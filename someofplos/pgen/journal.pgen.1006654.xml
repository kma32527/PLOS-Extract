<abstract>
<p>In the mammary gland, genetic circuits controlled by estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, act in concert with pathways regulated by members of the epidermal growth factor family to orchestrate growth and morphogenesis during puberty, pregnancy and lactation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between the hormonal and growth factor pathways remain poorly understood. We have identified the CUB and zona pellucida-like domain-containing protein 1 (CUZD1), expressed in mammary ductal and alveolar epithelium, as a novel mediator of mammary gland proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy and lactation. <italic>Cuzd1</italic>-null mice exhibited a striking impairment in mammary ductal branching and alveolar development during pregnancy, resulting in a subsequent defect in lactation. Gene expression profiling of mammary epithelium revealed that CUZD1 regulates the expression of a subset of the EGF family growth factors, epiregulin, neuregulin-1, and epigen, which act in an autocrine fashion to activate ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors. Proteomic studies further revealed that CUZD1 interacts with a complex containing JAK1/JAK2 and STAT5, downstream transducers of prolactin signaling in the mammary gland. In the absence of CUZD1, STAT5 phosphorylation in the mammary epithelium during alveologenesis was abolished. Conversely, elevated expression of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> in mammary epithelial cells stimulated prolactin-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed co-occupancy of phosphorylated STAT5 and CUZD1 in the regulatory regions of epiregulin, a potential regulator of epithelial proliferation, and whey acidic protein, a marker of epithelial differentiation. Collectively, these findings suggest that CUZD1 plays a critical role in prolactin-induced JAK/STAT5 signaling that controls the expression of key STAT5 target genes involved in mammary epithelial proliferation and differentiation during alveolar development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the mammary gland, development of an extensive ductal network during puberty and formation of lobuloalveolar units during pregnancy are critical events required for lactation. These complex developmental processes are regulated by a variety of signaling cues, including the steroid hormones 17β-estradiol (E) and progesterone (P), the peptide hormone prolactin (PRL), and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref001">1</xref>]. During pregnancy and lactation, E, P, and EGF family members act in concert with PRL to induce alveologenesis, a process in which ductal epithelial cells undergo extensive proliferation and secretory differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Circulating levels of PRL rise during pregnancy and promote proliferation and differentiation of the mammary epithelium in preparation for lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref007">7</xref>]. The prolactin receptor (PRLR) is a trans-membrane protein belonging to the cytokine receptor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref008">8</xref>]. Binding of PRL to PRLR triggers signaling events through the JAK/STAT5 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref010">10</xref>]. Janus tyrosine kinase 1 (JAK1) and janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2), associated with PRLR, are rapidly phosphorylated upon PRL binding. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), which is phosphorylated following JAK activation, undergoes dimerization and localizes to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref013">13</xref>]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref010">10</xref>]. Activated STAT5 binds directly to the GAS motif (TTCnnnGAA) at target genes to regulate their transcription and promote proliferation and/or differentiation of the mammary epithelium during distinct phases of mammary gland development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref011">11</xref>]. It was reported that PRL signaling through JAK2/STAT5 activates cyclin D1 transcription and nuclear accumulation in proliferating mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, STAT5a has been shown to regulate transcription of other mitogenic factors, such as the EGF family member epiregulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref016">16</xref>]. Terminal differentiation of the mammary gland is defined by the expression of milk protein genes in preparation for lactation. STAT5 controls the expression of several of these genes, including whey acidic protein (<italic>Wap</italic>) and β-casein (<italic>Csn2</italic>), to induce functional differentiation of the alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref020">20</xref>]. These observations established that STAT5 signaling is essential for proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland.</p>
<p>Ample evidence exists to suggest integrated effects of PRL and EGF receptor (ErbB)-mediated signaling pathways during mammary gland development. Binding of specific EGF ligands induces differential heterodimerization of ErbB family receptors to stimulate specific intracellular signaling pathways, thereby accounting for the varied effects of an activated receptor. Upon EGF administration, STAT5 is activated to a similar degree as seen with PRL treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, active ErbB4 was shown to induce phosphorylation of STAT5 in the mammary epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>ErbB4</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice exhibit disrupted alveologenesis and a dramatic reduction in the expression of <italic>Wap</italic> and further investigation revealed that STAT5 phosphorylation is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref021">21</xref>]. These findings pointed to a possible link between signaling via EGF family receptors and STAT5 activation to control alveolar proliferation and differentiation, although the precise molecular basis of this crosstalk remains unclear.</p>
<p>This study reports that CUZD1 is a novel mediator of PRL and EGF signaling in mammary epithelial proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy. This protein, also known as ERG1, Itmap1, or UO-44, was originally identified in our laboratory as an E-regulated gene in the rodent uterine epithelium and later reported in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref025">25</xref>]. CUZD1 contains a zona-pellucida (ZP)-like domain and two tandem CUB (Complement subcomponent /C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). There is presently little information concerning the functional significance of these motifs, although their presence is often noted in molecules involved in developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref027">27</xref>]. The mouse <italic>Cuzd1</italic> gene shares strong sequence identity with its human ortholog, indicating functional conservation across species (25). Using a <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mouse model and a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, we investigated the molecular pathways that are controlled by <italic>Cuzd1</italic> in the mammary gland and uncovered a novel mechanism linking CUZD1 to the PRL and EGF family growth factor signaling pathways that guide epithelial proliferation and differentiation in the mammary gland during pregnancy.</p>

<p>To investigate the functional role of CUZD1 in mammary gland development, we created <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice in which this gene is deleted from the mouse germ line by homologous recombination using mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). The efficiency of gene deletion was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s001">S1C Fig</xref>) and northern blot analysis of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). The <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> females were fertile and delivered normal size litters. However, the majority of pups from <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> dams died within 72 h of parturition and it was observed that they had insufficient milk in their stomachs. Almost all pups survived and grew normally when they were transferred to a foster dam immediately after birth. These results indicated that the <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> dams fail to produce an adequate amount of milk.</p>
<p>To further examine the phenotypic defects in the <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice, morphological analyses of whole mounts of mammary glands were performed at different stages of development. In comparison to their <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> littermates, the expansion of the epithelial tree in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice was delayed at puberty (6-weeks old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, a and b). However, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and E-cadherin staining of <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mammary glands at puberty indicate that there are no structural abnormalities in the cap or body cells of the terminal end buds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, a-d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref029">29</xref>]. The extent of ductal branching was modestly reduced in adult mutant females at estrous stage (10-weeks old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, c and d). During early pregnancy, mammary glands of mutant mice exhibited a severe deficiency in tertiary branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, e and f) and impaired alveolar development during late pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, g and h) and lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, i and j). Histological analysis of lactating <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mammary glands revealed sparsely distributed alveolar units with disrupted epithelial structure in comparison to their <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, a-d). Collectively, these results indicated that the impairment in alveolar differentiation in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> females during pregnancy and lactation leads to the deficiency in milk production.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> impairs the ErbB signaling pathway in the mammary epithelium</title>
<p>The impaired alveolar development in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mammary glands raised the possibility that CUZD1 is involved in the control of epithelial cell proliferation. To test this possibility, we monitored the mammary epithelial proliferation in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice and <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> littermates during puberty and lactation. We employed IHC analysis using an antibody against Ki67, a widely used marker for cellular proliferation. As expected, extensive cell proliferation was observed in the mammary ductal epithelia of non-pregnant pubertal <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, a). There was a significant reduction in the number of proliferating ductal epithelial cells in the mammary glands of pubertal <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, b). The difference in Ki67 positive cells at puberty is quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, c. When epithelial proliferation was assessed in the lactating mammary gland, we again observed a dramatic decline in epithelial proliferation in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, d and e). During puberty and pregnancy, <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> females maintained normal serum levels of E, P and PRL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), indicating that tissue intrinsic factors rather than systemic hormonal disruptions caused by the loss of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> are responsible for this defect in mammary gland proliferation. These results demonstrated that <italic>Cuzd1</italic> plays a critical role in regulating side-branching and alveolar morphogenesis in female mice during pregnancy and lactation, in part by influencing pathways involved in mammary epithelial proliferation.</p>

<p>To identify the pathways downstream of CUZD1, a microarray analysis was performed to compare the gene expression profiles of mammary epithelial cells isolated from <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice and their <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> littermates on day 18 of pregnancy. This microarray identified 411 transcripts that were altered (&gt;2-fold) in the <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> epithelium compared to the <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> epithelium (GEO Accession GSE30939). Prominent among the 377 down-regulated transcripts were mRNAs encoding three members of the EGF family, neuregulin-1 (<italic>Nrg1</italic>), epiregulin (<italic>Ereg</italic>) and epigen (<italic>Epgn</italic>). Interestingly, no significant alteration was detected in the expression levels of transcripts of several other EGF-family growth factors, such as amphiregulin (<italic>Areg</italic>), epidermal growth factor (<italic>Egf</italic>), heparin binding epidermal growth factor (<italic>Hbegf</italic>), neurgulin-2 (<italic>Nrg2</italic>), neuregulin-3 (<italic>Nrg3</italic>) and neuregulin-4 (<italic>Nrg4</italic>). Gene expression changes of EGF family ligands were confirmed using real-time RT-PCR and analyzed for statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Furthermore, IHC analysis of EPGN and NRG1 at lactation day 2 showed a substantial decline in these EGF ligands in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, b and d). These data indicate that the deletion of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> results in reduced expression of a specific subset of EGF family ligands in the mammary epithelium during late pregnancy.</p>
<p>Binding of EGF ligands to ErbB receptors results in their activation via auto-phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues, which subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref030">30</xref>]. While EREG binds to both ErbB1 and ErbB4, EPGN acts primarily via ErbB1. NRG1 binds to ErbB3 as well as ErbB4. We therefore, examined whether the observed alterations in the expression levels of <italic>Nrg1</italic>, <italic>Ereg</italic> and <italic>Epgn</italic> in the mammary tissue affected the ErbB receptor-mediated signaling. Mammary gland sections obtained from mice during late pregnancy were subjected to IHC, using antibodies directed against specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues critical for activation of ErbB1 (Tyr 1068), ErbB2 (Tyr 877), and ErbB4 (Tyr 1056). Abundant activating phosphorylation of ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB4 was observed in mammary epithelia of <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> mice, consistent with the proliferative activity seen in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, a, c, and e). In contrast, pErbB1 and pErbB4 were markedly reduced in the <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, b and d). Interestingly, phosphorylation of ErbB2 was not affected in the <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, f). No alteration was observed in the total protein levels of ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB4 in mammary epithelia of these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, insets). Collectively, these results indicated that CUZD1 is necessary for the production of the EGF family ligands, NRG1, EREG, and EPGN, which then function through ErbB receptor-mediated signaling pathways to control epithelial proliferation in the mammary gland during alveolar development.</p>

<title><italic>Cuzd1</italic> controls the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells by modulating the ErbB signaling pathway</title>
<p>We used HC11 cells, a non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line derived from pregnant mice, to examine the cell autonomous role of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref031">31</xref>].

<p>We next investigated whether CUZD1 controls the proliferation of HC11 cells by regulating the expression of the EGF growth factors. First, we examined the effects of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> overexpression on the expression of the EGF family members. Significantly higher levels of <italic>Epgn</italic>, <italic>Ereg</italic> and <italic>Nrg1</italic> transcripts were detected in HC11-Cuzd1 cells as compared to the HC11-LacZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Conversely, siRNA-mediated attenuation of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> mRNA expression in HC11 cells led to a marked reduction in the levels of <italic>Nrg1</italic>, <italic>Ereg</italic>, and <italic>Epgn</italic> mRNAs without significantly altering the levels of mRNAs encoding other EGF family ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). To determine which ErbB receptors play a role in CUZD1-induced cell proliferation, we performed a knock down of ErbB receptors 1–4 in HC11-Cuzd1 cells using gene-specific siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Knock down of ErbB1, ErbB3 and ErBb4 resulted in a decrease in HC11-Cuzd1 cell proliferation as measured by a BrdU incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We next wanted to determine if the loss of <italic>Cuzd1</italic>, and therefore the loss of specific EGF family ligands, led to a reduction in mammary epithelial cell proliferation. Using siRNA, we knocked down <italic>Cuzd1</italic> in HC11 mammary epithelial cells and supplemented with EPGN or NRG1 ligands. EPGN and NRG1 were both able to partially rescue proliferation of HC11 cells as compared to the ligand treated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly support the concept that CUZD1 controls the production of specific EGF family growth factors, which act via ErbB1, ErbB3 and ErbB4 to induce mammary epithelial cell proliferation.</p>

<title>CUZD1-mediated STAT5 signaling is necessary for differentiation of the mammary gland</title>
<p>To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of CUZD1, we attempted to identify the cellular factors that interact with it. To achieve this goal, we created HC11 cells stably over-expressing recombinant FLAG epitope-tagged CUZD1 (HC11-3xFLAG-Cuzd1 cells). Soluble extracts of these cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using a FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered and submitted for mass spectrometry. The LC/MS identified peptide fragments corresponding to multiple potential interaction partners of CUZD1, including JAK1 and JAK2, protein arginine methyltransferase 5 and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1.</p>
<p>Since JAK1/2 signaling and subsequent STAT5 phosphorylation is critical for mammary gland development, we focused on the interactions between JAK1, JAK2, and CUZD1. Co-immunoprecipitation of JAK1 and JAK2 from HC11 cell lysates was confirmed using an IP for endogenous CUZD1 and Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Interestingly, we also detected a signal for phosphorylated STAT5 in the HC11 cell immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The presence of this complex of proteins was also confirmed using Western blot in HC11-3xFLAG-Cuzd1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Although STAT5 was not identified as an interacting partner of CUZD1 in our proteomic analysis of the immunoprecipitate, it is conceivable that CUZD1 interacts directly with JAK1/JAK2, which exist in a larger cytosolic complex with STAT5.</p>

<p>In response to signaling by hormones, such as prolactin, activation of JAK1/2 leads to activation of the transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b, which control mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation during alveologenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref032">32</xref>]. Though both STAT5a and STAT5b are present in the mammary gland, STAT5a is the dominant form phosphorylated and localized to the nucleus during pregnancy and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref033">33</xref>]. We examined the status of the activating STAT5 phosphorylation (Tyr 694) in the mammary glands of <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice at day 18 of pregnancy by IHC analysis. Total STAT5 protein levels were unchanged in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice compared to <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(+/-)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, a and b). However, we observed a striking loss of STAT5 phosphorylation in the mammary epithelia of these mice, whereas abundant pSTAT5 was present in the mammary epithelium of Cuzd1<sup>(+/-)</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, c and d, e and f). STAT5 is known to directly regulate the expression of <italic>Wap</italic> and <italic>Csn2</italic>, two milk proteins secreted by differentiated epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref019">19</xref>]. We postulated that the loss of STAT5 phosphorylation impairs STAT5-dependent gene expression, leading to the observed deficiency in milk production in <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> females. To test this notion, we analyzed the gene expression levels of <italic>Wap</italic> and <italic>Csn2</italic>. The levels of <italic>Wap</italic> and <italic>Csn2</italic> transcripts were indeed markedly reduced in the mammary glands of <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> females during lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These results formed the basis of our hypothesis that CUZD1-mediated signaling through JAK/STAT5 controls mammary epithelial cell differentiation.</p>
<p>To further understand the functional significance of the interaction of CUZD1 with the JAK/STAT5 pathway, we examined phosphorylation and localization of STAT5 and expression of direct transcriptional targets of pSTAT5 in HC11-Cuzd1 cells in response to PRL treatment. In this experiment, the HC11-Cuzd1 cells were treated with vehicle or PRL and STAT5 phosphorylation/localization was analyzed using immunocytochemistry.

<title>CUZD1 and STAT5 co-occupy regulatory regions of target genes</title>
<p>CUZD1 has no nuclear localization sequence or DNA binding domain, but we observed that it was translocated to the nucleus upon stimulation with serum. We hypothesized that CUZD1 could be moving into the nucleus in association with pSTAT5. To investigate this possibility, HC11-3xFLAG-Cuzd1 cells were treated with a PRL/FBS/EGF cocktail, FBS, or a vehicle control to induce nuclear translocation of pSTAT5. Dual immunostaining was then performed to examine the cellular locations of pSTAT5 and CUZD1. In cells treated with the vehicle control, pSTAT5 and CUZD1 remained largely cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, a, d, and g). Upon stimulation with FBS or PRL/FBS/EGF, pSTAT5 and CUZD1 were colocalized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, b-c, e-f, and h-i). Previous studies reported that STAT5 binds directly to regulatory regions of <italic>Ereg</italic> and <italic>Wap</italic> genes to regulate their transcription (15,16). We observed that the expression of <italic>Ereg</italic> and <italic>Wap</italic> genes were up-regulated upon treatment with PRL, and their expression was further elevated in <italic>Cuzd1</italic>-overexpressing HC11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Based on the protein structure of CUZD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), there is no indication that CUZD1 binds to DNA, but we wanted to determine if CUZD1 and STAT5 remained in a complex when STAT5 is bound to DNA. To investigate this, we performed a ChIP re-ChIP using a STAT5-specific antibody followed by precipitation with anti-FLAG (M2) resin. Enrichment of regulatory elements in specific GAS motifs of <italic>Ereg</italic>, <italic>Wap</italic>, and <italic>Csn2</italic> indicated that CUZD1 remains bound to STAT5 in the nucleus when STAT5 is acting as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In single ChIP experiments, we confirmed STAT5 binding at in the <italic>Ereg</italic>, <italic>Wap</italic>, and <italic>Csn2</italic> GAS sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) as well as enrichment of these regulatory elements when we immunoprecipitated the FLAG-CUZD1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The authenticity of this result was confirmed by the absence of enrichment of the <italic>Wap</italic>, <italic>Csn2</italic> and <italic>Ereg</italic> GAS sites when a FLAG ChIP was performed in HC11-Cuzd1 cells in which CUZD1 is not flag-tagged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006654.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Collectively, our results indicated that, upon PRL-induced activation, the CUZD1-STAT5 complex translocates to the nucleus and interacts with target genes to bring about changes in gene expression that critically promote mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed mechanism of action of CUZD1 in the mammary gland epithelium.</title>
<p>Binding of PRL to PRLR induces activation of JAK1/2. CUZD1 forms a complex with JAKs and potentiates activation of STAT5 downstream of PRLR. Activated STAT5 and CUZD1 translocate to the nucleus where STAT5 regulates transcription of target genes, such as <italic>Ereg</italic> and <italic>Wap</italic>. EREG acts in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner through ErbB1 and/or ErbB4 to induce mammary epithelial proliferation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>E, P and PRL act in concert with the EGF family growth factors to govern mammary gland development during pregnancy and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref013">13</xref>]. In this study, we provide evidence that CUZD1 is a novel regulator of STAT5 signaling in the steroid-primed mammary epithelium. Loss of <italic>Cuzd1</italic> expression in mammary epithelial cells prevented <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of STAT5, resulting in a severe impairment in mammary epithelial proliferation and differentiation, which disrupts alveologenesis and prevents milk production during lactation.</p>
<p>A molecular link between CUZD1 and STAT5 phosphorylation has emerged from our study. Immunoprecipitation of CUZD1 from mammary epithelial cells followed by mass spectrometric and Western blot analyses revealed that CUZD1 is physically associated with several proteins, including JAK1/JAK2 and STAT5. Importantly, increased CUZD1 expression augmented PRL-induced phosphorylation as well as nuclear translocation of STAT5. The precise nature of CUZD1’s association with the JAK1/JAK2/STAT5 complex and the mechanism by which it promotes STAT5 phosphorylation are presently unclear. It is conceivable that CUZD1 potentiates JAK/STAT signaling downstream of PRLR activation by acting as an adaptor protein that aids in the recruitment of STAT5 to the PRLR/JAK complex. It may also act in an accessory role in stabilizing/enhancing phosphorylation of STAT5 by JAKs. Precedence for this hypothesis is based on literature describing the roles of effector proteins that alter signaling through this complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref034">34</xref>]. For example, c-Src has been shown to propagate PRL initiated JAK/STAT signaling in normal mammary tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref035">35</xref>]. Additionally, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) has been shown to inhibit the STAT5 signaling pathway by competitively binding to the tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2, preventing interaction and subsequent activation of STAT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Female mice lacking <italic>Prlr</italic>, <italic>Jak2</italic>, and <italic>Stat5</italic> are characterized by severe defects in mammary lobuloalveologenesis during pregnancy and lack of milk production during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref039">39</xref>]. The <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mice phenocopy the mammary defects observed in these mice during pregnancy and lactation, lending further support to the concept that CUZD1 is functionally linked to the components of the PRLR/JAK/STAT5 pathway during lobuloalveolar development and lactation.</p>
<p>The CUZD1 protein is localized in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of mammary epithelial cells. When the mammary epithelial cells are grown in the absence of serum, CUZD1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Stimulation of these cells with media containing serum triggers nuclear translocation of CUZD1. This result is also recapitulated by adding a combination of PRL, EGF and serum to these cells. Since CUZD1 lacks a nuclear localization motif or a DNA binding domain, we predicted that its translocation to the nucleus is dependent on association with a transcription factor. Indeed, our results are consistent with the view that CUZD1 translocates to the nucleus in association with pSTAT5. We further demonstrated that CUZD1 is recruited along with pSTAT5 to the regulatory regions of key target genes, such as <italic>Ereg</italic> and <italic>Wap</italic>. It is plausible that EREG contributes to CUZD1-mediated epithelial proliferation and alveolar expansion during pregnancy and lactation, as <italic>Ereg</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of STAT5 and has been implicated in promoting growth and survival of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study showed that CUZD1 controls the production of a subset of EGF family growth factors, EREG, NRG1, and EPGN, in mammary epithelium during pregnancy. Mice lacking <italic>Nrg1</italic> display pronounced defects in mammary alveologenesis with condensed alveoli and impaired alveolar outgrowth during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref044">44</xref>]. Development of mutant mouse models showed that ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 play important roles in mammary ductal growth and fat pad penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref048">48</xref>]. <italic>ErbB4</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mammary glands exhibited severe defects in alveolar proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006654.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> mammary glands showed impaired activation of ErbB1 and ErbB4 during pregnancy and lactation. These results are in accord with the hypothesis that the CUZD1-regulated growth factors, NRG1, EREG and EPGN, act primarily through ErbB1 and ErbB4 to exert their effects mainly during alveolar development. Consistent with this concept, there is a remarkable similarity between the mammary gland phenotypes of <italic>ErbB4</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> and <italic>Cuzd1</italic><sup>(-/-)</sup> females.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings support a model in which CUZD1 is a downstream mediator of PRL that enhances the signaling pathway through STAT5 during proliferation and differentiation of the mammary epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006654.g008">Fig 8</xref>). CUZD1 impacts mammary epithelial proliferation and differentiation during pregnancy and lactation. It promotes production of a specific subset of the EGF-like ligands, NRG1, EREG and EPGN, which control alveolar development. These growth factors primarily function through ErbB1 and ErbB4 to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Further analysis of the molecular mechanisms by which CUZD1 integrates the pathways regulated by STAT5 and the EGF family growth factors will improve our understanding of the molecular networks that underlie PRL regulation of normal mammary gland development.</p>
