<abstract>
<p>Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by the mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle cells. DUX4 is a transcription factor that activates genes normally associated with stem cell biology and its mis-expression in FSHD cells results in apoptosis. To identify genes and pathways necessary for DUX4-mediated apoptosis, we performed an siRNA screen in an RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line with an inducible <italic>DUX4</italic> transgene. Our screen identified components of the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) innate immune response pathway as mediators of DUX4-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that DUX4 expression led to increased MYC mRNA, accumulation of nuclear dsRNA foci, and activation of the dsRNA response pathway in both RD cells and human myoblasts. Nuclear dsRNA foci were associated with aggregation of the exon junction complex component EIF4A3. The elevation of MYC mRNA, dsRNA accumulation, and EIF4A3 nuclear aggregates in FSHD muscle cells suggest that these processes might contribute to FSHD pathophysiology.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy which is currently untreatable. It is caused by the inappropriate expression in skeletal muscle of the gene <italic>DUX4</italic> that encodes a transcription factor normally expressed in some stem cells. When DUX4 is expressed in cultured human or mouse skeletal muscle cells, it activates a program of cell death. Knowing the molecular basis for the cell death induced by DUX4 is important to determine the mechanism of muscle damage in FSHD. We used a molecular screening approach to identify genes and pathways necessary for DUX4 to induce the cell death program. We found that DUX4 activated a known MYC-induced cell death pathway, at least in part through stabilization of MYC mRNA. We also found that DUX4 expression led to an accumulation of double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that induced a cell death pathway evolved to protect against viral infections. This dsRNA accumulation was accompanied by aggregation of the EIF4A3 protein, a factor involved in mRNA surveillance and decay, which may provide a partial mechanism for how DUX4 can inhibit RNA quality control pathways in cells. Because FSHD muscle cells have increased MYC mRNA, dsRNA accumulation, and EIF4A3 nuclear aggregates, we conclude that these processes might contribute to FSHD pathophysiology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by mis-expression of the double-homeobox transcription factor DUX4 in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref001">1</xref>]. Normally, DUX4 is not expressed in skeletal muscle nor in most somatic tissues examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref003">3</xref>]. Ectopic expression of DUX4 in human and mouse cell lines as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> injection of DUX4 adenovirus into mouse muscle leads to rapid cellular apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref005">5</xref>]. This cell death is dependent on the transcriptional activity of DUX4 because expression of DUX4 with mutations in the DNA binding domain or trans-activation domain do not exhibit toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref006">6</xref>]. More recently, it was demonstrated that endogenous levels of DUX4 produced in FSHD muscle cells similarly causes cellular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Apoptosis is known to be a critical cellular process for both tissue homeostasis as well as vertebrate ontogeny where cells in developing organs follow the general guidelines of ‚Äúproliferation, differentiation and demolition‚Äù [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref008">8</xref>]. It is also appreciated that cellular apoptosis, outside of normal homeostatic or developmental contexts, is involved in autoimmune and neurological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref010">10</xref>]. As evidenced by numerous mouse knockout lines, programmed cell death is required for productive sperm development where excess or abnormal germ cells are constantly culled to ensure adequate space and nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref011">11</xref>]. Previously, immunodetection has identified DUX4 expression in cells in the seminiferous tubule, morphologically resembling spermatogonia or primary spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref002">2</xref>] and in the thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref003">3</xref>], both tissues with high rates of apoptosis. Thus, it is possible that expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle inappropriately activates a program of apoptosis that might otherwise be a 'normal' consequence of DUX4 expression during developmental processes.</p>
<p>As a transcription factor, DUX4 activates many genes that are expressed in stem cells and in the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref012">12</xref>]. The long terminal repeat (LTR) of a subset of human endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) contain the DUX4 binding motif, and DUX4 binds and activates their transcription, occasionally creating a novel transcription start site for adjacent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref013">13</xref>]. DUX4 expression also represses the innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref012">12</xref>] and the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref014">14</xref>], leading to an accumulation of normally degraded RNAs. However, it is not currently understood whether the changes in RNA stabilization following DUX4 expression lead to apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that FSHD muscle biopsies exhibit oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to control biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref015">15</xref>] and small molecule screens have demonstrated that compounds which protect cells from oxidative damage also protect against DUX4 toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref016">16</xref>]. It was also previously shown that <italic>Tp53</italic> knockout mice were protected from the effects of DUX4 delivered to skeletal muscle by AAV transduction and that a P53 inhibitor decreased DUX4 toxicity in human HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the DUX4-induced apoptotic pathways relevant to human skeletal muscle and FSHD remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>We conducted a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify genes and pathways necessary for DUX4 toxicity. This screen identified the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway and components of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) innate immune response as necessary for DUX4-induced apoptosis. We found that DUX4 expression resulted in the stabilization of several mRNAs, including MYC, and the accumulation of nuclear dsRNAs. Stabilization of MYC mRNA was associated with a dramatic increase in MYC protein levels and the activation of genes in the MYC-mediated apoptosis pathway, including <italic>BCL2L11</italic> and <italic>EGR1</italic>; whereas the accumulation of dsRNA was associated with nuclear aggregation of EIF4A3 and phosphorylation of the kinase EIF2AK2/PKR and its downstream target, the eukaryotic translational initiation factor subunit EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ±. The similar elevation of MYC mRNA, dsRNA accumulation, and EIF4A3 nuclear foci in FSHD muscle cells suggest that these processes might contribute to FSHD pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Although a prior study had identified <italic>TP53</italic> as necessary for DUX4-induced cell death in some cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref005">5</xref>], we found that human myoblasts with CRISPR mutated <italic>TP53</italic> and the RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line that does not contain a functional <italic>TP53</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref018">18</xref>] both succumbed to DUX4-induced cell death as efficiently as primary human myoblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s001">S1A‚ÄìS1D Fig</xref>). To establish a screen for genes necessary for DUX4-induced apoptosis, we transduced the RD cell line with a lentiviral vector encoding a doxycycline-inducible DUX4 coding sequence and puromycin selectable marker (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s002">S2A Fig</xref> for schematic) and generated a clonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD-DUX4i) with robust doxycycline-inducible expression of DUX4 that showed cellular toxicity at 24 hours after DUX4 induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) and more than 95% cell death by 48 hours, as determined by the ATP-based CellTiter-Glo assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). The dying cells exhibited an increase in activated caspase 3/7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) indicating that DUX4 induction leads to apoptosis in the P53 deficient RD cells.</p>
<p>To identify genes and pathways necessary for DUX4-induced toxicity in RD cells we measured cell survival following transfection of an siRNA library targeting 6,961 genes in the human ‚Äúdruggable‚Äù genome with a pool of four siRNAs per target gene. The parameters for the screen are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s002">S2D Fig</xref> and were optimized as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s003">S3A Fig</xref>. As positive controls, we used two unique siRNAs targeting DUX4 which had different efficacies of knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s003">S3B Fig</xref>) and, consequently, different effects on cell viability after DUX4 induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). Transfections were performed in triplicate and cell survival following DUX4 induction was measured by CellTiter-Glo.</p>
<p>Using a stringent mean Z-score threshold of 3.0, 69 siRNA pools significantly increased cell viability in response to DUX4. Targets that exceeded this threshold included some genes previously implicated in cellular apoptosis, for example: Death effector domain containing 2 (<italic>DEDD2</italic>), Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector a (<italic>CIDEA</italic>), MutS homolog 2 (<italic>MSH2</italic>), C-MYC (<italic>MYC</italic>) and its dimerization partner <italic>MAX</italic>, and <italic>RNASEL</italic>, a mediator of cellular antiviral defense. Using a more traditional Z-score cutoff of 2.0, 353 siRNA pools enhanced cell viability after DUX4 induction. In addition, 30 siRNAs had a Z-score of less than -2.0, suggesting that these genes might protect cells from DUX4-induced death. Among these targets were the DUX4 target genes, <italic>TRIM51</italic> (also known as <italic>SPRYD5</italic>) and <italic>TRIM43</italic> as well as the anti-apoptotic <italic>BCL2L1</italic> (also known as <italic>BCL-X</italic>) that can suppress MYC-mediated cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref019">19</xref>]. As expected, siRNAs targeting <italic>TP53</italic> had no effect on cell viabilty (Z-score = -0.03). Network analysis placed MYC/MAX as a 'hub' of protein-protein interactions among the candidate genes with an absolute value Z-score cutoff of 2.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). The general results of the screen are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s002">S2E Fig</xref>, and the full ranked list is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s010">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
<p>We proceeded to validate candidate siRNA pools identified in the initial screen using a strategy outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. As a first validation step we transfected RD-DUX4i cells with the ten siRNA pools with the highest Z-scores plus 15 additional pools with Z-scores ranging from 1.93 to 3.61. All 25 pools increased viability over the non-silencing control siRNA, indicating that pools identified in the primary screen reproducibly enhanced cell survival after induction of DUX4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).</p>

(B) Example of how siRNA pools from the primary screen were deconvoluted to determine whether the effect on cell viability was dominated by a single siRNA which would suggest off-targeting. In this example, EAF1 has a single dominant siRNA that rescues, whereas multiple siRNAs to MYC rescue. These data depict cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo assay. (C) Pooling of poorly performing siRNAs can 'synergize' to rescue from DUX4 toxicity as with siEAF1 whereas others are clearly dominated by a single siRNA as in siRGS3. These data depict cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo assay. (D) Scatter-plot of mean Z-scores from the original DUX4 siRNA screen against mean Z-scores produced in the Luciferase screen to determine the siRNA pools that inhibited doxycycline induction of the transgene.

<p>As a second validation step we de-convoluted these 25 pools of four individual siRNAs to determine whether multiple siRNAs within each pool contributed to the increased survival of RD cells rather than a single siRNA which might indicate a nonspecific, off-target effect. Of the 25 pools retested, 21 had more than one siRNA that enhanced cell survival by 2-fold or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). For the four pools with a single siRNA that rescued viability, we tested whether the individual non-rescuing siRNAs from that pool might rescue if pooled together, reasoning that synergy among the individually non-rescuing siRNAs might indicate on-target activity. Re-transfection of these non-rescuing siRNAs as pools of three revealed that more than one siRNA against two genes (<italic>EAF1</italic> and <italic>TLR5</italic>) rescued from DUX4 toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s004">S4C Fig</xref>), whereas for the other two genes (<italic>TLL1</italic> and <italic>RGS3</italic>), only a single siRNA had rescuing activity.</p>
<p>Further analysis showed that the rescue conferred by siRNAs in pools where there was a single rescuing siRNA, such as siRGS3, was correlated with the inhibition of doxycycline induction of DUX4 and of a doxycyline inducible luciferase transgene in RD cells (RD-LUCi cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). This indicated that some of the siRNA pools in the original screen likely achieved RD-DUX4i cell survival and a high Z-score because a single siRNA in the pool inhibited the doxycycline induction of DUX4 through unknown mechanisms.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a third validation step we tested for the inhibition of the doxycycline induction pathway on the entire set of siRNA pools with an original Z-score ‚â• 2.0 using the RD-LUCi cells. 110 of our initial 353 pools suppressed luciferase induction based on a cutoff Z-score of ‚â§ -0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s011">S2 Table</xref>), the minimum score of the 16 scrambled control siRNAs used in this secondary screen. For example, the RGS3 siRNA pool, which we had already determined had a single siRNA that suppressed doxycycline induction of luciferase, had a mean Z-score of -3.09. Overall, there was a modest but significant inverse correlation between the RD-DUX4i screen Z-scores and the RD-LUCi screen Z-scores (Spearman's rho = -0.396), indicating that some of the pools identified in the original screen were likely secondary to inhibiting the doxycycline induction pathway. Therefore, we eliminated the 110 genes targeted by pools that depress luciferase induction by more than the non-silencing control.</p>
<p>As a final filter, we performed RNA-sequencing on RD-DUX4i cells and required that the targeted mRNA must be expressed at greater than an average FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) of 0.5 to filter out low or non-expressed genes. For example, although TLR5 apparently rescued based on initial validation criteria (see above), it was expressed below the threshold level and was therefore eliminated. Of the original set of 6,961 genes targeted by the library, 16 genes with a Z-score ‚â• 3.0 passed our validation and filtering steps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006658.t001">Table 1</xref>). The final list of filtered targets with Z-score ‚â• 2.0 is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s012">S3 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>DUX4 inhibits MYC mRNA degradation and activates a MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway</title>
<p>The filtered targets meeting a Z-score threshold of 3.0 included several genes that broadly regulate RNA transcription (<italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>FOSB</italic>, <italic>EAF1</italic>, <italic>PHF20</italic>, <italic>CDC20</italic>), protein translation (<italic>TGS1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref020">20</xref>], or mitochondrial function (<italic>FXN</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref021">21</xref>]. MAX, the obligate heterodimer of MYC, also appeared as a candidate target in the initial screen, with a Z-score exceeding 3.0, although MAX was subsequently eliminated from the final candidate list because the pool of siRNAs to MAX demonstrated a modest reduction in doxycycline induction of the luciferase transgene (Z-score = -0.93). It is interesting to note that many of the aforementioned genes were upregulated in our RNA-seq data in RD cells overexpressing DUX4: <italic>FOSB</italic> (~92 fold), <italic>MYC</italic> (~56 fold), <italic>EAF1</italic> (~8 fold) and <italic>CDC20</italic> (~11 fold). Although siRNAs against MYC had a modest effect on transgene expression (luciferase Z-score = -0.29), the siRNAs also rescued viability following lentiviral transduction of a constitutively expressed DUX4 in cells with DUX4 protein levels and nuclear localization equivalent to the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s004">S4E‚ÄìS4G Fig</xref>). Therefore, we decided to investigate the MYC-mediated apoptosis pathway because DUX4 expression resulted in a dramatically increased expression of <italic>MYC</italic> as well as a set of genes that facilitate a program of enhanced cellular growth or metabolism.</p>
<p>We first verified that MYC protein was upregulated following DUX4 expression. Western blotting and RT-qPCR confirmed that MYC protein and RNA levels increased dramatically following DUX4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>), tracking closely with a direct target of the DUX4 transcription factor, MBD3L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The increase in MYC did not appear to correspond to a large change in MYC protein stability as determined by western blotting after cycloheximide (CHX) treatment to block de novo translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). There was no clear evidence of direct transcriptional activation of MYC by DUX4 based on prior chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref013">13</xref>] which did not identify a DUX4 binding site near the <italic>MYC</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s005">S5A Fig</xref>), although PolII ChIP showed a modest increase in promoter-associated and elongating PolII occupancy at the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s005">S5D Fig</xref>), about 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Most dramatic, however, was a clear enhancement of MYC mRNA stability following DUX4 induction as evidenced by the increased half-life from roughly 44 minutes to 360 minutes in DUX4-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To determine whether this increase in mRNA stability was specific to MYC or a more general effect on mRNA stability, we assessed the stability of two other labile mRNAs, JUN and CITED2, following DUX4 expression. Although these results were less dramatic, the trend indicated an increase in mRNA stability of both genes following DUX4 expression (CITED2 from approximately 45 to 182 minutes and JUN from 52 to 140 minutes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s005">S5E Fig</xref>). We conclude that, although the effect might not be specific to MYC, a major contribution to the increased MYC levels was likely through inhibition of mRNA degradation. These results are in agreement with a more general inhibition of mRNA degradation pathways in DUX4-expressing cells, similar to the previously demonstrated inhibition of NMD which leads to the stabilization of numerous labile mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<p>Studies in other cells have shown that the MYC-mediated pathway of apoptosis involves MYC activation of EGR1, and then MYC and EGR1 together activate expression of two BH3-only factors BCL2L11 and PMAIP1 (also known as BIM and NOXA, respectively) which antagonize the anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins and lead to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref022">22</xref>]. Analysis of our RNA-seq data revealed that DUX4 induced the expression of EGR1 (moderated fold-change of 48), induced the expression of BIMŒ≥, a specific isoform BCL2L11 with an alternative BH3-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref023">23</xref>], and increased total BCL2L11 transcripts roughly 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s013">S4 Table</xref>). The siRNA library used in our screen contained two separate siRNA pools against different splice isoforms of BCL2L11. One of the two pools rescued RD-DUX4i viability (Z-score = 2.01) and contained three siRNAs that targeted only the BIMŒ≥ isoform (3 out of 4 siRNAs), whereas the second pool did not rescue (Z-score = -0.59) and did not contain siRNAs that targeted only this isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s005">S5F Fig</xref>). Together our data indicate that DUX4 expression resulted in decreased degradation of the MYC mRNA and increased abundance of the MYC protein with subsequent activation of components of the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway, which has been shown to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

<title>DUX4 expression leads to accumulation of dsRNA and activation of an innate immune response</title>
<p>As noted above, knockdown of <italic>RNASEL</italic>, a gene involved in innate immunity to viral infection, rescued RD cells from DUX4 lethality (DUX4 Z-Score = 3.71) and had minimal effect on the doxycyline induction of the luciferase transgene (Luciferase Z-Score = -0.07). This rescue was validated as on-target based on our deconvolution strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s004">S4B Fig</xref>) and prompted us to look for other mediators of the cellular antiviral response in our screen.

These results led us to further postulate that at least part of DUX4 toxicity might be mediated via triggering an innate (antiviral-like) immune response in expressing cells.</p>
<p>Both EIF2AK2/PKR and RNASEL are primary responders of the double stranded RNA innate immune response. Because DUX4 leads to the accumulation of normally degraded RNAs, including those destined for nonsense mediated decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref014">14</xref>], activates the expression of RNAs from repetitive regions and retrotransposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref013">13</xref>], and stabilizes some mRNAs (this study), we considered the possibility that DUX4-expressing cells could increase the abundance of aberrant, endogenously formed dsRNAs. In order to test whether DUX4-expressing cells accumulate dsRNAs, we performed immunofluorescence using the J2 antibody, which recognizes dsRNAs, irrespective of the sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref025">25</xref>]. These experiments revealed that DUX4-expressing cells had strong, nuclear dsRNA foci which were not present in uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The signal observed after transfection of the dsRNA surrogate, poly(I:C), was similar in intensity to DUX4 expressing cells, though occupying a more cytoplasmic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This signal is not a non-specific property of the J2 antibody as we detected similar focal staining in DUX4-expressing cells using the separate monoclonal dsRNA-recognizing antibody K1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), nor is it an artifact of the doxycycline induction of transgene mRNA expression as our RD-LUCi line did not have similar nuclear staining after doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Immunofluorescence of DUX4-induced RD cells using either the J2 or K1 antibodies showed that approximately 5‚Äì10% of the nuclei had obvious dsRNA aggregation at 19 hours post induction, whereas the uninduced cells did not exhibit any detectable nuclear staining.</p>

<p>Accumulation of dsRNAs activates EIF2AK2/PKR via auto-phosphorylation. EIF2AK2/PKR, in turn, phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ±), which is thought to generally inhibit both host and viral gene translation, culminating in cellular apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref026">26</xref>]. To determine whether dsRNA accumulation leads to EIF2AK2/PKR activation in DUX4-expressing cells, we measured phosphorylated EIF2AK2/PKR in our DUX4-expressing RD cells and observed that, following DUX4 expression, EIF2AK2/PKR was phosphorylated to a level that is comparable to activation via transfection of poly(I:C), whereas total EIF2AK2/PKR levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To determine whether the EIF2AK2/PKR activation as a result of DUX4 expression has a functional consequence in our cells, we also blotted for EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ± phosphorylation in a time course following doxycycline induction. This experiment showed that both EIF2AK2/PKR and EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ± became phosphorylated approximately 15 hours post doxycycline addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The profound inhibition of the NMD pathway by DUX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref014">14</xref>] might be the cause of both the increased MYC mRNA and the accumulation of dsRNA because the NMD endonuclease SMG6 has been shown to degrade MYC as a non-canonical NMD target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref027">27</xref>] and NMD inhibition leads to dsRNA accumulation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore, we used siRNAs to knockdown two components of the NMD pathway, UPF1 and SMG6. Knockdown of either NMD component alone or in combination showed a mild, non-significant ~1.1‚Äì1.6 fold increase in MYC mRNA and a ~1.6‚Äì2.3 fold increase in the inclusion of an NMD-targeted exon in SRSF3, compared to the more than 24-fold increase in these RNAs following DUX4 induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Therefore, NMD inhibition through these mechanisms was not sufficient to stabilize the MYC mRNA.</p>

<title>DUX4 expression in human myoblasts leads to MYC mRNA and dsRNA accumulation with activation of downstream apoptotic pathways</title>
<p>To determine whether DUX4 induces the same MYC-mediated apoptotic pathways and dsRNA toxicity in human myoblasts, we assessed the expression of MYC, components of the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway, and the dsRNA innate immune response in an immortalized human myoblast cell line with a doxcycycline-inducible DUX4 (MB135-DUX4i). Our previous RNA-seq data generated using MB135-DUX4i cells fourteen hours after DUX4 induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref029">29</xref>] showed an approximate 3.3-fold increase (based on an EdgeR differential expression analysis) in MYC mRNA abundance and, interestingly, a preferential accumulation of transcripts from the P1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Similar to RD cells, DUX4 increased the abundance of EGR1 (5.4-fold) and the BH3-only proteins PMAIP1/NOXA (11-fold) and BCL2L11 (4.7-fold) (see Supplemental Table 1 in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref029">29</xref>]), and induced expression of the BIMŒ≥ isoform of BCL2L11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Therefore, the same MYC-mediated apoptotic pathways induced by DUX4 in RD cells were similarly induced by DUX4 in human myoblasts.</p>

<p>To determine whether DUX4 expression in human myoblasts activated the same dsRNA pathway as in RD cells, we stained DUX4-expressing myoblasts with the J2 antibody and found strong focal nuclear dsRNA signal, similar to the observed pattern in RD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Expression of DUX4 also led to phosphorylation of EIF2AK2/PKR as well as EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ± in DUX4 expressing myoblast cells, comparable to levels seen after poly(I:C) transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to RD cells, knockdown of either MYC or RNASEL rescued the MB135-DUX4i human myoblasts from DUX4-induced cell death, which was measured by counting viable cells at two and four days after induction of DUX4 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). However, knock-down of either MYC or RNASEL in human myoblasts also caused a delay in the accumulation of DUX4 protein and the activation of a DUX4 target gene, <italic>MBD3L2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>). Although DUX4 expression was robust at four days following induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>), a time when the MYC knock-down continued to show strong rescue, these rescue experiments should be interpreted cautiously regarding the individual necessity of MYC or RNASEL for DUX4-induced apoptosis in human myoblasts. In summary, expression of DUX4 in myoblasts, as in RD cells, resulted in increased MYC mRNA and components of the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathways as well as accumulation of dsRNA and activation of the pro-apoptotic dsRNA-sensing innate immune response.</p>

<title>EIF4A3 aggregates with DUX4-induced dsRNA and EIF4A3 knock-down inhibits NMD</title>
<p>Next, we determined whether the dsRNA aggregates corresponded to known nuclear subdomains or RNA binding proteins by performing immunofluorescence using the K1 dsRNA antibody and costaining with antibodies to promyelocytic leukemia bodies (PML), paraspeckles (NONO), the exon junction complex (EJC) components EIF4A3 and RBM8A/Y14, and TARDBP/TDP-43, which has been shown to aggregate in DUX4-expressing nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref030">30</xref>] and may regulate cellular dsRNA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref031">31</xref>]. Components of PML bodies and paraspeckles were not strictly associated with dsRNA staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s009">S9A Fig</xref>), though NONO did form condensations in the nucleus following DUX4 induction, some of which overlapped with dsRNA staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). TARDBP/TDP-43 did not show a clear association with the dsRNA foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006658.s009">S9D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, DUX4 strongly induced redistribution of EIF4A3 into aggregates that were almost entirely associated with dsRNA foci as determined by double-staining with either the J2 or K1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In many cases DUX4-induced cells with EIF4A3 aggregates appeared to have reduced nuclear staining beyond the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) suggesting that the majority of EIF4A3 was redistributed to the dsRNA foci, similar to the depletion of MBNL proteins by the mutant nuclear RNA in myotonic dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref033">33</xref>].

<title>FSHD cells have increased MYC expression and foci of dsRNA and EIF4A3</title>
<p>Endogenous DUX4 is expressed in only a small percentage of cultured FSHD muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref002">2</xref>]. Therefore, to determine whether DUX4 expression in FSHD cells correlates with higher levels of MYC mRNA, we used an RNA-seq dataset from FSHD cells FACS sorted based on the expression of a DUX4-reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref007">7</xref>]. Based on our previous analysis of this dataset (see Supplemental Table 1 in Jagannathan, <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref029">29</xref>]), muscle cells expressing the DUX4-responsive promoter showed an almost 2-fold increase in the level of MYC mRNA (log2 fold-change ~0.9 and adjusted p-value = ~0.003); however, EGR1, PMAIP1/NOXA and BCL2L11 were not significantly upregulated. Therefore, DUX4 expression is associated with higher levels of MYC mRNA in FSHD muscle cells, but the role in activating an apoptotic pathway requires further study.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence for dsRNAs in differentiated FSHD muscle cells showed either cytoplasmic or nuclear dsRNA staining in some of the cells with DUX4-positive nuclei but not in a control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In addition, the nuclear dsRNA foci in FSHD muscle cells were associated with EIF4A3 aggregates that were not present in control muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006658.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Therefore, DUX4-expressing FSHD muscle cells showed increased levels of MYC mRNA and formation of nuclear foci with dsRNA and EIF4A3 accumulation, indicating that the initial screen identified pathways relevant to FSHD biology, and perhaps pathophysiology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, an siRNA screen identified that the MYC-mediated apoptoic pathway as well as components of the dsRNA response pathways were involved in DUX4-induced apoptosis in RD cells, and led to the demonstration that DUX4 expression resulted in the stabilization and accumulation of MYC mRNA, the accumulation of nuclear dsRNA, and formation of nuclear EIF4A3 foci. The accumulation of MYC mRNA correlated with higher MYC protein levels and the transcriptional activation of components of the MYC-mediated pro-apoptotic pathway, including EGR1, BCL2L11 and its BIMŒ≥ isoform. The accumulation of dsRNA was correlated with the activation of the EIF2AK2/PKR innate immune response and the phosphorylation of EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ±. Inhibiting the expression of individual components of each of these pathways with siRNAs diminished apoptosis in RD cells in response to DUX4. These pathways were also induced by DUX4 in an immortalized human skeletal muscle cell line, with increased MYC RNA and the downstream effectors of MYC-mediated apoptosis (EGR1, PMAIP1/NOXA, and the BIMŒ≥ isoform of BCL2L11), as well as the accumulation of dsRNA, EIF2AK2/PKR and EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ± phosphorylation, and nuclear foci consisting of EIF4A3 and dsRNA. Finally, the elevation of MYC mRNA, dsRNA accumulation, and EIF4A3 nuclear foci in FSHD muscle cells suggests that these processes might contribute to FSHD pathophysiology.</p>
<p>Although DUX4 expression caused apoptosis in a P53-dependent manner in some cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref005">5</xref>], we found that P53 was not necessary for apoptosis in either RD cells or human myoblasts. It is possible that different requirements for P53 might be due to differences in the cell type or the mechanism of DUX4 delivery. This would be consistent with the fact that MYC causes apoptosis in a manner that is either P53-dependent or P53-independent, depending on the cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>EIF4A3 is a component of the EJC complex that binds the exon-junction of spliced RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref035">35</xref>]. Although the mechanism of sequestering EIF4A3 to nuclear foci remains to be determined, the co-localization of the EIF4A3 foci with dsRNA foci suggests that DUX4 induction and/or stabilization of RNAs with dsRNA secondary structure might overwhelm normal nuclear RNA processing and transport, leading to their accumulation as foci with associated RNA binding proteins. The formation of EIF4A3 nuclear aggregates might contribute to the inhibition of NMD following DUX4 expression, because the formation of nuclear aggregates appears to deplete EIF4A3 from the rest of the nucleus and knockdown of EIF4A3 inhibits NMD. In this regard, FSHD might have some parallels with myotonic dystrophy, where the MBNL RNA binding proteins are sequestered in nuclear foci by the repeat expansion in the mutant RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref033">33</xref>]. However, our prior demonstration that DUX4 expression leads to degradation of the UPF1 protein indicates that the possible sequestration of EIF4A3 is not the only mechanism by which DUX4 might inhibit NMD, and that simply re-expressing EIF4A3 might be unlikely to fully rescue this defect. Further studies will be necessary to determine the identity of the DUX4-induced dsRNAs and the RNAs that mediate EIF4A3 aggregation.</p>
<p>Although it is currently difficult to diagram a clear epistatic model from our results, there are multiple known interactions between MYC, the RNA-mediated innate immune response, and NMD. It has been shown that MYC overexpression can inhibit NMD, leading to ROS-mediated stress and EIF2S1/eIF-2Œ± phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref036">36</xref>], both of which are associated with DUX4 expression ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref006">6</xref>] and this study). Thus the elevated MYC in DUX4 expressing cells might also contribute to NMD inhibition, feeding forward to further enhance levels of DUX4, which is also an NMD target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref014">14</xref>]. Inhibition of NMD might also lead to the accumulation of dsRNAs. In yeast, NMD controls the accumulation of antisense long non-coding derived dsRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref028">28</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the profound inhibition of NMD by DUX4 might similarly result in dsRNA accumulation, either from constitutively expressed RNAs or the many repetitive RNA families and LTR-containing ERVs transcriptionally activated by DUX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref037">37</xref>]. Elevated levels of dsRNAs would then lead to an innate immune response, as has been observed in cancer cells that reactivate LTR-containing ERVs after DNA methylation inhibitor treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref039">39</xref>]. While we observed phosphorylation of EIF2AK2/PKR, which occurs upon binding dsRNA ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref040">40</xref>], we did not see a robust interferon response (based on our RNA-seq data). However, DUX4 has been shown to inhibit components of the innate immune response pathway, at least in part through upregulation of DEFB103 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref012">12</xref>], suggesting that the activation of this pathway by DUX4 might have a normal developmental role.</p>
<p>The apoptotic pathways induced by DUX4 in RD cells and human myoblasts might give insight into its normal role in development. DUX4 is normally expressed in the testis, likely in the early germline cells such as the spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, and has recently been reported to be expressed in the thymus, both areas of active developmental apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref003">3</xref>]. It is possible that one normal function for DUX4 is to elicit cellular apoptosis, and indeed the BIMŒ≥ isoform of BCL2L11 that we showed is induced by DUX4 in skeletal muscle is also expressed in the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref023">23</xref>]. However, the broad transcriptional program activated by DUX4 suggests a role in stem cell function beyond apoptosis, and apoptosis might occur in a cell-context dependent manner. In other words, cells that normally express DUX4 might be primed for apoptosis but also resistant in the correct developmental context. As mentioned above, DUX4 expression blocks the RNA-induced innate immune response to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref012">12</xref>], which might constitute a mechanism for protecting DUX4-expressing cells from toxicity in some normal developmental contexts compared to the expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle cells. We speculate that DUX4 expression, which leads to elevated MYC levels, might afford an accompanying growth or fitness advantage in the developmental context where cells are competing for resources and survival. This notion is further supported by the fact that the MYC-mediated competitive advantage depends on the innate immune response pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref041">41</xref>]. This normal process of cell competition is believed to control developmental size and eliminate cells with weaker attributes. Furthermore, the competitive advantage conferred by MYC might also be used in cancers for clonal expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref042">42</xref>]. In this regard, it is interesting to note that DUX4 expression has recently been shown to be a causal factor in a subset of B-cell leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006658.ref044">44</xref>]. Further work will be necessary to determine how the DUX4-mediated modulation of MYC levels and RNA accumulation might contribute to aspects of development and the pathophysiology of FSHD.</p>

<title>Knockdown of RNASEL and MYC rescue human myoblasts from DUX4 toxicity, but delay transgene expression.</title>
<p>(A) Bright field images showing MB135-DUX4i cell morphology after DUX4 expression at 2 and 4 days post-induction. The ATP-based CellTiter-Glo assay gave unusually high readings in control myoblast cells for unknown reasons and thus we used viable cell counts as an alternative. (B) Western blot showing a DUX4 target gene, MBD3L2, and DUX4 transgene expression in MB135-DUX4i cells at the indicated time-points after induction. (C) RT-qPCR to confirm knockdown of target mRNAs. Data are normalized to RPL27A and shown relative to the siCTRL condition. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean of three replicate wells.</p>
