<abstract>
<p>Somatosensory information from the periphery is routed to the spinal cord through centrally-projecting sensory axons that cross into the central nervous system (CNS) via the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ). The glial cells that ensheath these axons ensure rapid propagation of this information. Despite the importance of this glial-axon arrangement, how this afferent nerve is assembled during development is unknown. Using <italic>in vivo</italic>, time-lapse imaging we show that as centrally-projecting pioneer axons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) enter the spinal cord, they initiate expression of the cytokine TNFalpha. This induction coincides with ensheathment of these axons by associated glia via a TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2)-mediated process. This work identifies a signaling cascade that mediates peripheral glial-axon interactions and it functions to ensure that DRG afferent projections are ensheathed after pioneer axons complete their navigation, which promotes efficient somatosensory neural function.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>To survive, animals must receive sensory information from their environment and relay it to the central nervous system. The efficient transfer of this environmental information to the brain and spinal cord requires both neuronal and glial populations found along peripheral sensory nerves. In this work, we describe the early steps of sensory nerve assembly. We identify that a molecule most well described in inflammation, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and its obligate receptor are utilized to control glial ensheathment of sensory axons. This ensheathment occurs shortly after the first sensory axons enter the spinal cord. Together, our work uses time-lapse imaging and genetic manipulation to demonstrate the orchestrated coordination of glial and neuronal cells during nerve formation, providing insight into how sensory information from the periphery is integrated into the CNS during development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Efficient somatosensory perception requires that neurons propagate sensory stimuli from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS). Cutaneous somatosensory stimuli are first detected by excitable neurites in the skin, transduced past the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell soma and then conveyed to the CNS via a centrally-projecting afferent axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref001">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref003">3</xref>]. Glial cells that ensheath these components ensure that this somatosensory information is efficiently and rapidly propagated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref004">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>During development, the sensory neurons and glia that ensheath them are specified from neural crest cells that migrate from their dorsal neuroepithelial origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref008">8</xref>]. These neural crest cells eventually coalesce to form DRG, which continue to add neurons throughout embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref008">8</xref>]. Each sensory neuron then produces a pseudobipolar axon that innervates its peripheral target and a central projection that crosses into the spinal cord at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref001">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref003">3</xref>]. In mice at late embryonic stages, glial cells located at the DREZ are thought to act as positive substrates for axonal entry into the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref009">9</xref>]. However, our understanding of how DRG pioneer axons enter the spinal cord and how they influence development of associated glia is unknown.</p>
<p>In addition, although our understanding of molecular pathways that mediate DRG neuronal differentiation and specification are abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref010">10</xref>], we know very little about the molecular pathways that are required for the development of sensory glia within the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref011">11</xref>]. In fact, although there is a growing body of literature of known signaling pathways that mediate glial association and ensheathment of axons in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref011">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref017">17</xref>], it is still limited compared to our understanding of neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref018">18</xref>]. The most well characterized molecular mechanism that controls peripheral axon-glial communication is the Neuregulin 1 Type III (Nrg1-III) ligand and the ErbB family of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, however, genetic knockouts that disrupt Nrg1-III/ErbB signaling have peripheral axons with associated glia, suggesting that additional mechanisms likely function to ensure glia ensheath peripheral axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>To identify signaling pathways that mediate glial ensheathment of DRG pioneer axons, we took a multipronged approach, merging the elegance of zebrafish <italic>in vivo</italic>, time-lapse imaging with the power of mouse genetics. Live imaging in zebrafish revealed that pioneer DRG axons navigate to the DREZ with glial cells closely associated with the growth cone. We demonstrate that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) is upregulated in pioneer axons upon spinal cord entry and that a TNFa/TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) pathway directs ensheathment of the central projection, as genetic disruption of either TNFa or TNFR2 lead to a failure of glial ensheathment of pioneer axons in both mice and zebrafish. Together, these data identify critical cellular determinants of sensory, central projection formation and a mechanism underlying peripheral axon-glial communication.</p>

<title>Pioneer DRG axons navigate directly to the DREZ</title>
<p>Sensory afferent nerves are ensheathed by peripheral glia from the DRG to the edge of the spinal cord. However, the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of this cellular arrangement at the DREZ are not understood. Therefore, we characterized early stages of DREZ development to understand how the primary afferent circuit is established. We started by investigating how DRG afferent axons enter the spinal cord. To achieve this, we directly visualized the navigation of pioneer axons to the DREZ. Using <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> zebrafish, which have regulatory sequences of <italic>neurogenin1</italic> (<italic>ngn1</italic>) driving expression of GFP in developing DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref023">23</xref>], we began imaging embryos at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf), prior to central and peripheral axon formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>). Beginning at this stage, newly specified DRG neurons had transient, filopodia-like structures that projected ventrally initially, followed by similar projections that extended dorsally toward the presumptive DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>). These filopodia-like structures transitioned into single axons, and between 48 and 56 hpf, the dorsal processes transitioned into a growth cone that extended dorsally away from the cell soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>). The growth cone eventually ceased its dorsal migration and then entered the spinal cord at a position that corresponded with the location of the dorsolateral fasciculus (DLF) between 50 and 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>). By 72 hpf, each somite along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the larva contained a centrally-projecting DRG axon that had entered the DREZ.</p>

<p>To characterize the velocity and trajectory of these pioneer axons as they migrated toward the DREZ, we traced growth cones in four individual movies similar to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>. Tracing the most dorsal location of the growth cone at each time point revealed that DRG pioneer axons navigated with constant velocity toward the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>). When this tracing was plotted to represent the path of the growth cone, we saw that axons navigated directly dorsally from the cell body to the DLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s011">S1 Movie</xref>).

<title>Glia navigate with pioneer axons to the DREZ</title>
<p>We next sought to determine when glial cells associated with nascent sensory afferents during navigation to the DREZ. To do this, we used <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos);Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> embryos, which label DRG precursors with Eos, and DRG sensory neurons with GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref024">24</xref>]. We imaged these animals from 48 to 72 hpf to capture glial dynamics in relation to the DRG pioneer axon. Early in development, sensory neurons are derived from <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> neural crest cells and begin expressing <italic>ngn1</italic> when they become post-mitotic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, in our imaging, sensory neurons were <italic>ngn1</italic><sup>+</sup> (green) and also transiently expressed Eos (red) and appeared yellow. All other non-neuronal cells or glia were marked with Eos only and appeared red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s012">S2 Movie</xref>). Time-lapse imaging of these embryos, beginning at 48 hpf, revealed that as the pioneer growth cone navigated dorsally toward the DREZ, <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glial cells lagged slightly behind the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s012">S2 Movie</xref>). Once the pioneer axon reached the level of the DLF, the growth cone entered the spinal cord while associated <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia remained in the periphery, associated with the central afferent projection from the DRG to the edge of the spinal cord at the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s012">S2 Movie</xref>). In these images, the axon and associated glial cell can be distinguished based on the distribution of fluorescent protein which shows an axon with a concentrated fluorescent projection and a glial cell with fan-like morphology and more diffuse distribution of fluorescent protein. Based on these data, we conclude that glial cells navigate with the pioneer growth cone to the DREZ before they ensheath the peripheral arm of the afferent axon.</p>

<title>TNFa signaling is essential for glial ensheathment at the DREZ</title>
<p>We next sought to identify the molecular mechanism that mediates glial ensheathment of DRG pioneer axons. In our search for transgenic lines that labeled DRG neurons, we identified a new transgenic line, <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic>, which uses <italic>tumor necrosis factor Î±</italic> (<italic>tnfa</italic>) regulatory sequences to drive expression of GFP in zebrafish DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref025">25</xref>].

<p>Interestingly, we noticed that in <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> embryos, GFP expression was only detected in DRG neurons at 72 hpf, but not at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, 48 hpf-18%, 72 hpf-97%, n = 30 DRG). When <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> expression was scored at 52 hpf, we observed GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons predominantly in anterior DRG that were first to send pioneer axons into the spinal cord and an absence of GFP expression in posterior DRG that had yet to send pioneer axons to the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, 52 hpf-75%, n = 30 DRG). We therefore hypothesized that <italic>tnfa</italic> may be selectively expressed only in DRG neurons that had formed a pioneer axon that had entered the CNS. To test this hypothesis, we used time-lapse imaging between 48 and 72 hpf in <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp);Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> embryos, when pioneer DRG axons navigate into the spinal cord. Using this double transgenic line, we were able to visualize entry of the growth cone with the <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> line because DRG neurons transiently express <italic>sox10</italic> before upregulating <italic>tnfa</italic> expression. When we quantified the intensity of <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> from the movie represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, we noted that GFP was not detectable in DRG neurons before the pioneer axon entered the spinal cord, but increased after entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s013">S3 Movie</xref>). By 72 hpf, GFP intensity was brightly expressed in nearly all DRG neurons along the trunk of the zebrafish and this profile was consistently visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s013">S3 Movie</xref>). Based on these data, we demonstrate that <italic>tnfa</italic> is upregulated in DRG neurons as pioneer axons enter the spinal cord.</p>
<p>To test if <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> expression in DRG neurons required pioneer axon navigation into the spinal cord, we performed axon transections using a pulsed nitrogen dye laser to perturb pioneer axon entry into the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref028">28</xref>]. Using <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp);Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> embryos, we visualized and axotomized DRG pioneer axons that could be identified as RFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>â</sup> at 48 hpf. We scored successful axotomy by an aberration of the filopodia-like projections at the growth cone of axotomized axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In these ablations we targeted the growth cone and did not see any debris that corresponded with RFP<sup>+</sup> glia. At 72 hpf, 24 hours post axotomy (hpa), we detected a reduction in GFP<sup>+</sup> DRG neurons (20% GFP<sup>+</sup> n = 5 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3E and 3G</xref>). To confirm that this lack of expression was not a response to axotomy, we axotomized GFP<sup>+</sup> axons that had already entered the spinal cord at 48 hpf. 24 hpa, we did not visualize an elimination or reduction of GFP expression in these DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>). These data demonstrate that axons that have entered the spinal cord continue to express <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> even after axotomy. However, we acknowledge that post-transcriptional delay in protein detection may mask underlying changes in gene expression. We therefore also axotomized the peripheral projection of the DRG neuron before the afferent axon had projected into the spinal cord and scored GFP expression at 72 hpf. Similarly, peripheral axotomy also did not reduce the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that spinal cord entry is required for <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp</italic>) expression in DRG pioneer axons.</p>
<p>Given the upregulation of TNFa after the pioneer axon enters the spinal cord, we hypothesized that TNFa-mediated signaling would be important in the maintenance of pioneer axons and/or the glia that ensheath them. To investigate this hypothesis, we injected a <italic>tnfa</italic> translation blocking morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref029">29</xref>] into single-cell <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos)</italic> embryos and characterized the outcome of perturbed TNFa signaling on DRG pioneer axon-associated glia. In <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos) tnfa</italic> morphants at 72 hpf, we visualized <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> axonal projections, but did not detect any <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia ensheathing pioneer axons (26% contained <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia, n = 54 DRG), which is in contrast to the full ensheathment we observed in wildtype control larvae (100% contained <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia, n = 40 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). We extended our analysis of these experiments to determine if this phenotype was a delay in glial ensheathment by scoring the ensheathment phenotype at 96 hpf. Similarly, at 96 hpf, we visualized defective ensheathment in <italic>tnfa</italic> morphants when compared to wildtype larvae (36% contained <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia, n = 61 DRG).</p>

<p>To confirm these MO-injected phenotypes were specific to perturbation of <italic>tnfa</italic>, we utilized the CRISPR/cas9 system to generate F0 <italic>tnfa</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref031">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s008">S2 Table</xref>).

To confirm that these injections induced mutations that disrupted the genomic region of <italic>tnfa</italic>, we performed a T7 endonuclease assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref031">31</xref>] and detected that 7 out of the 13 selected larvae that were assayed showed potential mutations. We then confirmed this analysis by sequencing <italic>tnfa</italic> in the specific larvae that showed a potential mutation in the T7 assay and had a glial ensheathment phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s003">S3D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We next asked if this role for TNFa in glial ensheathment was evolutionarily conserved in mice. To test this hypothesis, we measured ensheathment of the DRG afferent nerve in wildtype and <italic>Tnfsf1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>TNF</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) pups at P0 using electron microscopy. We first quantified this by calculating the percentage of an axon bundle that was ensheathed by glial membrane. In wildtype pups at P0, on average, 1.7% of individual axonal bundles were unensheathed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Of these wildtype axonal bundles, only 11 nerve bundles of the 110 that we measured contained axons that were more than 3% unensheathed, indicating nearly every axon of the afferent nerve is ensheathed by birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4C and 4E</xref>, n = 3 animals). In contrast, in <italic>TNF</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups, we observed that 27.6% of individual axon bundles within the DRG afferent sensory nerve were unensheathed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4Câ4E</xref>, n = 3 animals). We also observed several small caliber axons that lacked glial membrane around the entirety of the bundle mixed with large caliber axons that were also incompletely ensheathed, which caused mixing between these axonal bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We therefore also quantified the number of axons in each small caliber bundle. In wildtype pups, small caliber bundles had on average, 32.0 axons, whereas <italic>TNF</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups contained 84.8 axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, n = 3 animals). When binning the axons bundles into ones that were ensheathed versus unensheathed, <italic>TNF</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups contained 45.6 that were ensheathed compared to 91.8 that were unensheathed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, n = 3 animals). This is compared to wildtype that had 32.0 ensheathed and 24.3 unensheathed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, n = 3 animals). Based on these data and our analysis from zebrafish, we propose that <italic>tnfa</italic> is required for glial ensheathment of DRG pioneer axons.</p>
<p>To further test this model, we collected trunk tissue from P0 wildtype and <italic>TNF</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups at P0, sectioned through the L3-L6 spinal column and stained tissue with the glial marker S100 and neuronal marker Î²III Tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref032">32</xref>].

<title>TNFa activates NFkB in DRG pioneer axon-associated glia</title>
<p>To test the possibility that pioneer axon TNFa was signaling directly to associated glia, we investigated if a canonical downstream signaling component of TNFa, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref033">33</xref>], was expressed in glia along DRG sensory afferent axons. We first scored the expression of GFP in <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>egfp);Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> larvae, which express GFP under control of <italic>nf-kb</italic> binding domains, reliably reporting NFkB activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref034">34</xref>], from 48 to 72 hpf. In these embryos between 48 and 56 hpf, we detected GFP expression in glial cells ensheathing the DRG central projection. Importantly, GFP expression between 48 and 72 hpf was only detected in DRG that had formed a central projection that extended into the spinal cord (48 hpf- 7.5%, 72 hpf-87.5%, n = 30 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). By 72 hpf, 87.5% of DRG examined along the length of the zebrafish trunk had GFP<sup>+</sup> glial cells, suggesting robust activation of NFkB was correlated with the entry of the pioneer axon into the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis, we used time-lapse imaging in <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>egfp);Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> embryos from 48 to 72 hpf, the period when pioneer DRG axons navigate into the spinal cord. With <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic>, we could visualize the entry of the growth cone into the spinal cord. In these movies, we did not detect GFP in pioneer axon-associated glia when the central axon formed. However, we observed GFP expression in associated glia soon after the centrally-projecting axon entered the spinal cord and by 72 hpf, GFP was expressed in nearly all pioneer axon-associated glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Based on this data, we conclude that NFkB is active in DRG glia after pioneer axons have entered the spinal cord.</p>

<p>To test if <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> expression in DREZ glia is dependent on the pioneer axon entering the spinal cord, we perturbed the navigation of pioneer axons into the CNS by transecting pioneer axons after they formed, but before they successfully navigated to the DREZ in <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>gfp);Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>mrfp)</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref028">28</xref>]. At 72 hpf, 24 hpa, we did not detect GFP in afferent axon-associated glia when pioneer axons were successfully axotomized before they entered the spinal cord (25% GFP<sup>+</sup> n = 8 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To confirm that this lack of expression was not a response to axotomy, we axotomized <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> axons that had already entered the spinal cord at 48 hpf. At 24 hpa, we did not visualize an elimination or reduction of GFP expression in these DRG glia (87.5% GFP<sup>+</sup> n = 8 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As a control, we also axotomized the DRG peripheral projection between 48 and 56 hpf, before afferent projections had navigated into the spinal cord, and then scored GFP expression at 72 hpf. In these studies, we always saw GFP<sup>+</sup> glia along the afferent projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Therefore, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that axon entry is required for NFkB activation in DRG glia.</p>
<p>Because the upregulation of TNFa in DRG neurons correlated with the entry of the pioneer axon into the spinal cord, we sought to understand the temporal dynamics of TNFa upregulation in DRG neurons compared to NFkB activation in associated glia. To do this, we compared intensity profiles from our <italic>Tg(tnfa</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> and <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> time-lapse movies and normalized the time for the point of axon entry into the spinal cord. These data showed that <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> intensity increased at similar time points compared to the time of axon entry (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">5D</xref>). Based on this analysis, we conclude that NFkB is upregulated in pioneer axon-associated glia after the pioneer axon enters the spinal cord.</p>
<p>If this model is correct and TNFa-mediated signaling is active in sensory glia as the pioneer axon enters the spinal cord, then perturbation of TNFa should disrupt NFkB expression in associated glia. To test this hypothesis, we injected a <italic>tnfa</italic> MO into <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> zebrafish embryos and assayed GFP expression in DRG glia at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, GFP expression in pioneer axon-associated glia was completely abolished in <italic>tnfa</italic> morphants (<italic>tnfa</italic> MO = 0% GFP<sup>+</sup> DRG, n = 30 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that upregulation of TNFa in DRG neurons induces TNFa-mediated expression of NFkB in associated glia.</p>
<p>To dissect this pathway further, we sought to determine if TNFa acted as a cleaved soluble peptide or in its transmembrane form. To test the requirement of TNFa cleavage as a function of glial ensheathment of the DRG central projection, we treated <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos)</italic> zebrafish embryos with TNFa Protease Inhibitor-1 (TAPI-1), an inhibitor of the metalloprotease <italic>adam17</italic>, which is required for TNFa cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref035">35</xref>]. In larvae treated with TAPI-1 from 24 to 72 hpf, we observed that glial ensheathment of DRG pioneer axons was identical to DMSO-treated larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). As confirmation that TAPI-1 disrupted metalloprotease activity in our paradigm, we visualized that differentiation of peripheral glia was expedited along the mixed portion of spinal peripheral nerves, a phenotype that is consistent with the lack of MMP activity that has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref036">36</xref>]. From these data, we conclude that TNFa cleavage is not required for proper ensheathment of DRG central axons.</p>

<title>TNFR2 is required for TNFa-mediated pioneer axon glial ensheathment</title>
<p>TNFa-mediated signaling is modulated through two receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2. Previous studies demonstrate that TNFR2, rather than TNFR1, is more likely to signal via transmembrane TNFa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref033">33</xref>]. TNFR2 is also exclusively expressed in non-neuronal cells of the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref037">37</xref>]. To confirm that <italic>tnfr2</italic> is expressed in glia in the DRG, we designed multiplex fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization probes specific to <italic>tnfr2</italic>. We performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis with these probes in <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> zebrafish embryos and observed that <italic>tnfr2</italic> mRNA was localized around GFP<sup>+</sup> sensory neurons, consistent with the expression of <italic>tnfr2</italic> in DRG glia at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We extended this analysis by visualizing both <italic>tnfa</italic> and <italic>tnfr2</italic> expression in <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> animals and saw that <italic>tnfa</italic> was exclusively expressed in GFP<sup>+</sup> sensory neurons while <italic>tnfr2</italic> was expressed in cells surrounding GFP<sup>+</sup><italic>/tnfa</italic><sup>+</sup> sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This data led us to conclude that <italic>tnfr2</italic> is expressed in pioneer axon-associated glia.</p>
<p>Therefore, we investigated the role of TNFa-TNFR2 mediated signaling in pioneer axon glia ensheathment. We first tested if NFkB upregulation in associated glia was dependent on TNFR2. To investigate this, we injected a <italic>tnfr2</italic> MO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref029">29</xref>] into <italic>Tg(NFkB</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> zebrafish and observed that GFP expression was absent in DRG glia at 72 hpf (<italic>tnfr2</italic> MO = 0% GFP<sup>+</sup> DRG, n = 30 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). These data are consistent with the model that NFkB activity is driven by TNFR2 signaling.</p>
<p>We next investigated the role of TNFR2 in glial ensheathment of DRG afferent axons. To do this, we injected a translation blocking MO to <italic>tnfr2</italic> into single-cell <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> and <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos)</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref029">29</xref>]. Consistent with the hypothesis that TNFa-TNFR2 signaling is required for glial ensheathment of the central projection, we observed a significant reduction in the number of pioneer axons that had associated <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia at 72 hpf, which phenocopied <italic>tnfa</italic> morphants (52% contained <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia, n = 31 DRG) and was significantly different from wildtype controls (100% contained <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia, n = 40 DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). To confirm that this phenotype was not due to a developmental delay, we scored the ensheathment phenotype at 96 hpf and again visualized defective ensheathment in <italic>tnfr2</italic> morphant larvae when compared to wildtype controls (45% contained <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia, n = 44 DRG). To confirm these MO-injected phenotypes were specific to perturbation of <italic>tnfr2</italic>, we injected <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos)</italic> embryos with gRNAs specific to <italic>tnfr2</italic> and scored glial ensheathment at 72 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref031">31</xref>].

<p>As we did with TNFa, we next asked if TNFR2 played a role in glial ensheathment in mice. To do this, we collected trunk tissue from P0 wildtype and <italic>Tnfrsf1b</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) P0 pups, sectioned through the L3-L6 spinal column, and stained the tissue for the glial marker S100 and neuronal marker Î²III Tubulin. In wildtype pups, S100 staining labeled cells that associated with Tubulin<sup>+</sup> axons along the central projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However, this labeling was absent or reduced in <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Similar to <italic>TNFa</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups, <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups also had reduced staining of ErbB3 along Isl<sup>+</sup> sensory axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We also quantified this ensheathment phenotype via electron microscopy. In <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups, we observed a significant lack of glial ensheathment and organization in the afferent nerve and on average, 21.7% of individual axon bundles were unsheathed, compared to less than 2% of disrupted ensheathment observed in wildtype pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>, n = 3 animals). Overall the percentage of axonal bundles that were unensheathed was significantly increased in <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups when compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>, n = 3 animals) (p&lt;0.0001). In addition, we quantified the number of axons in each small caliber bundle. In wildtype pups, there were on average, 31.5 axons per small caliber bundle, whereas is <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups, there 30.9 axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). When binning the axons bundles into ones that were ensheathed vs unensheathed, the <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups had on average, 24.3 that were ensheathed compared to 30.9 that were unensheathed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6H</xref>, n = 3 animals).

Based on these data, we propose TNFa-TNFR2 signaling is required for glial ensheathment of the afferent DRG nerve and that TNFa also has a non-TNFR2 function in nerve development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s006">S6C Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<title>TNFa and TNFR2 within the DRG are required for glial ensheathment</title>
<p>Expression analyses of <italic>tnfa</italic> and <italic>tnfr2</italic> support the hypothesis that TNFa and TNFR2 function within DRG to drive glial ensheathment. To directly test this model, we created mosaic zebrafish larvae by injecting <italic>tnfa</italic> or <italic>tnfr2</italic> MOs into a single cell of 16-cell <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos)</italic> or <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>gfp)</italic> embryos with a rhodamine-dextran tracer, and then raised those embryos to 72 hpf, when we analyzed glial ensheathment along pioneer axons and scored the cells that contained the rhodamine-dextran marker, and therefore, were MO<sup>+</sup>. In these larvae, we observed normal glial ensheathment of pioneer axons in all larvae that did not have rhodamine-dextran<sup>+</sup> DRG cells (<italic>tnfa</italic> = 510 nerves, <italic>tnfr2</italic> = 296 nerves) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s009">S3 Table</xref>). In contrast, we did observe significant glial ensheathment defects along pioneer axons when cells within the DRG were either rhodamine-dextran<sup>+</sup>/<italic>tnfa</italic> MO<sup>+</sup> or rhodamine-dextran<sup>+</sup>/<italic>tnfr2</italic> MO<sup>+</sup> (<italic>tnfa</italic> = 33 DRG, <italic>tnfr2</italic> = 12 DRG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s009">S3 Table</xref>). From these data, we conclude that <italic>tnfa</italic> and <italic>tnfr2</italic> function autonomously within DRG neurons and glia to mediate pioneer axons glial ensheathment.</p>
<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the role of TNFa/TNFR2 signaling in glial ensheathment, we used time-lapse imaging between 48 to 72 hpf in <italic>Tg(sox10</italic>:<italic>eos)</italic> embryos that were injected with a <italic>tnfr2</italic> MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). In these morphants, we observed that while DRG glia still associated with the single pioneer growth cone as it entered the spinal cord, the glia collapsed back towards the neuronal cell body soon after spinal cord entry, resulting in a naked pioneer axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006712.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). In these movies, we also observed ectopic axonal projections from the DRG in a subset of larvae. Therefore, we scored ectopic projections at 72 hpf in <italic>Tg(ngn1</italic>:<italic>egfp)</italic> larvae and visualized that 44% of <italic>tnfa</italic> morphants and 33% of <italic>tnfr2</italic> morphants had ectopic DRG projections (0% of wildtype animals contained these projections) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006712.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). However, these ectopic axons also lacked glial ensheathment.

<p>The DREZ is a crucial information relay station for the somatosensory circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref007">7</xref>]. In this manuscript, we characterize the development of this relay system and identify a signaling cascade that is active during its development. We demonstrate that pioneer axons navigate to the DREZ with supporting glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref018">18</xref>] and upon entering the spinal cord, peripheral glia ensheath these axons. We show that this glial ensheathment is dependent on TNFa-TNFR2-mediated signaling. Taken together, our data identify a signaling pathway that is precisely regulated during the entry of DRG pioneer axons into the spinal cord to ensure their ensheathment.</p>

<p>To achieve the precise timing of glial ensheathment during development, axons must coordinate their development with neighboring glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref018">18</xref>]. The Neuregulin 1 Type III (Nrg1-III) ligand and ErbB receptors are the most studied example of axon-glial communication that controls the spatiotemporal timing of ensheathment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref020">20</xref>]. Nrg1-III is a transmembrane ligand, which until cleaved, ensures only glia in close contact with the axon can bind via ErbB and drive ensheathment and ultimately, myelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref020">20</xref>]. In this manuscript, we identify another communication mechanism that spatiotemporally controls ensheathment, which requires TNFa and TNFR2. In our model, by controlling the expression of TNFa, ensheathment of the DRG pioneer axon is precisely timed. Spatially, ensheathment is restricted by requiring glia to contact via transmembrane TNFa. It will be interesting to examine in future studies whether axonally-derived <italic>tnfa</italic> is the only source that contributes to <italic>tnfr2</italic>-mediated glial ensheathment. In addition, whether TNFa-TNFR2 signaling also has a role, like NrgI-III/ErbB3, in myelination of these ensheathed axons, remains to be seen, but is an intriguing next step in these studies given that vast literature on NFkB in glial development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref013">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Another interesting and unanswered question of both of these pathways is what induces upregulation of the ligand. Given the temporal upregulation of TNFa that we see as the pioneer axon enters the spinal cord, it is possible that Nrg1-III could be similarly upregulated along axons as they enter nascent tissue. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that muscle-derived neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF upregulate Nrg1-III in motor axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref039">39</xref>]. Although our understanding of how axons control their ensheathment is limited, the work we present here implicates an additional signaling cascade that functions in this manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref012">12</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>A conserved TNFa-mediated signaling pathway</title>
<p>TNFa-mediated signaling is also required for the differentiation of DRG neurons in late stages of embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref026">26</xref>]. In the absence of TNFa, excess DRG neurons are present in the ganglia of P14 mice, a phenotype that is likely instigated from the failure of those neurons to undergo normal programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref026">26</xref>]. This neuronal pathway is mediated through TNFR1 and is likely to function when pioneer DRG axons have already entered the spinal cord. In our analysis, TNFa is also required for proper glial ensheathment, but functions through TNFR2. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that TNFa signaling functions multiple times within development of the sensory circuit, but perhaps distinctly through TNFR1 and TNFR2. For example, we scored an excess of axons in small caliber bundles in <italic>TNFa</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> but not in <italic>TNFR2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups. One potential explanation for this is that TNFa functions in both axonal and glial development whereas TNFR2 has a role only in glial ensheathment, and this may explain the sensory defects previously described in <italic>TNFa</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Complicating this hypothesis, however, is evidence that DREZ-associated glia are progenitors for DRG cells, which may be defective based on our observation that glial ensheathment is defective. Our data does not distinguish the core cause of our phenotype as loss of glial ensheathment could cause neuronal phenotypes or a phenotype in neurons could drive glial ensheathment defects. Either way, these results introduce a paradigm where TNFa could be used in two distinct pathways with two different cellular outcomes, glial versus neuronal. The developmental timing of these distinct pathways may contribute to their outcomes, shifting TNFa-mediated signaling from a TNFR2 cell arrangement and proliferation cue to a TNFR1-mediated cell death pathway. It is possible that this shift could be controlled by differential expression of the receptors or by variance in cleavage of the TNFa ligand from the membrane. This utility of TNFa during development is further amplified by the fact that the receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, can also act as ligands and induce reverse signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref040">40</xref>]. Identifying candidate downstream components and effectors of NFkB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref041">41</xref>], may shed light on this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Although TNFa signaling has been primarily studied in the immune system, it has also recently been shown to be essential for other developmental programs, including hematopoeisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006712.ref042">42</xref>]. We believe our discovery that TNFa likely functions as a transmembrane cue to modulate behavior of two contacting cells during neurodevelopment likely has broad implications. For example, this mechanism could be deployed in multiple developmental paradigms such as neuronal migration, cellular tiling or synaptic specificity, where contacting cells must communicate during their development. This possibility significantly expands the potential roles of TNFa during development.</p>

(B) Quantification of the number of <italic>ngn1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells per DRG at 72 hpf in wildtype, <italic>tnfa</italic> and <italic>tnfr2</italic> morphants. (C) Quantification of <italic>sox10</italic><sup>+</sup> glia at 96 hpf in wildtype (n = 60 DRG). The <italic>tnfa</italic> (n = 61 DRG) and <italic>tnfr2</italic> morphant (n = 44 DRG) larvae showing the glial ensheathment defect persists to 96 hpf. Scale bar, 25 Î¼m.</p>
