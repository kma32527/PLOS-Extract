<abstract>
<p>Ribosomal DNA is one of the most variable regions in the human genome with respect to copy number. Despite the importance of rDNA for cellular function, we know virtually nothing about what governs its copy number, stability, and sequence in the mammalian genome due to challenges associated with mapping and analysis. We applied computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. We find that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Counterintuitively, human cancer genomes show a <bold>loss</bold> of copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. The sequence can also be more variable in the cancer genome. Cancer genomes with lower copies have mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. The PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor that is critical for genome stability and a negative regulator of the mTOR kinase pathway. Surprisingly, but consistent with the human cancer genomes, hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse model for leukemia have <bold>lower</bold> rDNA copy number than normal tissue, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. Loss of copies occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Therefore, copy loss is a recurrent feature in cancers associated with mTOR activation. Ribosomal DNA copy number may be a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA damaging treatments.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The ribosomal DNA encodes the RNAs needed to make ribosomes for protein synthesis and cellular proliferation. However, ribosomal DNA has been excluded from most mammalian genome-wide studies due to challenges associated with its analysis. We find that both the sequence and copy number of the ribosomal DNA can change in human cancer genomes. mTOR is a kinase that senses the nutritional environment and is often over-active in cancer. Given mutational evidence for mTOR activation in the human cancer genomes with loss of ribosomal DNA copies, we analyzed ribosomal DNA in hematopoietic stem cells derived from mice under conditions of mTOR activation. Like the human cancer genomes, the ribosomal DNA copy number contracts in mTOR activated hematopoietic stem cells relative to normal stem cells. Loss is associated with high rates of cellular proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis, but compromised survival in the presence of DNA damage. Contractions are a recurrent feature in cancer genomes with overactive mTOR and may predict sensitivity to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics. Ribosomal DNA may be altered in other disease contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Repetitive regions in the human genome include ribosomal DNA (rDNA), telomeres, and centromeres, and these regions have profoundly important functions for genome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref003">3</xref>]. While challenging to study, genetic variability of these regions is ripe for selection. The rDNA encodes the functional RNAs of the ribosome, the most conserved and utilized genes in the genome. Three of the four RNAs are transcribed initially as a single transcript by RNA polymerase I. The repeats encoding the RNAs are present on five different regions on human acrocentric chromosomes, with each region composed of several copies of the gene, referred to as 45S. 45S is processed into three separate RNAs (28S, 5.8S, and 18S). The fourth RNA is encoded by the 5S genes, located on human chromosome 1 and transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The number of 5S copies correlates with 45S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref004">4</xref>]. The loci that encode the rRNAs are transcribed at incredibly high rates, with rRNA often constituting as much as 80% of the RNA in actively proliferating cells, to meet the demand for ribosome production. Even so, only about 50% of the repeats are transcribed.</p>
<p>The number of repeats is variable in human genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref005">5</xref>], with one recent computational study estimating between 14–410 copies of 45S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref004">4</xref>]. The variability in number combined with five different chromosomal locations makes the 45S pattern unique in each human genome. The human 45S genes are highly recombinogenic, with an estimated 10% recombination in a single generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref006">6</xref>]. The sequence of the 45S repeat within a species is highly conserved due presumably to high rates of recombination which allow for concerted evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref007">7</xref>]. While repeats exist mainly in a head to tail tandem arrangement, palindromic arrangements have also been observed, especially in syndromes with increased genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>One can imagine that one way for a cell to achieve high rates of protein synthesis would be to expand the number of rDNA copies, especially given that ribosomal RNA can be limiting for ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref009">9</xref>]. In fact, increases in copy number occur in different developmental and disease contexts. Expansions occur in frog oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref010">10</xref>] and the macronucleus of tetrahymena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref011">11</xref>] as part of the normal course of development, presumably to help achieve high rates of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Southern blotting experiments demonstrate that recombination at the rDNA is common in adult lung and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref012">12</xref>], suggesting the possibility that the rDNA may be affected in the cancer genome. However, copy number of the rDNA in mammalian development and disease has not been examined.</p>
<p>The TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase detects the nutritional environment and promotes ribosome biogenesis when amino acids are plentiful. The PTEN (phosphate and tensin homolog) phosphatase is a negative regulator of mTOR activity and acts as a tumor suppressor. Somewhat paradoxically, overfeeding flies, which overstimulates mTOR, has been associated with contraction of the rDNA copy number in the germline in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, transmitted transgenerationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref013">13</xref>]. TOR signaling was required for the amplification from low copy number back to normal copy number in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref014">14</xref>]. Together these results suggest there may be a connection between TOR signaling and the rDNA copy number, but this has not been explored in the mammalian genome. Furthermore, if the copy number or sequence changes in response to the environment, then rDNA may act as both a sensor and adaptor under stress conditions.</p>
<p>In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, the rDNA has many extra-ribosome functions, such as regulating gene expression, chromosome organization, and titrating chromatin factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref018">18</xref>]. The nucleolus, which contains the ribosomal DNA, is a hub for many signaling pathways and can act as a stress sensor. Chromosomal domains from most human chromosomes are associated with the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref020">20</xref>], highlighting its role as an organizer. Dramatically reducing the copy number in yeast does not cause reduction in rRNA levels, but causes all repeats to become active (sometimes termed “compensation”) and the yeast are hypersensitive to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref021">21</xref>]. In contrast, low copy compromises protein synthesis and development in the bobbed mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref022">22</xref>]. Furthermore, copy number of the rDNA titrates position effect variegation in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, modulation of copy number has the potential to regulate signaling, genome stability, chromosome organization, and gene expression without necessarily affecting ribosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>Recent technological developments enable accurate and high throughput measurements of the copy number of the rDNA. Copy number can be estimated from whole-genome sequence (WGS) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The plethora of cancer genome sequencing projects allows comparison between the copy number in the tumor genome versus the normal genome from a single individual. We used these new technologies to analyze how rDNA copy number changes in different tissues and in cancer. Surprisingly, rDNA copy number is reduced in cancer genomes with mTOR activation, providing evidence that copy number can be altered in a natural system. We also discovered co-occurring increased copy number of additional genes, and evidence for single nucleotide variation in the repeats. Using cancer stem cells derived from a mouse model for leukemia driven by loss of <italic>Pten</italic>, we find that copy loss does not compromise proliferation, rRNA production, or protein synthesis, but cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage. These data suggest that the ribosomal DNA can act as a sensor and adaptor to cancer-associated stress. Copy number may be a biomarker with predictive potential.</p>

<title>45S copy number is similar across different mouse tissues and inbred mouse strains, but differs between outbred mice</title>
<p>In the mouse genome, the 45S repeats are located on 5 different chromosomes (12, 15, 16, 18, 19) whereas all the 5S repeats are located on chromosome 8. The copy number for the two repeats co-varies and has been previously estimated using a computational approach from sequence data derived from a collection of laboratory and wild mice, showing a 10-fold range with values for 45S of 31–289 and for 5S of 32–224 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref004">4</xref>]. We wanted to extend these findings by developing a ddPCR method to directly measure the copy number of the 45S repeat with high accuracy in commonly used laboratory strains including the inbred strains C57BL/6 and DBA/2J, and the outbred strain CD-1. In addition, we wanted to know whether copy number varied by tissue given different metabolic requirements. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been reported to have an inverse relationship with rDNA copy number in human blood samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref017">17</xref>] and is thought to fluctuate with metabolic demand.</p>
<p>To answer whether rDNA copy number is variable across different mouse strains, tissues, and organs, we collected genomic DNA (gDNA) from fifteen tissues of three mouse strains, and performed ddPCR. The assay is designed such that the copy number of 45S and the single copy gene <italic>Gapdh1</italic> are measured in the same reaction using fluorescent probes. We found the average copy number for C57BL/6 was 156 based on 57 tissue measurements from eight mice (standard deviation is 13.1), and DBA/2J was 123 based on two mice (standard deviation is 12.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The mouse to mouse variation in the inbred strains was ~10%, with no obvious gender difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). While the mean copy number for CD-1 was similar (145 based on 5 mice), the variation between individuals was much higher (standard deviation is 43.2), as much as 2-fold in the individuals tested. This demonstrates that mice from inbred strains tend to have a much more similar copy number to each other than individuals from the outbred CD-1 strain. The copy number variation in CD-1 is more like what has been reported in the human population.</p>

<p>Next we addressed how copy number varies across tissues and organs. To first address the level of variation in the ddPCR protocol, we isolated gDNA from the same tissue after dividing it into three samples. In this case the variability is usually less than 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The results suggest that the accuracy of the measurements is appropriate to assess levels of variation higher than 5%. rDNA copy number differs by up to 15% between tissues from the same individual, and this is true in all three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This variation is similar to individual to individual differences from the two inbred strains. From these studies, we conclude that the changes reported in mtDNA copy number in various tissues are not mirrored by equivalent changes in rDNA copy number, since the tissue to tissue variation in a single individual for rDNA is low but for mtDNA is high. Given the result that tissues from the same individual have very similar rDNA copy numbers, this opens the possibility of using matched cancer-normal genome data to explore rDNA copy number using previously developed computational methods that use genome coverage for normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref017">17</xref>].</p>

<title>Some cancer genomes have fewer rDNA copies than the matched normal genome</title>
<p>We analyzed high-coverage tumor-normal matched WGS data from 162 individuals across eight tumor types, including 19 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples (ALL, phs000341) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref024">24</xref>], 36 medulloblastoma samples (phs000409) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref025">25</xref>], 16 core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia samples (CBF-AML, phs000414), 40 prostatic neoplasm samples (phs000447) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref026">26</xref>], 12 AIDS-related lymphoma samples (phs000530), 12 intestinal neoplasm samples (Liver/Small bowel, phs000579) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref027">27</xref>], 13 osteosarcoma samples (phs000699) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref028">28</xref>], and 14 esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (phs000598) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref029">29</xref>]. The normal WGS data was derived from either blood, solid normal tissue, or germline tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s010">S1 Table</xref>). We also analyzed the rDNA copy number in WGS data derived from blood of 143 normal individuals (phs000424, GTEx). These datasets were chosen for three reasons: 1) we wanted representation of both solid and blood tumors, 2) WGS data was available and 3) permission to use the data for this analysis was granted. The use of ~16,000 exons for normalization and the comparison of many tumor-normal pairs helps to offset concerns regarding how aneuploidy in the cancer genomes might skew results (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>).</p>
<p>To first verify the bioinformatics method, we compared our copy number measurements between the three different regions of the 45S gene for all the normal samples. We found good pairwise correlations between 18S, 5.8S, and 28S genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), similar to those previously reported with this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref017">17</xref>]. We next calculated the copy number for the normal and tumor matched samples. The copy number of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S for the normal samples was subtracted from the tumor for each individual and plotted as the normalized copy number. We found three cancer genome projects, osteosarcoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, for which there was a statistically significant reduction in copy number (~70–90 copies) for the tumor genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g002">Fig 2B–2D</xref>). The other five genome projects did not show significant changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting the method can discern loss vs. no loss. We found this result remarkable because it suggests that over the course of tumor development a lower copy number at the rDNA is selected in some cancers. This is opposite to the idea that more copies might be needed in cancer to reach high rates of ribosome biogenesis required for high rates of protein synthesis and proliferation. Instead, some other aspect of high proliferation may select for a lower copy number, for instance, efficient DNA replication. These findings represent the first demonstration that rDNA copies can be lost as part of cancer development.</p>

<p>We used the ~16,000 exons selected for normalization, which are scattered across all chromosomes, to examine whether the chromosomes with rDNA (13, 14, 15, 21, 22) are present at lower levels relative to other chromosomes in the tumor genomes, since this would indicate chromosome loss as one mechanism to lose rDNA copies. These exons were preselected based on the criteria that they were derived from the largest exon (300 bps or larger) of a single gene, mapped uniquely in the genome, and did not have sequence similarity to each other. Using sequencing coverage, we found evidence that chromosomes in the tumor genomes show more variable coverage than in the normal genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), presumably reflecting increased aneuploidy. However, the chromosomes with rDNA are not lost at higher rates in genome projects that are positive for rDNA loss compared to the genome projects negative for rDNA loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). These results suggest preferential loss of rDNA chromosomes is not the predominant mechanism underlying loss of rDNA copies in the cancer genome projects showing a net loss of rDNA copies.</p>

<title>Cancer genomes with a decrease in rDNA copy number have co-occurring copy number increases in other genes</title>
<p>To further analyze copy number variation in the cancer genome projects, we used the copy number of the preselected exons used for normalization to discover additional genes whose copy number co-varied with the ribosomal DNA. Exons were selected that displayed a significant copy number difference based on results of a paired t test for all the tumor versus all the normal values for each exon for each genome project (FDR&lt; = 0.05). For the three genome projects with low rDNA copy number in tumor versus normal (phs000530, phs000598, phs000699) there were 353 such exons. We then used hierarchical clustering to identify exons with similar trends in copy number (gain or loss) in the three “positive” projects compared to the five “negative” projects. The “gain” cluster was the most striking, with ~100 exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). These exons are spread across all chromosomes and are not confined to the chromosomes with 45S genes, indicating global rather than local structural variations accompany the loss of copies. This result suggests there may be a global concerted genomic signature associated with decreased rDNA copies in cancer. The GO terms associated with the genes from which these exons were derived include DNA damage response and metabolic regulation, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s011">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s013">S4</xref> Tables), suggesting the increase in copy number of these genes could affect cellular physiology. While none of these terms reach statistical significance when adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, there are conflicting views on whether this adjustment is necessary for GO term analysis. Unfortunately, RNA-seq data was not available for these cancer genome projects, which would have allowed us to evaluate if there was a corresponding gene expression signature.</p>

<title>Single nucleotide variation in the 45S repeat</title>
<p>The rDNA represents a prime example of concerted evolution, which refers to the fact that within a species there is very little sequence variation, but there is significant variation between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref007">7</xref>]. The homogeneity is thought to be maintained via frequent and continuous sweeps of recombination. However, variation in the ribosomal DNA sequence has not been assessed in the human genome. We identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels in tumor and normal genomes relative to a common reference. Indels were rare so we focused on SNVs. Within a single individual, the majority of SNVs (~90%) detected relative to the reference were shared between the tumor and normal genome. However, subtraction of the shared SNVs still yielded several unique SNVs. The number of unique SNVs were similar in tumor and normal genomes across the 8 different projects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s014">S5 Table</xref>). When taken in aggregate, the number of SNVs in the cancer genomes is not higher than in the normal genomes. These results suggest that as cells divide, SNVs can arise at the rDNA and propagate at a similar level in tumor and normal cells.</p>

The plot depicts unique SNVs per kb in the repeat in normal and cancer genomes, with the project number indicated on the x axis, and the allele number on each bar. (B). All unique SNVs for all projects were summed together to depict the SNVs per kb for the different regions of the repeat. The total number of SNVs in each region is annotated on each bar. (C). The number of unique SNVs identified in the 28S region are plotted by position relative to the 45S repeat in GenBank. Hotspots of variation are apparent. (D). The number of alleles for each shared SNVs in each genome pair was used to calculate an average allele number per genome. The average for the normal genome was subtracted from the average calculated for the matched tumor genome to yield the allele difference, plotted by project with results of a t test indicated for each (phs000341, 0.0467, phs000409, 0.7223, phs000414, 0.3458, phs000447, 0.0011, phs000530, 0.8773, phs000579, 0.9782, phs000598, 0.0144, phs000699, 0.0641).</p>

<p>One might predict the coding portion of the locus to experience selective pressure to generate functional ribosomes for high proliferation. SNVs were binned for each region of the repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Previous work in yeast has suggested the most variable region is the non-transcribed portion, because mutations here might have the least functional consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref030">30</xref>]. The human repeat is ~30% transcribed (ETS, ITS, 18S, 5.8S, 28S) and ~70% non-transcribed (IGS). We found that the regions encoding 18S and 5.8S had virtually no SNVs in either the tumor or normal genomes, suggesting these sequences cannot tolerate mutations, consistent with a previous report in yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref030">30</xref>]. Surprisingly, SNVs were detected in the 28S region, with a similar number in tumor and normal genomes. We detected hotspots for variation; the 189 SNVs were located at only 22 unique positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). SNVs in the gene encoding 28S rRNA have the potential to affect ribosome function if the corresponding repeats are transcribed.</p>
<p>All non-coding regions of the human repeat had SNVs, including the 5’ and 3’ external transcribed spacer regions, the internal transcribed spacers, as well as the large intergenic region, suggesting these regions can tolerate SNVs. Interestingly, the IGS did not appear to be mutated at a significantly higher rate than the overall repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s015">S6 Table</xref>). SNVs in the transcribed non-coding regions have the potential to affect transcription and processing of rRNA but are difficult to functionally evaluate given our limited understanding of the sequence features of the human repeat. In summary, variation in the non-coding region is higher than in the coding region, regardless of transcription. Moreover, the amount of variation is generally similar in the normal and tumor genomes.</p>
<p>Another way to quantify variation that pertains specifically to a multi-copy sequence in the genome is allele number. By this we mean that individual nucleotide positions could have sequence evidence for more than one base, which we refer to as alleles. For the shared SNVs, we evaluated the number of alleles present in the cancer and normal genomes, to ask whether there was differential presence of alleles. We found three genome projects with evidence for more minor alleles in the tumor as compared to normal genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The modest increase observed in prostate neoplasms (phs000447) could be due to the handful of cancer genomes in this project with very high copy number. Most notably, the esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) genomes have an increased allele frequency relative to the matched normal genomes (phs000598), despite having a lower copy number. Therefore, in the EAC genomes, there are more alleles of the 45S gene sequence despite fewer copies. The initial publication describing the analysis of the EAC genomes reported mutational complexity with accumulated mutations including activating mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, and loss of function mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>PIK3R1</italic>, <italic>AKT2</italic>, and <italic>AKT3</italic>, together implicating the mTOR-PTEN pathway in some instances of this cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref029">29</xref>]. Our results reveal that the mutational complexity of this cancer also encompasses variation in 45S. Overall, our sequence analysis of the human 45S repeats indicates a surprising level of SNVs with newly identified hotspots in the human 28S gene, and some cancer genomes with evidence for increased alleles.</p>

<title>The Pten<sup>-/-</sup> mouse leukemia model shows a decrease in rDNA copies in HSC genomes</title>

Loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> in prostate cancer is associated with tumor aggression and poor outcome.

Because the samples used for the cancer genome projects have a mixed population of mutations, may have genetic instability, and may be derived from mixtures of cell types, we wanted to specifically address whether high mTOR function could influence rDNA copy number in the context of a uniform genetic alteration (loss of <italic>Pten</italic>) in a pure cell population.</p>
<p>We used a mouse model for <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> leukemia in the C57Bl6 background to assess rDNA copies in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref036">36</xref>]. <italic>Pten</italic> is excised in bone marrow HSCs postnatally, but remains intact in all tissues other than the progeny of null HSCs.

<p>We constructed and sequenced libraries from genomic DNA derived from 20 WT and 20 <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> clones derived from two age and sex matched females. Using our computational method, counting of the 5.8S and 18S sequences showed a loss of ~30 copies in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> clones, and 28S showed a loss of ~20 copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Given that the libraries were made using a transposase method that has some bias, the agreement between the computational and ddPCR methods is quite good, and lends confidence in the overall trend toward loss in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> HSCs. This trend is consistent with the lower rDNA copies observed in the genomes of osteosarcoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> clones have similar ploidy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), indicating that chromosome loss is not the mechanism by which rDNA is lost in this context. Further analysis of the DNA sequences from the 40 clones revealed 110 SNVs relative to the consensus sequence that were shared between WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> clones. There were a handful of SNVs that occurred uniquely in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (9) or WT clones (28), with most occurring in the large IGS region (5 for WT and 17 for <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>). No SNVs were detected in 18S or 5.8S, but 3 were detected in 28S. Overall the SNV pattern is similar to that observed in the human genome. Together these results suggest that in some cancers, and specifically in loss of PTEN, loss of rDNA copies may provide some selective advantage for the cancer genome. Furthermore, in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSC model, loss of copies is a relatively early event, prior to progression to leukemia or aneuploidy.</p>
<p><italic>PTEN</italic> plays a critical role in the maintenance of chromosome stability, preventing double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref039">39</xref>].

Because rRNA is the most abundant RNA product, this method has been widely used as a proxy to measure rRNA synthesis. We found that rRNA production is more robust in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs compared to <italic>Pten</italic><sup>+/+</sup> HSCs despite reduced rDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This result is consistent with previous reports that PTEN normally represses both RNA polymerase I- and RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref043">43</xref>]. Moreover, global protein synthesis, as measured by <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation, was significantly higher in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref044">44</xref>]. Therefore, loss of copies and DNA damage sensitivity occurs in the context of more robust proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis.</p>

<p>To determine whether the DNA damage sensitivity was due to fewer copies or the activation of mTOR, we treated HSCs with INK128 to block TOR activity and asked whether the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs were still sensitive to DNA damage. For these experiments HSCs were derived from 3 age matched pairs of male mice. First we identified a concentration of INK128 that would effectively block TOR activity in the HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Second, we measured copy number by ddPCR, finding loss of ~30 copies in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs that occurred independent of treatment with INK128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The copy number in the tails of mice was similar across animals and similar to the copy number in the WT HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Next we measured rRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). These outputs depended on mTOR activity, as expected, and were effectively normalized between the genotypes in the presence of INK128. Together with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g006">Fig 6</xref>, these results demonstrate similar behavior between HSCs derived from male and female mice, with 8 pairs examined in total. Finally, we examined the sensitivity of the mTOR-blocked HSCs to bleomycin. Importantly, the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs are more sensitive to bleomycin than the WT HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006771.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), suggesting that the sensitivity is not due to differential activation of mTOR, but could derive from the lower copy number.</p>

<p>Finally, we asked whether copy number can change rapidly in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells grown in culture. RPE cells have a normal karyotype such that the droplet digital PCR method, which uses a single copy reference gene to calculate copy number, can be applied. RPE cells were transfected with 3 different siRNAs to knockdown <italic>PTEN</italic>, or a control siRNA. The knockdown of PTEN was confirmed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The copy number of the RPE cells was determined at 80 hours post-transfection, or after about 3 doublings. Under these conditions the copy number is not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006771.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). This result suggests that loss may require more doublings, or may require other environmental factors provided in an animal, such as cell-cell competition. This finding suggests that the loss of copies is not an immediate event upon loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> and is consistent with the result in the HSCs that short term treatment with an mTOR inhibitor is not sufficient to alter the copy number.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that in hematopoietic cancer stem cells, cell growth and ribosome biogenesis can occur robustly with ~30–40 fewer rDNA repeats. Interestingly, in budding yeast, loss of rDNA copies is associated with sensitivity to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref021">21</xref>]. Our results show that mouse HSCs without <italic>Pten</italic> function have fewer copies and are similarly sensitive to DNA damage. With only half of the rDNA repeats normally transcribed, loss of repeats can be compensated by increasing the fraction transcribed in yeast. However, the binding of factors that normally associate with the inactive repeats to maintain the stability of the locus may be compromised, increasing the sensitivity of yeast with fewer repeats to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref045">45</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether compensation occurs in the mammalian genome, and whether the absence of silenced repeats could cause DNA damage sensitivity. Nevertheless, copy number may be a useful predictor of DNA damage sensitivity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have used both computational approaches and ddPCR to analyze the copy number and sequence of the rDNA in mammalian cells. We find tissue to tissue variation in copy number in a single mouse is relatively low, as is individual to individual variation within an inbred strain. However, in an outbred mouse strain, the level of variation is higher, more resembling the situation in human genomes. We report for the first time that some cancer genomes, and in particular genomes associated with high mTOR activity, tend to have fewer copies than the matched normal genomes, a finding replicated in mouse cancer stem cells, and consistent with a previous report demonstrating transgenerational loss of rDNA copies in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> with overactive TOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref013">13</xref>]. The low copy cancer genomes show concerted copy number changes in additional genes, suggesting a structural signature for these genomes. rDNA sequence variation can also occur in cancer genomes. Low copy in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs is associated with sensitivity to DNA damage, extending previous reports that <italic>PTEN</italic> guards against genome instability. Our results suggest that copy number and sequence can change in the mammalian genome in cancer, and that loss of copies may have both costs and benefits. Future studies further analyzing the mechanisms and functional consequences of genomic alterations at the rDNA in mammals are warranted. Given our findings, it seems possible that ribosomal DNA could exhibit changes in other contexts.</p>
<p>Loss of rDNA repeats may affect genome function and chromosomal processes via the release of protein factors. The rDNA locus houses many pluripotency factors in mammalian cells, including Oct4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref046">46</xref>]. The rDNA also contains binding sites for Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref047">47</xref>], a key transcription factor for proliferation that can also affect DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref048">48</xref>], and CTCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref049">49</xref>], a key chromosome organization protein. The rDNA chromatin contains many different histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref049">49</xref>], which could sequester chromatin readers and writers. Finally, nucleolar associated domains are enriched in regions displaying heterochromatin signatures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref050">50</xref>] and rDNA copy number titrates position effect variegation, a heterochromatin based silencing phenomenon in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref023">23</xref>]. Losing repeats has the potential to liberate factors for re-distribution to the rest of the genome which could affect chromosome organization, gene expression, and replication.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PTEN has been shown to directly control the function of the DNA replication factor MCM2 during DNA replication stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref051">51</xref>]. Replication stress occurs at the rDNA and has been reported as a potent driver of functional decline in HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref052">52</xref>]. In a mouse model for cancer driven by deficiency in <italic>Mcm2</italic>, genomic deletions can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref053">53</xref>]. Spontaneous DSBs also occur at higher levels upon loss of PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref039">39</xref>]. Together these findings suggest that one possible reason that rDNA repeats are lost in the absence of PTEN is that DSBs and replication stress are handled without MCM2 function, and repair events are required. The repair events that result in deletions may be selected for, since the rDNA is difficult to replicate and loss of repeats might facilitate a successful cell cycle. We suggest that rDNA may both sense and adapt to genomic stress, with PTEN-mTOR normally guarding against copy loss.</p>
<p>Extrachromosomal expansions of rDNA have been reported in frog oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref010">10</xref>]. This expansion is thought to facilitate the production of rRNA for ribosome biogenesis and the translational requirements in these cells. Based on this finding we predicted that cancer cells might expand the repeats due to similar requirements. Instead, we found recurrent evidence for contractions. We note that there is a key difference between the oocyte and the cancer cell—rounds of DNA replication. We speculate that the requirement to replicate the rDNA in cancer may select for the loss of repeats while the lack of replication in the oocyte may allow the expansion to be tolerated. The timing of the loss of the repeats relative to the development of cancer cannot be determined from the cancer genome projects. However, in the mouse HSCs loss occurs prior to the development of leukemia and aneuploidy, at the stage of a cancer stem cell. Further characterization of the selective forces and timing of loss will be interesting questions for the future.</p>
<p>Linking the rDNA to both genome stability and ribosome biogenesis may enable it to act as a critical molecular sensor. Changes in translation are associated with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref054">54</xref>]. Myc and PI3K-AKT-mTOR are major oncogenic signaling pathways that promote reprogramming of translation. Studies to date have focused on mRNA regulatory elements, tRNA function and codon usage bias, and adaptations to stress that affect translation, but not ribosomal DNA copy number as a factor under the control of TOR signaling. Protein synthesis is quite tightly regulated in HSCs and defects that arise via loss of <italic>Pten</italic> or silencing of rDNA repeats cause functional decline and aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref052">52</xref>]. Our study suggests that rDNA copy number and sequence can be altered in human cancers. HSCs with fewer copies are more sensitive to DNA damage, but are not compromised for rRNA production, proliferation, or protein synthesis. We speculate that the extra inactive copies may normally serve in part to counteract rDNA instability. Together, our data and others show that multiple mechanisms regulate protein synthesis and genome stability to control aging and prevent leukemogenesis in HSCs, and that these processes may be linked using the rDNA as a sensor.</p>
<p>In summary, the rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer, with high mTOR activity associated with contractions and DNA damage sensitivity. With this recognition comes the possibility to target these loci. Cancer stem cells with low copy number may be more sensitive to DNA damaging agents. We speculate that this single copy number measurement could be used as a proxy detector for the variety of mutations that can occur in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in cancer and a predictor of whether DNA damaging drugs would selectively target the cancer stem cells. These findings may be applicable to cancer diagnosis and therapeutic choice.</p>

<title>Computational analysis of cancer genome projects</title>
<p>Cancer genome data was obtained with permission from dbGaP. The analysis for rDNA copy number is similar to a previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006771.ref017">17</xref>]. Briefly, the human consensus 45S rDNA sequences was obtained from NCBI (accession: U13369). Raw fastq whole-genome DNA sequence reads were downloaded from dbGaP. Reads were mapped to the 45S locus, and a set of 16022 pre-selected putative single-copy exons (the largest from each gene) using Bowtie2 v2.1.0 with default parameters. Only concordant read pairs are kept in the down-stream analysis. The rDNA copy number of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S was calculated as the mean coverage in the respective regions. To make samples comparable to each other, the rDNA copy number was further normalized to the background genome coverage, which is calculated as the median coverage of the single copy exons.</p>
<p>For sequence analysis, the predominant sequence of each individual genome was compared to the human reference sequence for 45S. Each nucleotide position was either a match to the consensus 45S sequence, or if not a match, then the position was called a SNV. SNVs were called using samtools mpileup (v1.2) after the duplicated reads were removed from the aligned read files. SNVs were further filtered with the quality score (&gt;20, “PASS”). If the SNVs of the cancer and normal matched genome pair were identical, this was termed a shared SNV. If the SNV was not identical, this position was termed a unique SNV. For the shared SNVs in a pair, each position was evaluated for sequence evidence of 1–4 different nucleotides. The allele numbers for the shared SNVs were used to calculate an average allele number for each genome. The average of the number of alleles at the shared SNVs for normal was subtracted from tumor to generate the allele difference for each matched pair, plotted as an individual point in the box plot. GO terms were calculated using the R package GOstats.</p>

<title>rDNA containing chromosomes are not lost at higher rates than normal chromosomes.</title>
<p>A. Normalized coverage of each chromosome for tumor (left) and normal (right) genome for each person is shown in a heatmap for each of the 3 projects for which we calculated loss of copies of rDNA. The tumor genomes show more variable coverage than the normal genomes, indicating aneuploidy, as might be expected. B. For the 5 human chromosomes containing rDNA (13, 14, 15, 21, 22), the normalized coverage is plotted for tumor and normal genomes for all genome projects negative for loss of rDNA (rDNA chromosomes-negative) and positive for loss of rDNA (rDNA chromosomes-positive). While there is clearly more variable coverage in the tumor genomes for these chromosomes in both positive and negative genome projects, there is not a trend toward coverage loss in the positive projects that could account for the loss of rDNA.</p>

<title>Confirmation of mTOR activation in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs and decrease in copy number accompanied by increase in damage sensitivity.</title>
<p>(A) Western blotting for various indicators of mTOR activity was performed to confirm that loss of PTEN results in activation of mTOR activity in HSCs. (B) <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs exhibited a decrease in rDNA copy number compared to matched WT HSCs, samples were derived from 3 mice of each genotype with 8–12 clones each (n = 28 for <italic>Pten</italic><sup>+/+</sup> HSCs, and n = 33 for <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSCs). (C). The rDNA copy number in the gDNA derived from tail samples was similar between the WT mice used to derive the HSC clones used in (B), and was also similar to rDNA copy number in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>+/+</sup> HSC clones derived from these mice. Tail DNA was not available for the mice used to derive the HSC clones in (B). (D-G). HSCs were treated as indicated and the viability was calculated at day five based on total cell number and trypan blue staining. Each dosage was performed in triplicate and the error bars represent standard deviation. Data shown was derived from HSCs from a single mouse of each genotype. Asterisks represent values for which a t test indicates statistical significance below 0.05.</p>

<title>DNA seq verifies loss of rDNA in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSC clones and euploidy.</title>
<p>A. DNA was isolated from 20 WT and 20 <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HSC clones. Libraries were made using the Nextera kit and subjected to sequencing at low coverage. We employed our computational pipeline developed for the human cancer genome data to analyze these samples. (A) We found a loss of 20–30 copies of rDNA in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> clones, depending on the sequence counted (5.8S, 18S, or 28S). For each of the 3 sequences, a t test showed statistical significance lower than 0.0001. (B) ~16,000 single copy exons were used to examine ploidy. Coverage is plotted as a heat map by the average coverage for each chromosome for each HSC clone, with the genotype indicated. There are no obvious differences in chromosome coverage between the WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> clones, indicating that the WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> clones are similarly euploid.</p>
