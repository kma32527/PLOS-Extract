<abstract>
<p>In many insects, the accessory gland, a secretory tissue of the male reproductive system, is essential for male fertility. Male accessory gland is the major source of proteinaceous secretions, collectively called as seminal proteins (or accessory gland proteins), which upon transfer, manipulate the physiology and behavior of mated females. Insect hormones such as ecdysteroids and juvenoids play a key role in accessory gland development and protein synthesis but little is known about underlying molecular players and their mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the roles of hormone-dependent transcription factors (Nuclear Receptors), in accessory gland development, function and male fertility of a genetically tractable insect model, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. First, we carried out an RNAi screen involving 19 hormone receptors, individually and specifically, in a male reproductive tissue (accessory gland) for their requirement in Drosophila male fertility. Subsequently, by using independent RNAi/ dominant negative forms, we show that Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) is essential for male fertility due to its requirement in the normal development of accessory glands in Drosophila: EcR depleted glands fail to make seminal proteins and have dying cells. Further, our data point to a novel ecdysone receptor that does not include Ultraspiracle but is probably comprised of EcR isoforms in Drosophila male accessory glands. Our data suggest that this novel ecdysone receptor might act downstream of homeodomain transcription factor paired (prd) in the male accessory gland. Overall, the study suggests novel ecdysone receptor as an important player in the hormonal regulation of seminal protein production and insect male fertility.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Insects are the major contributors to biodiversity and have economic, agricultural and health importance. This unparalleled abundance of insects, in part, can be attributed to their high reproductive potential. In many insects, proteins derived from the accessory gland, the secretory tissue of male reproductive system, are critical for fertility. The production of these accessory gland proteins is regulated by insect hormones but the underlying mechanisms/molecular players remain poorly understood. Elucidation of the same has potential applications in designing pest control management strategies and to understand the effect of environmental chemicals on reproduction. In view of this, we analyzed the role, if any, of various insect hormone receptors in development and function of the male accessory gland in a genetically tractable insect model, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Here, we report the involvement of Ecdysone receptor (EcR with novel composition) in Drosophila male fertility. We show that the depletion of this receptor causes cell death in male accessory glands, which fail to produce seminal fluid proteins leading to sterility/sub-fertility of Drosophila males. These findings will find potential applications in designing insect pest control strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In insects, molecular contributions from the male play critical roles in altering the reproductive physiology and behavior of the mated female. These physiological and behavioral changes, including elevated egg production, decreased willingness to remating, storage/utilization of sperm, altered gene expression and increased feeding [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref002">2</xref>], collectively referred to as post-mating responses, are dependent on the receipt of sperm and seminal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref005">5</xref>]. In insects, the majority of these seminal proteins are contributed by the accessory glands, a secretory tissue of the male reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref011">11</xref>]. The accessory glands are derived from the genital disc during the late larval stage and the development, as well as the secretory activity of the male accessory gland, is tightly regulated by the insect endocrine system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref013">13</xref>]. The roles of ecdysteroids and juvenoids, the major insect hormones, in maturation and for the stimulation of protein synthesis in male accessory glands of many insects are well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref022">22</xref>]. Despite this, the molecular players and/or receptors and their mechanism of action in the hormonal regulation of male accessory gland structure and function remain poorly understood. Mutations in Methoprene-tolerant (Met, a juvenile hormone receptor; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref023">23</xref>]), or knockdown through injection of dsRNA for two hormone receptors (E75 and DHR38; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref024">24</xref>]) resulted in a marginal reduction in the protein synthesis in the male accessory glands. However, it is uncertain if this phenotypic outcome is due to tissue specific /systemic role(s) of these hormone receptors. Precise characterization of the underlying hormone receptors can lead to a mechanistic understanding of the hormonal regulation of insect male accessory glands useful in designing pest control management strategies and to evaluate the effect of man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals on the reproduction of economically important insects. Hence, an attempt has been made in the present study to identify the hormone receptor(s) underlying the development and/or synthetic activity of insect male accessory glands, by taking advantage of a versatile insect model system, namely <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p>
<p>In Drosophila, the steroid hormone ecdysone and the terpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) regulate major developmental and adult processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref025">25</xref>]. The male accessory glands in Drosophila develop from mesodermal cells recruited into the genital disc during late larval development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref026">26</xref>]. Each lobe of the male accessory gland in Drosophila is composed of a monolayer of binucleate morphologically distinct cell types with 96% flat polygonally shaped “main cells” and 4% large, spherical, vacuole filled “secondary” cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref028">28</xref>]. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, the programming of these cell types by homeodomain transcription factor, <italic>paired</italic> (<italic>prd</italic>), homeodomain transcription repressor, <italic>defective proventriculus</italic> (<italic>dve</italic>) and homeobox gene, <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>) is critical for male fertility as their concerted synthetic activities lead to production of functional accessory gland proteins (Acps; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref033">33</xref>]). These Acps modulate multiple physiological and behavioral processes in females, after their transfer during mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref036">36</xref>]. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, ecdysone and juvenile hormone titers are known to influence the synthesis of Acps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref038">38</xref>]. Apart from <italic>Met</italic>, the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> genome has 18 nuclear receptor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref039">39</xref>] but their roles in accessory gland development, Acp synthesis and reproduction remain to be characterized. Therefore, we examined the requirement for 19 hormone receptors (18 nuclear receptors and Met) in Drosophila male fertility by employing the GAL4/UAS binary expression system with RNAi constructs, and inducible dominant-negative forms against these hormone receptors, in an accessory gland-specific manner. We demonstrate that ecdysone receptor (EcR) but not ultraspiracle (USP) is essential for functional male accessory glands, and hence critical for male fertility in Drosophila. We find elevated apoptotic marker(s) coupled with structural abnormalities and reduced seminal proteins in EcR deficient accessory glands. In addition, we show that all three isoforms of EcR are essential for male fertility in Drosophila. Together, our findings suggest a deviation from the traditional heterodimer of EcR and USP, and point to a novel receptor comprising EcR homodimers in the development/function of male accessory glands in Drosophila.</p>

<title>EcR is essential for male fertility in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic></title>
<p>In Drosophila, ecdysone and juvenile hormones are critical for reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref041">41</xref>]. Further, these hormones regulate the production of seminal fluid proteins in male accessory glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref042">42</xref>]. However, knowledge of the key players underlying this hormonal control is limited. In this context, we hypothesized that nuclear receptors, which are the key regulators of hormonal action, may underlie the hormonally mediated development/function of male accessory glands. To test if this is the case, we have knocked down 18 nuclear receptors [EcR, USP, DHR38, DHR78, DHR39, DSF, DHR51, DHR3, E78, DHR96, ERR, SVP, TLL, FTZ-F1, DHR83, HNF4, DHR4, E75 (Please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s001">S1 Fig</xref> for levels of knockdown)], a JH receptor (Met) and Juvenile hormone esterase (Jhe), individually, in an accessory gland (<italic>prd</italic>-GAL4; Please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s002">S2 Fig</xref> for male accessory gland-specific expression of the GAL4 driver) specific manner, in the Drosophila male reproductive tract. To begin with, we assessed the consequences of the depletion of hormone receptors (HR) associated with ecdysone/juvenile hormone signaling on male fertility in terms of the progeny produced by females mated to these knockdown males (<italic>prd-</italic>GAL4/UAS-<italic>HR-miRNA</italic>). We counted the number of progeny produced by females mated to knockdown males and compared to those from females mated to genetically matched control males (<italic>Sb</italic>/UAS-<italic>HR-miRNA</italic>), which have normal levels of the targeted candidate. Of the candidates (18 nuclear receptors, Met, Jhe) tested, females mated to Met deficient males produced significantly fewer progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Met knockdown, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; Bonferroni corrected p-value for significance is <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.002) when compared to controls. This is consistent with the previous report of reduced fertility of null mutants of <italic>Met</italic><sup>27</sup> due to reduced seminal protein levels in their accessory glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref023">23</xref>]. Interestingly, females mated to males with EcR-deficient accessory glands did not produce any progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>, EcR knockdown), and differed significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; Bonferroni corrected p-value for significance is <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.002) from their controls (which were fertile and produced progeny at levels similar to other controls; <italic>p</italic> = 0.13). To rule out the influence of strain and/or off-targeting effects on the observed sterility phenotype of EcR-miRNA males, we depleted EcR in a similar manner using a different RNAi construct (EcR-TRiP) and assayed the fertility of their mates. Interestingly, females mated to EcR-TRiP knockdown males produced progeny, albeit the numbers were yet significantly lower than those of controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s003">S3A Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007). The observed discrepancy between EcR knockdown lines in the fertility phenotype may be attributed to the difference in the extent of knockdown between miRNA (97% knockdown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and TRiP line (33% knockdown; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of the remaining 17 nuclear receptors or Jhe did not yield detectable fertility phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This is interesting because many ecdysone signaling pathways in insects are known to be mediated by a heterodimer of EcR and USP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref043">43</xref>]. Females mated to USP-deficient males, like the mates of DHR38, DHR78, DHR39, DSF, DHR51, DHR3, E78, DHR96, ERR, SVP, TLL, FTZ-F1, DHR83, HNF4, DHR4, or E75 knockdown males, did not significantly differ from their control in the overall number of progeny produced over a period of 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>, USP, <italic>p</italic> = 0.27). One possible explanation for this lack of phenotype could be that the extent of knockdown may not be sufficient as the level of protein loss in USP is not as severe as that of EcR through miRNA based silencing. At this juncture, it is important to note that the observed knockdown levels (&gt; 50% knockdown, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) achieved with USP-miRNA were still better than EcR-TRiP based silencing (which was only 33% but yet resulted in a phenotype). In addition, similar depletion of USP with different additional RNAi constructs (USP-TRiP or USP-RNAi) also did not have a significant effect on male fertility: females mated to these knockdown males had fertility comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Nonetheless, if EcR is acting with USP, then one would predict that simultaneous depletion of USP shall further reduce the fertility of the weaker EcR (EcR-TRiP) knockdown. However, the number of progeny from the females mated to EcR-TRiP/USP-miRNA double knockdown males was comparable to that of females mated to EcR-TRiP knockdown males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s006">S6 Fig</xref>; p = 0.2589). In addition, we observed that knockdown of EcR did not affect the USP levels in male accessory gland and vice-versa: EcR knockdown male accessory glands had USP protein at levels comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g002">Fig 2</xref>) while USP-deficient accessory glands had reduced level of USP protein but contained normal levels of EcR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The above findings raised the possibility that EcR may function without USP in ecdysone signaling pathways operating in/on male accessory glands. To test if this is the case, we focused on EcR and USP for further experiments.</p>

<title>The effect of knockdown of different hormone receptors on the fertility of mated females.</title>
<p>To identify the nuclear/hormone receptor involved in male fertility, 19 receptors were knocked down, individually, in accessory gland specific manner in the male reproductive tract and were allowed to mate with virgin females. Shown here is the number [Mean±Standard Error (SEM)] of progeny produced by females mated to knockdown or control males over a period of 10 days. Mates of <italic>met</italic> (Methoprene tolerant, a juvenile hormone receptor, **<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) knockdown males produced significantly fewer progeny when compared to their controls and also those in strain background control (Jhe). Interestingly, females mated to EcR knockdown males failed to produce progeny (EcR; ***<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.0001; Bonferroni corrected p value for significance is <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.002). However, fertility of females mated to USP (<italic>p =</italic> 0.27) or the remaining 16 hormone receptor knockdown males was not significantly different from their respective controls.

<p>In Drosophila, a reduction in fertility could be due to several reasons, including fewer eggs being laid by mated females and/or reduced hatchability/increased mortality of these laid eggs during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref036">36</xref>]. Therefore, to determine the cause of reduction in the fertility of mates of EcR knockdown males, we counted the number of eggs laid (fecundity), and the number of progeny (fertility) produced over a period of 10 days, by females mated to EcR or USP knockdown males. We also examined the egg hatchability and/or mortality during development by determining percent hatchability as a proportion of eggs reaching adult stage as in Ravi Ram and Wolfner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref036">36</xref>]. Mates of EcR or USP control males or USP knockdown males laid eggs at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1). However, females mated to EcR knockdown males laid significantly fewer eggs compared to their control mates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, EcR knockdown, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). Mates of EcR knockdown males laid eggs within 24h after the start of mating (ASM), albeit significantly lower in number when compared to those of control mates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, day 1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). However beyond 24h ASM, EcR knockdown mates did not lay eggs, while control mates continued to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, Days 2–10, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). Subsequently, we counted the number of flies that emerged from these vials to determine the fertility. Females mated to EcR, USP control males or USP knockdown males produced progeny at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3D–3F</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1), whereas mates of EcR knockdown males had no progeny over a period of 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3D &amp; 3E</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). We calculated the percentage hatchability as a proportion of eggs reaching adulthood. None of the eggs laid by females mated to EcR knockdown males (EcR-miRNA) hatched, as evidenced by the lack of larvae as well as progeny. The overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3G</xref>, EcR knockdown, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) as well as day-wise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) percent hatchability levels obtained in EcR knockdown scenario were significantly lower than those in control. A similar trend, with the exception of sterility phenotype, was observed in mates of EcR-TRiP knockdown males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). However, USP control and knockdown mates had significant differences in percent hatchability on days 8 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3I</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) but such differences did not have a significant bearing on the overall percent hatchability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g003">Fig 3H</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.3). Therefore, the reduced fertility of EcR knockdown mates is a consequence of reduced egg production in addition to egg hatchability. These findings suggest that normal levels of EcR in the male accessory glands are critical for male fertility.</p>

<title>EcR is critical for the normal accessory glands in Drosophila male reproductive tract</title>
<p>Transfer of sperm and seminal fluids from the male to the female during mating and post-copulatory storage as well as subsequent utilization of sperm in specialized organs (seminal receptacle and spermathecae) of the mated female reproductive tract are critical determinants of fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref044">44</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed sperm production in knockdown males and transfer of sperm to their mates. We observed mature sperm in the seminal vesicles of EcR control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) males or USP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) males, indicating the normal sperm production. This is not surprising since the <italic>prd</italic> driver in the study does not target testes and/or processes related to sperm production. To find out the transfer of sperm and their storage in EcR or USP knockdown mates, reproductive tracts from these females were dissected at 2h ASM and we observed that mates of EcR control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), USP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4G</xref>) or knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4H</xref>) males had mating plug in the uterus and GFP-tagged sperm in their uteri as well as sperm storage organs, namely seminal receptacle and spermathecae. However, females mated to EcR knockdown males contained GFP-labeled sperm only around the mating plug in their uteri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Consistent with this, GFP-labeled sperm were visible in the seminal receptacles from EcR control, USP control or USP knockdown mates while seminal receptacles from EcR knockdown mates had no detectable GFP-labeled sperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s008">S8A–S8D Fig</xref>). Accordingly, the number of sperm stored in the sperm storage organs was significantly different between EcR control and knockdown mates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s008">S8E Fig</xref>, EcR, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) while USP knockdown mates stored sperm at levels comparable to USP controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s008">S8E Fig</xref>, USP, SR <italic>p</italic> = 0.1 and SP <italic>p</italic> = 0.25). These findings suggest that the knockdown of EcR and USP has no detectable effect on sperm transfer to the female. However, sperm transferred from EcR knockdown males fail to move towards storage organs and accordingly, were not able to enter storage organs. This is consistent with the reports that the movement of sperm in the female reproductive tract, their entry into- and release from- sperm storage organs require normal levels of accessory gland proteins (Acps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref047">47</xref>]. Therefore, the observed failure of sperm from EcR knockdown males to enter the sperm storage organs after their transfer to females points to defects in Acp content. Nuclear receptors are known to play key roles in the regulation of organogenesis and development in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref050">50</xref>]. This prompted us to analyze the accessory glands at the structural level and the production of Acps at the transcript as well as protein levels in EcR-deficient males.</p>

<title>Analysis of sperm production in EcR knockdown males and their fate in mated females.</title>
<p>To evaluate the effect of EcR knockdown (EcR-miRNA) on sperm, we first generated control and knockdown males that express GFP labeled sperm (ProtamineB-EGFP). Subsequently, observation of seminal vesicles from these males under a confocal microscope revealed comparable levels of GFP tagged sperm (green) in both controls (Panels A&amp;C) as well as knockdown (EcR, Panel B or USP, Panel D) males, suggesting that sperm production is normal in these males. To test if these males are able to transfer sperm to females during mating, males knockdown for EcR or USP in their accessory glands were allowed to mate with Oregon-R virgin females. At 2h ASM, reproductive tracts from mated females were isolated and observed under confocal microscope for the presence of GFP-labeled sperm. Reproductive tracts from females mated to (E) EcR control, (G) USP control or (H) knockdown males contained mating plug (MP, blue) in the uteri (U) and GFP-labeled sperm (green) in the uteri as well as sperm storage organs, namely seminal receptacle (SR) and spermathecae (SP). However, reproductive tracts of females mated to EcR knockdown males (F) contained mating plugs but had sperm only in the uterus but not in SR and SP. These observations suggest that knockdown of EcR or USP has no detectable effect on sperm transfer but the sperm transferred by EcR knockdown males fail to move towards sperm storage organs and are not stored at levels comparable to those in controls.</p>

<p>Each male accessory gland lobe of Drosophila has a single cellular layer comprised of morphologically distinct main cells and secondary cells with a muscle sheath underneath surrounding the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref028">28</xref>]. These main cells and secondary cells express different but partially overlapping sets of Acps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref029">29</xref>]. To test if depletion of EcR affects the accessory gland structure, we compared the morphology and ultrastructure of EcR-depleted accessory glands with that of EcR control or USP control and knockdown glands. In controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s009">S9A &amp; S9C Fig</xref>) and USP knockdown males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s009">S9D Fig</xref>), the accessory glands under phase contrast microscope appeared bulged and their lumina were filled with secretions. However, accessory glands of EcR knockdown males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s009">S9B Fig</xref>) appeared flaccid and contained little/no secretions in their lumina. Transmission electron micrographs of the accessory gland in the EcR control males contained a single layer of epithelium, with secretory cells, numerous ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies. The lumen contained several vesicles filled with electron dense secretions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition, the lumen was also filled with various filamentous structures signifying the secretory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). However, accessory glands from EcR knockdown males contained disorganized endoplasmic reticulum, fewer ribosomes, and the lumen contained fewer/negligible filamentous structures and was characterized by extensive vacuolization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).The ultrastructure of USP control and knockdown accessory glands did not deviate from that of EcR controls and contained several filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g005">Fig 5C &amp; 5D</xref>). To understand the effects of EcR depletion, if any, on the cell types (main cells and secondary cells), we immunostained the glands with antibodies against α-Spectrin (which label the cell membrane, as in Minami et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref031">31</xref>]). In the EcR control, we observed several polygonally shaped binucleate cells (the main cells) and a few large and spherical binucleate cells (the secondary cells) interspersed between the polygonally shaped cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g006">Fig 6A and 6A′</xref>). In contrast, EcR-deficient glands lacked such cellular distinction and contained highly disrupted cell membranes with aggregated nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g006">Fig 6B and 6B′</xref>), indicating the effects of EcR depletion on the cellular organization in the male accessory glands. To substantiate the effects of EcR depletion on the cell types of accessory gland, we performed western blotting of the glands with antibodies for Abdominal-B (Abd-B), a Hox protein essential for normal development of the secondary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref029">29</xref>]. Interestingly, Abd-B protein was significantly reduced /non-detectable in accessory glands from EcR knockdown males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>,—lane under EcR in Abd-B panel), while controls had detectable Abd-B protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, + lane under EcR, + and–lanes under USP in Abd-B panel) suggesting that the development/function of secondary cells might be affected. To corroborate the same, we analyzed the levels of Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ANCE), which is expressed and associated with large vesicles of secondary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref051">51</xref>]. Expectedly, controls had detectable ANCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, + lane under EcR, + and–lanes under USP in ANCE panel) while the same in accessory glands from EcR knockdown males was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g006">Fig 6D</xref>,—lane under EcR in ANCE panel) indicating the disruption of secondary cells in EcR knockdown glands. To further characterize the effect of EcR knockdown on main and secondary cells of the accessory glands, the distinct secretory products (Acps) of these two cell types were analyzed.</p>

Consistent with this, quantitative PCR analysis in EcR-TRiP based knockdown males revealed a significant reduction of transcript levels of candidate Acps representing secondary cells (CG1652, CG1656) and main cells (CG11864) in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The extreme vacuolization and the lack of candidate Acps typically contributed by main and secondary cells suggest that loss of EcR affects both cell types and that EcR is necessary for normal functional male accessory glands in Drosophila.</p>

<title>Knockdown of EcR induces cell death in Drosophila male accessory glands</title>
<p>In Drosophila, down-regulation of EcR is known to induce cell death in prothoracic gland (PG) through apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref055">55</xref>]. In Drosophila, the regulation and execution of steroid induced apoptosis is dependent on the interplay between anti-apoptotic gene <italic>Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1</italic> (<italic>Diap1</italic>) and proapoptotic genes <italic>reaper (rpr)</italic>, <italic>head involution defective (hid)</italic> and <italic>grim</italic>, which activate a family of proteases known as caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref059">59</xref>]. Therefore, to test if EcR depletion is leading to cell death in male accessory glands in the present study, we immunostained these glands with cleaved Caspase 3 antibody, which detects active effector caspases (Drice and Dcp-1) in apoptotic cells and the activity of Caspase-9 like initiator caspase (Dronc) in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref060">60</xref>]. In controls, accessory glands had binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) with intact nuclei as reported above, and cleaved Caspase 3 labeling was non-detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8B &amp; 8C</xref>). In contrast, EcR-deficient male accessory glands had distorted nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8D</xref>) reminiscent of nuclear damage. In addition, these glands contained increased labeling of cleaved Caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8E &amp; 8F</xref>), suggesting apoptosis in these accessory glands. Taken together, these data indicate that EcR deficiency induces apoptosis in male accessory glands and this could explain the lack of functional products (Acps) in these glands. It is well known that inhibition of caspase activity and promotion of their degradation by Diap1 can suppress cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref062">62</xref>]. In addition, over-expression of Baculovirus P35 is known to rescue cells from undergoing apoptosis by interfering with the cell death pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref063">63</xref>]. Therefore, if the observed EcR knockdown fertility phenotype is a consequence of increased levels of apoptosis in accessory glands, one would expect the overexpression of Baculovirus P35 or the Diap1 in the EcR knockdown background to rescue the fertility. As predicted, we observed that overexpressing P35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8G</xref>) or Diap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8H</xref>) in the EcR knockdown background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8I</xref>) indeed rescued the fertility of these knockdown males. Unlike the EcR depleted glands, accessory glands from EcR knockdown males overexpressing P35 or Diap1were filled with secretions and morphologically comparable to the control gland (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Further, females mated to EcR knockdown males overexpressing P35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8G</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2260) or the anti-apoptotic Diap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g008">Fig 8H</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2055) had fertility at levels comparable to control.</p>

<title>The active receptor may be composed of EcR isoforms</title>
<p>In the present study, observations at the morphological, structural, transcriptional and biochemical levels demonstrate that EcR is necessary for the normal development/function of male accessory glands and that USP is not required for these functions in Drosophila. Interestingly, a similar paradigm was observed by Costantio <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref064">64</xref>] in the expression of genes encoding glue proteins in the salivary glands of Drosophila. Together, it appears that a novel EcR based receptor that does not contain USP plays critical role(s) in regulating the gene expression in the secretory tissues (such as accessory glands and salivary glands) of Drosophila. At this juncture, it is highly intriguing how these novel receptors regulate somatic (glue protein production by salivary glands) and sex-specific functions (male accessory gland development) and thus opens up future avenues for deciphering somatic, tissue specific and sex-specific regulatory networks underlying hormonal signaling in insects.</p>
<p>Nuclear receptors are known to function as dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref065">65</xref>] in transmitting the hormone signal. Therefore, two possible compositions exist for the active receptor in transmitting the hormonal signal to male accessory glands in Drosophila. First, EcR may complex with another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily in the accessory gland to transmit the hormonal signal. In this case, one would expect that silencing of such a nuclear receptor partner in the accessory glands leads to a phenotype of reduced fertility. However, the lack of significant fertility reduction in the present study with the RNAi of nuclear receptors other than EcR argues against the involvement of another member of nuclear receptor superfamily as a part of the active receptor at this tissue level. A second possibility is that EcR may form homodimers involving its isoforms. EcR encodes three isoforms, namely EcR-A, EcR-B1 and EcR-B2, with the conserved C-terminal ligand binding domain having transcriptional activation function and a variable N-terminal A/B domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref066">66</xref>]. To test the involvement of EcR isoforms, we analyzed reproductive parameters (fecundity, fertility, hatchability and sperm storage) and certain accessory gland parameters [morphology, secondary cell markers (Abd-B and ANCE) &amp; apoptosis (cleaved Caspase 3)] in males overexpressing the dominant negative forms of EcR-A (<italic>EcR-A</italic><sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup>), EcR-B1 (<italic>EcR-B1</italic><sup><italic>F645A</italic></sup>) or EcR-B2 (<italic>EcR-B2</italic><sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup>), in an accessory gland-specific manner. Interestingly, females mated to males overexpressing any of these dominant negative forms laid fewer eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and produced fewer progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) when compared to their controls while hatchability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) paralleled that of controls. Similarly, these mated females had significantly fewer sperm in their sperm storage organs, namely, spermathecae and seminal receptacle at 2h and 4 days ASM when compared to their controls. It was observed that although there is a significant difference in sperm storage in mates of all the three dominant negative forms, storage was more severely affected in females mated to males expressing EcR-A than those of EcR-B1 or EcR-B2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). Further, in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10A-a, 10A-c &amp; 10A-e</xref>), the reduction in the size of the accessory glands was quite noticeable with the overexpression of EcR-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10A-b</xref>) but not with the overexpression of EcR-B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10A-d</xref>) or EcR-B2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10A-f</xref>). In addition, both Abd-B and ANCE (the secondary cell specific candidates) were drastically reduced in EcR-A<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup> accessory glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Accessory glands from EcR-B1<sup><italic>F645A</italic></sup> or EcR-B2<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup> had marginally reduced Abd-B levels when compared to that in control while ANCE levels were comparable to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Similarly, cleaved Caspase 3 signals were detectable in all three as opposed to the control but the signal of cleaved Caspase 3 was relatively higher in EcR-A<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup> glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006788.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Consistent with this, cleaved Caspase 3 labeling was detectable in glands from all three isoforms but the intensity of labeling was higher (yet lower than that in the EcR knockdown) in EcR-A<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup> than in EcR-B1<sup><italic>F645A</italic></sup> or EcR-B2<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). These observations may point to a major role for EcR-A in the development of male accessory glands. However, at this juncture, it is important to note that individual overexpression of these isoforms does reduce male fertility, sperm storage and induce apoptosis in the gland but not to the same intensity as knockdown of all the isoforms (through EcR-miRNA or EcR-TRIP). In addition, none of the glands from EcR-A<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup>, EcR-B1<sup><italic>F645A</italic></sup> or EcR-B2<sup><italic>W650A</italic></sup> manifested the abnormal nuclear distribution/aggregation observed in glands (EcR-miRNA) lacking all three isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006788.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). Therefore, rather than one particular isoform, the active receptor may be a homodimer, probably involving all the isoforms of EcR. However, further studies are required to delineate the specific role each EcR isoform has in regulating male accessory gland development. Nonetheless, the above findings suggest that EcR, along with its all isoforms, is essential for male fertility in Drosophila.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>The accessory glands from the male reproductive tract were dissected in 0.7% saline and placed in 1X PBST (1X PBS with 0.3% Triton-X) until the end of all the dissections. Subsequently, PBST was replaced with 4% PFA (Paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS), and the tissues were incubated for 1h. The tissues were then washed with 0.3% PBST thrice, for 15 min each. The blocking solution (4% BSA in 0.1% PBST) was added, and tissues were incubated for 30 min. The primary antibodies for cleaved Caspase 3 (Asp175, 1:100, primary host-rabbit, cell signaling technology, USA) or α-Spectrin (3A9, 1:100, primary host-mouse, DSHB, USA) were added, and the tissues were incubated overnight at 4°C. Tissues were then washed thrice, for 15 min each with 0.3% PBST, and incubated in Alexa Fluor® 568 Goat Anti-Rabbit (Life technologies, USA) or Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat Anti-Mouse (Life technologies, USA), respectively, diluted in 0.1% PBST at 1:200 at room temperature for 2 h. Tissues were washed thrice, for 15 min each with 0.3% PBST and mounted on slides using mounting media containing DAPI (vectashield, vector laboratories, USA). The images were taken under a confocal microscope (TCS SPE, Leica, Germany), on DAPI (excitation wavelength 340-380nm), FITC (excitation wavelength 450-490nm) or TRITC (excitation wavelength 578-603nm) settings, depending upon the Alexa fluors used. Three independent batches with five replicates (accessory gland pairs)/batch were used for each group.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Protein samples were prepared from accessory glands dissected out of 3–5 days old knockdown or control males and were probed through western blotting. Briefly, four pairs of accessory glands were homogenized in 20μl of 2X SDS sample buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref077">77</xref>], boiled for five minutes and were loaded and resolved on 7.5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel for detection of Acps, ANCE, Abd-B or cleaved Caspase 3 while proteins were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for detection of EcR and USP. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Merck Life Science, Bangalore, India) using semi-dry transfer system (Amersham Biosciences, USA). The blots were probed with antibodies against EcR, [primary antibody: Anti-Ecdysone receptor antibody (ab35264, Abcam, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000; Secondary antibody: peroxidase affinipure rabbit anti-sheep at a dilution of 1:2000 (Jackson, USA)], USP [primary antibody: Anti-USP antibody (ab106341, Abcam, USA) at dilution 1;1000; Secondary antibody: Peroxidase–Affinipure Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 (Jackson, USA)], candidate seminal fluid proteins {Anti-Acp antibodies for Ovulin, SP, Acp36DE, CG1652, CG1656, CG17575, CG10586, Acp62F; Ravi Ram <italic>et al</italic>.

As a control for the loading, the blots were probed with anti-α-tubulin antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006788.ref075">75</xref>] or anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma, USA). The blots were developed with chemiluminescent agent (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo-Fisher, USA). An equal volume of the enhancer (luminol) was mixed with stable peroxide buffer (150μl each) and spread uniformly over the blot. The patterns were documented using Versa-doc Imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA). A minimum of two independent blots was used for antibody probing.</p>

<title>Fertility of females mated to EcR and USPdouble knockdown males.</title>
<p>We hypothesized that if USP were to be involved in male fertility, depletion of USP in EcR-TRiP background should further enhance the fertility phenotype of EcR-TRiP. To test if this is the case, we generated a double knockdown of USP as well as EcR by driving the expression of both USP-miRNA and EcR-TRiP (EcR-TRiP+USP-miRNA) through <italic>prd</italic>-GAL4 and analyzed the fertility of females mated to these males in comparison to those mated to EcR-TRiP knockdown males. In both groups, females mated to knockdown males (Knockdown) produced fewer progeny when compared to those mated to their genetically matched sibling controls (***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0007). However, the number of progeny produced over a period of 10 days by females mated to USP and EcR double knockdown males was comparable to that of EcR-TRiP knockdown mates (<italic>p</italic> = 0.2589). Values represented here are Mean±SEM involving at least 15–20 mated females per group and assays were repeated at least twice.

<title>Reproductive performance of EcR-TRiP control and knockdown males.</title>
<p>To assess the reproductive performance, we mated 3-5days old virgin females with control or knockdown males and assessed the number of eggs laid (A, Fecundity), number of progeny produced (B, Fertility) by mated females and the proportion of eggs reaching adulthood (% hatchability) over a period of 10 days ASM. Females mated to EcR-TRiP knockdown males laid significantly fewer eggs (*<italic>p</italic> = 0.03; N = 10–15). Similarly, females mated to knockdown males produced significantly fewer progeny (***<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007; N = 10–15) when compared to control. This reduction in progeny production is a consequence of reduced egg laying as well as significantly reduced hatchability of these laid eggs (**<italic>p</italic> = 0.002; N = 10–15) when compared to those of controls.</p>
