<abstract>
<p>One of the major mechanisms driving the evolution of all organisms is genomic rearrangement. In hyperthermophilic Archaea of the order <italic>Thermococcales</italic>, large chromosomal inversions occur so frequently that even closely related genomes are difficult to align. Clearly not resulting from the native homologous recombination machinery, the causative agent of these inversions has remained elusive. We present a model in which genomic inversions are catalyzed by the integrase enzyme encoded by a family of mobile genetic elements. We characterized the integrase from <italic>Thermococcus nautili</italic> plasmid pTN3 and showed that besides canonical site-specific reactions, it catalyzes low sequence specificity recombination reactions with the same outcome as homologous recombination events on DNA segments as short as 104bp both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in contrast to other known tyrosine recombinases. Through serial culturing, we showed that the integrase-mediated divergence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> strains occurs at an astonishing rate, with at least four large-scale genomic inversions appearing within 60 generations. Our results and the ubiquitous distribution of pTN3-like integrated elements suggest that a major mechanism of evolution of an entire order of Archaea results from the activity of a selfish mobile genetic element.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Mobile elements (MEs) such as viruses, plasmids and transposons infect most living organisms and often encode recombinases promoting their insertion into cellular genomes. These insertions alter the genome of their host according to two main mechanisms. First, MEs provide new functions to the cell by integrating their own genetic information into the DNA of the host, at one or more locations. Secondly, cellular homologous recombination will act upon multiple integrated copies and produce a variety of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. If such modifications are advantageous, they will spread into the population by natural selection. Typically, enzymes involved in cellular homologous recombination and the integration of MEs are distinct. We describe here a novel plasmid-encoded archaeal integrase which in addition to site-specific recombination can catalyze low sequence specificity recombination reactions akin to homologous recombination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Large-scale genomic rearrangements allow organisms to evolve much more rapidly than through random mutation alone. Rearrangements can result in the movement of genes within genomes, changes in coding strand use, loss of nonessential functions and the incorporation of foreign DNA. As a result, the organization, content and processing of genetic information can be deeply altered. In all three domains of life, chromosomal reorganization is mainly promoted by recombination between homologous sequences, for example between redundant ribosomal operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref002">2</xref>] or integrated copies of mobile elements (ME) such as prophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref004">4</xref>], transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref006">6</xref>] and insertion sequences (IS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref007">7</xref>]. Such recombination can result in the DNA inversions readily observed in closely related genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition to homologous recombination, chromosomes can undergo rearrangement through retrotransposon-associated non-homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref010">10</xref>]. Other elements like integrons confer rapid adaptation to bacteria in changing environments by shuffling cassette arrays encoding a variety of functions, a process involving a site-specific recombinase and two types of attachment sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref011">11</xref>]. Further genomic rearrangement/reorganization can occur through the acquisition of new genetic material, predominantly by lateral gene transfer. Such gene transfer occurs in all organisms through infection by mobile elements such as viruses or plasmids, or through the uptake of free or encapsulated DNA from the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref013">13</xref>]. Genomes can acquire novel genes in a fashion ranging from transient to permanent depending on the type of element and the physiological conditions of the host. When ME succeed in stably inserting their genome, the inserted DNA is then replicated as part of the host chromosome. The transactions between ME DNA and host genome are catalyzed by recombinases typically encoded by the elements themselves. These recombinases rank in different classes based on their enzymatic activity and the specificity of their DNA targets. The smallest ME are insertion sequences (IS) composed of a short DNA segment encoding only the enzymes involved in their transposition which can occur at many different genomic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref014">14</xref>]. The related transposons are larger DNA segments which can be transposed by two flanking IS and frequently carry additional genes such as antibiotic resistance determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref015">15</xref>]. The most frequent IS recombinases are DDE transposases which do not form covalent transposase-DNA intermediates during transposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref016">16</xref>]. Other and typically larger ME such as plasmids and viruses encode recombinases promoting DNA transactions with a stronger DNA sequence specificity. Such site-specific recombination is not only used for mobile element integration and excision in bacteria but also in the spread of antibiotic resistance by transposable elements, the control of plasmid copy number, regulation of gene expression and the resolution of concatenated chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref017">17</xref>]. Site-specific recombinases can be categorized into the serine recombinases and tyrosine recombinases (Y-recombinases); which, in contrast to DDE transposases, form covalent enzyme-DNA intermediates during recombination, albeit with markedly different mechanisms of action. Before religation of the two recombining DNA strands, serine recombinases generate breaks in all strands while Y-recombinases produce two sequential single-strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref017">17</xref>]. As a rule, site-specific integration/excision reactions promoted by Y-recombinases occur via a synaptic complex composed of two DNA duplexes carrying the specific sites bound by four recombinase protomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref017">17</xref>]. The two-recombinase pairs are activated sequentially, allowing one strand from each duplex to be exchanged at a time via two consecutive and symmetrical Holliday junctions. A notable exception is <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> phage CTX. Not only does this phage integrate into its host genome in single stranded form where two sites fold into a hairpin structure, mimicking a recombination target for the cellular XerCD chromosome resolvase; but also only requires XerC for integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>One of the best-studied Y-recombinases is the integrase of phage λ. The primary function of this enzyme is the integration of phage DNA into the chromosome of its bacterial host (and its excision). This function is achieved by promoting site-specific recombination between the phage attachment site <italic>attP</italic> and its chromosomal counterpart <italic>attB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref019">19</xref>]. Under particular circumstances, the integrase of the lambdoid phage HK022 is capable of generating inversions between <italic>attP</italic> and a secondary attachment site in the HK022 left operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref003">3</xref>]. Similarly, the primary function of the yeast FLP protein is the control of the 2μ plasmid copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref020">20</xref>] by DNA inversion between two divergent 34bp FRT sites located on the plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref021">21</xref>]. FLP recombinase activity has also been successfully used for integration and excision of synthetic DNA in mammalian genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref022">22</xref>]. The recombination activities of both λ integrase and FLP recombinase are summarized as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s004">S1 Fig</xref>. Historically, this reciprocal and conservative recombination between two stringently defined double-stranded DNA sequences in each chromosome was denominated the Campbell model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The sequences of a considerable number of Y-recombinases have been compared to reveal the position of conserved residues and infer the location of the catalytic active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref024">24</xref>]. They share in their C-terminal moiety a rather well conserved region of ~120 amino acids containing up to six nearly invariant amino acids R..K..HxxR..[W/H]..Y forming the active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref026">26</xref>]. A small number of Y-recombinases have been characterized biochemically in Archaea, for example the XerA recombinase of the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> which exhibits a perfect active site consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref027">27</xref>]. Sequence alignments have revealed that other archaeal active sites diverge slightly from the bacterial consensus R..HxxR..Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref028">28</xref>]. The integrases of viruses SSV1 isolated from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon <italic>Sulfolobus shibatae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref029">29</xref>] and SSV2 from <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref030">30</xref>] share the consensus R..KxxR..Y while the plasmidic integrase of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> sp. NOB8H2 displays R..YxxR..Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Mobile elements therefore contribute to genome evolution through both site-specific and homologous recombination, which usually operate by distinct mechanisms and enzymatic activities. Homologous recombination is also known to occur frequently between multiple IS copies resulting in large scale archaeal genomic rearrangements, as observed in both <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> e.g. <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref031">31</xref>] and <italic>Euryarchaota</italic> e.g. <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref032">32</xref>]. The distribution of archaeal ISs is patchy not only at the phylum level but also at genus level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref009">9</xref>]. Interestingly, genome shuffling occurs in <italic>Thermococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref033">33</xref>] even if ISs are seldom found in this genus suggesting that alternative recombination mechanisms are capable of producing large-scale genomic rearrangements.</p>
<p>If site-specific recombination only requires specific nucleotide sequences targeted by a dedicated recombinase, homologous recombination on the other hand is a much more complex process. In all organisms, homologous recombination constitutes one of several pathways to repair double-strand breaks. In addition to DNA synthesis, it requires dedicated recombinases and their accessory factors which act on stretches of near-sequence-identical DNA. In eukaryotic and bacterial cells, the enzymes and pathways involved in homologous recombination have been extensively studied (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref035">35</xref>] for reviews), whereas archaeal homologous recombination is still an active field of investigation. It is known that the initial resectioning step after double-strand break involves the Rad50–Mre11–HerA–NurA complex to generate 3’ single-strand substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref037">37</xref>]. The RecA paralog RadA and its accessory functions associate with this ssDNA to constitute the presynaptic filament, which will scan and pair with homologous sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref038">38</xref>]. In the archaeon <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic>, homologous recombination has been detected experimentally between stretches of identical DNA sequences equal to or greater than 500bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>To our knowledge, a direct overlap between site-specific and homologous recombination processes has not been described so far. In the present work, we report the discovery and characterization of a new integrase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon <italic>Thermococcus nautili</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref041">41</xref>] capable of catalyzing both site-specific recombination and low sequence specificity recombination reactions mimicking homologous recombination. The wide distribution of this particular Y-recombinase among the <italic>Thermococcus</italic> genus provides a valid rationale for the observed genomic rearrangements in these Archaea.</p>

Strikingly, comparison of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>onnurineus</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. sp. 4557 chromosomes by this approach revealed only two large inversions of 139/143Kb and 102/74Kb respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g001">Fig 1B &amp; 1C</xref>). This relatively small number of inversions facilitated the investigation of the synteny breakpoints bordering both inversions. Using the SyntTax web tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref042">42</xref>], a composite representation was obtained as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g001">Fig 1C</xref>. Gene order is conserved immediately upstream and downstream of each inversion border and was used to identify the synteny breakpoints. For each inversion, the breakpoints are located within tRNA gene pairs, transcribed in opposite orientations. Interestingly, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> plasmid pTN3 integrates in the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> gene BD01_0018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s005">S2 Fig</xref>) and this gene displays over 97% sequence identity with tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> (GQS_t10759), which borders a large chromosomal inversion between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>onnurineus</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. sp. 4557 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The concordance between the chromosomal attachment site of the pTN3 integrase (Int<sup>pTN3</sup>) and the recombination targets bordering each inversion (in opposite orientations) led us to define a working model to explain the formation of genomic inversions observed in the <italic>Thermococcus</italic> genus. We hypothesize that the frequent genomic inversions observed in the evolution of the <italic>Thermococcales</italic> order are a result of enzymatic activity of the integrase encoded by horizontally mobile elements, such as pTN3.</p>

<title>Int<sup>pTN3</sup> catalyzes low sequence specificity recombination reactions mimicking homologous recombination between any DNA sequence pairs</title>
<p>The absence of inter-pair DNA similarity observed in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> 60G and 66G chromosomal inversions prompted us to test whether Int<sup>pTN3</sup> could catalyze recombination between homologous non-archaeal sequences. The simplest experiment consisted of the incubation of cloning vector pBR322 DNA with the integrase in the same conditions as described above. This recombination reaction promoted by Int<sup>pTN3</sup> yielded a ladder of plasmid multimers produced by sequential integration, which could be readily observed by eletrophoretic migration whereas no homologous integration reaction was detected with the mutated Int<sup>pTN3</sup>Y428A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Surprisingly, Int<sup>pTN3</sup> generated also a double-strand cut at the pBR322 ColE1 origin of replication for which we have no explanation at this stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s013">S10 Fig</xref>). This cleavage does not constitute an intermediate step in the recombination reaction since none of Int<sup>pTN3</sup> linear substrates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g007">Fig 7</xref> carries the ColE1 origin. In addition to the homologous integration reaction, we investigated the capacity of Int<sup>pTN3</sup> to promote inversions between homologous sequences of bacterial origin. Short DNA segments of decreasing length (250, 175 and 100bp, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s014">S11 Fig</xref>) originating from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli lacZ</italic> gene were cloned in opposite orientations respective to the <italic>lacZα</italic> gene of pUC18 to generate plasmids pCB574, pCB571 and pCB558, respectively. These templates were linearized, incubated with Int<sup>pTN3</sup> and tested by subsequent restriction analysis. In each case, Int<sup>pTN3</sup> generated additional bands consistent with homologous inversion reactions displaying efficiencies proportional to the extent of DNA identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major mechanism producing chromosomal rearrangements is recombinational exchange between homologous sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref046">46</xref>]. These rearrangements often consist of DNA inversions between IS elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref047">47</xref>]. The observation that, in the <italic>Thermococcus</italic> genus, large chromosomal inversions occur even in the absence of IS elements prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanism behind these rearrangements. The presence of tRNA genes at recombination endpoints in genomes as diverse as plant chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref049">49</xref>] and <italic>Thermococcales</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref009">9</xref>], combined with the fact that integrases often target tRNA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref050">50</xref>], lead us to propose a precise molecular model involving Int<sup>pTN3</sup> to explain large-scale genomic rearrangements. Using a combination of comparative genomics, <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses, and serial culturing experiments, we uncovered a mechanism and enzymatic activity responsible for the shuffling-driven chromosomal evolution in <italic>Thermococcales</italic>. By means of deep comparative genomic analyses, we were able to correlate genome scrambling with the presence of a mobile element. This mobile element has been identified as plasmid pTN3, naturally present in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> both as an episome and integrated in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref043">43</xref>]. Plasmid pTN3 encodes the Int<sup>pTN3</sup> integrase of the Y-recombinase superfamily capable of promoting its site-specific plasmid integration at a tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> gene of its host. Due to perfect DNA conservation between <italic>attB</italic> and <italic>attP</italic> attachment sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s005">S2B Fig</xref>), an intact and presumably expressed tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> is reconstituted upon pTN3 chromosomal integration. We successfully reproduced, with high efficiency in a purified <italic>in vitro</italic> system, the canonical DNA reactions of integration and excision expected from a <italic>bona fide</italic> integrase. Site-specific mutation of the active site tyrosine to alanine abolished these activities. A positive excision reaction was also obtained <italic>in vivo</italic> by expressing wild-type Int<sup>pTN3</sup> and the catalytic tyrosine mutant Int<sup>pTN3</sup>Y428A in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>kodakarensis</italic> KOD1 cells. The genome of this strain carries the integrated episome TKV4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref045">45</xref>] which is remarkably similar to pTN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Surprisingly, both wild-type and mutant forms of the integrase excised TKV4 in circular form. This suggests that a truncated C-terminal Int<sup>TKV4</sup>, presumably impaired in DNA-binding but carrying the catalytic tyrosine, can complement Int<sup>pTN3</sup>Y428A. A plausible explanation invokes the participation of integrase dimers in the recombination reaction. In this case, only the heterodimeric form would possess an active catalytic site where Tyr428 is provided by the first monomer while the second monomer contributes the remaining conserved residues. This cleavage <italic>in trans</italic> was initially reported for the FLP recombinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref052">52</xref>]. Similarly, the complementation of activity between a DNA-binding impaired mutant and a catalytic tyrosine residue mutant has been described for another archaeal integrase, Int<sup>SSV1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

Each arrow corresponds to an individual gene numbered according to GenBank annotations. The consistent gene color code illustrates orthology across organisms while white color indicates its absence. As indicated by a blue dotted line, conservation of synteny is clearly visible on the right border and limited by the gene encoding pTN3 C-ter integrase and its remnants. Truncated N-terminal-encoding integrase genes constitute pseudogenes lacking a stop codon and are therefore not annotated. Genetic divergence appears stronger on the left border.</p>

<p>The peculiar location of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> GQS_t10759 at the exact border of a large DNA inversion observed between the genomes of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>onnurineus</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. sp. 4557 suggested that this inversion could have occurred by the recombinase activity of Int<sup>pTN3</sup>. In our purified system, we could obtain highly efficient DNA inversions between two inverted copies of GQS_t10759. Paradoxically, we were unable to promote inversion between tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> GQS_t10759 and tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> GQS_t10745 contrary to what the genomic comparisons between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>onnurineus</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. sp. 4557 suggested. An experiment of prolonged <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> cultivation was instrumental in elucidating the large-scale inversion mechanism in <italic>Thermococcus</italic>. The strain carrying its natural plasmids was cultivated during 60 or 66 generations; total DNA was extracted from this population and sequenced in a manner similar to a metagenome. We observed the high incidence in the resulting populations of a particular recombined genome with four large chromosomal inversions and a very low copy number of plasmid pTN3 encoding active Int<sup>pTN3</sup> (&lt; 2/chromosome) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s003">S3 Table</xref>). This plasmid loss could have contributed to the higher fitness and spread of a particular clone in the population. The four large-scale inversions occurred between four pairs of naturally occurring paralogous genes sharing at least 104bp of sequence identity in inverted orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s011">S8 Fig</xref>). No significant sequence conservation could be detected between the four pairs. We did not observe chromosomal rearrangements after prolonged incubation of <italic>Thermococcus</italic> sp. 5–4, which does not carry plasmids. The potential causal link between pTN3 and a number of unrelated sequence pairs involved in large scale genomic shuffling in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> was difficult to conciliate with the classical site-specific recombination properties we described for Int<sup>pTN3</sup>. Remarkably, by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with this integrase, we succeeded in producing inversions between several pairs of inverted paralogous genes detected in our <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> sub-culturing experiments. These results suggested that the recombination properties of Int<sup>pTN3</sup> could be extended to virtually any homologous pair of DNA sequences. Using exogenous pBR322 plasmid DNA or genes segments from bacterial origin, we demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that Int<sup>pTN3</sup> actively promotes low sequence specificity reactions mimicking homologous integration and inversion of any sequence pair as short as 100bp. The catalytic site mutation in variant Int<sup>pTN3</sup>Y428A abolishes this particular recombination reaction as well. Interestingly, cellular homologous recombination in Archaea operates according to a different pathway with dedicated enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref037">37</xref>] and in <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> has only been reported between DNA segments of 500bp or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>These reactions unveiled a specific Int<sup>pTN3</sup>-generated double-strand cut at the ColE1 origin of replication carried by pBR322 and its derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s013">S10 Fig</xref>). At this moment, we do not have a precise rationale to explain this observation other than a potential distant secondary structure similarity between the small RNAI and RNAII encoded by the ColE1 origin and the tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> encoded by Int<sup>pTN3</sup> <italic>attB</italic> substrate. Biological interactions between tRNAs and ColE1 RNAs have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref053">53</xref>]. Clearly, this double-strand cleavage does not participate in any recombination reaction since we demonstrated all <italic>in vitro</italic> Int<sup>pTN3</sup> inversions on linear DNA segments devoid of ColE1 origin.</p>
<p>The positive <italic>in vitro</italic> Int<sup>pTN3</sup>-promoted low sequence specificity recombination results explain the failure of this enzyme to promote inversion between tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> GQS_t10759 and tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> GQS_t10745. These sites were initially thought to constitute inversion endpoints between the genomes of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>onnurineus</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. sp. 4557 but do not share sufficient sequence similarity to be efficiently recombined <italic>in vitro</italic>. The particular positioning of these sequences in opposite orientations could have occurred through previous overlapping inversions between a different set of paralogs or by less frequent native homologous recombination. We observed a similar situation in the sequence of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> 60G and 66G populations. In several cases, homologous segments were in direct orientation in the original genome but became opposed due to a previous overlapping inversion therefore indicating that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> 60G and 66G inversions occurred sequentially.</p>
<p>In order to investigate whether pTN3 could account for large-scale rearrangements in the <italic>Thermococcus</italic> genus, we examined by synteny analysis the distribution of pTN3-like integrated element among completely sequenced <italic>Thermococcales</italic>. Out of 17 sequenced <italic>Thermococcus</italic>, and in addition to the previously reported <italic>T</italic>. <italic>kodakarensis</italic> TKV4 element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref045">45</xref>], five isolates were found to harbor a pTN3-related element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006847.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The natural competence for DNA uptake of some <italic>Thermococcales</italic> such as <italic>T</italic>. <italic>kodakarensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref039">39</xref>] and the capacity of pTN3 to be transferred between cells using membrane vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref043">43</xref>] could explain the ubiquitous presence of this mobile element.</p>
<p>Protein sequence and structural comparisons between Int<sup>pTN3</sup> and other hyperthermophilic archaeal integrases such as that of crenarchaeal virus SSV1 indicate that these proteins are clearly related. However, Int<sup>pTN3</sup> possesses several additional interspersed domains relative to SSV1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s005">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006847.s015">S12</xref> Figs). We surmise that these additional domains contribute to the low sequence specificity recombination reactions akin to homologous recombination events that we have observed.</p>
<p>By summing up all direct and indirect evidence reported here, it is very likely that the integrase encoded by pTN3-like plasmids can account for the genomic shuffling observed in the <italic>Thermococcus</italic> genus. Plasmids of the pTN3 class are genetically closely related to viruses as they encode a capsid protein and a DNA packaging ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref043">43</xref>] but pTN3 virions have not be observed to date. It is not clear at this stage whether plasmids or viruses equipped with an Int<sup>pTN3</sup>-like integrase have a better fitness either due to provirus maintenance or by virion spreading. An integrase mimicking homologous recombination could promote viral integration into the host genome only if both viral and cellular chromosomes share significant DNA similarity. This enzyme however, could facilitate integration of a virus into the genome of a closely related provirus.</p>
<p>The question arises whether an enzyme promoting genome shuffling using very short repeated segments as substrates, would be beneficial for a cellular organism. On one hand, ‘wrongly’ recombined genomes would result in suboptimal gene expression programs and cells carrying scrambled genomes would display a reduced fitness and clearly be counter-selected in the population. Interestingly, the presence of a pTN3-specific spacer in a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> CRISPR locus strongly suggests that the presence of this plasmid is deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref041">41</xref>]. On the other hand, it is also possible to envision situations where high-level genome shuffling by inversion could be advantageous. Alternate gene expression patterns could increase, for instance, adaptation to rapid environmental changes. In addition, for organisms such as <italic>Thermococcales</italic> where highly-expressed essential housekeeping genes maintain invariable positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref033">33</xref>], genome scrambling could be beneficial by relocating “less desirable” integrated elements to chromosomal areas of reduced gene expression, therefore minimizing their impact on cellular physiology.</p>

To construct pCB538, a fragment containing KmR and the beginning of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene (lac100) was PCR-amplified from pUC4K with the primers LacZ100-Sac1-For and KanR-Xba1-Rev containing the restriction sites for SacI and XbaI, respectively, at the 5’ end. The adequately digested fragment was then ligated into a SacI-XbaI digested pUC18. For plasmids pCB572 and pCB574, part of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene was amplified from pUC18 and the KmR gene sequence was amplified from plasmid pUC4K. The two fragments were then assembled into the EcoRI digested pUC18. Purified plasmids pCB548, pCB552, were digested using ScaI and EcoRI and plasmids pCB572 and pCB574 were digested using ScaI. The fragments containing the non <italic>att</italic>-sites were then gel purified using the kit NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey Nagel).

<title><italic>In vitro/in vivo</italic> integrase enzymatic assay</title>
<p>Standard <italic>in vitro</italic> integrase assays were performed as follows: 165ng (8.25ng/μL, 3.1pmol) purified Int<sup>pTN3</sup> and 0.5μg (25ng/μL, 10pmol) supercoiled plasmid substrates were incubated 30 min at 65°C in a reaction buffer containing 300mM KCl, 27 mM Tris HCl pH8, 0.17mM DTT and 1mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Depending on the size of the plasmid substrate, the DNA/integrase molar ratio varied from 30 to 60. For substrates with non-<italic>att</italic> sites, the integrase concentration was increased up to 50pmol. To assay dimer formation, the reaction products were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. For the excision and inversion assays, reaction products were purified with the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (Thermo Scientific) prior to eletrophoretic separation. <italic>In vitro</italic> circularization of TKV4 was performed in a standard integrase assay with genomic DNA of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>kodakarensis</italic> isolated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006847.ref060">60</xref>].

The precise regions corresponding to both tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> genes are boxed in black. DNA segments cloned in pCB548 indicated by green blocks refer to BD01_1557-related sequences while red blocks correspond to BD01_1976-related sequences. The BD01-1976 nucleotide highlighted in black corrects a sequencing error in the original <italic>T</italic>. <italic>nautili</italic> genome sequence.
