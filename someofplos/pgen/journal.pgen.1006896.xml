<abstract>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs, which direct post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and function in a vast range of biological events including cancer development. Most miRNAs pair to the target sites through seed region near the 5’ end, leading to mRNA cleavage and/or translation repression. Here, we demonstrated a miRNA-induced dual regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) via seed region and non-seed region, consequently inhibited tumor growth of NSCLC. We identified miR-1254 as a negative regulator inhibiting HO-1 translation by directly targeting HO-1 3’UTR via its seed region, and suppressing HO-1 transcription via non-seed region-dependent inhibition of transcriptional factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A), a transcriptional activator of HO-1. MiR-1254 induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells by inhibiting the expression of HO-1, consequently suppressed NSCLC cell growth. Consistently with the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, mouse xenograft studies validated that miR-1254 suppressed NSCLC tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we found that HO-1 expression was inversely correlated with miR-1254 level in human NSCLC tumor samples and cell lines. Overall, these findings identify the dual inhibition of HO-1 by miR-1254 as a novel functional mechanism of miRNA, which results in a more effective inhibition of oncogenic mRNA, and leads to a tumor suppressive effect.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that miRNAs bind to 3`UTR of target mRNAs and direct post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) via its seed sequence. Here we report a new dual regulatory mechanism of miRNA. We described that miR-1254 repressed HO-1 at post-transcriptional level by directly targeting HO-1 3’UTR via its seed sequence and also inhibited HO-1 transcription by suppressing the transcriptional factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) via its non-seed sequence. MiR-1254 induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells by inhibiting the expression of HO-1, consequently suppressed NSCLC cell growth. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse xenograft studies also supported the inhibitory effect of miR-1254 on NSCLC growth. These findings identify the dual regulation of miR-1254 on HO-1 as a novel functional mechanism of miRNA, which results in a more effective inhibition on the oncogenic mRNA, and leads to a suppressive effect on NSCLC growth, thus significantly advance our understanding of miRNA-directed gene regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs, which direct post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and play important regulatory roles in a vast range of cellular processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref003">3</xref>]. Aberrant expression of miRNAs may play an important role in tumorigenesis or cancer development through dysregulation of tumor-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref009">9</xref>]. It is generally accepted that miRNA binds to 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) of target mRNAs via its seed sequence (position 2–8), resulting in degradation or translational repression of the target mRNA in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>For a majority of miRNAs, as few as 6nt of the seed sequence matching with the target mRNA is required for functional interaction. However, besides the canonical interaction between seed region of miRNA and the 3’-UTR of target mRNA, more and more evidence show that non-canonical miRNA-target sites can be functional as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref013">13</xref>]. For example, imperfect matches of miRNA seed region with the target can be compensated by supplemental components in near-perfect sites and function in target cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref016">16</xref>]. Studies in mouse brain shows that only 73% of the Ago-mRNA interactions can be explained by seed matches for Ago-bound miRNAs, while the rest 27% have no predicted seed matches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref018">18</xref>]. Regions outside the seed sequence may also be necessary or sufficient to direct different non-canonical regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref011">11</xref>]. For example, functional “centered sites” in miRNA which have 11–12 continuous Watson–Crick pairs complementary to the target mRNA were identified by analyzing microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref019">19</xref>]. Subsequent study demonstrated that 11-mer matches of miRNA “centered sites” to the target mRNA with single mismatches or GU wobbles also form hybrids but only a small proportion leads to a repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref020">20</xref>], which indicates additional mechanism besides sequence complementarity may also be necessary.</p>
<p>The most classical function of miRNA is to induce post-transcriptional gene silencing, through either mRNA cleavage and/or translational repression. The function of miRNA has been extended to transcriptional levels, either directly or indirectly. Several studies demonstrate sequence complementarity between miRNA and target gene promoter lead to gene silencing at transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref027">27</xref>]. MiR-552 is found with a dual inhibition on CYP2E1 expression, targeting both CYP2E1 promoter via its non-seed sequence and CYP2E1 mRNA 3`UTR region via its seed sequence, respectively. It consequently induces a dual inhibition of the target mRNA at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which represents a model of effective gene regulation by miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref028">28</xref>]. Here, during our study of miRNAs regulating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, we found another type of “dual regulation” including indirect transcriptional silencing and direct post-transcriptional inhibition.</p>
<p>HO-1 is a rate-limiting enzyme that metabolizes heme to generate carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron, and biliverdin; biliverdin is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref030">30</xref>]. Although the physiological HO-1 expression is only found in normal liver and spleen, HO-1 is highly induced in different types of tumors, including melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref031">31</xref>], glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref032">32</xref>], pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref033">33</xref>], prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref034">34</xref>] and non-small-cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref035">35</xref>]. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that HO-1 modulated tumor growth by regulating apoptosis and cell cycle, stimulating angiogenesis, and inhibiting or terminating inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref037">37</xref>]. Here we report that miR-1254 is a miRNA which down-regulated HO-1 via two distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, miR-1254 directly targets HO-1 via its seed sequence and represses HO-1 expression at post-transcriptional level. On the other hand, miR-1254 targets transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) which is a transcriptional activator of HO-1, via its non-seed sequence, and consequently represses HO-1 expression at transcriptional level. MiR-1254 induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells by inhibiting the expression of HO-1, consequently suppresses NSCLC cell growth. HO-1 expression is inversely correlated with miR-1254 level in human NSCLC tumor samples and cell lines. Collectively, these findings identify the dual inhibition of HO-1 through miR-1254 as a novel functional mechanism of miRNA, which results in a more effective inhibition of oncogenic mRNA, and leads to a tumor suppressive effect.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics and experimental screening identify miR-1254 as a negative regulator of HO-1</title>
<p>HO-1 over-expression has been reported to be involved in tumor growth and malignant progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref035">35</xref>], previous study from our laboratory has demonstrated that HO-1 is down-regulated by miR-1304 in lung cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref037">37</xref>]. In order to find more effective miRNAs, we explored the miRNAs that potentially bind to the 3’UTR of HO-1 using bioinformatics tools. Twenty-six miRNAs were predicted to target HO-1 using all three databases (TargetScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref038">38</xref>], miRanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref039">39</xref>] and PITA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref010">10</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left). To confirm whether these miRNAs target the 3`UTR of HO-1, we constructed a dual luciferase reporter (psi-HO1) by cloning human HO-1 3`UTR into the psiCHECK2 vector. Through co-transfection of 26 miRNAs individually with psi-HO1 reporter into HEK293 cells, we found that 11 miRNAs potently reduced the luciferase activity of psi-HO1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right), indicating that these miRNAs potentially targeting HO-1 3`UTR and inhibiting HO-1 expression. To corroborate this finding, we transfected these miRNAs into human NSCLC A549 cells, western blot assays showed that miR-1254 had the strongest and most stable inhibitory effect on HO-1 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We transfected different doses of miR-1254 into A549 cells, and found that miR-1254 suppressed HO-1 expression at both protein and mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, the inhibition at mRNA and protein levels were not perfectly consistent, in low doses of miR-1254 (0.5~1nM), the inhibition at mRNA level is stronger than protein level, while in higher doses of miR-1254 (6~12.5nM), more dramatic inhibition was found at protein level, these results indicated that the suppression of HO-1 at mRNA and protein levels was probably achieved through different mechanisms. As a miRNA with the most dramatic inhibitory effects on HO-1 protein expression, and potentially functioning through multiple mechanisms, miR-1254 attracted our further interest.</p>

<title>Both over-expressed and endogenous miR-1254 inhibit HO-1 expression in human NSCLC cells at both mRNA and protein levels</title>
<p>We next sought to study the regulation of HO-1 expression by miR-1254 at both mRNA and protein levels in lung cancer cell lines. Human NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1975 cells were transfected with miR-1254 mimics for 48 hours, and then the expression levels of mature miR-1254, HO-1 protein and mRNA were examined. Taqman microRNA assay confirmed that miR-1254 mimics were successfully transfected into the cells and the level of mature miR-1254 was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, top). Consequently, the mRNA and protein levels of HO-1 were down-regulated in the cells transfected with miR-1254 mimics compared to that with the negative control oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2A</xref> bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">2B and 2C</xref>). We induced the expression of HO-1 in miR-1254-transfected and non-transfected cells via treatment with 20 μmol/L hemin, which is previously described as a HO-1 inducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref040">40</xref>]. In the presence of hemin, we found that HO-1 expression was greatly increased, and transfection of miR-1254 mimics inhibited the expression of induced HO-1 as well, to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-1254 mimics inhibited the expression of HO-1 in lung cancer cells. We subsequently explored whether the endogenous miR-1254 in NSCLC cells functions in the maintenance of HO-1 expression. MiR-1254 specific antisense oligonucleotides (Anti-1254) were used to down-regulate the level of endogenous miR-1254. Our results showed that the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, left and middle) and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, right) levels of HO-1 were up-regulated in A549 and NCI-H1975 lung cancer cells transfected with Anti-1254, compared to that with the negative control antisense oligonucleotides. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9 method was used to delete the genomic sequence of miR-1254 and further determine the endogenous relationship between miR-1254 and HO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). The results showed that deletion of miR-1254 genomic sequence by CRISPR/Cas9 diminished endogenous miR-1254 level in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). We established miR-1254 +/- and miR-1254 -/- cell lines derived from single clones, and examined HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in wild-type (WT), miR-1254 +/- and miR-1254 -/- cells. As expected, the expression of HO-1 at both mRNA and protein levels are negatively correlated with the level of miR-1254 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Taken together, all these results suggest that both overexpressed and endogenous miR-1254 inhibit the expression of HO-1.</p>

<title>Inhibition of HO-1 at protein but not mRNA levels were dependent on miR-1254 seed sequence through post-transcriptional gene silencing</title>
<p>Since miRNAs usually direct post-transcriptional gene silencing through seed sequence binding to the 3’-UTR region of the target mRNA, we investigated the post-transcriptional effects of miR-1254 on HO-1. Predicted by TargetScan, miR-1254 seed region was complementary to the sequences from 1166–1172 in 3′UTR of HO-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We generated dual luciferase reporter constructs containing wild type or mutant HO-1 3’UTR with mutations in miR-1254 potential binding site. Co-transfection of the wild type reporter with miR-1254 mimics resulted in a decrease of the luciferase activity in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, lane1 and 2). As expected, the effect of miR-1254 mimics on luciferase activity was abolished in cells co-transfected with the reporter containing mutation in its binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We further examined the mRNA and protein levels of HO-1 in A549 cells transfected with either miR-1254 or its seed sequence mutant (5`mt). Intriguingly, miR-1254-induced inhibition of HO-1 at mRNA level was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and the inhibition at protein level was only partly abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) upon transfection with 5`mt in A549 cells.</p>

<p>Given that miR-1254 reduced HO-1 mRNA level in A549 and NCI-H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), we determined HO-1 mRNA half-life to preclude the contribution of miR-1254 on HO-1 mRNA stability. A549 and NCI-H1975 cells were transiently transfected with miR-1254 and control oligonucleotides (nc), and after 4 hours, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, which is an established inhibitor of mRNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref042">42</xref>], for different times. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, the half-life of HO-1 mRNA in A549 or NCI-H1975 cells transfected with miR-1254 was unaffected compared to the control cells, suggesting that miR-1254 did not affect HO-1 mRNA stability. This indicates that the inhibition of HO-1 at mRNA level is independent on the seed region of miR-1254, and provides further evidence to support our hypothesis that miR-1254 suppresses HO-1 expression through multiple mechanisms.</p>

<title>MiR-1254 suppresses HO-1 transcription via its non-seed region</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that whether miR-1254 suppresses HO-1 at the transcriptional level, first, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in A549 cells to examine the binding of RNA polymerase Ⅱ (pol-Ⅱ) on HO-1 promoter, and found that pol-Ⅱ but not an IgG control enrichment on HO-1 promoter fragment was reduced by miR-1254 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Second, we constructed a HO-1 promoter (PGL-HO1) reporter by cloning a ∼1.5 kb human HO-1 promoter into the firefly luciferase vector PGL4.10, and we found that expressing miR-1254 greatly inhibited the luciferase activity of the reporter in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, lane1 and 2). These findings suggest that miR-1254 represses HO-1 at transcriptional level. Moreover, mutation in miR-1254 seed region did not abolish the inhibition on the luciferase activity of the reporter, which indicated the transcriptional regulation functioned through the non-seed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, lane 3). We designed different mutants of miR-1254 with mutations in non-seed region, and transfected them into HEK293 cells separately. As shown in the results, the mid region mutant mmt-6 (mmt) and the 3`region mutant 3mt-5 (3’mt) eliminated the inhibition of miR-1254 on HO-1 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s001">S1A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, left, lane4 and 5). So we choose the mmt and 3’mt mutants in the following studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). We examined the effect of miR-1254 non-seed region mutation (mmt and 3mt) on HO-1 mRNA in A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) and NCI-H1975 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, left) cells using qRT-PCR. Consistently with dual luciferase report assay, both mmt and 3mt abolished the inhibitory effects on HO-1 mRNA expression. These results suggest that miR-1254 inhibits HO-1 transcription via its non-seed sequence, while the seed region is additionally responsible for the inhibition at post-transcription level, which may consequently induces a dual inhibition of HO-1.</p>

<title>MiR-1254 inhibits HO-1 transcription by targeting TFAP2A</title>
<p>The novelty of miR-1254 non seed region induced transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) on HO-1 inspired us to explore the exact functional mechanism of its non-seed sequence. Our laboratory has reported that miR-552 binds to CYP2E1 promoter region via its non-seed sequence and induces TGS of CYP2E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref028">28</xref>]. We analyzed the sequence alignment of miR-1254 with HO-1 promoter using miRBase database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref039">39</xref>] and RNA hybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref043">43</xref>], there were 6 potential binding sites in the fragment within 1.5kb upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, top). Non-denaturing PAGE experiment was performed to test the binding ability of miR-1254 with these 6 sites in vitro, and data showed that site 2 had the highest possibility to form hybrids with miR-1254 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, bottom). Next we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout site 2 in HO-1 promoter, however, the inhibition of miR-1254 on HO-1 mRNA level was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that site 2 is not the functionally targeting motif in HO-1 promoter. Subsequently, we cloned 6 fragments of HO-1 promoter with varying length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) into the firefly luciferase vector PGL4.10 and individually co-expressed with miR-1254 in HEK293 cells. Data showed that expressing miR-1254 greatly inhibited the luciferase activity of the reporter containing the shortest fragment 1(only 150 bp upstream from TSS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). However, when we mutated both of the two potential binding sites in the fragment based on sequence alignment, the inhibition of miR-1254 on HO-1 promoter was not abolished (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Altogether, the results suggested that miR-1254 might not suppress HO-1 transcription via directly targeting HO-1 promoter.</p>
<p>Previous study showed that miRNAs can also induced DNA methylation and consequently induced transcription inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref045">45</xref>]. We tested this possibility by treating A549 cells with 1μM Decitabine, a DNA demethylation drug for 48 h, after transfection with miR-1254. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s003">S3D Fig</xref>, DNA methylation was abolished, however, the inhibitory effect of miR-1254 on HO-1 transcription still existed.</p>
<p>After excluding the possible mechanisms that miR-1254 directly targets HO-1 promoter or induces DNA methylation of HO-1 CpG islands we hypothesized that miR-1254 inhibits the transcription factors of HO-1 and consequently induces TGS. Plenty of regulatory elements have been identified in the promoter region of HO-1, targeted by transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref047">47</xref>], activating protein-1 (AP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref048">48</xref>], up-stream stimulatory factor (USF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref049">49</xref>], nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and transcription factor AP-2(TFAP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref050">50</xref>]. Since expressing miR-1254 inhibits the luciferase activity of the reporter containing the shortest fragment 1(only 150 bp upstream from TSS), and mutation of the binding sites on HO-1 promoter did not abolish the inhibitory effects, it’s possible that miR-1254 inhibit HO-1 transcription through targeting transcriptional factors. Predicted by TRANSFAC, TFAP2A and USF1 binding sites can be searched in this region. However, binding sites of NFκB, Nrf2 or AP-1 could not. Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding sites of NFκB are near to the binding sites of TFAP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref050">50</xref>], so we examined the expression of NFκB as well as TFAP2A and USF1. The results showed that TFAP2A but not USF1 or NF-κB was inhibited by miR-1254 and the inhibition effect were abolished by miR-1254 non-seed region mutants (mmt or 3mt), but not by seed region mutant (5mt), which indicated that TFAP2A may be involved in miR-1254-induced HO-1 TGS in A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and NCI-H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, right). RNA interference knockdown of TFAP2A (si-TFAP2A) potently reduced the HO-1 promoter luciferase reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, left). To further study the role of TFAP2A in miR-1254 regulation of HO-1, we cloned the coding sequence of TFAP2A into pTT5 vector (pTT5-TFAP2A) and then co-transfected it with PGL-HO1 into HEK293 cells. As shown in the data, the PGL-HO1 luciferase activity was substantially increased by the co-transfection with pTT5-TFAP2A in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, right). We confirmed these results in A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and NCI-H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s004">S4B Fig</xref>) with TFAP2A knocked down using chemically synthesized siRNA against TFAP2A (si-TFAP2A), the results consistently showed that HO-1 protein expression was decreased by si-TFAP2A. These results suggest that TFAP2A is a major transcription factor that functions in HO-1 activation in these cells.</p>

<p>Then, we examined the changes at mRNA and protein levels in A549 cells with CRIPSR/Cas9-modified miR-1254 knockdown. The results showed that the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) expression levels of TFAF2A were dramatically increased in a dose-dependent manner in miR-1254-knockdown cells, but not the other two transcription factors of USF1 and NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), consistently with the changes of HO-1 expression at mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g002">Fig 2G</xref>).

MiR-1254 mmt basically lost the inhibition on TFAF2A and HO-1 protein expression, while miR-1254 5mt maintained the inhibitory function on TFAP2A, and partially attenuated the protein reduction of HO-1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s004">S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm whether miR-1254 inhibits HO-1 mRNA expression through down-regulating TFAF2A, we co-transfected miR-1254 mimics with pTT5-TFAP2A into A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4G</xref>) and NCI-H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), the results showed that over-expression of TFAP2A rescued miR-1254-induced inhibition on HO-1 expression. We further performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in A549 cells, and found that the enrichment of TFAP2A but not an IgG control on HO-1 promoter fragment was reduced by miR-1254, consistently with the enrichment results of polymerase Ⅱ (pol-Ⅱ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Collectively, these findings support that TFAP2A is a transcriptional activator for HO-1 in NSCLC cells and miR-1254 represses HO-1 transcription through targeting TFAP2A.</p>

<title>MiR-1254 targets TFAP2A 3`UTR via its non-seed sequence</title>
<p>Our results suggested miR-1254 directs TGS of HO-1 expression via targeting the transcriptional activator TFAP2A, possibly through its non-seed region. We then elucidated the regulatory mechanism through which miR-1254 suppressed TFAP2A expression. We cloned 3`UTR of TFAP2A into the luciferase reporter psi-CHECK2 (psi-TFAP2A) and co-transfected with miR-1254 mimics or its mutants with mutation in different regions into HEK293cells. Consistent with the results on HO-1 mRNA expression, the luciferase activity of psi-TFAF2A was inhibited by miR-1254, and the inhibitory effect was abolished by miR-1254 non-seed region mutants (mmt or 3mt) but not seed region mutant (5mt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Then, we analyzed the sequence alignment of miR-1254 with TFAP2A 3`UTR. Predicted by RNA hybrid, miR-1254 non-seed region was complementary to the sequence in 3′UTR of TFAP2A mRNA (from 264–257) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). When mutations were introduced into the 8 nt sequence in TFAP2A mRNA 3’-UTR complementary to non-seed sequence of miR-1254, miR-1254 could not suppress the activity of the mutant reporter any longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Moreover, mutations were also introduced in seed and non-seed region of miR-1254 (5’mt, mut), qRT- PCR was performed to test their effects on HO-1 in A549 cells. As shown in the results, mRNA expression of TFAP2A was rescued when miR-1254 non-seed region were mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>

These results suggest that miR-1254 binds to TFAP2A 3`UTR via its non-seed sequence through an 8 nt-contiguous Watson–Crick pairs and miR-1254 represses HO-1 expression at post-transcriptional level by directly targeting HO-1 3’UTR via its seed sequence. Altogether, we found that miR-1254 suppresses HO-1 expression at mRNA and protein levels through different mechanisms, and dependent on different regions.</p>

<title>MiR-1254 suppresses cell growth of NSCLC cells through HO-1 by inducing cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis</title>
<p>As described previously, it has been found that HO-1 plays a vital role in promoting cell survival in several types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref035">35</xref>]. It is highly possible that miR-1254 regulates human lung cancer cell growth through modulating the expression of HO-1. In order to investigate the effects of miR-1254 on lung cancer cell growth, miR-1254 mimics were transfected into A549 and NCI-H1975 cells. Trypan blue staining showed that miR-1254 over-expression for 3 days markedly decreased the number of A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and NCI-H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). MTT assay was used to examine the effects of miR-1254 on cell viability.

In the colony formation assay, transfection with miR-1254 mimics inhibited the colony-forming activity of both A549 and NCI-H1975 cells, while transfection with negative control oligonucleotides has no such effects (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s005">S5C</xref>).

Trypan blue staining, MTT assay and colony formation assay revealed that the decrease of cell viability due to miR-1254 transfection could be rescued by inducing HO-1 expression with hemin chloride in A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref>) and NCI-H1975 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s005">S5A–S5C Fig</xref>) cells.

<p>To explore the precise path by which miR-1254 reduced the NSCLC cell number, we cloned the coding sequence of HO-1 into pTT5 vector (pTT5-HO1). The plasmids were transfected into NSCLC cells to overexpress HO-1 and test the rescue effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. Western blot analysis of HO-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicated that miR-1254 over-expression in A549 cells reduced cell proliferation, as expected, the restoration of HO-1 expression strongly overrode the repression effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Flow cytometry combining with PI staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay were used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis, respectively. The results showed that enforced miR-1254 expression led to more than 10% S phase cell cycle arrest and a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells. Consistently, HO-1 re-expression attenuated miR-1254-induced S phase cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>) and NCI-H1975 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s005">S5D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006896.s005">S5E Fig</xref>).

<title>HO-1 expression is inversely correlated with miR-1254 expression in human NSCLC tumor samples and cell lines</title>
<p>We examined the HO-1 mRNA level in 34 paired frozen NSCLC tumor samples and normal lung tissue specimens.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In general, miRNAs bind to 3`UTR of target mRNAs and direct PTGS via its seed sequence, however, we and other groups demonstrated that miRNAs can also function through its non-seed sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref028">28</xref>]. For example, 11–12 nt Watson–Crick paring between the center of the miRNA and the “centered sites” in target was proved to be functional in target suppression. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref020">20</xref>]. Our results suggest that miR-1254 binds to TFAP2A 3`UTR via its non-seed sequence through 8 contiguous Watson–Crick pairs effectively inhibits TFAF2A and its target gene HO- 1 expression. When we screened the miRNAs which potentially target HO-1 3’-UTR, which indicated the effect of post-transcriptional gene regulation, miR-1254 was not the one which has the most dramatic effect on HO-1 3’-UTR luciferase reporter, however, miR-1254 is the one which suppresses HO-1 protein expression most effectively, which also indicates a transcriptional inhibition in addition to the post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our data showed that HO-1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-1254 at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels via its non-seed sequence and seed sequence, with indirect and direct mechanisms, respectively. The dual inhibition of miR-1254 we found here may represent a novel regulatory mechanism of miRNA, which results in a stronger and more stable suppression on target gene expression.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that miR-1254 expression is dysregulated in human breast cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref051">51</xref>], retinoblastoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref052">52</xref>] and NSCLC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref054">54</xref>]. MiR-1254 was identified as a circulating miRNA downregulated in NSCLC patient serum, compared with healthy control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref054">54</xref>]. However, in another study, miR-1254 was detected upregulated in early-stage NSCLC tumor samples, and is considered as a candidate for serum-based biomarker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref053">53</xref>]. Those studies suggested that miR-1254 might be involved in tumor progression, but the exact function is largely unknown. As miR-1254 has a very high GC content (62.5%), it usually gives low reads in RNA-seq data, which makes it more difficult to be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>HO-1 expression is widely up-regulated in various types of tumors and consequently impacts tumor development by promoting cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref055">55</xref>]. Previous studies showed that HO-1 can be regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref056">56</xref>]. Several miRNAs have been reported as regulators of HO-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006896.ref057">57</xref>], and seven unreported miRNAs with inhibitory activity on HO-1 were screened out in our current work as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. These miRNAs are inactivated in different types of cancer cells under most circumstances. In the present study, we demonstrated that HO-1 is regulated by miR-1254 at both mRNA and protein levels in human lung cancer cells. MiR-1254 directly targets HO-1 3’-UTR via its seed sequence and represses HO-1 expression at post-transcriptional level. In parallel, miR-1254 suppresses TFAP2A, which is a transcriptional activator of HO-1, via its non-seed sequence, and consequently represses HO-1 expression at transcriptional level. This dual regulatory mechanism by miR-1254 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels has the potential to lead a more effective inhibition effect on HO-1. Moreover, there are many other oncogenes which are similarly regulated with HO-1, they could be regulated both by miR-1254 and TFAP2A directly. ChIPBase was used to predict the transcriptional targets of TFAP2A and TargetScan was used to predict miR-1254 targets. The intersection of the two populations has 347 targets in total including HO-1. Importantly, our findings indicate that miR-1254 induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of NSCLC cells through inhibiting the expression of HO-1, consequently suppressing the NSCLC cell growth. The clinical data showing that HO-1 mRNA level is inversely correlated with miR-1254 in human NSCLC tumor samples, indicating that miR-1254 may be a negative regulator of HO-1 in physiological conditions. Collectively, our findings identify miR-1254 as an inhibitor of HO-1 with dual regulatory mechanisms via different sequence regions, and functioning in NSCLC cell growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006896.g007">Fig 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the new functional mechanism of miRNA non-seed sequence, many details in the mechanism remain far more elusive. For example, is the non-seed region-dependent transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene regulation a universal effect of miRNA? How many miRNAs have dual regulation on their targets like miR-1254? In terms of the components and functional mechanism of RISC, what’s the difference between non-seed sequence-modified and seed region modified-gene regulation? Addressing these questions will give us a further insight into miRNA-modified gene regulation and also a better understanding of miRNA functions in the oncogenic signaling network.</p>
