<abstract>
<p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a key role in cell fate specification, proliferation, and survival during mammalian development. Cells require a small organelle, the primary cilium, to respond properly to Hh signals and the key regulators of Hh signal transduction exhibit dynamic localization to this organelle when the pathway is activated. Here, we investigate the role of Cell Cycle Related kinase (CCRK) in regulation of cilium-dependent Hh signaling in the mouse. Mice mutant for <italic>Ccrk</italic> exhibit a variety of developmental defects indicative of inappropriate regulation of this pathway. Cell biological, biochemical and genetic analyses indicate that CCRK is required to control the Hedgehog pathway at the level or downstream of Smoothened and upstream of the Gli transcription factors, Gli2 and Gli3. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments indicate that <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells show a greater deficit in response to signaling over long time periods than over short ones. Similar to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutants lacking the CCRK homolog, LF2, mouse <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells show defective regulation of ciliary length and morphology. <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells exhibit defects in intraflagellar transport (the transport mechanism used to assemble cilia), as well as slowed kinetics of ciliary enrichment of key Hh pathway regulators. Collectively, the data suggest that CCRK positively regulates the kinetics by which ciliary proteins such as Smoothened and Gli2 are imported into the cilium, and that the efficiency of ciliary recruitment allows for potent responses to Hedgehog signaling over long time periods.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The importance of cilia in development and disease has become broadly appreciated in recent years due in part to their roles in signal transduction. Despite this attention, crucial aspects of ciliary assembly and function, such as the mechanisms controlling ciliary assembly and the signal transduction events occurring in cilia, remain unclear. Cilia play a central role in sensing and transducing Hedgehog signals in the context of mammalian embryogenesis and in a variety of cancers. Here, we investigate the functions of Cell Cycle Related Kinase (CCRK), which plays an evolutionarily conserved function in the assembly of cilia and flagella. We find that mouse CCRK positively and negatively regulates ciliary length. We show that CCRK controls multiple aspects of Hedgehog signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> by regulating the processing and activities of the Gli transcription factors. Our data suggest that CCRK controls Hedgehog signaling by promoting the efficient ciliary import of core signaling components.</p>

<title>The role of Hedgehog signaling in vertebrate development</title>
<p>In the mammalian embryo, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway controls cell proliferation, cell survival, and tissue patterning (cell fate specification and differentiation) in most tissues such as the developing nervous system, skeleton, skin, and internal organs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref001">1</xref>]). The role of Hh signaling in tissue patterning has been most extensively studied in the context of the spinal neural tube. In this system, the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand functions as a morphogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref002">2</xref>]; cells experiencing the strong, intermediate, low, or absent signaling (in a ventral-to-dorsal order) adopt the floor plate, motor neuron, V0-V2 interneuron, or dorsal interneuron fates, respectively. The strength of signaling is determined by the amount of ligand cells experience, as well as the duration of that exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Mammalian Hedgehog signaling and the primary cilium</title>
<p>At the surface of signal responding cells, Hh ligands bind to a complex including the transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptch1). In the absence of the Hh ligand, Patched inhibits the seven-pass transmembrane signal transducer, Smoothened (Smo). Binding of Hh ligand to Patched relieves its inhibition on Smo, thereby activating it. In turn, active Smo regulates the activity of the Gli family transcription factors, through a process that is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Mammals have three <italic>Gli</italic> genes (<italic>Gli1- 3</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref004">4</xref>]. <italic>Gli1</italic>, whose expression is strongly induced by Hh signaling, encodes a transcriptional activator of Hh targets but it is not required for embryonic Hh signal transduction. Gli2 and Gli3, however, are both necessary to control embryonic Hh signaling, functioning as activators or repressors of target genes. In the absence of Hh ligands, Gli2 and Gli3 are phosphorylated by a series of kinases, leading to proteasome-dependent processing into shorter repressor forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref005">5</xref>]. Unprocessed (full-length) forms are kept in a functionally inactive state due to their physical association with Suppressor of Fused (Sufu, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref006">6</xref>]). Once Smo is activated by signaling, the phosphorylation pattern of Gli proteins is altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref007">7</xref>]). These changes prevent proteolytic processing (thus repressor formation) and they render the Gli proteins active such that they can enter the nucleus and activate the expression of a series of genes, including <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic>.</p>
<p>In mice, much of this signal transduction occurs in the primary cilium (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref008">8</xref>]). This relationship appears to be generally conserved among vertebrates including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref010">10</xref>]. The primary cilium, present on nearly every cell type in the body, is a microtubule-based appendage surrounded by an extension of the plasma membrane and anchored by the mother centriole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref011">11</xref>]. It is assembled primarily through a mechanism termed Intraflagellar Transport (IFT, reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref011">11</xref>]). IFT particles associate with ciliary cargo and microtubule motors, forming trains that are transported in an anterograde direction towards microtubule plus-ends (at the distal end of the cilium) by Kinesin II. IFT machinery and cargo to be exported from the cilium are loaded onto IFT particles that are returned to the cell body (retrograde transport towards microtubule minus-ends) through cytoplasmic Dynein 1b.</p>
<p>A large number of mutations have been identified in mice that block the formation of cilia or alter their assembly and all of these perturbations lead to changes (increase or decrease) in the activity of Hh signaling in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref016">16</xref>]. Key regulatory components of the Hh pathway show dynamic changes in their localization to cilia, depending on the presence or absence of signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref018">18</xref>]. In the absence of signals, Patched1 localizes to the cilium, whereas Smo shows little or no localization. Only a small amount of Gli2, Gli3, and Sufu localize to the cilium (where they concentrate at its tip). In the presence of signals, ciliary localization of Patched is lost, while Smo, Gli2, Gli3, and Sufu become enriched in the structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref018">18</xref>]. A number of experiments indicate that this change in ciliary localization is important for the factors to execute signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref020">20</xref>]. Analysis of mouse mutants has shown that proper proteolytic processing of full-length Gli proteins to generate repressor forms is dependent on primary cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref021">21</xref>]. In parallel, the ability of full-length Gli proteins to undergo differential phosphorylation, dissociate from Sufu, and activate Hh target genes also requires primary cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref022">22</xref>]. Because of this, defects in ciliogenesis result in ligand-independent up-regulation of Hh targets, down-regulation or absence of ligand-dependent Hh responses, or a combination of the two effects.</p>

<title>Regulation of ciliary assembly by a kinase, CCRK, and its homologs</title>
<p>Studies of a mutation that perturbs ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling in the mouse, <italic>broadminded (bromi)</italic>, implicated Cell Cycle-Related Kinase (CCRK, also known as Cdk20) in these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>CCRK shares homology with members of the Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) family and it was originally identified in vertebrates as a Cdk2-activating protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref024">24</xref>]. However, subsequent work showed that CCRK has only a minor role in cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref025">25</xref>], leaving the role of mammalian CCRK unclear.</p>
<p>CCRK homologs have been identified and studied in several species (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic>, and <italic>Danio rerio)</italic> and, in all cases, disruption of the gene leads to defects in ciliary length and/or structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref028">28</xref>]. The homolog in the algae <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is called Long Flagella 2 (LF2). The originally identified mutations in <italic>lf2</italic> cause flagella to be significantly longer than normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref026">26</xref>]. However, these mutations were subsequently found to be hypomorphic. In contrast, cells harboring a null allele, <italic>lf2-6</italic>, generate flagella with a broad range of lengths (either too long, too short, or flagella of different lengths on the same cell, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref029">29</xref>]). Partial knockdown of <italic>Ccrk</italic> expression in cultured mammalian cells results in ciliary lengthening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref030">30</xref>], as in <italic>lf2</italic> hypomorphic <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref026">26</xref>], but the effect of complete loss of CCRK on Hedgehog signaling and ciliogenesis in mammals has not been previously determined.</p>
<p>Here, we find that the role of CCRK in mice is complex, as it positively and negatively controls both ciliary length and the activity of the Hh pathway. The results indicate that CCRK positively regulates import of ciliary cargo including Hh signaling components. They also suggest that efficient flux of Hh signaling components into, and out of, the cilium, is limiting for long-term, but not initial, Hh responses.</p>

<p>As <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the notochord appeared normal in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants, we hypothesized that CCRK is required for proper responses to the highest level of Shh signals, rather than production of Shh ligands. To address this, we performed a genetic experiment. Rab23 is an antagonist of the Shh pathway. In <italic>Rab23</italic> mutants, spinal neural progenitors adopt ventral cell fates, such as p3 and floor plate independently of Shh ligand or the pathway activator Smoothened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref034">34</xref>]. If CCRK acts in the pathway downstream of Shh ligand and of Smoothened, then the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant patterning phenotype would be genetically epistatic to that of <italic>Rab23</italic> mutants. Indeed, E10.5 <italic>Rab23</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>Ccrk</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> double mutants exhibited loss of floor plate and reduction of p3 progenitor cell numbers. These features were indistinguishable from those in <italic>Ccrk</italic> single mutants, despite the loss of inhibition from Rab23 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s005">S5 Fig</xref>,</bold> data quantitated in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s014">S2 Table</xref></bold>). These data indicate that CCRK is important for regulating Hh pathway activity at a step downstream of Shh, Smoothened, and Rab23.</p>
<p>The slight dorsal expansion of the motor neuron domain in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant suggested that CCRK could also be required for complete repression of Hh pathway activity in the absence of signaling. <italic>Smoothened</italic> (<italic>Smo</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mutants are unable to respond to Hh ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref035">35</xref>].

Indeed, we observed restoration of some Shh-dependent cell types, Olig2+ and Nkx6.1+ progenitors, in <italic>Ccrk</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>Smo</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> double mutants, which were never seen in <italic>Smo</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> single mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s006">S6O</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s006">S6P</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s006">S6K and S6I Fig</xref>;</bold> data quantitated in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s015">S3 Table</xref>)</bold>.

<p>Although Gli3 provides both positive and negative regulation of Hedgehog responses, its repressor function has a relatively dominant role in Hedgehog signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref036">36</xref>]. In the spinal neural tube, the activator function of Gli3 is dispensable (due to redundancy with Gli2), whereas its repressor function is uniquely required. If <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants retain at least some Gli2 function, then loss of the Gli3 repressor in this background should boost Hedgehog responses to provide phenotypic rescue. Indeed, <italic>Ccrk</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>Gli3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> double mutants showed phenotypic rescue in comparison with <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s008">S8I and S8J Fig</xref></bold>, data quantified and analyzed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s017">S5 Table</xref></bold>).

<title>CCRK regulates posttranslational modification of Gli proteins</title>
<p>To complement our genetic analysis, we investigated how the regulation of Gli2 and Gli3 is affected at the protein level by disruption of <italic>Ccrk</italic>. We performed western blotting for Gli2 and Gli3 using extracts from E9.5 wild-type and <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant embryos <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g003">Fig 3A</xref>)</bold>. Wild-type embryos showed a single full-length species of Gli2 (190 kDa), whereas in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant extracts we observed an additional, faster migrating species (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). This pattern likely reflects a shift in posttranslational modification of Gli2, such as decreased phosphorylation, leading to diminished Gli2 activator function. We investigated this possibility and found that Gli2 mobility was increased in wild-type samples treated with lambda phosphatase, whereas Gli2 in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant samples showed increased mobility similar to phosphatase treated wild-type samples (lanes 2 and 4 in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>) even without phosphatase treatment. This suggests that Gli2 in mutant cells occurs in a hypo-or non-phosphorylated state. As expected, inclusion of the phosphatase inhibitor Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> reversed the effect of phosphatase on Gli2 in wild-type samples (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>, lane 3).

These results were consistently observed in three separate experiments.

<p>We also observed profound effects of the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutation on the abundance of Gli3 forms. In wild-type embryos, Gli3 is found in two forms: a full-length form (185 kDa) that can be rendered into the activator state (Gli3Act) and a proteolytically generated 85 kDa repressor form (Gli3Rep) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref005">5</xref>]. Shh signaling suppresses formation of Gli3Rep in favor of the full-length form that can function as a transcriptional activator. We found that the full-length form of Gli3 was significantly increased (~4-fold) in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Despite this increase, our genetic data indicate that the Gli3 activator function is impaired in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants given that <italic>Ccrk/Gli2 and Gli2/Gli3</italic> double mutants show a similar, strongly dorsalized, neural patterning phenotype (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref037">37</xref>]). The increase in full-length Gli3 levels in the mutants may reflect increased stability of non-functional full-length Gli3 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Discussion</xref>). We also observed a modest (~40%) decrease in the levels of the Gli3 repressor form in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants, which may reflect inefficient proteolytic processing of Gli3 and may explain the weak ligand-independent activity of the Hedgehog pathway in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants indicated by the partial rescue phenotype of <italic>Smo/Ccrk</italic> mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>).

We compared Hh pathway activity between mutant and wild-type cells in unstimulated cells, as well as in cells stimulated with Smoothened agonist (SAG). When exposed to varying concentration of SAG for 24 hours, the direct Hh target gene <italic>Gli1</italic> (monitored by qPCR) was expressed at a reduced level (30–40%) compared to wild-type cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). This phenotype was confirmed using wild-type and mutant cells transfected with a Gli binding site/luciferase reporter (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We next investigated immortalized wild-type and <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant MEF cell lines. We validated this model by stably transfecting the mutant cell lines with constructs overexpressing either wild-type CCRK or a version with a K33R mutation that is predicted to disrupt kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref029">29</xref>]. The immortalized <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells showed a deficiency in Hh pathway activity similar to primary <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref></bold>). Mutant cells harboring the wild-type construct showed responses that were slightly higher than controls, whereas mutant cells harboring the K33R mutant version showed no evidence of rescue. These data confirmed the role of CCRK in the phenotype and indicated that the kinase activity of CCRK is required for its ability to potentiate Hh pathway activity.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the defect in Hh pathway activity as a function of time of SAG exposure. We stimulated cells with 200 nM SAG for periods ranging from 2 to 24 hours. Interestingly, we found normal or slightly elevated levels of induction of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells up to 12 hours of SAG exposure in comparison to control cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>). However, after about 12 hours of exposure, wild-type cells exhibited continuously increased levels of expression, whereas the increase was modest for <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells. A similar phenomenon was observed when cells were stimulated with lower amounts of SAG (5 or 20 nM, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s009">S9A Fig</xref></bold>). <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells showed a qualitatively similar pattern of responses with respect to <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression, although expression by mutant cells was slightly reduced at times ≤12 hours with larger differences in expression seen at 14–24 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s009">S9B Fig</xref></bold>). These results suggest that CCRK function is more important for later periods of signaling than for short-term responses.</p>

<p>Because wild-type cells show a continuous increase in <italic>Gli1</italic> expression with increased duration of SAG exposure, it is possible that the activity at 24 hours represents prior pathway activity combined with recent pathway activity. If this were the case, the defective responses in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells at 24 hours exposure could be due to a loss in their memory of prior activity or to a failure to mount strong responses beyond 8 hours of exposure. To investigate this, we conducted a hysteresis experiment to determine to what extent the cells retain activity from prior signaling events once the inducer is removed for extended periods (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>). When wild-type and mutant cells were exposed to SAG for 8 hours, they mounted similar responses. When cells were treated with SAG for 8 hours, followed by SAG washout (plus inclusion of the Smo inhibitor Cyclopamine) for 24, 48, or 72 more hours, wild-type cells showed levels of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression similar to, or somewhat higher than, those observed immediately after 8 hours of SAG exposure, indicating that prior exposure to SAG maintains <italic>Gli1</italic> expression for an extended period. The <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells also retained wild-type levels of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression 24 hours after removal of inducer, although their responses were somewhat lower than wild-type at 48 and 72 hours. Collectively, these data argue that the failure of <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells to mount strong responses to exposure times beyond 8 hours lies in their failure of long-term signaling rather than a loss of memory of prior signaling events.</p>

<title>CCRK regulates the morphology and length of primary cilia</title>
<p>Because CCRK homologs in other organisms function in ciliogenesis and because ciliary defects were observed in mutants for the CCRK-binding protein BROMI, we investigated the effects of CCRK disruption on cilia in the mouse. Cilia in the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant embryonic neuroepithelium were generated at roughly normal frequencies but they adopted a shortened, swollen morphology (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s011">S11</xref></bold>). Staining with the ciliary marker Arl13b showed a small ring-like pattern (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). Both of these ciliary phenotypes resemble those found in <italic>bromi</italic> mouse mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref023">23</xref>]. We next analyzed cilia in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant and control MEFs. <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant MEFs generated cilia, albeit with notable differences from wild-type. First, we found that, while both Arl13b and the IFT protein IFT88 localized to <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia, they showed an accumulation at the distal end of the cilia in comparison to wild-type cilia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>). This phenotype suggests an imbalance between the processes of anterograde and retrograde IFT and is similar to the distal swelling seen in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella null for the <italic>Ccrk</italic> homolog <italic>lf2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref029">29</xref>]. Second, we measured the length of wild-type and <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia under steady-state (serum starved) conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). Although the average cilia lengths were generally similar (2.6 and 3.5 μm, for control and mutant cilia, respectively), there was a broader distribution of cilia lengths in the mutant cells than in the control cells (std. dev. of 0.78 vs. 1.9 for control and mutant cilia, respectively). This finding is reminiscent of the length phenotype of <italic>Chlamydomonas lf2</italic> null flagella, which can be much longer or shorter than those of wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<p>We also interrogated the role of CCRK in a cell type that generates longer cilia, IMCD3, engineered to express a fluorescent reporter, IFT88::YFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref038">38</xref>], allowing us to monitor intraflagellar transport. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to disrupt <italic>Ccrk</italic> in IMCD IFT88::YFP cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>). <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant IMCD cells generated cilia but, similar to neuroepithelial cells and MEFs, the mutant cilia showed swelling at the distal ends, as determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>). This phenotype was accompanied by the accumulation of IFT88::YFP at the distal ends of cilia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g007">Fig 7C</xref></bold>). Stable transfection of the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant IMCD cells with a construct expressing wild-type CCRK resulted in complementation/phenotypic rescue. We next monitored the movement of IFT88::YFP particles in live wild-type and <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant IMCD cells using TIRF microscopy to generate kymographs from which we determined rates of anterograde and retrograde IFT (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g007">Fig 7C</xref></bold>). The rates of anterograde transport were not statistically different between wild-type and mutant cells. Retrograde IFT occurred at a slightly slower rate in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells compared to controls (0.62 and 0.51 μm/sec, in wild-type and mutant cells, respectively, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g007">Fig 7D</xref></bold>). Although it was difficult to determine IFT frequencies due to movie-to-movie variability, IFT events occurred at normal or somewhat reduced frequencies in the mutant cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g007">Fig 7E</xref></bold>). These data indicate that IFT was only modestly affected in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells, a result similar to findings from <italic>Chlamydomonas lf2</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref039">39</xref>]. While this defect may have some contribution to the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant ciliary length and morphology phenotype, other deficits, such as transport of the ciliary cargo <italic>per se</italic>, may play a more important role.</p>

<title>CCRK controls the kinetics of ciliary protein localization</title>
<p>We determined whether the localization of Hedgehog signaling components to <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia was affected in embryonic fibroblasts. We assayed the localization of SuFu, Smo, Gli2 and Gli3 under unstimulated conditions or after 24 hours of stimulation with the Smoothened agonist. Each of these proteins shows enrichment in cilia upon Hh pathway stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref018">18</xref>]. We observed similar patterns of localization for these proteins under the two steady-state conditions in wild-type and <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g008">Fig 8A</xref></bold>). However, Gli2 localized to wild-type cilia more frequently than to mutant cilia under unstimulated conditions. We investigated the temporal change in localization patterns by assaying the frequency and amount of ciliary Gli2 localization as a function of time of SAG-mediated pathway induction. Interestingly, the frequency of wild-type cilia with Gli2 localization reached a plateau around 30 min of induction, whereas <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia did not show uniform localization until 4 hours of induction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006912.g008">Fig 8B</xref></bold>). Similarly, the kinetics of increase in ciliary Gli2 fluorescence upon induction were much slower in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells than in wild-type cells. Analysis of Smoothened ciliary localization revealed a similar delay in recruitment in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells. These data suggest that, although the rates by which IFT complexes move are relatively unaffected by loss of CCRK, the efficiency of ciliary recruitment and transport of Hedgehog regulatory proteins, and perhaps other cargo, is controlled by CCRK. These findings suggest that CCRK regulates ciliary length, morphology, and function in Hedgehog signaling by promoting the efficiency of ciliary cargo recruitment and transport.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that the evolutionary conserved kinase, CCRK, regulates a broad array of processes at levels ranging from the subcellular to the organismal. We find that mouse CCRK controls several aspects of ciliogenesis, which in turn are important for Hedgehog signal transduction, patterning, and embryonic morphogenesis. The role of <italic>Ccrk</italic> is similar to that of <italic>broadminded</italic> (<italic>bromi)</italic>, identified in a forward genetic screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref023">23</xref>]. BROMI protein physically associates with CCRK and promotes its stability. In support of a common function, <italic>Ccrk</italic> null mutants phenocopy <italic>bromi</italic> mutants with respect to embryogenesis, Hedgehog pathway effects, and ciliary defects.</p>
<p>We suggest that CCRK in the mouse plays a role analogous to LF2, its homolog in the green algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella show a structure strikingly similar to that of mammalian cilia and both organelles are assembled using similar mechanisms, such as intraflagellar transport (IFT). A comparison of the phenotypes of <italic>Chlamydomonas lf2</italic> null mutants with those of <italic>Ccrk</italic> null mutant cells shows close similarities. First, <italic>Ccrk</italic> and <italic>lf2</italic> null cells both generate cilia/flagella with a broader range in lengths compared with controls. Second, similar to <italic>lf2</italic> mutant flagella, mouse <italic>Ccrk</italic> null cilia show swelling at their distal ends, which is accompanied by an accumulation of IFT proteins at this site. Third, recent analysis of <italic>lf2</italic> mutant flagella undergoing regeneration revealed that IFT particles loaded with ciliary cargo (tubulin) were transported much less frequently than controls, although the transport frequency of all IFT particles (loaded or unloaded) was only slightly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref039">39</xref>], suggesting that these mutants fail to load IFT particles with cargo properly or to dispatch loaded particles from the flagellum base. Similarly, <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia show only small changes in the rates and frequencies of IFT, whereas the enrichment of cargo (Smoothened, Gli2) in cilia upon Hh pathway activation was substantially slower in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells.</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>CCRK regulation of ciliary length and structure</title>
<p><italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia show two overt phenotypes: swelling at their distal ends and defective length control. The distal swelling is accompanied by accumulation of the ciliary proteins Arl13b and IFT88 at this end. Such a phenotype is consistent with a defect in retrograde IFT or, possibly, an imbalance in the efficacy of retrograde versus anterograde IFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref015">15</xref>]. The slightly reduced retrograde IFT rates and frequencies in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia may be responsible for this phenotype. Alternatively, a defect in the IFT turnover process at distal ends of cilia, which involves disassembly/unloading of anterograde IFT trains and assembly/loading of retrograde IFT trains, could lead to such a phenotype. CCRK could regulate the activity of retrograde IFT machinery <italic>per se</italic> or it could control the ciliary import of proteins that are rate-limiting for retrograde transport.</p>
<p>The role of CCRK in the control of ciliary length is less clear, as the means by which cells sense and control their lengths are not well understood. Cilia and flagella initially undergo a lengthening phase, then slow their growth to reach a steady-state length. Many models have been proposed to explain how cells sense their ciliary length, such as the “time-of-flight” or ion current models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref040">40</xref>]. Regardless of the sensing mechanism, the cell must execute some form of length control in response to this information. We suggest that differential loading of cargo onto IFT particles provides this control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref041">41</xref>]. According to this hypothesis, during a growth phase, IFT particles are efficiently loaded with cargo needed to assemble cilia at their tips. However, as the cilium begins to reach a steady-state length, cargo loading is significantly down-regulated, leading to reduction in the amount of ciliary cargo being delivered. If cargo, such as tubulin, were rate-limiting for ciliary assembly, this would cause slowing and then stopping of ciliary growth. Thus, ciliary cargo loading may be improperly regulated in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells and the variation in ciliary length may be explained by such a defect. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> IFT trains loaded with tubulin are transported frequently during the growing phase, but this frequency is strongly attenuated when the cilium is at steady state. In <italic>lf2</italic> mutants with regenerating flagella, the frequency of transport is greatly reduced compared to controls. In these mutant flagella, at steady state, the frequency is higher than in normal flagella. Reduced transport during growth delivers fewer tubulin subunits to the cilium, resulting in its shortening in some cells. However, in other <italic>lf2/Ccrk</italic> mutant cells, there may be a delay in reaching steady state, as cargo loading and transport is not appropriately down-regulated, causing those cilia to grow longer than normal.</p>

<sec id="sec015">
<title>Regulation of Hedgehog signaling by CCRK in the embryo</title>
<p>Disruption of <italic>Ccrk</italic> in the embryo results in phenotypes indicative of defects in Hedgehog signaling, similar to other mouse mutants with elevated or decreased activity of the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref033">33</xref>]. In <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants, cell fates in the most ventral neural tube, that require strong Shh signaling, are either absent (floor plate) or reduced in number and mispositioned (p3 cells), while cell fates requiring intermediate levels (pMN cells) are concomitantly expanded into ventral territories. This suggests that, while <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants are capable of Shh signaling, the strongest responses are defective, with cells executing intermediate responses instead. In addition, the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant pMN domain also expands dorsally, suggesting that cells that would normally adopt fates controlled by low levels of signaling behave as if they experience intermediate levels. The observation that cells requiring weak activity of the pathway are restored in <italic>Smo</italic> mutants when <italic>Ccrk</italic> is mutated suggests that CCRK represses the Hh pathway in the absence of signals. Thus, CCRK both potentiates and represses the activity of the Hh pathway, depending on context.</p>
<p>The <italic>Ccrk/Rab23</italic> epistasis data, along with the SAG <italic>in vitro</italic> data, indicate that CCRK acts in the response to Shh (rather than in ligand production) at the level of Smo or downstream of it. Hh signaling in the mouse embryo is mediated by the combined functions of Gli2 and Gli3 activator/repressor forms. The epistasis and biochemical analyses suggest that all of these activities are partially impaired in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants. Despite the similarity between the <italic>Ccrk</italic> and <italic>Gli2</italic> mutant patterning phenotypes, the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant phenotype is not caused by loss of Gli2 activity alone, as disruption of <italic>Gli2</italic> in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants resulted in exacerbation of the phenotype (stronger dorsalization) and because disruption of <italic>Gli3</italic> in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants resulted in phenotypic rescue, whereas disruption of Gli2 and Gli3 results in a strongly dorsalized patterning phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref037">37</xref>]. It is unlikely that the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant phenotype is due to loss of Gli3Act function alone, as Gli3 activator is not required for floor plate specification in the presence of Gli2. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation for these data is that both Gli2Act and Gli3Act functions are impaired in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants and this has the combined effect of diminishing strong Shh responses. Low-level Smo-independent Hh pathway activity in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants might be due to reduced Gli3Rep function. Indeed, the mutants exhibited reduced amounts of the 85 kDa Gli3Rep form, consistent with diminished proteolytic processing of the Gli3. However, the residual Gli3Rep in these mutants is likely to be functional since loss of <italic>Gli3</italic> can rescue the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant phenotype.</p>
<p>The state of Gli2 and Gli3 proteins in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant embryos supports the arguments presented above. The full-length (FL) forms of both Gli2 and Gli3, representing GliAct or GliAct precursor forms, are affected in the mutants. FL-Gli2 changes its electrophoretic migration, consistent with inefficient post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation). The change could represent incomplete PKA phosphorylation at the Pc-g sites in the N-terminus of Gli2, which potentiate Gli2Act by promoting its dissociation from Sufu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref007">7</xref>]. FL-Gli3 shows dramatic accumulation in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants. Although this could, in principle, cause hyperactivation of Shh responses in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants, it may also be a secondary effect of reduced Gli3Act function. This is because release of full-length Gli proteins from their inhibitor, Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref006">6</xref>], leads to rapid degradation of such proteins, whereas failure to dissociate from Sufu leads to FL-Gli stabilization but loss of its transcriptional functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Collectively, the genetic and biochemical data suggest that the functions of Gli2Act and Gli3Act forms are impaired, possibly due to their inability to efficiently dissociate from Sufu. In addition, inefficient processing of FL-Gli3 results in diminished Gli3Rep function, which, in turn, increases inappropriate, ligand-independent activation of the Shh pathway.</p>

<title>Loss of CCRK causes ciliary and Hh signaling defects that both resemble and differ from those resulting from loss of other ciliary regulators</title>
<p>While the ciliary and Hh signaling phenotypes of <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants share some similarities with those of other mouse mutants with mutations in ciliary regulators, they differ in important ways from each. Loss of IFT B proteins (such as Ift172), like loss of <italic>Ccrk</italic>, results in both diminished high level Hh responses and weak ectopic Hh pathway activity. However, IFT B mutants typically fail to generate cilia (unlike <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants) and the intermediate/high level Hh responses are more significantly impaired in IFT B mutants than <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref013">13</xref>]. Loss of IFT A proteins (such as Ift122) or cytoplasmic dynein (Dync2h1) result in accumulation of IFT complexes in the distal tips of cilia, similar to <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants. However, loss of IFT A proteins only causes increased Hh pathway activity, <italic>Dync2h1</italic> mutants only show diminished pathway activity, whereas <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants show both diminished and ectopic pathway activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref015">15</xref>]. Although loss of the ciliary kinesin Kif7 and loss of CCRK each cause deregulation of ciliary length, their effects on Hh pathway activity and neural patterning are largely opposite from one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref044">44</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the roles of CCRK in ciliary assembly and Hh pathway control are distinct from those of previously studied regulators, although CCRK and such regulators are likely to be functionally connected.</p>

<title>Regulation of Hedgehog signaling components by CCRK in the cilium</title>
<p>We suggest that CCRK indirectly controls the function and biochemical state of Hh signaling components by promoting their import into the cilium. This is supported by our analyses of Smo and Gli2 ciliary localization. In normal cells during the first several hours of SAG exposure, the levels of Smo and Gli2 increase in the cilium over time indicating the rate of ciliary import of these proteins exceeds the rate of their ciliary export during the first 1–2 hours of signaling. In contrast, the rates of Gli2 and Smo ciliary accumulation were substantially delayed in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells. This observation may be explained by a reduced rate of ciliary import of Gli2 and Smo. Alternatively, there may be an increase in the rate of ciliary export of these factors in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells. While we cannot definitively distinguish between these possibilities at present, we favor the first one. The distal accumulation of Gli proteins in retrograde IFT mutant cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref015">15</xref>], coupled with direct interactions between Gli proteins and Kinesin II subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref045">45</xref>], suggest Gli proteins are transported by IFT. Because retrograde IFT rates are modestly impaired in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia and the frequency of IFT events is somewhat reduced in such cilia, an increase in Gli2 ciliary export is unlikely. The accumulation of IFT88 at the distal ends of <italic>Ccrk</italic> cilia is also consistent with impaired retrograde IFT. Although we were only able to assay the change in cargo accumulation during the first few hours after stimulation (as the levels of proteins reach a steady state thereafter), we hypothesize that <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cilia continuously exhibit reduced flux of cargo transport. A reduction in the rate of ciliary transport of Hh pathway components could result in diminished Hh pathway activity. Signaling downstream of Smo results in modification of Gli proteins and dissociation from their inhibitor Sufu, events which are dependent on their transport within cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, diminished influx of pathway activators (Smoothened and Gli2) could result in the generation of fewer activated Gli transcription factor molecules per unit of time. This would cause a cumulative defect in the transcriptional output of the pathway.</p>

<sec id="sec018">
<title>Regulation of Hh pathway responses over time</title>
<p>Examination of <italic>Gli1</italic> induction in wild-type cells over time suggests there are at least two phases in the response. During the first phase, between 2 and 12 hours, the increase in target mRNA level is mostly linear with a shallow slope with respect to induction time. This could be explained by the generation of a fixed level production of target gene message per unit of time coupled with perdurance of previously made transcripts. During the second phase, between 12 and 24 hours of exposure, the magnitude of the response increases much more rapidly. The change of slopes is related to the state of the network during each of these periods.</p>
<p>The change in the rate of target mRNA increase between the first and second phases may be explained by recruitment of a signal amplification mechanism to further enhance responses during the second phase. While we do not know the mechanistic basis of this amplification, it may rely on the production of more <italic>Gli2</italic> which is transcriptionally up-regulated by Shh signaling in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006912.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, the time of onset of this amplification would be determined by the time it takes from the initial increase in <italic>Gli2</italic> transcription to the generation of active Gli2 protein. Once active Gli2 protein levels accumulate, they may mediate a more robust response to SAG per unit of time.</p>
<p>In <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells, the rate of increase in <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression with SAG exposure remains slow and continuous from 2 hours until well beyond 24 hours of induction, suggesting that the sensitization mechanism normally acting during the second phase is defective. The hysteresis experiments indicate that the dampened responses of mutant cells at late time points are caused by a reduction in the generation of activated Gli proteins per unit of time, rather than loss of cellular memory of prior signaling events (due to, e.g., shortened half-lives of activated Gli proteins).</p>
<p>We suggest a model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006912.s012">S12 Fig</xref></bold>) in which CCRK increases the rate of import of Hh pathway components during pathway stimulation. However, the decreased rate of cargo import in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells does not impact the ability of such cells to mount appropriate responses during the first phase of signaling. In contrast, the reduced import rate is limiting with respect to mounting an amplified response during the second phase. If the amplification mechanism occurs through increasing Gli2 protein levels, it is possible that the additional Gli2 critically depends on its efficient transport into and out of the cilium.</p>
<p>While our model is testable, it remains unclear how the import of ciliary cargo is regulated and what the role of CCRK in this mechanism may be. Future identification of CCRK substrates should be helpful in this regard.</p>

<title>Generation of a Ccrk null mutant allele</title>

<title>Quantitation of Shh-dependent neural tube patterning as a function of developmental stage in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants.</title>
<p>Wild-type and <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant embryos were obtained between E9.0 and E11.5 and somite number determined. Sections at the 4-5<sup>th</sup> somite level were stained for FoxA2, Nkx2.2, Olig2, and Pax6. Numbers of expressing cells (FoxA2, Nkx2.2, Olig2) as well as ventrally-positioned nonexpressing cells (Pax6) were counted. As early as the 10-13-somite stage, <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutants showed a dorsalized pattern manifested as fewer Fox2+, Nkx2.2+, Olig2+, and Pax6- cells. By the 24-27-somite stage, the Olig2+ domain had expanded in the mutant. Vnt, ventral neural tube. Quantitation derived from 3 embryos per genotype/stage (2 sections per embryo). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. P values from Student’s t-tests: *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ns, not significant.</p>

<title>Model depicting the function of CCRK in ciliary cargo transport and the implications for activity of the Hh signaling pathway.</title>
<p>(A) We propose that CCRK acts through an unknown mechanism to promote the loading of ciliary cargo onto IFT particles so that they may be imported into the cilium. Such cargo includes regulators of Hh signal transduction (e.g. Gli2), tubulin dimers, and potentially, regulators of ciliary assembly/disassembly. (B) An individual Gli transcription factor molecule must first be loaded onto transport machinery and then transported towards the cilium tip where it can be activated (via its dissociation from Sufu). Once activated, the Gli molecule must be transported back to the cell body where it can enter the nucleus and activate target genes. We suggest that the initial step (loading and transport) is inefficient in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells. This would have the effect of delaying the time required for an individual molecule to be imported, activated, and function. Hence, fewer activated Gli molecules would be generated in the <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant per unit of time. (C) During the period of Hh pathway induction, normal cells show two phases: an initial phase of slow increase, during which <italic>Gli2</italic> is upregulated (due to feedback), and a second phase when the magnitude of the response is amplified (possibly due to the increased levels of Gli2). We suggest that the initial phase is relatively insensitive to the efficiency of ciliary import of Hh pathway regulators, but the transport efficiency is rate limiting for the response during the amplification phase. Thus, the decrease in the rate of ciliary transport of Hh pathway regulators in <italic>Ccrk</italic> mutant cells has very little effect during the initial phase, but it has a dramatic effect on the response during the amplification phase.</p>
