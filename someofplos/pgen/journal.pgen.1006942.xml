<abstract>
<p>Senescence is a universal barrier to immortalisation and tumorigenesis. As such, interest in the use of senescence-induction in a therapeutic context has been gaining momentum in the past few years; however, senescence and immortalisation remain underserved areas for drug discovery owing to a lack of robust senescence inducing agents and an incomplete understanding of the signalling events underlying this complex process. In order to address this issue we undertook a large-scale morphological siRNA screen for inducers of senescence phenotypes in the human melanoma cell line A375P. Following rescreen and validation in a second cancer cell line, HCT116 colorectal carcinoma, a panel of 16 of the most robust hits were selected for further validation based on significance and the potential to be targeted by drug-like molecules. Using secondary assays for detection of senescence biomarkers p21, 53BP1 and senescence associated beta-galactosidase (SAβGal) in a panel of HCT116 cell lines carrying cancer-relevant mutations, we show that partial senescence phenotypes can be induced to varying degrees in a context dependent manner, even in the absence of p21 or p53 expression. However, proliferation arrest varied among genetic backgrounds with predominantly toxic effects in p21 null cells, while cells lacking PI3K mutation failed to arrest. Furthermore, we show that the oncogene ECT2 induces partial senescence phenotypes in all mutant backgrounds tested, demonstrating a dependence on activating <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> for growth suppression and a complete senescence response. These results suggest a potential mechanism to target mutant KRAS signalling through ECT2 in cancers that are reliant on activating KRAS mutations and remain refractory to current treatments.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cellular senescence is an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation. Senescence is understood to be a universal barrier that all cancers must overcome during their evolution. Developing ways to induce senescence in cancer cells is therefore an attractive strategy to identify targets for cancer therapy. However, a lack of understanding of this complex process has meant that little progress has been made in translating senescence induction into the clinic. Here we describe the identification and validation of a panel of inducers of senescence phenotypes from a large-scale siRNA screen. We show that the senescence response can be induced to varying degrees in genetic backgrounds mimicking common cancer mutations, allowing for a prioritisation of approaches. We also show that partial senescence responses can be triggered in cancer cells in the absence of genes considered by some to be essential for a senescence response. However, distinct differences in proliferation arrest are observed different backgrounds. These results advance our understanding of the complexity of senescence biology. This study has identified several potential targets for drug discovery. Interestingly, our results show the potential for therapeutic intervention in some backgrounds which are so far refractory to current treatments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular senescence, often described as the irreversible arrest of cell proliferation, can be induced by a variety of signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref002">2</xref>]. It is a complex phenotype, consisting of various effector mechanisms including the DNA damage response (DDR), chromatin modification, autophagy and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref004">4</xref>]. Understanding collective control of these mechanisms is a priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref005">5</xref>] and screening approaches might help to deconvolute senescence pathways. However, the senescence response involves the expression of many biomarkers linked to these effector mechanisms, including cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21, components of the SASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref006">6</xref>] and in some contexts senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), which are associated with gene repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref007">7</xref>]. There are also some key morphological changes that occur, including a large flattened morphology, enlarged nucleus and expression of senescence associated beta-galactosidase (SAβGal). Expression of these biomarkers is context dependent and few specifically define senescence, therefore various markers should be investigated in parallel to confirm the senescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Senescence markers and effectors are evident in various premalignant tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with a role for senescence as a universal barrier to tumorigenesis. In mouse models of <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>V12</italic></sup>-dependent lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal carcinoma, p16 and SAβGal were detected in premalignant lesions, but not in the malignant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref009">9</xref>]. Similarly, oncogenic <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> overexpression can induce senescence in cultured melanocytes; human nevi (moles), which often carry <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup>, express many senescence markers and much evidence supports a role for senescence in maintaining their arrested state and preventing progression to melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Senescence signalling also occurs in advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref004">4</xref>] and in response to standard chemo- or radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref012">12</xref>], where it may aid therapeutic activity of these agents by acting as a fail-safe mechanism in cases where pro-apoptotic signalling is defective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, induction of the SASP by cancer therapeutics may also induce a tumour-directed immune response owing to the release of inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with this, the re-expression of p53 in a p53-deficient mouse model of liver carcinoma expressing oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>V12</italic></sup> resulted in senescence, rather than apoptosis, and tumour regression by immune clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref014">14</xref>]. However, in some contexts SASP components could promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Senescence induction is an attractive concept in cancer research, and the idea of modulating the senescence response for therapeutic benefit, either to enhance current treatments or as a tumour suppressive therapy in its own right, has been gaining momentum over recent years. However, cellular senescence and immortality remain underserved areas for drug discovery owing to a lack of senescence-inducing agents and an incomplete knowledge of the complexity of the underlying signalling events. To address the first issue, we recently reported identification of a novel compound, CB-20903630, through a “target agnostic” virtual screen. The compound selectively induces a variety of senescence associated phenotypes and G1 blockade in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref016">16</xref>]. However, given the diversity of senescence triggers, it seems clear that engagement of the response is under distributed control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, populating senescence effector pathways remains a major aim.</p>
<p>Kinome-focused siRNA screening has previously been used successfully to uncover pathways regulating cell immortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref019">19</xref>]. In the current study, we undertook a large-scale siRNA screen combined with high-throughput imaging in the human melanoma cell line A375P to identify senescence effectors. Our results revealed diversity in levels of senescence engagement between gene targets and cell lines, consistent with recent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref006">6</xref>]. Using a panel of HCT116 isogenic cell lines carrying common cancer-relevant gene mutations, we show that some senescence phenotypes can be engaged despite the absence of known effectors such as p53 or p21. However, distinct differences in proliferation arrest engagement are evident in different genetic backgrounds. Finally, we show senescence induction by knock-down of ECT2 in particular is greatly enhanced in the presence of oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>. These findings suggest that pro-senescence therapy may be effective in various malignancies, including those harbouring oncogenic RAS mutations, which are common and often refractory to treatment. Furthermore, by populating the signalling pathways that regulate the senescent phenotype with the effectors identified by our screen, a more complete picture of the senescence response can be drawn.</p>

<title>Identification of siRNAs that induce a senescent morphology in A375P melanoma cells</title>
<p>To identify potential senescence-inducing targets for drug discovery and extend our knowledge of senescence signalling in cancer, we initially performed validation of a high-content fluorescence imaging screen focused on senescence phenotypes. Using A375P cells treated with etoposide, we demonstrated that stable growth arrest in this cell line, assessed by colony formation assays and cell growth kinetics after compound washout, was accompanied by induction of a range of senescence markers. These included increased nuclear area, SAβGal and p21 expression, and 53BP1 and H2AX nuclear foci. We next tested an imaging assay based on the nuclear area marker and cell number in a small scale screen of 160 kinase inhibitor compounds by high content fluorescence imaging using the Operetta platform. We have previously reported the ability of some of these compounds to induce senescence in normal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref020">20</xref>]. Four of the best hits from this screen were tested in a range of secondary assays, including colony formation assays, confirming the ability of screening based on these markers to identify chemical agents capable of causing a range of senescence phenotypes alongside stable proliferation arrest. These validation experiments are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s007">S2 File</xref>.</p>
<p>We next used the validated imaging assay to perform a large-scale screen of 10,414 gene targets using the Ambion Silencer Select Druggable Genome siRNA library. As quality controls on each screening plate, etoposide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s007">S2 File</xref>) and an independent siRNA obtained from Qiagen against CDK1 (which is known to be involved in senescence) were included. Primary hits in A375P cells, detected by increased nuclear area and reduced proliferation compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref020">20</xref>], were rescreened and ranked by confidence (Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and a refined hit list of the 24 most robust hits and 16 others predicted to be druggable targets by functional analysis was generated for further validation. Criteria for the assessment of druggable targets included previous success in targeting the encoded protein or another of the same molecular class with a small molecule or drug-like compound, or the presence of a potentially druggable site within the protein structure. Many of the 24 highest-confidence hits were also classed as druggable, increasing our interest in them. The combined validation list of 40 targets showed a range of senescence-like morphologies upon knockdown, and included some weaker hits with fewer siRNAs passing the cut-off point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). These were included from a drug development standpoint and also to test a range of senescence responses in secondary validation assays. The siRNAs selected are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006942.t001">Table 1</xref>, together with their prioritisation grouping and confidence ranking.</p>

<p>Predictably, the majority of these 40 genes are involved in cell cycle regulation, the DNA damage response and maintenance of DNA integrity. However, several more interesting gene families emerged, including ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit genes RRM1 and RRM2, calpain cysteine protease family members CAPN11 and CAPN9 and several proteasome subunit family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Interestingly, although the Qiagen positive control CDK1 siRNA performed as well as many of the top hits, the Ambion CDK1 siRNAs from the library were not in our top 40. We continued to use the Qiagen siRNA in further experiments.</p>

<title>Screen hits induce expression of senescence biomarkers</title>
<p>To further investigate the 40 prioritised siRNAs as senescence inducers, a fresh batch of the same siRNAs was tested for the ability to increase nuclear area and induce SAβGal in A375P cells using a stricter cut-off value of control mean + 3 standard deviations (SD) in at least 2/3 replicate wells in 2/3 independent experiments. Hereafter an “increase” will refer to an increase passing this criterion unless otherwise stated. All 40 siRNAs increased nuclear area in 3 independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g002">Fig 2A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s007">S2A Fig</xref>), further validating the primary screen results. However, many gave SAβGal levels below the stricter cut-off, suggesting a partial or atypical senescence response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g002">Fig 2A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s007">S2C Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of these 40 siRNAs was extended to HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, chosen for the availability of isogenic derivatives with various oncogenic genotypes, previously used in screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref021">21</xref>] and their ability to express biomarkers of senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s007">S2B and S2D Fig</xref>). The results with parental HCT116 cells further corroborated those for A375P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Many of the strongest inducers of senescence in A375P also came out top in HCT116, while those that were negative for SAβGal in A375P were also negative for increased nuclear area and SAβGal in HCT116. Based on the SAβGal results for A375P, the nuclear area and SAβGal for HCT116, and the assessment of druggability, the list was refined to 16 siRNA targets for further analysis. This refined list encompassed many of the strongest hits from the siRNA screen. We continued to include the Qiagen positive control siRNA targeting CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Two additional biomarkers of senescence are p21 (CDKN1A) and recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage (nuclear foci). To further characterise the response of the refined siRNAs we analysed induction of p21 and formation of 53BP1 foci by immunofluorescence in A375P and HCT116 cells transfected with the 16 hit and control siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Consistent with the results for nuclear area and SAβGal, all 16 test siRNAs induced expression of p21 greater than the non-targeting control in A375P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In HCT116 cells, p21 expression was also increased by all test siRNAs except that targeting CIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Likewise, CIT siRNA failed to increase SAβGal in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and formation of 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that knockdown of CIT does not induce senescence in HCT116 cells. Generally, only a small induction of 53BP1 was evident in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g003">Fig 3B &amp; 3D</xref>), however many of the top hits for nuclear area and SAβGal expression, including ECT2, ESPL1, DDB1 and CDC45L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s007">S2 Fig</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), were also the most positive for both p21 and 53BP1, suggesting a coordinated senescence response to the knockdown of these mRNAs.</p>

<p>We found 9/16 siRNAs in p53 null HCT116 cells and 4/16 siRNAs in p21 null cells that increased both nuclear area and SAβGal expression. A further 4 siRNAs increased nuclear area but not SAβGal expression in p21 null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4A, 4C &amp; 4D</xref>). However, only 1 siRNA (KIF11) induced both phenotypes in addition to proliferation arrest as defined above in p53 null cells. A number of other siRNA did substantially reduce growth relative to scrambled control siRNA transfections, although the 100%-150% cutoff was not met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In the HCT116 p21 null cells, transfection of the majority of the top 16 siRNAs, with the exception of CIT, resulted in cell numbers well below plating density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that many cells died. However, the p21 null cells that remained viable after siRNA transfection expressed the other senescence phenotypes in many cases. It may be the case that this results from selective killing of non-senescent cells, while those that induce senescent phenotypes survive. However, further investigations would be required to determine this.</p>

<p>Conversely, the presence of <italic>PIK3CA</italic><sup><italic>H1047R</italic></sup> appeared to be required for a senescence response.

<p>Parental HCT116 cells showed “complete” senescence response to 2 siRNAs: ECT2 and ALDOA. Interestingly, the siRNA targeting ECT2 induced among the strongest increases in nuclear area across all of the isogenic HCT116 lines tested, along with siRNA against ESPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4B–4F</xref>). Knockdown of ECT2/ESPL1 also resulted in increased expression of SAβGal in all cell lines except p21 null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Furthermore, these were the only siRNAs to increase nuclear area and SAβGal expression in the HCT116 <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4A &amp; 4E</xref>), in contrast to parental and other HCT116 cells, which showed partial senescence responses involving these phenotypes to many of the siRNAs. Comparing responses, a more robust phenotype also including cytostasis was observed for both ECT2 and ALDOA in the presence of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> (parental cells), whereas only partial responses were observed in <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006942.t003">Table 3</xref>). For ECT2, both nuclear area and SAβGal expression were induced in <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells, but proliferation arrest did not occur. For ALDOA, only SaβGal induction was observed in <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells.</p>
<p>To further investigate these potential <italic>KRAS</italic> dependent effects on the senescence response, we characterised the SASP of parental and <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells after transfection with these siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Mutliplex chemiluminescent ELISA assays were performed to detect nine pro-inflammatory cytokines. The same cut-off of greater than mean + 3SD of scrambled control by at least 2/3 siRNA in 2/3 experiments was used for assignment of increase. ALDOA knockdown caused a complex inflammatory phenotype involving increased levels of GM-CSF, IL2 and IL8 in both cell lines. In the absence of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>, IL1β, IL6, and IL12-p70 were also induced. In parental cells, instead, IFNγ and IL10 were upregulated. In contrast, ECT2 knockdown produced less complex effects. In <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells, GM-CSF and IL8 were induced. In the presence of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>, only IFNγ was increased.</p>
<p>We additionally performed assays for activated caspase 3/7 in parental HCT116 cells after ECT2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). While the positive control CDK1 siRNA increased levels by 1.8-fold, ECT2 knockdown did not increase activated caspase 3/7. Examination of the levels of ECT2 mRNA detected in microarray analysis after transfection confirmed that the message was reduced to 45% of the level of scrambled control in parental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006942.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ECT2 induces multiple markers of senescence including growth arrest without caspase activation specifically in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant cells, while inducing a SASP phenotype that may suggest sensitisation to apoptotic triggers due to the known involvement of IFNγ in death receptor signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Knock-down of ECT2 can induce senescence markers in a <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> dependent manner</title>
<p>ECT2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RHO family of GTPases and has been associated with regulation of RAS–MAPK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref023">23</xref>]. This and the induction of a more robust senescence phenotype in the presence of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> led us to focus on ECT2. To further investigate the relationship between the senescence response to ECT2 down-regulation and the <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> mutation, we tested the spontaneously immortalised non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line MCF10a and its isogenic derivative MCF10a <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D/+</italic></sup>, in which the <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> allele is knocked-in at the endogenous locus. We also analysed an additional colorectal cancer cell line DLD1, which, like HCT116, has a <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> mutation, and an isogenic counterpart in which the mutated <italic>KRAS</italic> allele is knocked out to leave only wild-type KRAS (DLD1 <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>).</p>
<p>Combined results from all repeats of each individual ECT2 siRNA transfection in this focussed cell panel showed significant increases in nuclear area in all cell lines except the MCF10a isogenic pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We did see a slight but significant increase in SAβGal expression in parental MCF10a cells with ECT2 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). SAβGal expression was significantly increased in response to ECT2 knock-down in the presence and absence of <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> in DLD1 cell lines, but the increase did not reach significance in the HCT116 lines; this effect was strongest in the DLD1 parental cells with the <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>Analysing the results according to the cut-off values used previously (at least 2/3 siRNAs increase marker levels beyond mean of scrambled + 3SD in at least 2/3 experiments), we used heat-maps to summarise the expression of all 4 senescence biomarkers in our <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> isogenic cell line panel. In the non-transformed MCF10a isogenic pair ECT2 knock-down did not reproducibly induce the expression of any biomarker, whereas in HCT116 cell lines the increase in nuclear area and expression of SAβGal was detected in at least 2 out of 3 experiments in both the parental and the <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells, as before. High levels of p21 and 53BP1 were detected in HCT116 parental cells, but no positive increase in <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells, suggesting a more robust senescence response in the presence of oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>. This was further corroborated in the DLD1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), although no significant induction of p21 or 53BP1 was detected in these cells. Analysis of MCF10a proliferation showed a low level of toxicity as defined previously (83% survival), while scrambled transfectants grew to only 149% of seeding density. As noted, this mild toxicity occurred without evidence of induction of any senescence markers. <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant cells were sensitive to transfection (47% survival after transfection with scrambled siRNA). However, the relative reduction with ECT2 was similar (24% of seeding density), again without induction of senescence markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Therefore, in this cell panel, engagement of senescence in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant background also appeared to be specific for cancer cells. Further studies will be required to evaluate the relative sensitivity of a wider range of normal and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant cancer cells. It is known that DLD1 are particularly reliant on mutant KRAS signalling for proliferation in soft agar (surrogate 3D conditions) compared with standard tissue culture 2D conditions. HCT116 cells display a similar phenotype, although the difference between WT/mut (parental) and WT/- (KRAS +/-) genotypes is far less pronounced than DLD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref024">24</xref>]. We therefore analysed the more sensitive DLD1 system to determine whether ECT2 knockdown affects this phenotype. In our hands, DLD1 <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells proliferated poorly in soft agar, although they grew normally on tissue culture plastic as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We examined the link between KRAS and ECT2 in these conditions. Knockdown of KRAS reduced proliferation in DLD1 parental cells grown in 2D and 3D, but had a greater effect in 3D conditions, as did other published KRAS synthetic lethal targets such as PLK1 and GATA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref026">26</xref>]. ECT2 knock-down in DLD1 parental cells reduced proliferation modestly in 2D, but substantially in 3D conditions, to around 10% of the non-targeting control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006942.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), consistent with a senescence response in these conditions, which better model growth in vivo.</p>

<p>Finally, to investigate the signalling networks underlying the senescence response to ECT2 knock-down in the presence or absence of <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>, we used network modelling to interrogate gene expression profiles of HCT116 parental and <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells transfected with siRNA targeting ECT2.

Diverging networks show reduced signalling from RAC1 towards MYC in HCT116 parental cells, leading to down-regulation of CDC25B and cell cycle arrest, consistent with the robust senescence response. In HCT116 <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cells, signalling from RAC1 leads to an up-regulation of cell cycle signalling through cyclin D1 to CDK6. Expression of CDK6 is associated with G1/S progression; this might contribute to a weaker senescence response, although this warrants further investigation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The concept of inducing senescence for cancer treatment is an attractive one that has gained interest recently. The presence of residual senescence signalling in various advanced tumour types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref004">4</xref>] and the detection of senescence biomarkers in response to standard chemo- and radiotherapy regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref002">2</xref>] suggests that pro-senescence therapy, either alone or in combination with established therapies, may improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref003">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of senescence biomarkers in pre-malignant or benign lesions suggests that novel agents that are able to induce senescence in tumour cells might have reduced systemic toxicity and fewer side-effects than standard treatments, improving prognosis where senescence can be robustly achieved.</p>
<p>To identify and realise the potential of pro-senescence therapies we need to understand the complex nature of senescence signalling, especially in cancer cells, and to identify robust biomarkers of this response. Here we describe the identification and validation of a panel of siRNAs that induce a spectrum of senescence responses in two cancer cell lines, A375P melanoma and HCT116 colorectal carcinoma. Many of the top siRNA hits targeted genes were involved in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of DNA integrity, consistent with the senescence phenotype. Proteasomal and ubiquitin-protein transferase activities also featured strongly, with a number of proteasome family members in the siRNA target list. This is consistent with reduced proteolytic activity and down-regulation of proteasome β-catalytic subunits reported in human primary fibroblasts senescing <italic>in vitro</italic> and in ageing human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref027">27</xref>]. Moreover, the treatment of cultured primary fibroblasts with specific proteasome inhibitors induces a senescence-like phenotype that includes irreversible growth arrest and expression of SAβGal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref028">28</xref>]. In addition we found that siRNA knock-down of AURKB induced nuclear size increase and expression of SAβGal in both A375P and HCT116 cells, consistent with and confirming the results of a parallel compound-based screen for senescence effectors in IMR90 human diploid fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, siRNA knock-down of AURKB, BUB1B, ECT2, INCENP, KIF11 and CIT induced large nuclear morphologies that were associated with mitotic defects and growth arrest in a large-scale phenotypic screen in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>To validate the observed responses, we investigated the expression of two other established senescence biomarkers, senescence effector p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref008">8</xref>], and DDR factor 53BP1, in 16 of the most robust siRNA hits in both A375P and HCT116 cells. DNA damage components are widely used as senescence markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref030">30</xref>]. The extent of senescence response following gene knockdown depended on both the genetic background and cell type. Some siRNAs, including those targeting DDB1, PSMA5 and ECT2, induced a robust senescence response with expression of all 4 biomarkers in both cell types, while others, such as those targeting CIT, induced a weak response involving only increased nuclear area and SAβGal expression in A375P and little to no induction of p21 or 53BP1 in either cell line. This situation is consistent with a partial senescence response where genes might contribute to senescence evasion but are not crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Indeed, considering effects on cell proliferation, a large percentage of hits could induce combinations of senescence associated phenotypes in cell lines lacking key normal senescence effectors p53 (commonly mutated in various cancer types) or p21. Senescence in a p21 null background has previously been shown in murine fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref033">33</xref>]; and in HCT116 isogenic cell lines the plant tannin gallotannin was shown to induce a senescence response independent of p53 or p21 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref034">34</xref>]. Similarly neonatal human melanocytes senesce without expressing p53 or p21, just p16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref035">35</xref>] and benign nevi likewise have p16 and rarely express p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref036">36</xref>]. However, in our experiments, induction of the full spectrum of markers including growth arrest was limited to KIF11 in the p53 deficient background, while effects on cell number consistent with toxicity were observed in most cases in the p21 null background. It is well known that many existing toxic and targeted agents are capable of causing senescence in a subset of cells, despite the main phenotype caused being cell death, and this may be the most common mode of senescence induction in p21 null cells. The senescent phenotype results from the complex co-operative interaction of various signalling pathways, so it is not surprising that, in the right context, cells with a particular defect can still respond at least partially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref037">37</xref>]. Our study therefore highlights the spectrum of “senescence-like” phenotypes that can arise in different mutational contexts.</p>
<p>Activating mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> have been described in various cancer types including non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancers and in around 50% of colorectal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref038">38</xref>]. However RAS proteins have appeared undruggable until recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus research has focussed on targeting RAS signalling pathways and downstream effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref038">38</xref>] including <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> and PI3Kα (PIK3CA). Ten of our 16 top siRNA hits in HCT116 cells in which <italic>PIK3CA</italic><sup><italic>H1047R</italic></sup> was deleted induced senescence markers, yet none of them arrested proliferation, notably suggesting dependence of the actual arrest upon oncogenic <italic>PIK3CA</italic> in HCT116 cells. Analysis of the response in the HCT116 isogenic line lacking the activating <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> mutation revealed that only siRNAs targeting ALDOA and ECT2 were capable of inducing SAβGal and nuclear area in this background. ECT2 also reduced proliferation in this background, though not as robustly as the parental cells.</p>
<p>ECT2 (epithelial cell transforming 2) is a known oncogene that is upregulated in various cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref040">40</xref>] and associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref041">41</xref>] and astrocytoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref042">42</xref>]. Prognostic significance of elevated ECT2 mRNA expression has been evaluated and positively correlated with protein expression in a range of cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref044">44</xref>]. Its regulation is relatively understudied. However, ECT2 expression is known to be transcriptionally regulated through the cell cycle and during DNA damage to control mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref046">46</xref>]. Regulation of ECT mRNA stability via FXR1 may also contribute to FXR1 oncogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref047">47</xref>], while the tumour suppressor effects of miR-223 may be partly mediated by targeting the ECT2 3’UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>From a therapeutic standpoint, siRNA knock-down of ECT2 in glioblastoma cell lines caused decreased proliferation, migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref049">49</xref>], and mice with U251 astrocytoma cell line xenografts expressing ECT2 shRNAs showed significantly greater survival than non-targeting shRNA controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref042">42</xref>], making it an interesting target. Our druggability assessment for ECT2 showed no known drugs available to target this gene or other family members; however the protein structure is available and revealed potential druggable sites that could be exploited for drug development. It will be of interest in future studies to develop inducible ECT2 knockout systems to more thoroughly investigate the mechanisms and downstream effects of senescence induction when all cells in the population are targeted.</p>
<p>ECT2 regulates cell fate in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> through RAS–MAPK signalling via crosstalk from the RHO-1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref023">23</xref>]. Here, knockdown of ECT2 induced a more complete senescence response in HCT116 cells with <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>, but not in MCF10a non-neoplastic breast epithelial cells irrespective of <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup>, suggesting a possible tumour-specific effect. Furthermore, SaβGal was significantly induced in DLD1 parental line with <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> in comparison to the KRAS<sup>+/-</sup> derivative. These links between ECT2 and RAS signalling make this an attractive and novel target worthy of further investigation for pro-senescence therapy of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant tumours. Moreover ECT2 was recently identified in a large siRNA screen as being required for the survival and proliferation of KRAS transformed HCT116 cells, but not those lacking mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref025">25</xref>]; and knockdown of KRAS, ECT2 and other KRAS synthetic lethal targets PLK1 and GATA2, in parental DLD1 cells substantially reduced growth in 3D in our hands.</p>
<p>We used network analysis to show that knockdown of ECT2 leads to further mRNA changes in a large number of genes closely associated with its signalling pathway. A similar approach was taken by Long and colleagues to infer ECT2 signalling mechanisms in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref050">50</xref>]. Our findings point to significant downregulation of Rac1 and PKC signalling, both of which are in line with the known signalling functions of ECT2, in addition to upregulation of p21 and modulation of multiple other cell cycle and cytoskeletal genes such as vimentin and cdc25. Together, these results are in line with the effects on senescence that we observed in our screening assays.</p>
<p>The screen described here provides proof-of-concept of the ability to induce and detect novel senescence effectors in cancer cells, some with actions enhanced by common oncogenic mutations. Consistent with recent observations, a range of senescence responses was detected, highlighting the importance of using multiple phenotypes to measure the extent of the response induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref006">6</xref>]. One of our most robust hits, ECT2 siRNA, had the ability to engage a senescence response enhanced by mutant <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G13D</italic></sup> and therefore shows promise as a target for senescence induction therapy for a range of cancers harbouring this mutation. However, to realise the full potential of candidate targets and markers identified in screening, appropriate routes to translation need to be established. We have previously investigated plasma markers of human ageing and DNA damage in gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006942.ref051">51</xref>]. Furthermore, we have recently initiated two large, prospective, longitudinal studies to evaluate multiple candidate senescence biomarkers including ECT2 (UK Clinical Research Network trials 12434 and 12435). Ultimately, validation of novel markers and targets in well-defined human cancer populations will be required to accelerate the field of senescence therapeutics.</p>
