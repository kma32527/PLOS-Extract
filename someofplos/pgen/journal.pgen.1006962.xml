<abstract>
<p>Impairment of the autophagy pathway has been observed during the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal deposition of extracellular and intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. Yet the role of autophagy in Aβ production and AD progression is complex. To study whether increased basal autophagy plays a beneficial role in Aβ clearance and cognitive improvement, we developed a novel genetic model to hyperactivate autophagy in vivo. We found that knock-in of a point mutation F121A in the essential autophagy gene Beclin 1/<italic>Becn1</italic> in mice significantly reduces the interaction of BECN1 with its inhibitor BCL2, and thus leads to constitutively active autophagy even under non-autophagy-inducing conditions in multiple tissues, including brain. <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>-mediated autophagy hyperactivation significantly decreases amyloid accumulation, prevents cognitive decline, and restores survival in AD mouse models. Using an immunoisolation method, we found biochemically that Aβ oligomers are autophagic substrates and sequestered inside autophagosomes in the brain of autophagy-hyperactive AD mice. In addition to genetic activation of autophagy by <italic>Becn1</italic> gain-of-function, we also found that ML246, a small-molecule autophagy inducer, as well as voluntary exercise, a physiological autophagy inducer, exert similar <italic>Becn1</italic>-dependent protective effects on Aβ removal and memory in AD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that genetically disrupting BECN1-BCL2 binding hyperactivates autophagy in vivo, which sequestrates amyloid oligomers and prevents AD progression. The study establishes new approaches to activate autophagy in the brain, and reveals the important function of <italic>Becn1</italic>-mediated autophagy hyperactivation in the prevention of AD.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Accumulation of amyloid β peptides (Aβ) is a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although many efforts have been made, no effective therapies are available to cure AD. Autophagy is a stress-induced pathway nerve cells use to dispose damaged structures, and may be a strategy to eliminate Aβ aggregation. However, direct evidence of autophagic disposal of Aβ is lacking. Here we described a new AD mouse model that shows high autophagy activity even under non-autophagy-inducing conditions. In these mice, we engineered a single mutation into a key autophagy gene <italic>Becn1</italic>, which disrupts an inhibitory binding and leads to constitutively active autophagy in brain. Compared to regular AD mice, the autophagy-hyperactive AD mice are protected from amyloid accumulation, memory deficits and high mortality. We also isolated autophagic vesicle from these mice by an antibody, and found that Aβ oligomers are incorporated inside the vesicles. Thus, we obtained direct evidence for the first time that oligomerized amyloids are substrates of autophagy. These findings are important, as we demonstrated the reversal of AD progression by modulating the activity of a single autophagy gene. Our findings also revealed the therapeutic potential of brain-permeable autophagy-inducing chemicals in the prevention of AD by reducing intracellular amyloids.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein aggregation and deposition, leading to progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline among elderly populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref001">1</xref>]. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the two primary hallmarks of AD pathology, and aging is a major known risk factor of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref003">3</xref>]. Amyloid plaques are formed by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, generated by sequential enzymatic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref005">5</xref>]. Besides the well-recognized extracellular deposition of Aβ, recent studies also revealed the accumulation of intracellular pools of Aβ in AD brain. Intracellular Aβ can be generated at the trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum as part of the secretory pathway, or be reuptaken by neurons and glial cells from the secreted extracellular pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref007">7</xref>]. Although many therapeutic efforts have been made to eliminate Aβ aggregation and deposition at either the synthesis or the degradation stage, no effective therapies are available so far to cure AD, and the mechanism driving the neurodegenerative progression remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal catabolic pathway regulated by autophagy-related (ATG) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref010">10</xref>]. Autophagy is induced by stress conditions such as hypoxia, starvation or oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref012">12</xref>]; upon autophagy induction, autophagosomes sequester cytoplasmic components and fuse with lysosomes to generate autolysosomes, in which degradation of the autophagic cargos occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref014">14</xref>]. Although many studies have reported the roles of autophagy in the elimination of wasteful components, including protein aggregates, the relationship between autophagy and AD progression is complex. Several lines of evidence suggest an impairment of the autophagy pathway in the pathogenesis of AD. Brain from AD patients shows an abnormal accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and a reduction in the level of Beclin 1/BECN1, an essential autophagy protein and ortholog of ATG6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref016">16</xref>]. However, direct evidence of autophagosome-mediated degradation of Aβ or APP in brain is lacking. Paradoxically, autophagy has been reported to promote, rather than reduce, the production of Aβ. Knockout (KO) of an essential autophagy gene <italic>Atg7</italic> specifically in forebrain excitatory neurons of AD mice decreases extracellular amyloid plaque formation, which is due to reduced processing and secretion of Aβ; however, these <italic>Atg7</italic> KO mice have exacerbated memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref017">17</xref>], suggesting that the intracellular level of amyloids, which may be regulated by autophagy, may play a key role in cognitive impairment in AD. It is also under debate whether the level of the precursor protein APP is directly regulated by autophagy in either rodent brain or primary neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref019">19</xref>]. On the other hand, enhancing lysosomal degradation capacity by genetic deletion of Cystatin B, a suppressor of lysosomal cysteine proteases, or use of autophagy-inducing chemicals such as a phytochemical Rg2 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, reduces amyloid burden and memory deficit in mouse models of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref022">22</xref>]. However, the mechanism of these compounds remains enigmatic. In addition, although knockout of autophagy genes leads to neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref024">24</xref>], it is unknown whether physiologically increased basal autophagy prevents neurotoxicity of Aβ and has beneficial effects in protecting against Alzheimer’s-like diseases.</p>
<p>Thus, to directly assess the function of physiological enhancement of autophagy in vivo, we generated and characterized a unique mouse model of constitutively active autophagy caused by a single knockin mutation (F121A) in <italic>Becn1</italic>. We crossed these autophagy-hyperactive mice with the 5XFAD transgenic AD mice, which overexpress a combination of 5 familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) mutations in human APP and human PS1 (presenilin 1) proteins and show early amyloid deposition beginning at 2 months of age and cognitive decline at 6 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref025">25</xref>]. We demonstrated that elevated basal autophagy targets Aβ oligomers, and significantly reduces the accumulation of Aβ, but not APP. Genetic hyperactivation of autophagy also ameliorates neuronal dysfunction and enhances survival in AD mice. In addition to genetic activation of autophagy, we also found that autophagy hyperactivation either pharmacologically by a novel compound ML246 or physiologically by voluntary exercise protects AD mice from amyloid deposition and memory loss. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that hyperactive autophagy caused by a single mutation in <italic>Becn1</italic> sequesters amyloids and restores memory in AD, and also establishes the first genetic model of constitutively active autophagy as a useful in vivo tool to study autophagy in different diseases.</p>

<title>A knockin point mutation F121A in <italic>Becn1</italic> leads to constitutively high autophagy in vivo</title>
<p>To study how autophagy physiologically regulates the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we generated a new knock-in mouse model with hyperactive autophagy, by genetically disrupting the nutrient-regulated interaction between BECN1 and its inhibitor BCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Reversible BECN1-BCL2 binding is an important regulatory mechanism of autophagy induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref026">26</xref>]. When nutrients are abundant, BECN1 is bound and inhibited by BCL2, an anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagy protein. In response to stress such as starvation, BECN1 is released from the inhibitory binding of BCL2 for autophagy function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref028">28</xref>]. The BCL2 binding site in human BECN1 is reported as F123 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref027">27</xref>]. We found that F121 in the BH3 domain of mouse BECN1 is the corresponding conserved residue of human F123. Thus, we proposed that mutating the residue F121 (TTT) to an alanine (A, GCT) disrupts BECN1-BCL2 binding and leads to constitutive activation of BECN1 and autophagy in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We then generated a global knock-in mouse line (<italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s001">S1A–S1C Fig</xref>), and found that the homozygous <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice are viable, fertile, of normal size and weight, and display normal histology in major organs under normal housing conditions. The BECN1 protein expression level in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice is also comparable to that in WT mice in multiple major organs, including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, liver and pancreas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice, there is much less interaction between BECN1 and BCL2 in both skeletal muscle and brain than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that the F121A mutation significantly weakens BCL2 binding to BECN1 in vivo.</p>

<p>To determine whether these mice have hyperactive autophagy, we crossed them with the GFP-LC3 autophagy reporter mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref029">29</xref>]. Upon autophagy induction, diffusely distributed autophagosome marker protein LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form lipidated LC3 (LC3-II), which specifically associates with autophagosomal membranes and can be resolved by western blot or visualized as fluorescent puncta. We found that under non-autophagy-inducing conditions (fed and resting), <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> knock-in mice exhibit a higher number of GFP-LC3 puncta (autophagosomes) in both skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) than wild-type (WT) mice, which reaches similar levels under autophagy-inducing conditions (90-min treadmill exercise or 48-h starvation). These data suggest that <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice show high basal autophagy. To determine that the increment of autophagosomes in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice is due to elevated autophagic flux, rather than a block in autophagosome degradation, we analyzed the autophagy flux by inhibiting lysosomal degradation using the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. In skeletal muscle of <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice, chloroquine injection led to more accumulation of LC3 and GFP-LC3 puncta compared to WT mice, measured by western blot analyses and microscopy, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, compared to WT mice, <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice showed a lower level of p62, an autophagy cargo protein, in skeletal muscle, which was rescued by chloroquine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These data suggest that the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mutation in mice leads to higher autophagic degradation of LC3 and p62. Altogether, we conclude that mutating F121 to A disrupts BECN1-BCL2 binding and constitutively activates autophagy in mice, thus providing a novel mouse model with hyperactive autophagy as a useful tool to analyze the physiological effects of autophagy upregulation in vivo.</p>

<title><italic>Becn1</italic> F121A decreases amyloid accumulation and improves cognitive function in the 5XFAD Alzheimer’s mouse model</title>
<p>To determine the effects of autophagy activation on AD, we crossed the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mice with the 5XFAD mice, an amyloid mouse model used in AD research. 5XFAD mice demonstrate early and aggressive phenotypes of intraneuronal Aβ42 aggregates, β-amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration, and represent a good model for our study. We analyzed the amyloid burden in the resulting 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice by dot blot assays, ELISA and microscopy at the age of 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>). The dot blot assay has been previously validated to measure levels of Aβ42 in APP transgenic mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref030">30</xref>]. We found that 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice show lower levels of both soluble and insoluble Aβ42 in the brain than the 5XFAD mice by dot blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), whereas expression of the precursor APP remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup>-mediated hyperactive autophagy downregulates the levels of Aβ42, but not of APP. This is also confirmed by ELISA analyses on the level of total brain Aβ42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Furthermore, staining of amyloid plaques by Thioflavin S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) or Aβ42 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) showed that there is a significant reduction of amyloid plaques in the cortex and a trend of reduction in the hippocampus of 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice.</p>

<p>Importantly, <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>-induced reduction in Aβ42 is dependent on autophagy but not other pathways that regulate amyloid transport. We found that short-term (7-day) treatment of 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mice with SBI-0206965, an autophagy inhibitor blocking the kinase activity of an essential upstream kinase ULK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref031">31</xref>], abolished the reduction in brain Aβ42 levels by dot blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Similarly, in HEK293 cells stably expressing APP and <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>, siRNA knockdown of the essential autophagy gene <italic>ATG7</italic> significantly increased the level of intracellular Aβ42 by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). The reduced Aβ42 level is not due to alterations in APP trafficking in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mice, as immunofluorescence microscopy showed no detectable difference in the amount of APP colocalized with Rab5+ early endosomes or Rab7+ late endosomes in primary cortical neurons isolated from PDAPP <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice and PDAPP <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice (PDAPP mice is another amyloid model as described below) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we also biochemically analyzed APP internalization and trafficking, by biotin protection assays using HEK293 cells stably expressing APP and WT <italic>Becn1</italic> or <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> (the endogenous <italic>BECN1</italic> was deleted by CRISPR/Cas9) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). After inducing endocytic trafficking of cell surface APP by incubating the cells at 37°C for 5 min or 15 min, we observed a similar level of APP endocytosis (represented by biotinylated APP that is protected from glutathione stripping) in cells expressing WT <italic>Becn1</italic> and expressing <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>. Thus, altogether, these results demonstrated that <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> does not affect APP trafficking. In addition, 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mice expressed a similar level of amyloid receptors in the brain that contribute to the clearance of Aβ, such as LDLR (Low-density lipoprotein receptor) and LRP1 (LDLR-related protein 1), compared to 5XFAD mice expressing WT <italic>Becn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Thus, altogether, we conclude that the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> knockin mutation reduces amyloid accumulation, and the effect of <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> on Aβ metabolism is mediated by the hyperactive autophagy activity.</p>
<p>Next, to analyze memory function, we performed Morris water maze tests on WT mice and AD mice with normal or high autophagy. During the visible platform training, all 3 groups of mice showed no significant difference in either escape latency or distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), suggesting that there was no visual or swimming abnormality among all groups. In contrast, during the hidden platform trials, 5XFAD mice expressing WT <italic>Becn1</italic> showed apparent deficiency in memorizing the platform location, while 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice had significantly improved performance day by day in both escape latency and distance, similar to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). These data suggest that the memory impairment caused by Aβ accumulation is ameliorated by the <italic>Becn1</italic> F121A mutation. Overall, we conclude that genetic stimulation of basal autophagy mediated by <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> reduces Aβ42 levels and plaque formation in mouse brain, and improves memory capacity that is impaired by amyloid aggregation in AD.</p>

<title><italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> increases survival of PDAPP AD mice</title>
<p>To fully analyze the function of the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> allele in AD, we used another amyloid mouse model, known as PDAPP mice. These mice carry a V717F (Indiana) mutation in APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref032">32</xref>], and exhibit extracellular amyloid deposition starting at 6–9 months of age.

We crossed PDAPP mice with either the autophagy-hyperactive <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice, or autophagy-deficient <italic>Bcl2</italic><sup>AAA</sup> mice. <italic>Bcl2</italic><sup>AAA</sup> mice contain 3 knock-in alanine mutations (T69A, S70A and S84A) at the phosphorylation residues of BCL2, which block BCL2 phosphorylation and BECN1 release from BCL2 binding; thus, they are opposite to the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mice and show defective autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref035">35</xref>]. Notably, homozygous expression of the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mutation decreased mortality in PDAPP mice, while the autophagy-deficient PDAPP <italic>Bcl2</italic><sup>AAA</sup> mice showed a trend of exacerbated mortality compared to the PDAPP mice with normal autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

<title>Autophagy stimulation by ML246 and voluntary exercise reduces Aβ accumulation and improves cognitive function in 5XFAD mice</title>
<p>In addition to <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>-mediated genetic activation of autophagy, we decided to further study whether stimulating autophagy pharmacologically is also protective against neurodegenerative progression. We recently identified a brain-penetrable autophagy-inducing small molecule ML246 (metarrestin)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), and analyzed its effects on the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro analyses, we utilized the HEK293 cell line stably expressing APP (APP-HEK293), in which the produced Aβ molecules are efficiently secreted, to study the effect of ML246 on amyloid metabolism. Via dot blot assays, we found that ML246 treatment for 24 h significantly reduced the level of secreted Aβ in the conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In addition, cultured WT primary cortical neurons treated with the conditioned media from ML246-treated APP-HEK293 cells underwent a lower level of apoptotic cell death than those treated with media from vehicle-treated APP-HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These results demonstrate that ML246 reduces amyloid production and secretion in vitro. Importantly, siRNA knockdown of the essential autophagy gene <italic>ATG7</italic> in APP-HEK293 cells reversed the ML246-mediated reduction of both secreted Aβ42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and apoptotic neuronal death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting that the effect of ML246 in amyloid metabolism is autophagy-dependent.</p>

<p>In addition to the amyloid cell model, we also found that ML246 promotes the removal of intracellular aggregates formed by polyglutamine (polyQ)-expansion proteins. We used HeLa cell lines stably expressing tetracycline-repressible expanded polyQ-repeat protein HTT (huntingtin) as a model, HTT65Q and HTT103Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref037">37</xref>]. In contrast to the HTT protein with the normal number of glutamine repeats (HTT25Q), HTT65Q and HTT103Q formed insoluble polyQ aggregates larger than 0.2-μm in diameter, which can be detected by filter trap assay. We discovered that the accumulation of both HTT65Q and HTT103Q aggregates is decreased after ML246 treatment for 24 h, whereas knockdown of <italic>ATG7</italic> prevents this reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), suggesting that ML246 reduces intracellular protein aggregation, and this effect is dependent on the autophagy activity. Fluorescence imaging further confirmed that ML246 administration decreased the number of cells positive for HTT aggregates, which is also in an ATG7-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Thus, these data indicate that the autophagy pathway stimulated by ML246 promotes the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins (including both amyloid and polyQ expansion proteins) in vitro, and ML246 can be used as a candidate compound for in vivo analyses in AD mouse models.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we investigated the function of ML246-induced autophagy in amyloid accumulation and cognitive function in 5XFAD mice. Via dot blot assays, we found that compared to the ones treated with vehicle, 6-month old 5XFAD mice treated with ML246 for 5 weeks showed decreased levels of both soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) and insoluble Aβ42 in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). The expression of the precursor APP was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the level of Aβ42, but not APP, is regulated by autophagy. Notably, the effect of ML246 was abolished in the autophagy-deficient 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>), further supporting that ML246-induced reduction of Aβ42 in vivo is autophagy-dependent.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addition to pharmacological approaches, physical exercise has recently been demonstrated as a fast and robust physiological method to induce autophagy in various tissues, including brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref038">38</xref>]. Intriguingly, previous studies indicated that aerobic exercise decreases amyloid load in AD mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref042">42</xref>], and is also associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline among elderly populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that exercise-induced autophagy may represent a cellular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of exercise in AD brain. To test this hypothesis, we housed 2-month old 5XFAD mice individually with access to a running wheel for 16 weeks. Through dot blot assays on brain lysates, we found that 5XFAD mice subject to 16 weeks of voluntary running have significantly lower levels of both soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and insoluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) Aβ42 in brain than those housed under resting conditions (without running wheels), suggesting that physical exercise decreases the amyloid burden in AD mouse brain. Fluorescence microscopy also shows a significant reduction of amyloid plaques after exercise training, and a trend of plaque reduction after ML246 treatment, stained by thioflavin S or Aβ42 antibody in brain of 5XFAD mice, especially in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Similar to ML246 treatment, APP expression is not affected by exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). In comparison, exercise failed to reduce amyloid accumulation in the autophagy-deficient 5XFAD <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), suggesting that the autophagy pathway is required for the effects of exercise on amyloid accumulation.</p>

<p>Finally, to analyze whether the autophagy-inducing compound ML246 has the potential to improve the cognitive function of Alzheimer’s mice, we performed Morris water maze tests on 6-month old 5XFAD mice injected with ML246 daily for 5 weeks. We found that ML246 treatment, as well as 16-week voluntary exercise, improved the performance of 5XFAD mice during the hidden platform trials, compared to the vehicle-treated resting mice at the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). These data suggest that similar to exercise, the autophagy inducer ML246 ameliorates memory impairment in AD mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The role of autophagy in amyloid production and clearance has been unclear. In this study, we generated a mouse model with hyperactive autophagy by knocking-in a point mutation F121A to Beclin 1/<italic>Becn1</italic>, and found that <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>-mediated autophagy hyperactivation reduces brain amyloid accumulation, ameliorates cognitive deficits, and improves survival rates in Alzheimer’s mouse models.</p>
<p>BECN1 is a core component of the type III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex, and is key for the initiation of autophagosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref026">26</xref>]. Lentiviral overexpression of <italic>Becn1</italic> has been shown to reduce APP levels in cultured CHO cells or decrease amyloid deposition in AD mouse brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref016">16</xref>]. Yet it is unclear whether <italic>Becn1</italic> overexpression represents a physiological method for autophagy activation. Thus, we designed a strategy to constitutively activate autophagy in vivo by preventing BECN1 from binding with its inhibitor BCL2. Under nutrient rich conditions, BECN1 is bound and inhibited by BCL2; whereas in the presence of stress such as nutrient starvation and exercise, BCL2 is phosphorylated and released from BECN1, which activates autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref028">28</xref>] and represents a physiological regulatory mechanism of the function of <italic>Becn1</italic> in autophagy. In our new knock-in mouse model, the introduction of the F121A mutation in <italic>Becn1</italic> (F121A) disrupts the BCL2 binding site, resulting in the constitutive activation of BECN1 in autophagy that is no longer regulated by stress. In skeletal muscle and brain of the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mice, the autophagy levels under basal conditions are as high as those obtained after physical exercise or starvation in WT mice. Thus, we consequently crossed these mice with amyloid mouse models, including 5XFAD and PDAPP mice, to study the function of <italic>Becn1</italic>-mediated autophagy in AD. Given the roles of autophagy in a broad spectrum of diseases, this new mouse model can be a useful genetic tool to study the physiological effects of autophagy hyperactivation in multiple diseases.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup>-mediated autophagy hyperactivation decreases Aβ levels and improves memory in 5XFAD mice. Yet how the autophagy pathway downregulates intracellular Aβ still remains mysterious. Besides the plasma membrane, APP also localizes to the secretory pathway (such as the trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum), endosomes, lysosomes and mitochondria. We do not know whether it is the intracellular Aβ, or the extracellular secreted pool taken back up by cells, that is regulated by autophagy in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>FA/FA</sup> mice. Several studies also suggest that BECN1 promotes internalization and lysosomal trafficking of the precursor protein APP. In cultured neuronal and HEK293 cell lines, BECN1 has been reported to promote endocytosis and endolysosomal and autolysosomal proteolysis of plasma membrane APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref047">47</xref>]. The adaptor protein AP2 seems to interact with LC3 to target APP to autophagosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref019">19</xref>]. However, whether APP trafficking and degradation depends on other key components in the autophagy machinery is not known, and whether the process of autophagosome-mediated APP degradation occurs in AD mouse brain or neurons is still under debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref018">18</xref>]. Our data argue against a role of autophagy in regulating the levels of APP, since we found that <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> does not alter the level, internalization, or trafficking of APP in mouse brain, primary cortical neurons, or cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s005">S5B and S5C</xref> Figs), suggesting that the effect of <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> on amyloid metabolism is not through the regulation of APP.</p>
<p>The role of autophagy in the regulation of Aβ is more complex. On one hand, <italic>Becn1</italic> has been shown to be important for the phagocytosis and autophagic degradation of extracellular Aβ by cultured microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref049">49</xref>], and <italic>Becn1</italic>-deficient mice showed impaired Aβ clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref049">49</xref>], which is consistent with our findings. On the other hand, autophagy is suggested to facilitate Aβ processing and secretion from neurons, using neuroglioma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref050">50</xref>] and tissue-specific <italic>Atg7</italic> KO mice in excitatory forebrain neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref017">17</xref>]. Thus, our autophagy-hyperactive AD mouse model is useful to assess the overall readout of autophagy activation on Aβ levels in vivo (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g004">4</xref>). Using this model system, we biochemically detected Aβ oligomers in purified intact autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006962.g005">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting that autophagy plays a direct role in brain amyloid clearance. We propose a model in which autophagic degradation of Aβ occurs in both neurons and glial cells, where neuronal autophagy mainly degrades de-novo processed Aβ, whereas autophagy in glia removes Aβ reuptaken from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006962.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). As future directions, it will be interesting to determine whether the endocytic reuptake and trafficking machinery in neurons or glia is required for autophagic degradation of Aβ, and to discover what receptors are involved in the autophagosomal recognition of Aβ42-containing secretory or endocytic vesicles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, besides hyperactivating autophagy by genetic factors, we analyzed the effects of ML246, a novel autophagy-inducing compound that can pass the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref036">36</xref>], on Aβ accumulation and cognition in AD mice. Pharmacological strategies to modulate autophagy have been recently proposed in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref051">51</xref>]. Most autophagy inducers that have been tested are based on inhibiting the autophagy suppressor mTOR, such as the well-known mTOR inhibitor rapamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref053">53</xref>], which seems to be effective to decrease Aβ levels and prevent cognitive impairment in AD mice when used at early stages prior to the formation of extracellular plaques. Here we showed that ML246 is able to decrease protein aggregates in cultured cells, and reduce Aβ levels and ameliorate memory deficit in 5XFAD mice, and notably, we started compound treatment at the age of 4–5 months when amyloid deposition has already been documented in this AD mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref025">25</xref>]. Thus, ML246 is a new autophagy activator of neuroprotective function and potential use in AD treatment, although the signaling pathways and mechanisms by which ML246 induces autophagy are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In addition to genetic and compound inducers of autophagy, we also studied whether activating autophagy by physiological methods prevents AD. Starvation and exercise are the best-known physiological inducers of autophagy in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref054">54</xref>]. Interestingly, although starvation induces detectable formation of autophagosomes in neurons of 3-month 5XFAD mice after 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref056">56</xref>], it seems ineffective in removing intra-neuronal or extracellular Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref056">56</xref>], likely due to insufficient degradation of Aβ-containing autolysosomes after short-term starvation. In comparison, exercise, either forced exercise by treadmill or voluntary exercise by running wheel, has been recently shown to increase the autophagy flux in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and cerebral cortex in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref057">57</xref>]. Thus, we investigated the effects of physical exercise in AD, and demonstrated that 4 months of voluntary running exerted positive effects on animal behavior and amyloid pathology in brain of 5XFAD mice. It should be noted that we started voluntary exercise at the age of 2 months prior to any detectable cognitive impairment. Physical exercise has previously been suggested to play a beneficial role against cognitive decline in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref042">42</xref>], but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We showed for the first time that compared with AD mice with normal autophagy activity, exercise is not able to reduce amyloid deposition in brain of autophagy-deficient AD mice, suggesting that exercise-induced autophagy may be an important mechanism mediating some of the beneficial effects of exercise on AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref054">54</xref>], although exercise may affect other pathways that also contribute to the exercise-mediated neuroprotective effects. Intriguingly, treadmill exercise does not seem to be as effective as voluntary wheel running to prevent neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref040">40</xref>]. It is likely that the stress associated with forced running on the treadmill exerts detrimental effects on animal behavior and disease pathogenesis. Finally, considering that one key problem in AD is the late diagnosis of the disease that significantly reduces the effectiveness of subsequent treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006962.ref059">59</xref>], voluntary exercise should be considered as an important component in modern lifestyle to effectively induce autophagy and prevent cognitive decline as a non-pharmacological intervention.</p>
<p>In summary, in this study we developed 3 new strategies to potently activate autophagy in the brain, genetic (by the <italic>Becn1</italic><sup>F121A</sup> mutation), pharmacological (by ML246), and physiological (by voluntary exercise). Using the different approaches, we provided evidence that autophagy induction ameliorates amyloid pathology and reduces cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice. Our data revealed the potential of autophagy stimulation in lowering toxic aggregate-prone proteins and improving neuronal functions for the treatment of AD.</p>

<title>Morris water maze testing</title>
<p>For animal behavior, 6-month old mice were tested. The Morris water maze test consists of two sections: the visible platform testing and hidden platform testing. During the tests, mice were placed in the water tank filled with opaque water (maintained at 25°C), with their heads facing toward the tank wall. In the visible platform section, a black platform extending 2 cm above the water level was used for these trials. For each trial, the platform was randomly positioned, and the mouse was placed in the tank at different start positions. The trial was stopped after the mouse found and climbed onto the platform, and the escape latency was recorded. The trial was stopped if the mouse did not climb onto the platform in 60 s, and the experimenter guided it to the platform. Mice were tested for 4 days with eight trials per day. In the hidden platform section, a transparent platform underneath the water level was used instead of the black one during all trials, mice were tested with a fixed platform location over 5 days period with six trials per day, and they were allowed to search the platform in 60 s. In the tests, two parameters were evaluated: the trail duration (s) and distance to the platform (m).</p>

<p>Snap frozen hemi-brain were homogenized in 800 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, D8537) with 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with halt proteinase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific), and halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific). Protein concentration was quantified using BCA Assay (Pierce). For Aβ42 dot blots, 10 mg/ml brain homogenates were extracted in guanidine buffer (5 M guanidine-HCl [GuHCl], 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0) overnight at room temperature. One μl of sample was spotted in triplicate on 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane, and dried for 1 h at 37°C. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S, and the dot blot signal on the membrane was detected by immunostaining with Aβ42 antibody (Invitrogen, 700254, 1:1000) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc2004, 1:2000). Aβ42 signals were normalized to the Ponceau S staining. To separate soluble and insoluble Aβ fractions, 10 mg/ml of the total homogenated brains were centrifuged at 14000 rpm, 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was used directly for dot blot assays. The pellet (insoluble fraction) was extracted in guanidine buffer overnight at room temperature, and used in dot blot analyses.
