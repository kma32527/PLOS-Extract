<abstract>
<p>Large-scale sequencing efforts have captured a rapidly growing catalogue of genetic variations. However, the accurate establishment of gene variant pathogenicity remains a central challenge in translating personal genomics information to clinical decisions. Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (<italic>IRF6</italic>) gene variants are significant genetic contributors to orofacial clefts. Although approximately three hundred <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants have been documented, their effects on protein functions remain difficult to interpret. Here, we demonstrate the protein functions of human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants could be rapidly assessed in detail by their abilities to rescue the <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> phenotype in zebrafish through variant mRNA microinjections at the one-cell stage. The results revealed many missense variants previously predicted by traditional statistical and computational tools to be loss-of-function and pathogenic retained partial or full protein function and rescued the zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> periderm rupture phenotype. Through mRNA dosage titration and analysis of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database, <italic>IRF6</italic> missense variants were grouped by their abilities to rescue at various dosages into three functional categories: wild type function, reduced function, and complete loss-of-function. This sensitive and specific biological assay was able to address the nuanced functional significances of <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants and overcome many limitations faced by current statistical and computational tools in assigning variant protein function and pathogenicity. Furthermore, it unlocked the possibility for characterizing yet undiscovered human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants from orofacial cleft patients, and illustrated a generalizable functional genomics paradigm in personalized medicine.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Advances in sequencing technologies have led to rapid increases in personalized genetics information. Millions of differences exist when comparing the genomes of two individuals, accounting for the diversity of humans and occasionally disease pathogenicity. Accurate determination of the functional consequences of these differences is critical for translating personal genetic information into clinical decision. Various methods have been devised to meet this challenge. However, they are imperfect, especially in their abilities to interpret rare variants. Rare variants must be evaluated by multi-pronged approaches to establish disease pathogenicity, one crucial approach being functional testing through experimental models. Here, we utilized a zebrafish model to rapidly evaluate the protein functions of rare gene variants of <italic>IRF6</italic>, a gene of established importance in orofacial cleft pathogenesis. <italic>IRF6</italic> functions are well-conserved across species, and allowed us to test the functions of human <italic>IRF6</italic> variants by their abilities to rescue zebrafish embryos depleted of <italic>irf6</italic>. Many variants previously labeled pathogenic and loss-of-function retained full wild type-level protein activity, suggesting they could potentially represent benign, rather than disease-causing genetic variations. This paradigm is applicable to other genes and will allow researchers to rapidly triage gene variants for further study and clinicians to provide more accurate genetic diagnoses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies has ushered in a new era of personalized medicine for a myriad of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref001">1</xref>]. Large-scale consortia sequencing efforts have documented thousands of whole exomes and genomes from both disease patients and the general population, and captured a growing catalogue of genetic variations for statistical comparisons and analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref002">2</xref>]. However, a frequent challenge in the analysis of human gene variants is the establishment of pathogenicity for disease, distinguishing disease-causing variants from the background of variants present across human populations that are rare and undetermined in function, but not actually pathogenic. Statistical methods based on the relative enrichment of certain gene variants in disease populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref006">6</xref>], and computational methods based on sequence conservation or structural information with limited biological data are often inadequate and provide conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref008">8</xref>]. Indeed, false assignment of pathogenicity for gene variants is a critical challenge in translating knowledge gained from genome sequencing to clinical diagnoses and treatments. One focused resequencing study recently revealed that as many as 27% of previously published disease-causing variants were benign or lacked sufficient evidence for pathogenicity and therefore should be categorized as variants of unknown significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) recently published a study utilizing the largest aggregation of human exomes to reveal that while each person has an average of 54 variants in their genome that are currently annotated as pathogenic, as many as 41 of them are now observed to occur frequently in the human population and thus are unlikely to cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref010">10</xref>]. As the amount of exome/genome sequencing data continues to increase exponentially, it is crucial for candidate gene variants to undergo rigorous, multi-pronged evaluation before pathogenicity assignments. In addition to statistical (case-control association, familial segregation, population frequency, and etc.) and bioinformatic (evolutionary conservation, protein energetics, and etc.) methods, experimental approaches utilizing biological assays that directly test the protein functions of gene variants should be implemented to provide functional evidence that directly links gene variants to the pathogenesis of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>One well-studied example of a common congenital malformation associated with gene variants is that of orofacial clefts associated with the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (<italic>IRF6</italic>, ENSG00000117595) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref015">15</xref>]. Orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital malformations with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 700 births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref016">16</xref>]. Pathogenic variants in <italic>IRF6</italic> are among the most common genetic causes of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref017">17</xref>] and are associated with both Van der Woude syndrome (VWS, OMIM 119300) and Popliteal Pterygium syndrome (PPS, OMIM 119500), autosomal dominant Mendelian disorders with variable penetrance and expressivity that are characterized by CL/P and skin abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref012">12</xref>]. The <italic>IRF6</italic> gene sequence is highly conserved across vertebrates and contains two functional domains, a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a SMIR/IAD protein-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref018">18</xref>]. From murine studies, disruption of <italic>Irf6</italic> led to a CL/P phenotype in addition to oral epithelial adhesions, poor epithelial barrier functions, and improper skin stratification, revealing a potentially important role for the oral epithelium in directing palate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref020">20</xref>]. Approximately 300 human <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants have been catalogued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref015">15</xref>], and despite the wealth of structural and biological data for this well-described transcription factor, accurate determinations of variant protein functions and pathogenicity assignments associated with <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants remain significant challenges. Moreover, different computational programs use algorithms that weight various aspects of amino acid change differently and often provide conflicting predictions on protein function for the same missense mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The large number of human <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants and its well-understood biology make <italic>IRF6</italic> an ideal model to examine the challenges of assigning variant protein function and pathogenicity. In order to develop a rapid functional assay to determine the protein functions of a large number of <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants, we utilized a novel <italic>irf6</italic> null zebrafish model by taking advantage of the finding that maternally-deposited <italic>irf6</italic> transcripts are required for the proper development of the embryonic epithelium (periderm) during epiboly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref022">22</xref>]. By using CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> null model, we were able to establish maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> homozygotes where 100% of the embryos lacked Irf6 and ruptured unless rescued by functional Irf6 protein. This <italic>irf6</italic> rescue assay was used to test the protein functions of human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants, and provide an additional line of biological evidence to help bridge the gap between gene variant identification and pathogenicity assignment.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of the zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> CRISPR mutant model.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> gene structure composed of eight exons, a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (yellow), and a SMIR/IAD protein-binding domain (green).

<p>It has been previously reported through gene expression analysis and experiments involving dominant-negative Irf6 that maternal transcripts of <italic>irf6</italic>, deposited in the oocyte cytoplasm during gametogenesis, were critical for proper periderm differentiation and epiboly progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref023">23</xref>]. The zebrafish periderm is an embryonic epithelium with many morphologic and molecular features similar to the mammalian embryonic oral epithelium that surrounds the facial prominences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref025">25</xref>]. Based on these previous reports of <italic>irf6</italic> maternal contributions, homozygous <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>Δ8bp/Δ8bp</italic></sup> F2 females were crossed with males of any genotype to produce heterozygous (<italic>+/Δ8bp</italic>) and homozygous (<italic>Δ8bp/Δ8bp</italic>) <italic>irf6</italic> embryos that developed normally up to the sphere stage (4 hours post fertilization = hpf). However, shortly thereafter these maternal <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>Δ8bp/Δ8bp</italic></sup> embryos, regardless of genotype, failed to appropriately initiate epiboly compared to wild type embryos, resulting in the separation of the animal pole structures from the underlying yolk, periderm rupture, and embryonic lethality in 100% of embryos between 5–6 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g001">Fig 1D, 1D’, 1E and 1E’</xref>). Conversely, when homozygous F2 males were crossed with wild type or heterozygous females, the resulting embryos underwent normal epiboly progression and embryonic development, confirming that maternal contributions of <italic>irf6</italic>, even from heterozygous <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>+/Δ8bp</italic></sup> females, were sufficient for epiboly progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Another zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> line harboring a 5 bp insertion in exon 6 of the <italic>irf6</italic> coding region was also identified from the same CRISPR-injected P0 embryos and produced the same set of phenotypes as the Δ8bp deletion line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

Thus, in order to characterize the <italic>irf6</italic> Δ8bp zebrafish model at the molecular level, RT-qPCR using primers specific to the <italic>irf6</italic> 5’ UTR overlapping the protein N-terminus was performed on zebrafish embryos at the sphere stage (4 hpf) from permutations of wild type and maternal/paternal homozygous <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>Δ8bp/Δ8bp</italic></sup> crosses.

<title>PolyPhen-2 and SIFT predictions of <italic>IRF6</italic> variant protein function do not accurately reflect their ability to rescue zebrafish periderm rupture</title>
<p>The conservation of human <italic>IRF6</italic> protein function in zebrafish provided an opportunity to assess the protein functions of human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants. Over 300 <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants have been identified from human CL/P patients and approximately 50% are missense variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref015">15</xref>]. Two of the more commonly used computational prediction programs, PolyPhen-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref028">28</xref>] and SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref029">29</xref>], were used to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions on the protein functions of <italic>IRF6</italic> missense variants and segregate them into three categories: 1) both programs agree the variant disrupts protein function, resulting in a loss-of-function protein, 2) the programs disagree on the effects of the variant on protein function, and 3) both programs agree the variant does not disrupt protein function. Human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants were then mapped to their corresponding nucleotides in the zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> cDNA by sequence conservation, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed into mRNA, and microinjected into maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos to assess their ability to rescue the periderm rupture phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The results demonstrated that the computational programs did not offer a significant advantage in predicting the biological functions of variant Irf6 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4D–4F</xref>). Variants that received conflicting predictions from PolyPhen-2 and SIFT also provided mixed results in their abilities to rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Moreover, variants that were predicted by both computational programs to result in loss-of-function proteins were often able to experimentally rescue the rupture phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Lastly, missense gene variants that were predicted by both programs to be non-deleterious to protein function were also mixed in their abilities to rescue, further demonstrating the limitations of these computational programs at predicting protein function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). For example, the missense gene variant p.F252L that was predicted by both programs to be non-deleterious to protein function was unable to rescue the maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> rupture phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). When the experimentally tested <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants were grouped according to their abilities to rescue periderm rupture and mapped to the predicted human IRF6 protein structure (protein-binding domain and C-terminus) generated by ExPASy, the distribution of the amino acid residues suggested variants that could not rescue mostly resided in protein secondary structures and thus likely to disrupt protein conformation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Conversely, amino acid residues for human <italic>IRF6</italic> variants that retained protein function and rescued periderm rupture mostly mapped to regions without secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and thus less likely to disrupt protein conformations critical for IRF6 function. In addition, the variants tested were re-examined for their genetic backgrounds and the numbers of individuals previously identified with the variant and this information was used to classify the variants according to the five-category system for variant pathogenicity established by the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4D–4F</xref>). While no variants in the highest pathogenicity certainty category of “Pathogenic” were able to rescue the rupture phenotype, other variants with varying degrees of uncertainty in pathogenicity were mixed in their abilities to rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g004">Fig 4D–4F</xref>).

<title>Dosage titrations can differentiate functional categories of human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants</title>
<p>The human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants functionally tested in this study could result in reduced function rather than complete loss-of-function proteins, thereby leaving open the possibility that while they can rescue the zebrafish maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> rupture phenotype in this assay, their reduced function <italic>in vivo</italic> is sufficient to cause disease in humans. To address this possibility, the mRNA of wild type zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic>, human <italic>IRF6</italic>, and several missense gene variants were individually microinjected into maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos at the one-cell stage through a range of concentrations to establish a titration response curve for periderm rupture rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To assist in the functional analysis of these <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants with potentially more nuanced functional changes, we utilized the significantly increased statistical power of rare human gene variant detection provided by the Exome Aggregation Consortium database of over 60,000 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref015">15</xref>]. In addition, we also examined the gnomAD database, a more recent effort from the same group which now extended to over 125,000 exomes and 15,000 whole genomes. From these databases, the <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants p.R45Q, p.R45W, p.G70R, p.V274I, p.D354N, and p.F369S were identified. Through various lines of evidence, the variant p.V274I was already considered benign by ACMG standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Indeed, 9,280 alleles of this gene variant (allele frequency 0.077) was found in ExAC distributed across all populations including Europeans, Africans, and Asians. p.D354N and p.F369S were found to be non-conserved in zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> and illustrates the possibility that the identities of these residues are not essential for IRF6 protein function. In addition, although p.D354N was previously identified in four VWS pedigrees, 37 alleles were also found in the ExAC/gnomAD database. Three other missense gene variants, p.R45Q, p.R45W, and p.G70R were identified as single alleles in the ExAC/gnomAD database and were able to rescue the periderm rupture phenotype of maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos. The small number of these alleles do not provide as strong of support for non-pathogenicity as p.V274I. But, their presence in ExAC/gnomAD does raise the possibility that these gene variants could retain protein function and potentially be non-pathogenic, and therefore should be functionally tested. The aforementioned variants, in addition to p.V274I and several others that were mixed in their ability to rescue were used in a mRNA microinjection dosage titration assay. Interestingly, the tested missense gene variants naturally segregated into three functional categories upon dosage titration. The variants identified in ExAC/gnomAD rescued to the same degree as wild type zebrafish and human <italic>IRF6</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g005">Fig 5B</xref> Green). Variants that were able to rescue in the periderm rupture assay but not found in ExAC/gnomAD were found to be reduced in protein function compared to wild type, rescuing a smaller percentage of embryos at each of the mRNA dosages tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g005">Fig 5B</xref> Blue). These results are in contrast to the missense gene variants that could not rescue the rupture phenotype at any dosage tested, which were not found in ExAC/gnomAD or other public exome/genome databases, suggesting that they are complete loss-of-function variant proteins and likely pathogenic in human orofacial cleft patients.</p>

<title>Challenges in statistical and computational analyses of rare human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants</title>
<p>While it is tremendously useful to document human genetic variations in genes associated with disease from a wide range of populations, as in the case of <italic>IRF6</italic> for orofacial clefts, a key challenge in human genetics remains how to functionally ascertain whether coding sequence variations result in harmful alterations in protein function, and whether these functional changes are pathogenic for disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref006">6</xref>]. Statistical methods can provide support for the pathogenicity of gene variants by examining the segregation of pathogenic variants with disease status within affected families, or by examining the frequencies of the variants in the population or disease cases versus control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref008">8</xref>]. However, such statistical methods do not test biological protein functions and are prone to biases, especially for rare gene variants. Distinct but unobserved pathogenic variants may be located on the same haplotype as the candidate rare variant and thus segregation analysis alone cannot unambiguously assign pathogenicity, especially in smaller pedigrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref001">1</xref>]. In addition, the incidence of CL/P is higher in regions of the world where whole exome and genome sequencing has not yet captured a large cross section of the normal population for use as controls. Due to this geographical clustering, many cases of newly discovered <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants cannot be statistically compared to public exome/genome databases because the population mismatch could over emphasize the relative rarity of certain gene variants and thereby their potential pathogenicity.</p>
<p>Computational programs such as PolyPhen-2 and SIFT that predict the effects of missense mutations on variant protein functions use complex algorithms that take into consideration a multitude of parameters to predict the thermodynamic stability and functions of variant proteins after amino acid substitutions. However, there are still many unaccounted factors that go into translating amino acid changes to changes in protein function and thus such computational programs often provide results that conflict with biological evidence. Since many computational prediction programs depend on machine-learning algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref031">31</xref>], the direct biological assessment of variant protein functions could be reiterated through the same algorithms to improve their predictive powers for both IRF6 and other proteins with similar sequences and motifs. According to the recent ACMG guidelines, the assessment of gene variant pathogenicity should be multi-pronged with various independent lines of supporting evidence from different approaches, including statistical, computational and experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref030">30</xref>]. While pathogenicity assignments typically cannot be made from any line of evidence alone, using experimental models to directly interrogate variant protein functions provide valuable insights into the biological effects of missense variant amino acid substitutions on protein functions and can greatly aid in the interpretation of variant protein function and pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Zebrafish periderm as a model of mammalian oral epithelium and the requirement of maternal <italic>irf6</italic> during epiboly and craniofacial development</title>
<p>The zebrafish <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> model revealed the importance of <italic>irf6</italic> maternal transcripts for embryonic periderm development, corroborating previous reports that characterized <italic>irf6</italic> function in the zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref023">23</xref>]. However, in contrast to previous studies of <italic>irf6</italic> performed using mRNA injections of dominant-negative Irf6 which could result in delayed and incomplete knockdown of Irf6 function, the genetic disruption of <italic>irf6</italic> reported in this study more completely ablated Irf6 function in the early embryo with near undetectable expression of downstream transcriptional targets such as <italic>grhl3</italic> and <italic>krt4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref033">33</xref>]. This <italic>irf6</italic> null model exhibited developmental arrest at the sphere stage and suggests that <italic>irf6</italic> is a potential epiboly initiation factor necessary for regulating cell signaling pathways that orchestrate this complex morphological event during zebrafish embryogenesis. Interestingly, paternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos developed normally into adulthood, suggesting that zygotic transcription of <italic>irf6</italic> may not be necessary in zebrafish for normal embryonic development, possibly due to the persistence of maternal Irf6 protein throughout early embryogenesis. <italic>Irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice exhibited cleft palates with oral epithelial adhesions and a number of other epithelial abnormalities, suggesting that <italic>IRF6</italic> plays an important role in regulating epithelial proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref020">20</xref>]. The zebrafish embryonic periderm has emerged as a model of the mammalian oral epithelium because many of the gene regulatory networks and cellular behaviors during zebrafish epiboly, such as convergence-extension and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are conserved in the mammalian oral epithelium during palate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref034">34</xref>]. The observation that maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos failed to initiate epiboly cellular movements suggests that many of the downstream pathways and cellular behaviors are dependent upon the proper establishment of the periderm, and emphasizes the potential importance of the oral epithelium in initiating and orchestrating both epithelial and mesenchymal tissue behaviors during palate development in the mammalian system. Because of the early embryonic lethal periderm rupture phenotype of maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos, we are in the process of elucidating the functional requirements of Irf6 during craniofacial development in zebrafish, separated from its functions in the establishment of the periderm during epiboly.</p>

<title>Functional rescue of zebrafish periderm rupture with <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants</title>
<p>The experimental finding that human <italic>IRF6</italic> mRNA could rescue not only periderm rupture in zebrafish maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos but also normal embryonic development and <italic>IRF6</italic> gene regulatory network gene expression suggests that there is significant cross-species conservation in IRF6 protein structure and function. Taken together, our finding demonstrated that the zebrafish maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> model could serve as a sensitive and specific platform for the rapid assessment of human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense variant protein functions in a relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> context. This biological assay can complement the statistical analyses to form a more comprehensive picture in the process of assigning pathogenicity to <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants. This complementary approach is especially important for rare <italic>IRF6</italic> gene variants identified in a small number of individuals often in a single pedigree. In the case of p.R45W, this gene variant was detected in a single VWS affected proband but also in his unaffected sibling and mother, leaving in question whether this missense variant is truly pathogenic or simply a rare benign variant that was annotated as pathogenic despite the imperfect variant co-segregation with disease which was previously attributed to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref035">35</xref>]. Although this interpretation is possible due to the variable expressivity of phenotypes exhibited by VWS patients in the same pedigree, other interpretations are possible such as a case where an unobserved pathogenic variant in a separate gene adjacent to <italic>IRF6</italic> is on the same haplotype co-segregating with the p.R45W variant. This interpretation is further supported by the biological analysis of p.R45W variant protein function in the zebrafish model, which revealed that the p.R45W variant protein was able to rescue maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> periderm rupture and function quantitatively to the same degree as wild type <italic>IRF6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007009.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). While this experimental validation of p.R45W variant protein function does not conclusively exclude its potential pathogenicity in human patients, it does suggest that further biological evidence is needed before p.R45W can be annotated as pathogenic in public databases and used in the clinical diagnosis of VWS patients.</p>
<p>The functional genomics validation of <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variant protein function presented in this study is complemented by rapid increases in statistical power for rare gene variant identification and pathogenicity assignment through expansions in large public exome/genome databases. More and more individuals are sequenced daily with advances in sequencing technologies and concomitantly decreasing sequencing costs. Several <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants previously unobserved in the general population and therefore thought to be pathogenic were identified in the ExAC/gnomAD databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007009.ref010">10</xref>], potentially weakening the statistical power of their pathogenicity assignments by ACMG standards. In addition, their discovery in the ExAC/gnomAD databases streamlined the variant protein functional validation process by identifying variants with the highest probability of ambiguous pathogenicity assignments for testing in our model. The zebrafish maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> model allowed for the detection of subtle changes in <italic>IRF6</italic> protein function such as reduced function variants through mRNA microinjection dosage titrations. The stability of variant mRNA and proteins could also be readily assessed through molecular biology techniques after mRNA microinjections. The missense variants p.R45Q, p.R45W, p.G70R, and p.V274I were able to not only rescue the periderm rupture phenotype of maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> zebrafish embryos, but were also functionally indistinguishable from wild type zebrafish and human <italic>IRF6</italic> in dosage titration, suggesting that the proteins produced from these missense variants retained full function. However, the pathogenicity of these variants cannot be conclusively determined with this <italic>IRF6</italic> functional model due to the possibility that only a subset of <italic>IRF6</italic> functions are conserved between human and zebrafish. Interestingly, the variants tested that were able to rescue in the embryo rupture assay and yet not found in the ExAC/gnomAD databases were reduced in protein function when compared to wild type zebrafish or human <italic>IRF6</italic>. This result suggests that these missense gene variants are not complete loss-of-function variants but rather reduced in function, and thus still potentially pathogenic in humans because their reduced functions might be insufficient to prevent phenotype and disease onset. Lastly, the variants that were not able to rescue the maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> periderm rupture at any of the dosages tested likely represent complete loss-of-function missense variants. These variants were not found in the ExAC/gnomAD databases, and their complete loss-of-function provide an additional line of biological evidence in support for their pathogenic status in human VWS patients. Because of the relatively small number of missense gene variants functionally tested through dosage titration in this study, no variant was discovered to be functionally wild type and yet not identified in the ExAC/gnomAD databases. Although the collection of sequenced exomes and genomes is continuously increasing, a larger control population still does not guarantee the discovery of rare gene variants previously thought to be pathogenic in human disease. In these situations, experimental validation of rare gene variant protein functions could bridge a gap in knowledge and provide additional biological insights to assist in variant pathogenicity assignments and improve their accuracies. While it is possible that only a subset of <italic>IRF6</italic> protein functions are conserved in the zebrafish model and tested through this functional rescue assay, this model serves to provide novel insights into the effects of human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants on IRF6 protein function, and complement current statistical and bioinformatics results.</p>
<p>Overall, the zebrafish maternal-null <italic>irf6</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> model not only offers a method to rapidly assess the protein functions of current and yet undiscovered human <italic>IRF6</italic> missense gene variants, but also illustrates a generalizable functional genomics paradigm where novel human gene variants can be biologically tested for protein function using corresponding zebrafish mutants to provide another line of biological evidence to assist with pathogenicity assignments. With advances in CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis in zebrafish, it will be increasingly efficient to develop zebrafish gene disruption and rescue assays to test the functions of human gene variants for genes in other contexts of disease.</p>
