<abstract>
<p>Chaperonins are a class of molecular chaperones that assist in the folding and assembly of a wide range of substrates. In plants, chloroplast chaperonins are composed of two different types of subunits, Cpn60α and Cpn60β, and duplication of <italic>Cpn60α</italic> and <italic>Cpn60β</italic> genes occurs in a high proportion of plants. However, the importance of multiple <italic>Cpn60α</italic> and <italic>Cpn60β</italic> genes in plants is poorly understood. In this study, we found that loss-of-function of <italic>CPNA2</italic> (<italic>AtCpn60α2</italic>), a gene encoding the minor Cpn60α subunit in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, resulted in arrested embryo development at the globular stage, whereas the other <italic>AtCpn60α</italic> gene encoding the dominant Cpn60α subunit, <italic>CPNA1</italic> (<italic>AtCpn60α1</italic>), mainly affected embryonic cotyledon development at the torpedo stage and thereafter. Further studies demonstrated that CPNA2 can form a functional chaperonin with CPNB2 (AtCpn60β2) and CPNB3 (AtCpn60β3), while the functional partners of CPNA1 are CPNB1 (AtCpn60β1) and CPNB2. We also revealed that the functional chaperonin containing CPNA2 could assist the folding of a specific substrate, KASI (β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I), and that the KASI protein level was remarkably reduced due to loss-of-function of <italic>CPNA2</italic>. Furthermore, the reduction in the KASI protein level was shown to be the possible cause for the arrest of <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos. Our findings indicate that the two Cpn60α subunits in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> play different roles during embryo development through forming distinct chaperonins with specific AtCpn60β to assist the folding of particular substrates, thus providing novel insights into functional divergence of Cpn60α subunits in plants.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chaperonins are large oligomeric complexes that are involved in the folding and assembly of numerous proteins in various species. In contrast to other types of chaperonins, chloroplast chaperonins are characterized by the hetero-oligomeric structure composed of two unique types of subunits, Cpn60α and Cpn60β, each of which is present in two or more paralogous forms in most of higher plants. However, the functional significance underlying the wide array of subunit types and complex oligomeric arrangement remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the minor Cpn60α subunit AtCpn60α2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo development, and found that AtCpn60α2 is important for the transition of globular embryos to heart-shaped embryos, whereas loss of the dominant Cpn60α subunit AtCpn60α1 affects embryonic cotyledon development. Further studies demonstrated that AtCpn60α2 could form functional chaperonins with AtCpn60β2 and AtCpn60β3 to specifically assist in folding of the substrate KASI, which is important for the formation of heart-shaped embryos. Our results suggest that duplication of <italic>Cpn60α</italic> genes in higher plants can increase the potential number of chloroplast chaperonin substrates and provide chloroplast chaperonins with more roles in plant growth and development, thus revealing the relationship between duplication and functional specialization of chaperonin genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chaperonins are a class of molecular chaperones that are characterized by a barrel-shaped architecture formed by two stacked oligomeric rings consisting of several subunits of approximately 60 kDa. Two types of chaperonins have been identified: type I chaperonins are found in eubacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria; and type II exist in archaea and eukaryotic cytosol. The main difference between them is that type I chaperonins require co-chaperonins consisting of seven 10 kDa subunits for substrate encapsulation, whereas type II chaperonins have a built-in lid that plays the same role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref001">1</xref>]. The GroEL/GroES complex in <italic>Escherichia coil</italic> has been studied extensively as the prototype of type I chaperonins. GroEL is a homo-oligomer which consists of two stacked heptameric rings. The folding cycle in GroEL/GroES has been surveyed in detail, and the canonical view suggested that the complex operates through the asymmetric “bullet” cycle. In this asymmetric cycle, unfolded/misfolded substrates first bind to the hydrophobic cavity lining of one ring (<italic>cis</italic> ring), utilizing the exposed hydrophobic residues, and then the binding of ATP causes large conformational changes of the <italic>cis</italic> ring that further trigger the binding of co-chaperonins. Binding of co-chaperonins initiates further conformational changes and caps the <italic>cis</italic> ring, and consequently encapsulates the substrates into an expanded cavity with a hydrophilic lining, which assists the substrates to refold into their native states. Following the hydrolysis of ATP in the <italic>cis</italic> ring, ATP and other non-native proteins bind to the opposite ring (<italic>trans</italic> ring), resulting in the dissociation of refolded substrates, ADP, and co-chaperonins in the <italic>cis</italic> ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref004">4</xref>]. Moreover, an alternative model, known as the symmetric “football” model, was recently also proposed. In this model, the exchange of ADP to ATP is extremely rapid in the presence of abundant substrate protein, resulting in formation of a symmetric “football” intermediate that has GroES bound to both rings and can assist in protein folding simultaneously in both rings. This “football” intermediate would be reverted to the “bullet” conformation upon ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition, although <italic>Escherichia coil</italic> only contains one chaperonin gene, a survey of 669 complete bacterial genomes showed that nearly 30% contain two or more chaperonin genes, and a degree of subfunctionalization has occurred in the chaperonin subunits encoded by these duplicated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref008">8</xref>]. Moreover, in the previous study, Wang and coworkers found that some specific mutations of GroEL can improve the folding of GFP, but the mutated GroEL has a reduced ability to function as general chaperones, suggesting a conflict between the increased ability of GroEL to fold particular substrates and its general ability to fold a wide range of substrates, and this conflict would be resolved by duplication and variation of chaperonin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Chloroplast chaperonin (Ch-Cpn60) was first found as a homolog of GroEL that could bind to the chloroplast Rubisco large subunit and assist the assembly of Rubisco, a key rate-limiting enzyme in the process of carbon dioxide fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref010">10</xref>]. In contrast to GroEL, ch-Cpn60s contain two different types of subunits, Cpn60α and Cpn60β, which only share approximately 50% identity. Ch-Cpn60s composed of Cpn60α and Cpn60β are considered to be the native form of chloroplast chaperonins <italic>in vivo</italic>, because ch-Cpn60s purified from <italic>Pisum sativum</italic>, <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> were all shown to be hetero-oligomers consisting of nearly equal amounts of Cpn60α and Cpn60β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref013">13</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, there are two <italic>Cpn60α</italic> genes and four <italic>Cpn60β</italic> genes, which encode three dominant subunits: AtCpn60α1, AtCpn60β1 and AtCpn60β2; and three minor subunits: AtCpn60α2, AtCpn60β3 and AtCpn60β4 (the nomenclature used in this article is in accordance with The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Information Resource database). Among them, AtCpn60α1 and AtCpn60α2 share only about 57% identity, and AtCpn60β1/2/3 share 90%-95% identity, while AtCpn60β4 is only 60% identical to the other AtCpn60β subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref015">15</xref>]. <italic>AtCpn60α1</italic> was the first chaperonin gene studied in detail, and its mutant, <italic>schlepperless</italic> (<italic>slp</italic>), showed retardation of embryo development before the heart stage, and defective embryos with highly reduced cotyledons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref016">16</xref>]. Then a T-DNA insertion mutant of <italic>AtCpn60α2</italic>, <italic>emb3007</italic>, showed the embryo development arrested at the globular stage in the SeedGenes database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seedgenes.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.seedgenes.org/</ext-link>), suggesting that <italic>AtCpn60α2</italic> is also possibly an embryo-defective gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref018">18</xref>]. A T-DNA mutant lacking the <italic>AtCpn60β1</italic> transcript, <italic>len1</italic>, had impaired leaves and showed systemic acquired resistance (SAR) under short-day condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref019">19</xref>]. It was also reported that a weak mutant of <italic>AtCpn60α1</italic> and a strong mutant allele of <italic>AtCpn60β1</italic> both showed impaired chloroplast division and reduced chlorophyll levels, and the <italic>AtCpn60β1 AtCpn60β2</italic> double mutant led to an albino seedling similar to <italic>slp</italic>, suggesting that AtCpn60β1 and AtCpn60β2 are redundantly required for normal chloroplast function, together with AtCpn60α1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition, a recent report also showed that the ch-Cpn60 containing the AtCpn60β4 subunit played a specific role in the folding of NdhH, a subunit of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH), indicating that the particular type of AtCpn60β subunit could contribute to the folding of some specific substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Embryogenesis is the beginning of plant development. During <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo development, chloroplast biogenesis is a temporary process. Proplastids in the whole embryo first begin to differentiate into chloroplasts at the transition stage, and then the mature chloroplasts degenerate to undifferentiated eoplasts during seed maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref024">24</xref>]. For decades, through forward and reverse genetic screens in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, numerous chloroplast proteins crucial for embryo development were discovered. Interestingly, nearly all embryo defects caused by chloroplast dysfunction displayed premature arrest at the globular stage, indicating that the formation of impermanent chloroplasts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryos is especially crucial for the transition of globular embryos to heart-shaped embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we provided genetic evidence to show that the two <italic>AtCpn60α</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> affect the embryonic development at different stages. Further studies revealed that CPNA2 could form a functional chaperonin with AtCpn60β2 and AtCpn60β3 subunits to specifically assist the folding of KASI (β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I), and KASI could not be folded by the functional chaperonin containing CPNA1. Moreover, we found that the KASI protein level was largely reduced due to loss-of-function of <italic>CPNA2</italic>, and the reduction in KASI protein level possibly caused the abnormality of the <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos. Our results showed that Cpn60α2 and Cpn60α1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can form functional chaperonin complexes with specific AtCpn60β subunits to assist the folding of particular substrates, indicating that functional divergence of chloroplast Cpn60α subunits has occurred in higher plants.</p>

<title>Identification of an embryo-defective (<italic>EMB</italic>) gene <italic>CPNA2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control embryo development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we ordered the stock CS76507, which is a set of 10,000 T-DNA lines, from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center (ABRC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abrc.osu.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://abrc.osu.edu/</ext-link>). From the stock, we obtained a mutant that showed obvious seed abortion, with a frequency of 25.55% (n = 2270). We found that the T-DNA insertion of this mutant is located in the first exon of AT5G18820 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) using thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref028">28</xref>]. We named the gene <italic>CPNA2</italic> because it encodes the chaperonin subunit AtCpn60α2, and named the mutant <italic>cpna2-2</italic> (The <italic>emb3007</italic> mutant described previously was designated as <italic>cpna2-1</italic> here). PCR analysis of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ progeny showed that no homozygous mutant plant existed, and the ratio of heterozygote to wild type was nearly 2:1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s005">S1 Table</xref>).

Moreover, we obtained another T-DNA mutant (<italic>cpna2-3</italic>, SALK_144574) from ABRC, and found that the mutant <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/+ also showed seed abortion, with a frequency of 26.09% (n = 1196) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To further confirm that <italic>CPNA2</italic> is responsible for seed abortion in <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/<italic>+</italic> plants, we performed a complementation test. A genomic fragment, including <italic>CPNA2</italic>, 1548 bp upstream of the start codon and 673 bp downstream of <italic>CPNA2</italic>, was introduced into <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/+. The result showed that the fertility was restored in the siliques of <italic>CPNA2pro</italic>:<italic>gCPNA2</italic> transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Together, these results indicated that seed abortion in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> could be caused by loss-of-function of <italic>CPNA2</italic>.</p>
<p>To investigate the cause of seed abortion of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/+, we first examined the processes of embryo development in the seeds of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/+ using the whole mount clearing technique. We could not distinguish abnormal embryos in the siliques from the zygote stage to the globular stage. However, when most embryos in the seeds of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/+ reached the transition stage, some embryos showed the irregular globular shape and the start of abnormal cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). While wild-type embryos progressed into further stages, the abnormal embryos still stayed at the globular stage, and finally degraded along with the collapse of seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The phenotype of these abnormal embryos is consistent with the mutant <italic>emb3007</italic> in SeedGenes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seedgenes.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.seedgenes.org/</ext-link>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref018">18</xref>]). In addition, since <italic>CPNA2</italic> was predicted to encode a chloroplast chaperonin subunit and chloroplast chaperonins had been reported to be involved in the folding and assembly of many chloroplast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref029">29</xref>], we wondered whether the abortion of <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos was due to impaired chloroplast development. To investigate this, we first examined the subcellular localization of CPNA2 in mesophyll protoplasts isolated from transgenic plants carrying the <italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-GFP</italic> construct. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, the protoplasts containing CPNA2-GFP fusion protein displayed GFP signals that overlapped with chlorophyll autofluorescence, confirming that CPNA2 is located in chloroplasts. Then we observed the ultrastructure of chloroplasts using transmission electron microscopy. In the 6 DAP siliques of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ plant, we observed that mature chloroplasts in wild-type embryos contained organized thylakoid membranes stacked into grana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). In contrast, only abnormal chloroplasts that lacked thylakoid membranes and contained a deeply stained mass were found in <italic>cpna2-2</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggested that loss-of-function of <italic>CPNA2</italic> impeded the process by which proplastids differentiate into mature chloroplasts during embryo development, thereby causing the arrest of the <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos and seed abortion of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna2-3</italic>/+.</p>

<p>It had been reported that <italic>CPNA2</italic> has an extremely low signal in all tissues and developmental stages using the Genevestigator program, and the CPNA2 protein could not be detected in proteomics studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref030">30</xref>].

<title>Functional divergence of <italic>CPNA2</italic> and <italic>CPNA1</italic> occurs during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo development</title>
<p>Hill and Hemmingsen reported that <italic>CPNA2</italic> is the paralog of <italic>CPNA1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref015">15</xref>], thus it is possible that they have redundant functions. However, a <italic>CPNA1</italic> mutant, <italic>slp</italic> (<italic>schlepperless</italic>), showed an embryo-defective phenotype that mainly appeared at the heart stage and thereafter, which is different from the <italic>cpna2</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref016">16</xref>]. To confirm the previous study, we obtained another <italic>AtCpn60α1</italic> mutant (<italic>cpna1</italic>, SALK_006606) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), and then observed embryo development in the siliques of <italic>cpna1</italic>/+. As expected, nearly a quarter of the examined embryos (25.71%, n = 579) showed the abnormal phenotype. The abnormal embryos had highly reduced cotyledons, a larger angle between cotyledons, and developed more slowly from the torpedo stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), which was similar to the phenotype of the <italic>slp</italic> embryos.</p>
<p>As shown above, <italic>cpna1</italic> and <italic>cpna2</italic> mutants had very different embryo-defective phenotypes, which could be caused by functional divergence and/or different expression patterns of the two genes. To investigate the expression pattern of <italic>CPNA1</italic> during embryo development, we obtained transgenic plants carrying the <italic>CPNA1pro</italic>:<italic>H2B-CFP</italic> construct, and observed CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) signals in the dissected embryos. The fluorescent signal was originally detected in protoderm cells at the globular stage, and then concentrated in the SAM at the transition stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). When the embryos developed into heart, torpedo, and cotyledon stages, most CFP signals were specifically redistributed on the adaxial sides of cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>As the above results demonstrated, <italic>CPNA1</italic> has a similar expression pattern to <italic>CPNA2</italic> during embryo development, while it is expressed more widely. This indicates that the different embryo-defective phenotypes of the <italic>cpna1</italic> and <italic>cpna2</italic> mutants are likely to be caused by functional divergence of the two genes, but not due to differences in expression pattern. Moreover, these findings also suggested that <italic>CPNA1</italic> mainly plays a role at the torpedo stage and thereafter, whereas <italic>CPNA2</italic> is crucial to reach the heart stage for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryos.</p>

<title>CPNA2 and CPNA1 have specific AtCpn60β subunits as their functional partners</title>
<p>Ch-Cpn60s had been considered to be hetero-oligomers consisting of equal amounts of Cpn60α and Cpn60β, based on several studies conducted in <italic>Pisum sativum</italic>, <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and <italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref031">31</xref>]. Moreover, because CPNA2 and CPNA1 could play different roles during embryo development, we wondered which AtCpn60β subunits could interact with CPNA2 or CPNA1 to form specific chaperonins. Using AtPID (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Protein Interactome Database) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref032">32</xref>], we first predicted the functional partners of CPNA2 and CPNA1. The result showed that AtCpn60β1 and AtCpn60β2 had much higher scores than AtCpn60β3 and AtCpn60β4 among the predicted functional partners of CPNA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s006">S2 Table</xref>). In contrast, AtCpn60β3 and AtCpn60β2 were the top two predicted functional partners of CPNA2, and AtCpn60β3 had a far higher score than the other candidates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s006">S2 Table</xref>). These results implied that CPNA2 and CPNA1 could possibly interact with different AtCpn60β subunits to form specific functional chaperonins.</p>
<p>To further clarify the functional partners of CPNA2 and CPNA1, we obtained T-DNA insertion mutants of <italic>AtCpn60β1</italic> (<italic>CPNB1</italic>), <italic>AtCpn60β2</italic> (<italic>CPNB2</italic>), <italic>AtCpn60β3</italic> (<italic>CPNB3</italic>), and <italic>AtCpn60β4</italic> (<italic>CPNB4</italic>) from ABRC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Homozygous mutant plants of all <italic>AtCpn60β</italic> genes could be obtained and had normal fertility. Through reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, we also confirmed the complete loss of the corresponding transcripts in the <italic>cpnb2</italic>, <italic>cpnb3</italic> and <italic>cpnb4</italic> mutants, and the enormous reduction of the <italic>CPNB1</italic> transcript in the <italic>cpnb1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). We then crossed these mutants pairwise to obtain double heterozygous plants. In all double heterozygous plants, we only observed aberrant seeds in siliques of the <italic>cpnb1</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpnb2</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb3</italic>/+ plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), implying that the <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> and <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> double homozygous embryos were possibly abnormal.</p>
<p>We also obtained <italic>cpnb1</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb2</italic> and <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic>/+ plants in the self-crossed progenies of the <italic>cpnb1</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpnb2</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb3</italic>/+ mutants, respectively. As expected, siliques of the <italic>cpnb1</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb2</italic> and <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic>/+ plants contained numerous aberrant seeds, at a frequency of 25.43% (n = 1050) and 25.64% (n = 1166), respectively, suggesting that the <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> and <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> embryos were probably abnormal. To clarify the cause for the abnormality of the <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> and <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> embryos, we examined the developmental processes of these double homozygous embryos in the aberrant seeds. In siliques of the <italic>cpnb1</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb2</italic> plants, the <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> embryos had a similar shape to wild-type embryos at the heart stage, apart from slightly smaller cotyledons and a larger angle between cotyledons.

In contrast, we observed that the majority of the <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> embryos (70.61%, n = 228) were arrested at the globular stage in the siliques of the <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic>/+ plants, while the other <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> embryos showed various phenotypes, including remarkable retardation of embryo development, and variation of cotyledon shape and number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, we found that <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> embryos had a very similar phenotype to <italic>cpna1</italic> embryos, echoing the previous study that showed that <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> seedlings were analogous to <italic>cpna1</italic> seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition, although the penetrance was incomplete possibly due to partial complement of <italic>CPNB1</italic>, the majority of the <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> embryos were shown to phenocopy the <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos. Combined with the prediction from AtPID (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s006">S2 Table</xref>), this result further suggested that CPNA1 is likely to form a functional chaperonin with CPNB1 and CPNB2 during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo development, whereas CPNB2 and CPNB3 were the functional partners of CPNA2. Moreover, since the <italic>cpnb1</italic>/+ <italic>cpnb3</italic>/+ plants showed normal seed development, it seemed that CPNB2 was a versatile AtCpn60β subunit which could form functional chaperonins with both CPNA1 and CPNA2, and was sufficient to support embryo development alone.</p>

<title>KASI is a specific substrate of the functional chaperonin containing CPNA2</title>
<p>As the previous results demonstrated, we found that CPNA2 and CPNA1 have nonredundant functions during embryo development. Moreover, it had been widely reported that some chaperonins containing specific subunits had unique substrates and played an important role under certain circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref035">35</xref>]. Based on these results, it is possible that the chaperonin containing CPNA2 has some specific substrates that cannot be folded by the chaperonin containing CPNA1, thus affecting the specific developmental process of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryos.</p>
<p>To examine this possibility, we first introduced two chimeric genes encoding an HA (influenza hemagglutinin protein epitope) tag fused to the C-terminus of CPNA2 or CPNA1 into <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna1</italic>/+ mutants, respectively. The <italic>CPNA2pro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-HA</italic> and <italic>CPNA1pro</italic>:<italic>CPNA1-HA</italic> constructs fully restored the fertility of <italic>cpna2-2</italic>/+ and <italic>cpna1</italic>/+ plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that HA-tag has no effect on the functions of CPNA2 and CPNA1. Since expression of the <italic>CPNA2</italic> gene in vegetative tissues is very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref014">14</xref>], we also obtained transgenic lines carrying the <italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-HA</italic> or <italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>CPNA1-HA</italic> construct, and conducted Co-IP assay in 7 DAG transgenic and wild-type seedlings using the μMACS HA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The MS analysis showed that KASI, a protein involved in <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis, had more peptides and much higher scores in CPNA2 immunoprecipitation fractions than in CPNA1 and WT immunoprecipitation fractions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007036.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s009">S1 Data</xref>). These results suggested that KASI was a possible specific substrate of the chaperonin containing CPNA2. Moreover, the MS data also showed that CPNB3 was not detected in CPNA1 immunoprecipitation fractions, but had high scores in CPNA2 immunoprecipitation fractions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007036.t001">Table 1</xref>), echoing the previous genetic results demonstrating that CPNB3 is a functional partner of CPNA2 but not CPNA1.</p>

<p>To further confirm that KASI is a specific substrate of the chaperonin containing CPNA2, we also performed a proteinase K protection assay. This assay takes advantage of the formation of a highly stable <italic>cis</italic>-ternary complex consisting of substrate, chaperonin and co-chaperonin in the presence of ADP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref037">37</xref>]. This <italic>cis</italic>-ternary complex could sequester a substrate into the cavity of a chaperonin, thus protecting the substrate from digestion by proteinase K. Recombinant CPNA1, CPNA2, CPNB1, CPNB2, CPNB3, Cpn20 (a co-chaperonin subunit in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), and KASI proteins were overexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and then purified on Ni-NTA agarose resin. Subsequently, the various chaperonins consisting of AtCpn60α and AtCpn60β subunits were reconstituted according to previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref031">31</xref>]. After purification by gel-filtration chromatography, the reconstituted chaperonins were used in proteinase K protection assays of denatured KASI protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5C, 5D and 5E</xref>, KASI was digested by proteinase K in the presence of Cpn60A1-B1, Cpn60A1-B2 or Cpn60A1-B3, indicating that KASI was not likely to form stable <italic>cis</italic>-ternary complexes with Cpn20 and chaperonins containing CPNA1. In contrast, in the presence of Cpn60A2-B2 or Cpn60A2-B3, almost all of the KASI protein was protected from digestion by proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>), which was likely due to the formation of the stable <italic>cis</italic>-ternary complexes. Taken together, these results showed that denatured KASI protein could only be captured and refolded by Cpn60A2-B2 and Cpn60A2-B3, but not by chaperonins containing CPNA1, confirming that KASI is a specific substrate of the functional chaperonins containing CPNA2.</p>
<p>In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007036.t001">Table 1</xref>, CPNB1 had very high scores in both CPNA2 immunoprecipitation fractions, indicating that CPNB1 could likely interact with CPNA2. To know whether CPNB1 was a functional partner of CPNA2, we also reconstituted the chaperonin consisting of CPNA2 and CPNB1 (Cpn60A2-B1) and performed a proteinase K protection assay of denatured KASI using Cpn60A2-B1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, KASI was not protected from digestion by proteinase K in the presence of Cpn60A2-B1, indicating that Cpn60A2-B1 was not a functional chaperonin that can assist the folding of KASI. This result showed that although CPNB1 could interact with CPNA2 when the CPNA2 protein was overexpressed <italic>in vivo</italic>, it could not form a full-functional chaperonin with CPNA2 alone, providing further evidence supporting the above genetic findings that suggested CPNB1 was not a functional partner of CPNA2.</p>

<title>Premature arrest of <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos is likely caused by reduction of KASI protein</title>
<p>As demonstrated above, KASI is a specific substrate of the functional chaperonin containing CPNA2. To know whether the level of KASI protein was reduced in the <italic>cpna2</italic> homozygous mutant, we first rescued the development of <italic>cpna2-2</italic> homozygous embryos using a <italic>ABI3pro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-HA</italic> construct. Since the <italic>ABI3</italic> gene is specifically expressed in seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref039">39</xref>], we obtained <italic>cpna2-2</italic> homozygous seedlings from <italic>ABI3pro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-HA</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The abnormal seedlings had the white cotyledons and could not develop true leaves even on the fourteenth day after germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Genotypic analysis of the abnormal seedlings also confirmed that they were <italic>cpna2-2</italic> homozygous mutants partially rescued by the <italic>ABI3pro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-HA</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Then we examined KASI protein levels in 7 and 14 DAG seedlings of WT and <italic>cpna2-2</italic> by immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>, KASI protein levels in 7 and 14 DAG seedlings of <italic>cpna2-2</italic> were reduced to approximately one-tenth of the level in contemporaneous WT seedlings.

<p>In addition, Wu and Xue reported that <italic>KASI</italic> was crucial for embryo development and <italic>KASI</italic> deficiency resulted in disrupted embryo development before the globular stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref040">40</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the decline of KASI protein level in <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos causes abortion of the mutant embryos. To examine this possibility, we constructed a <italic>CPNA2pro</italic>:<italic>amiR-KASI</italic> vector to specifically reduce the expression level of <italic>KASI</italic> in the embryos of transgenic lines at the transition stage and thereafter. In T1 generation transgenic plants, we chose three lines for follow-up studies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, we found that the expression levels of <italic>KASI</italic> in lines 18 and 23 were reduced by almost half, whereas the expression level of <italic>KASI</italic> in line 16 remained unchanged. Then we carefully examined embryo development in ovules of wild type, line 16, line 18, and line 23. In the ovules of line 16, embryos developed similarly to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In contrast, when wild-type embryos reached the heart stage, almost all the embryos of line 18 and line 23 still stayed at the globular stage, and reached the heart stage when normal embryos entered the torpedo stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Embryos in the ovules of line 18 and line 23 ultimately could reach the cotyledon stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and the fertility of line 18 and line 23 plants was not affected. Moreover, we also counted the percentages of all embryonic morphologies in the 3, 4, 5, and 7 DAP siliques of wild type and transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s007">S3 Table</xref>), further confirming the delayed embryo development in lines 18 and 23, consistent with the morphological observations.</p>

<title>Structural basis of functional specialization of CPNA2</title>
<p>As the above results showed, the functional chaperonin containing CPNA2 could specifically assist in the folding of KASI and could play a unique role during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo development. To clarify the structural basis of functional specialization of CPNA2, we first analyzed the three-dimensional (3-D) structures of GroEL, CPNA1, and CPNA2 through homology modeling. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, compared with GroEL and CPNA1, CPNA2 lacked strands 2 and 3. To confirm the importance of strands 2 and 3, we also did homology modeling of the CPNA2 orthologs in <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, and <italic>Morus notabilis</italic>. Surprisingly, these orthologs all possess strands 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), suggesting that the lack of strands 2 and 3 is not likely to be necessary for functional specialization of CPNA2. Moreover, Ile 150 (I150) and Asp 398 (D398), which are crucial for ATP/ADP binding in GroEL, are also highly conserved in CPNA1 and CPNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

<p>In previous studies, a few positions in the apical domain of GroEL had been proposed as substrate binding sites, which are highly conserved in many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref044">44</xref>]. To know whether these positions led to functional specialization of CPNA2, we first examined the corresponding positions in the homologous proteins of CPNA1 and CPNA2 by protein sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The result showed that the highly conserved hydrophobic residue Ala 259 in the orthologs of CPNA1 is converted to a hydrophilic residue Glu or Ser in the orthologs of CPNA2, while the conserved positively charged residue Arg 267 in Cpn60α1 is mostly replaced by an uncharged residue Gln or Asn in Cpn60α2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007036.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<title>Different Cpn60α subunits have specific Cpn60β subunits as their functional partners in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>Chloroplast chaperonins are composed of two types of chaperonin subunits, Cpn60α and Cpn60β, which is different from the chaperonins in bacteria and mitochondria. Several previous studies demonstrated that ch-Cpn60s consisting of nearly equal amounts of Cpn60α and Cpn60β were the native form of chloroplast chaperonins <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the Cpn60β subunit could also form the chaperonin complex in reconstitution experiments alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref031">31</xref>]. Among the four Cpn60β subunits in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtCpn60β1, AtCpn60β2, and AtCpn60β3 have more than 90% identity, while AtCpn60β4 shares only 60% identity with the other three AtCpn60β subunits. However, the homo-oligomers reconstituted with AtCpn60β1, AtCpn60β2 or AtCpn60β3 have unique physicochemical properties, different preferences for various co-chaperonins, and distinct abilities of folding substrates, implying the functional divergence of Cpn60β1/2/3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the phenotypes of different combinations of <italic>AtCpn60β</italic> double mutants, and found that <italic>cpnb1 cpnb2</italic> and <italic>cpnb2 cpnb3</italic> double mutant embryos phenocopied <italic>cpna1</italic> and <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos, respectively. This finding suggested that CPNA1 plays a role in embryo development together with CPNB1 and CPNB2, while CPNA2 can function with CPNB2 and CPNB3. Moreover, we found that CPNB3 could not be detected in the CPNA1 immunoprecipitation fractions, whereas it was abundant in the CPNA2 immunoprecipitation fractions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007036.t001">Table 1</xref>). This result indicated that CPNA1 had far lower affinity for CPNB3 compared with CPNA2, further confirming that CPNB3 is the functional partner of CPNA2 but not CPNA1, consistent with the genetic results. In addition, we found that the chaperonin complex reconstituted with CPNA2 and CPNB1 could not protect KASI from proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), thus suggesting that CPNB1 is the functional partner of CPNA1 but not CPNA2, consistent with the genetic results. These findings provided evidence that different AtCpn60α subunits could bind specific AtCpn60β subunits as their functional partners, indicating the functional divergence of Cpn60α subunits in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we also found that although CPNB1 and CPNA2 do not appear to function together in the folding of KASI, CPNB1 was abundant in the CPNA2 immunoprecipitation fractions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007036.t001">Table 1</xref>). It was also reported that AtCpn60β1/2/3 and AtCpn60α1 usually formed the native chaperonin together <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref030">30</xref>], even though we did not detect CPNB3 in CPNA1 immunoprecipitation fractions possibly due to low affinity of CPNB3 for CPNA1. These results suggested that all the AtCpn60β1/2/3 subunits are usually mixed into native chaperonins containing the Cpn60α subunit <italic>in vivo</italic>, although they have different affinity for specific Cpn60α subunit. Moreover, although it had been reported that the native chaperonin containing Cpn60β4 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is composed of seven Cpn60α1, two Cpn60β4, and five Cpn60β1/2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref021">21</xref>], the exact proportions of AtCpn60β1, AtCpn60β2, and AtCpn60β3 in native chaperonins are difficult to determine due to similar molecular weights and high identity of AtCpn60β1/2/3. Further study is still needed to clarify the stoichiometry of subunits in native ch-Cpn60s of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>Functional chaperonins containing CPNA2 can specifically assist in the folding of KASI</title>
<p>Although multiple chaperonin genes are present in a high proportion of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the biological significance of duplication and variation of chaperonin genes has yet to be fully elucidated. Recently, a study on the type II chaperonin of <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> showed that three different chaperonin subunits (α, β, γ) could form three types of chaperonins at different temperatures, and specific chaperonins could fold a distinct range of substrates to adapt to environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref033">33</xref>]. Moreover, it was also reported that GroEL1 in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> specifically interacts with KasA (a key component of type II Fatty Acid Synthesis) to affect mycolic acid synthesis and biofilm formation, whereas GroEL2 provides the housekeeping chaperone function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref035">35</xref>]. In the field of chloroplast chaperonins, Zhang and coworkers recently determined the crystal structure of the apical domains of Cpn60α and Cpn60β1 in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, and elucidated the structural basis for why Cpn60α and Cpn60β subunits have different affinity for substrates and co-chaperonins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref046">46</xref>]. Additionally, in line with the divergence of protein sequence, the Cpn60β4 subunit in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has a unique structure and the chaperonin containing Cpn60β4 could specifically assist the folding of NdhH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref021">21</xref>]. These findings revealed that duplication and variation of chaperonin genes could extend the function of chaperonins in various species.</p>
<p>Here, we found that KASI, a protein involved in <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis, was far more abundant in CPNA2 immunoprecipitation fractions than in CPNA1 immunoprecipitation fractions, implying that KASI was likely to be a specific substrate of the chaperonin containing CPNA2. To confirm this conjecture, we conducted the proteinase K protection assay of KASI in the presence of different chaperonin complexes. It was shown that both Cpn60A2-B2 and Cpn60A2-B3 could perfectly protect KASI from digestion by proteinase K, whereas all the chaperonins containing CPNA1 could not protect KASI. This result further showed that the functional chaperonins containing CPNA2 could specifically assist in the folding of KASI, suggesting that CPNA2, a minor Cpn60α subunit, has a unique function in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Moreover, we also examined two conserved positions proposed as substrate binding sites in the orthologs of CPNA2, and found that they were not responsible for the functional specialization of CPNA2. Hence, detailed structural analysis of the chaperonin containing CPNA2 is required to further elucidate the mechanism of KASI folding.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was reported that chaperonins in various species had a wide range of substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref001">1</xref>], therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that the chaperonin containing CPNA2 has other specific substrates in addition to KASI. Moreover, since we conducted Co-IP assay in 7 DAG seedlings but not in embryos due to technology limitations, it is possible that there are some unknown specific substrates of the chaperonin containing CPNA2 that only exist in embryos. The detection of more specific substrates would further contribute to the functional elucidation of <italic>CPNA2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>Reduction of KASI protein level is likely to cause the abortion of <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos</title>
<p>A number of genes involved in <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis are essential for early embryo development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <italic>GURKE</italic>, a gene encoding the acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC1, is required for partitioning the apical part of globular embryos in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref047">47</xref>], and loss-of-function of <italic>CAC1A</italic>, a gene encoding the biotin carboxyl-carrier protein BCCP1, obviously delayed embryo development from the early globular stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref048">48</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>KASI</italic> deficiency was also found to result in arrested development of most <italic>kasI</italic> embryos before the globular stage, and delayed development of few <italic>kasI</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref040">40</xref>]. Additionally, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> microarray data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref049">49</xref>], we found that the expression level of <italic>KASI</italic> has a dramatic increase when embryos reach the heart stage, implying that <italic>KASI</italic> is likely to be crucial for the transition of globular embryos to heart-shaped embryos. To confirm this conjecture, we specifically reduced the expression level of <italic>KASI</italic> in the embryos at the transition stage and thereafter by transforming the <italic>CPNA2pro</italic>:<italic>amiR-KASI</italic> vector. In the transgenic lines, we observed that the process of globular embryos reaching the heart stage was delayed, confirming that <italic>KASI</italic> plays an important role in the formation of heart-shaped embryos.</p>
<p>Since <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos are arrested at the globular stage and loss-of-function of <italic>CPNA2</italic> could result in a significant decrease in the KASI protein level that is crucial for the transition of globular embryos to heart-shaped embryos (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g006">6</xref>), the arrest of <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos is likely due to the reduction of the well-folded KASI protein level in mutant embryos. However, we did not find any <italic>CPNA2pro</italic>:<italic>amiR-KASI</italic> transgenic line in which embryo development is arrested at the globular stage, perhaps because it would be difficult to obtain transgenic lines in which the expression of <italic>KASI</italic> is nearly knocked out since <italic>KASI</italic> is an embryo-lethal gene as reported by Wu and Xue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref040">40</xref>]. Additionally, as previously mentioned, other unknown specific substrates of the chaperonin containing CPNA2 might exist in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryos, and these substrates are also possible to play an important role in embryo development. Hence the elucidation of why <italic>cpna2</italic> embryos are arrested at the globular stage still needs further research.</p>

<title><italic>CPNA2</italic> is crucial for chloroplast biogenesis during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryo and seedling development</title>
<p>During plastid development, proplastids develop highly organized thylakoid membrane to differentiate into mature chloroplasts, and formation of the thylakoid membrane requires coordinated synthesis and assembly of proteins, pigments, and glycerolipids. In chloroplasts, <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid (FA) synthesis produces 16:0 and 18:0 FAs that are the building blocks of membrane glycerolipid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref050">50</xref>]. Therefore, FA synthesis is crucial for the formation of the thylakoid membrane and for chloroplast biogenesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that <italic>CPNA2</italic> deficiency could result in a significant decrease in the KASI protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g006">Fig 6</xref>). KASI is a key condensing enzyme involved in <italic>de novo</italic> FA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref050">50</xref>], and therefore, it is likely that <italic>CPNA2</italic> deficiency also disrupts FA synthesis in chloroplasts, thus impeding formation of the thylakoid membrane and chloroplast biogenesis. In accordance with this conjecture, we found that abnormal chloroplasts in <italic>cpna2-2</italic> embryos lacked thylakoid membranes and contained a deeply stained mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>), indicating that chloroplast biogenesis in <italic>cpna2-2</italic> embryos is severely disrupted. Moreover, the result of GUS staining showed that <italic>CPNA2</italic> is highly expressed in the SAM of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), implying that <italic>CPNA2</italic> may also play an important role in chloroplast biogenesis in the SAM. This idea was further supported by the result that the <italic>cpna2-2</italic> homozygous seedlings could not develop true leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007036.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>CPNA2</italic> is crucial for chloroplast biogenesis, and thus affects the developmental processes of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryos and seedlings.</p>
<p>In the process of biological evolution, gene duplication and variation usually extend the function of original genes to adapt to environmental changes. In this study, we found that CPNA2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> belongs to a unique type of Cpn60α subunits that only exist in angiosperms. Functional chaperonins consisting of CPNA2 and specific Cpn60β subunits could specifically assist in the folding of KASI, and play an important role in the transition of globular embryos to heart-shaped embryos in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This neofunctionalization of Cpn60α subunits in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> provides a novel insight into the significance of multiple <italic>Cpn60α</italic> genes in plants, and reveals the relationship between duplication and functional specialization of chaperonin genes.</p>

<p>Chaperonin-substrate complexes were isolated from the <italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>CPNA2-HA</italic> and <italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>CPNA1-HA</italic> transgenic plants with the μMACS HA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the procedure described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref021">21</xref>]. In brief, intact chloroplasts were first isolated from 7 DAG seedlings of the transformants by the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref060">60</xref>]. Then the freshly isolated chloroplasts were ruptured in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.01% Tween 20, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM glucose, 30 U/ml hexokinase) plus protease inhibitor cocktail (Biotool). After lysis of chloroplasts, ADP (Sigma) was added into the lysates to reach a concentration of 10 mM, and then the lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and then NaCl was added into the supernatants to reach a final concentration of 150 mM. After incubating with 50 μl anti-HA Microbeads for 2.5 h at 4°C, the mixture was transferred to columns placed in a magnetic field. After rinsing four times with 200 μl washing buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM ADP), twice with 200 μl washing buffer II (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM ADP) and once with washing buffer III (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM ADP), the immunoprecipitates were then eluted with 50 μl elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 50 mM DTT, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.005% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol).</p>
<p>After elution, the immunoprecipitates were in-gel digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref061">61</xref>] with minor modification. In brief, the total protein was loaded to the gel and SDS-PAGE was conducted. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained, sliced and in-gel digested by trypsin, and then the desalted peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid/2% acetonitrile/98% H<sub>2</sub>O, loaded onto a C18 trap column (Thermo Scientific), and subsequently eluted from the trap column over the self-packed C18 analytic column in a 120 min gradient. The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by using a Q Exactive HF instrument (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an Easy-nLC 1000 system. MS data was acquired and submitted to Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific) to perform protein identification and quantitation utilizing its integrated SEQUEST HT search engine and Percolator algorithm. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and 20 mmu for MS/MS. Carbamido methylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine and deamidation of N, Q as a dynamic modification. A high confidence dataset with less than 1% FDR (false discovery rate) was used for peptide filtering. Files from the samples were searched against the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteome database of Swiss-Prot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Following sonication of the BL21 cells, the fusion proteins were purified by High Affinity Ni-NTA Resin (Genscript).</p>
<p>For the proteinase K protection assay, Cpn60s were reconstituted with Cpn60α and Cpn60β according to the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref062">62</xref>]. 15 μM Cpn60α, 15 μM Cpn60β and 10 μM Cpn20 were mixed in the incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 16 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT and 5 mM ATP), and then incubated for 2 h at 30°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction of the reconstitution mixture was collected and loaded on a Enrich Size Exclusion Column 650 (Bio-Rad). Then the reconstituted Cpn60s were purified and collected by gel-filtration chromatography.</p>
<p>The proteinase K protection assay was performed according to the procedure as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007036.ref062">62</xref>] with some modification. The various purified Cpn60s (1 μM) and denatured substrate KASI (0.64 μM) were incubated in refolding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.9 μM Cpn20 and 1 mM ADP) for 20 min at 25°C, and then proteinase K (sigma) was added to a final concentration of 2.0 μg/mL. After incubation for 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min at 25°C, the proteolysis was stopped by adding PMSF (2 mM). Finally, the content of the substrates in reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with His-tag antibody (Genscript).</p>
