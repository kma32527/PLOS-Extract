<abstract>
<p>Hox mediated neuroblast apoptosis is a prevalent way to pattern larval central nervous system (CNS) by different Hox genes, but the mechanism of this apoptosis is not understood. Our studies with Abdominal-A (Abd-A) mediated larval neuroblast (pNB) apoptosis suggests that AbdA, its cofactor Extradenticle (Exd), a helix-loop-helix transcription factor Grainyhead (Grh), and Notch signaling transcriptionally contribute to expression of RHG family of apoptotic genes. We find that Grh, AbdA, and Exd function together at multiple motifs on the apoptotic enhancer. <italic>In vivo</italic> mutagenesis of these motifs suggest that they are important for the maintenance of the activity of the enhancer rather than its initiation. We also find that Exd function is independent of its known partner homothorax in this apoptosis. We extend some of our findings to Deformed expressing region of sub-esophageal ganglia where pNBs undergo a similar Hox dependent apoptosis. We propose a mechanism where common players like Exd-Grh-Notch work with different Hox genes through region specific enhancers to pattern respective segments of larval central nervous system.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Specification of the head to tail axis of the developing central nervous system is carried out by Hox genes. Hox mediated programmed cell death of the neural progenitor cells plays an important role in specification of this axis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood. We have studied this phenomenon in abdominal and subesophageal regions of larval central nervous system of Drosophila. We find that different Hox genes use a combination of common players (Extradenticle, Grainyhead and Notch) but employ region specific enhancers to cause progenitor cell death in different segments of developing central nervous system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apoptosis is used to eliminate defective and/or dispensable cell types during development of an organism. Removal of excess cells from the developing tissue is critical for its final size, shape and functionality in the whole organismal context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref003">3</xref>]. The central nervous system (CNS) also relies heavily on apoptosis for its patterning and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Equally important and one of the earliest steps in development of CNS is specification of anterior posterior axis (AP axis). AP axis specification is carried out by Hox genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref011">11</xref>] and their TALE homeodomain containing cofactors; Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref013">13</xref>]; and Pbx and Meis in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref014">14</xref>]. Hox genes pattern CNS by regulating proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref022">22</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>]. Their role in developmental apoptosis of CNS has been reported earlier, both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref018">18</xref>] as well as in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref022">22</xref>], but the molecular mechanism of the cell death in neural stem cells as well as their progeny are not known.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hox mediated apoptosis of neural stem cells (neuroblast-NB) and their progeny happens both in embryonic and post-embryonic (larval) stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref030">30</xref>]. This apoptosis is mediated through activation of RHG family of genes (<italic>reaper</italic>, <italic>hid</italic>, <italic>grim</italic> and <italic>sickle</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref034">34</xref>], but the precise molecular mechanism tying a particular Hox gene to death of a specific cell type is not known. In larval stages, Hox mediated NB apoptosis has been reported for Labial (Lab), Deformed (Dfd), Sex combs reduced (Scr) and Abdominal-A (AbdA) expressing regions of CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>]. AbdA mediated larval NB (postembryonic NB-pNB) apoptosis is so far the best characterized of all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>], yet the precise molecular details of the same are lacking.</p>
<p>The segments A3-A7 of embryonic ventral nerve cord has 60 NBs each (30 per hemi-segment). Following an embryonic wave of AbdA mediated NB apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref017">17</xref>], majority of NBs undergo cell death, leaving behind only 3 NBs per hemisegment. Following embryonic phase of apoptosis, abdominal NBs stop expressing AbdA and enter quiescence by the end of embryogenesis. All the 3 NBs have specific locations and developmental potential and are designated as NB5-2 (Ventromedial-Vm), NB5-3 (Ventrolateral-Vl) and NB3-5 (Dorsolateral-Dl) in embryonic stages, and Lineage-6, Lineage-5 and Lineage-9 in larval stages respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref037">37</xref>]. These 6 NBs (3 per hemisegment) exit quiescence in early third instar larval (L3) stage (66–72 hours after egg laying-AEL) and divide for different durations, following which an asynchronous increase in AbdA expression in these cells causes their apoptosis and removal from CNS over a course of next 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>]. The pNBs mutant for either <italic>abdA</italic>, <italic>or grainyhead</italic> (<italic>grh</italic>-a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor) or RHG genes [as seen in genomic deletion-<italic>Df(3L)H99</italic>] escape apoptosis, underlying their individual importance in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>]. The mechanistic details of how Grh and AbdA mediate pNB apoptosis through RHG genes is not known.</p>
<p>Similarly, in subesophageal ganglia (SEG) of larval CNS (which expresses Dfd, Scr and Antennapedia), 36 NBs (18 segmental pairs) are reported in second instar larval (L2) stage. Out of these 36 pNBs (18 pairs), 10 pNBs (5 pairs) are found in Dfd expressing region of SEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>], here on referred to as Dfd-SEG. Four out of these 10 pNBs undergo Dfd mediated apoptosis as larva progresses from L2 to L3 stage (illustrated later in a Figure and detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s011">S1 Text</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>]. The molecular mechanism of this apoptosis and role of Grh in this phenomenon is yet to be investigated.</p>
<p>A genomic deletion analysis had identified a 22kb region referred to as <italic>NBRR</italic> (<italic>NeuroBlast Regulatory Region</italic>), which contains NB specific enhancer for apoptotic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref038">38</xref>]. A 5 Kb subfragment (<italic>enh-1</italic>) of <italic>NBRR</italic>, has been suggested to be the apoptotic enhancer required for embryonic NBs. However, it is not clear whether the same enhancer functions to cause larval NB apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>]. This study also suggests that pulse of AbdA expression responsible for larval NB apoptosis, is initiated in response to activation of Notch signaling in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis of Hox mediated larval pNB apoptosis. We analyzed 22 Kb <italic>NBRR</italic> and have narrowed down the larval abdominal apoptotic enhancer to a 1Kb region of the genome. Our experiments suggest that AbdA, Exd, Grh and Notch transcriptionally contribute to regulation of RHG genes, and Exd has a Hth independent role in this apoptosis. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments suggest that AbdA and Grh physically interact with each other, and Grh-AbdA-Exd assemble a tetrameric complex with DNA on some of the binding motifs in the apoptotic enhancer. <italic>In vivo</italic> mutagenesis of all the motifs suggest, that they are important not for the initiation but for the maintenance of the enhancer activity, and consequently expression of RHG genes. Our analysis of the enhancer mutant for Su(H) binding sites reveal that Notch signaling also has a direct input in the maintenance of the enhancer activity and hence RHG genes in abdominal pNBs.</p>
<p>Subsequently we show that Dfd mediated pNB apoptosis in SEG use same players (Hox-Exd-Grh-Notch) but employ a different enhancer located outside <italic>NBRR</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, this study describes a common mechanism of RHG gene regulation in pNBs undergoing Hox dependent apoptosis. Wherein combination of Exd-Grh-Notch are employed by specific Hox genes, to carry out apoptosis in different regions of developing CNS through separate spatial enhancers.</p>

<title>Analysis of 22Kb NBRR</title>
<p>23 Kb genomic region (including 22Kb <italic>NBRR</italic> and additional 500bps on either side; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) was divided into 5 over lapping fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). LacZ reporter lines were generated for these fragments and analyzed for their expression in larval CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s012">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Since AbdA pulse doesn’t come on simultaneously in all the pNBs, therefore these cells die asynchronously. NBs start dying from early L3 stage and over a period of next 48 hrs different pNBs activate AbdA at different times and undergo apoptosis with majority of death happening between mid to late L3 stages. Owing to this, we chose to look at the larval ventral nerve cords (VNC) in time range of 84–90 hrs AEL. At this time, we expected majority of abdominal pNBs to be lacZ<sup>+</sup>. The reporter lines for <italic>NBRR</italic> fragments <italic>F1</italic> (8 Kb), <italic>F2A</italic> (6 Kb) and <italic>F2B</italic> (6 Kb) failed to show any lacZ expression in abdominal pNBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s001">S1A–S1C Fig</xref>). However, <italic>NBRR fragment-3</italic> (8 Kb) and <italic>fragment-4</italic> (8 Kb) reporter lines (here on referred to as <italic>F3-lacZ</italic> and <italic>F4-lacZ</italic>) expressed in pNBs of abdominal CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). This indicated that the apoptotic enhancer lies in 3 Kb overlapping region of <italic>F3</italic> and <italic>F4</italic> fragments. This was further confirmed by analyzing the expression of the reporter line made from last 4.5 Kb region of <italic>F3</italic> (referred to as <italic>F3B-lacZ</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Subsequent reporter lines were made by subfragmenting 3Kb overlapping region, of which a 1Kb reporter lacZ line (referred to as <italic>F3B3-lacZ</italic>) recapitulated larval pNB expression in abdominal pNBs at 84-90hrs AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to isolate the smallest modular enhancer, a 717bp subfragment was further selected from 1 Kb based on its sequence conservation across multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, chromatin accessibility and the presence of multiple transcription factor (TF) binding sites, as assessed by UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref039">39</xref>]. The transgenic line for 717bp subfragment (referred to as <italic>717-lacZ</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) was generated by site specific insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref040">40</xref>]. We found that this reporter line expressed in pNB at 84–90 hrs AEL, but the expression of the reporter was limited to Vl pNBs at late L3 stage. Our analysis suggests that this was a consequence of the insertion of the construct at the specific site (attP40-25C6), since insertion of 1Kb <italic>F3B3-lacZ</italic> at the same site also restricted its expression to Vl pNBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). Owing to this, even though <italic>717-lacZ</italic> expressed in pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and exhibited other features of genuine apoptotic enhancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), specific insertion site seems to have altered its activity. Therefore, majority of following experiments were done with 1Kb <italic>F3B3-lacZ</italic>, and 717 bp enhancer was mainly considered for <italic>in vivo</italic> binding site mutant analysis.</p>
<p>In order to assess the temporal regulation of these genomic sub-fragments, we analyzed the expression of 8kb <italic>F3</italic>, 1kb <italic>F3B3</italic> and <italic>717-lacZ</italic> at early L3 stage (66-72hrs AEL), which was a few hours prior to initiation of pNB apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We found all the reporter lines expressed weakly in abdominal pNBs and their expression was limited only to a few abdominal pNBs. However, as larvae progress to mid L3 stage, the expression is extended into more pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1B–1E</xref>), suggesting that these <italic>enhancer-lacZ</italic> lines reflect the temporal control of RHG gene expression.</p>
<p>In order to genetically isolate the enhancer, we also generated a 14.6 Kb genomic deletion called <italic>M22</italic> (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s011">S1 Text</xref>) which deletes the entire <italic>F3</italic> fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). We observed that heteroallelic combination of <italic>M22/MM3</italic> (<italic>MM3</italic> is a 54 Kb deletion used earlier to isolate <italic>NBRR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref038">38</xref>]) showed ectopic NBs in the abdominal region of CNS (161.9+/-12.7, n = 20 VNCs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). The number of ectopic pNBs were comparable to those observed in <italic>MM3/MM3</italic> deletion (167.6+/-10.8, for n = 12 VNCs), suggesting that 14.6Kb <italic>M22</italic> deletion uncovers the enhancer for abdominal pNB apoptosis.</p>
<p>The reporter line expression and <italic>M22</italic> deletion analysis strongly suggested that enhancer for abdominal pNB lies within 1Kb <italic>F3B3</italic> region of <italic>NBRR</italic>.</p>

<title>Apoptotic enhancer sustain its expression till late L3 stage</title>
<p>Since, we could capture lacZ<sup>+</sup> abdominal pNBs with reasonable frequency, this indicated to us that lacZ expression in these cells was not immediately followed by cell death. We also observed that intensity of lacZ expression in pNBs in early L3 stage was weak and became stronger in mid L3 stage (Compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s003">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g001">Fig 1B–1E</xref>). This suggested that lacZ reporter expression (and RHG genes) comes on and then sustain itself, till these cells undergo apoptosis. This is congruent to what is reported earlier in case of <italic>grim</italic> deletion where NB death is delayed till late L3 stages, when <italic>rpr</italic> finally executes the cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Considering these observations, we expected that the apoptotic enhancer should be capable of maintaining the expression of the lacZ reporter (and RHG genes) in abdominal pNBs even till late L3 stage of development. To this end, we tested different reporter lines (<italic>F3</italic>, <italic>F4</italic>, <italic>F3B</italic>, <italic>F3B3</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>, and <italic>717-lacZ</italic> shown with later results) for their sustained expression in pNBs destined for apoptosis. This was achieved by testing the expression of lacZ lines in cell death blocked background by either using genetic deletions (<italic>for NBRR</italic>) or by expression of apoptosis blocker p35.</p>

<title>Grh and AbdA transcriptionally regulate apoptotic enhancer</title>
<p>Grh has been reported to be expressed in CNS from embryonic stage 11. Its expression in larvae is limited to NBs and is excluded from neurons. Since CNS specific <italic>grh</italic> mutants show a block in abdominal pNB apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref042">42</xref>], we decided to investigate its role in AbdA mediated pNB apoptosis.</p>
<p>To this end, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down <italic>grh</italic>, <italic>abdA</italic> and <italic>Notch</italic> (discussed in later section) in pNBs and score for their effect on 1Kb <italic>F3B3-lacZ</italic> reporter line expression. <italic>tub-gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> was used to temporally induce the knockdown from late embryonic stage and larvae were dissected in late L3 stage (114–120 hrs AEL; t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).

<p>Ectopic expression of AbdA in thoracic pNBs is known to cause their apoptosis. Therefore, we expected that <italic>enhancer-lacZ</italic> expression should also get induced in these cells in response to ectopic AbdA (Grh is already present in these cells). Ectopic expression of AbdA was induced from early L3 stage and larvae were dissected 7 and 12 hrs later in early and mid L3 stage for <italic>F3</italic> and <italic>F4-lacZ</italic> respectively (t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8F Fig</xref>). We observed that <italic>F3-lacZ</italic> expressed in very few thoracic pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) in control VNCs, whereas the ectopic expression of AbdA induced <italic>F3-lacZ</italic> in many thoracic pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Consistent with this observation, <italic>F4-lacZ</italic> expression was also ectopically induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). We also found that induction of lacZ happens primarily in pNBs as indicated by co-staining for AbdA, Dpn and lacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). The lacZ expression seen in some of the progeny is a consequence of these cells inheriting lacZ from their progenitors. Similarly, we observed 1Kb <italic>F3B3</italic> and <italic>717-lacZ</italic> also get induced in response to AbdA over expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s005">S5E–S5H and S5G and S5H Fig</xref>). Since these smaller subfragments were more promiscuous in their expression in thoracic region, induction in response to AbdA was scored by increase in intensity of lacZ expression in addition to ectopic expression in thoracic NBs. Ectopic expression of lacZ could also be detected in central brain as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s005">S5F and S5H Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The inducible expression of <italic>F3</italic>, <italic>F4</italic>, <italic>F3B3 and 717-lacZ</italic> further suggested that apoptotic enhancer is responsive to ectopic induction of AbdA. Further, the knockdown suggest that AbdA and Grh transcriptionally regulate RHG genes in pNBs through 1Kb <italic>F3B3</italic> enhancer.</p>

<title>Grh is important for pNB apoptosis in Dfd-SEG region</title>
<p>Out of ten pNBs in Dfd-SEG in L2 stage, four undergo Dfd dependent apoptosis as animal progresses to L3 stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>]. In order to investigate molecular basis of this apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), we first checked whether Grh was expressed in pNBs found in L2 stage in Dfd-SEG region.

The pNBs were marked by Dpn and the whole lineage was marked by <italic>inscGAL4</italic> driven <italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). We consistently found 10 pNBs (9.92+/-0.27, for n = 13 L2 VNCs) which were Dpn<sup>+</sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) in early L2 stage (48–54 hrs AEL).

By late L3 stage (114–120 hrs AEL) only 6 pNBs and associated lineages were observed. We found that pNBs in these lineages always expressed Grh (6.0+-/-0, for more than 20 L3 VNCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g004">Fig 4C and 4F</xref>) and showed very low or no expression of Dfd.

On a closer observation of the lineages in both abdominal and Dfd-SEG segments of VNCs, we found that Hox-Grh code of pNBs and their progeny was same: pNBs were always Grh<sup>+</sup>/Hox<sup>-</sup>, progeny were always Grh<sup>-</sup>/Hox<sup>+</sup> (checked for more than 20 L3 VNCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g004">Fig 4D–4D’ and 4E–4E’</xref>).</p>

<p>This implied that apoptosis of pNBs in Dfd-SEG may also be Grh dependent, and is possibly triggered by change in Hox<sup>-</sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> state of pNB to Hox<sup>+</sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> state.

<title>Role of Notch in pNB apoptosis is independent of Grh</title>
<p>Notch signaling is often utilized to make decisions in multiple developmental contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref046">46</xref>]. More recently, it has been suggested to play a role in abdominal pNB apoptosis, where it was implicated in activating the pulse of AbdA triggering pNB apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>]. We first checked whether Notch has a lineage autonomous function in pNBs of abdominal segments by making Notch loss of function MARCM clones (<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>55e11</italic></sup>). We recovered two kind of clones in abdominal region of CNS; the first class of clones were recovered in A3-A7 segments of CNS where the AbdA mediated abdominal pNB apoptosis is mainly reported (discussed below). A second class of clones were recovered in A1-A2 segments where no AbdA mediated apoptosis occurs (detailed in discussion). The clones recovered in A3-A7 segments had a surviving pNB at 114–120 hrs AEL indicating that pNB had failed to undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). These clones were small and showed no consistent and significant downregulation of AbdA in the pNBs (compared to the levels of AbdA in progeny of the same lineage, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Therefore, we checked for the levels of Grh in these cells and found them to be unaffected in surviving pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Out of 23 clones examined across 10 VNCs, only 3 clones showed complete AbdA downregulation, 15 clones showed partial downregulation, and 5 clones showed no downregulation of AbdA. We also employed RNAi to verify these observations. Notch knockdown was initiated from late embryonic stage and its effect was examined in late L3 stage (t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). Three types of ectopic NBs were recovered; the first two type of NBs showed AbdA levels comparable or less than neuronal progeny of the lineage, these were designated as NBs with no or partial AbdA downregulation. The third type of NBs showed no AbdA expression (categorized as NBs showing complete downregulation). We report on an average 20 pNBs (20.0+/-2.7, n = 12 VNCs) surviving per VNC, of which only 2 pNBs (2.5+/-1.44, n = 12 VNCs) could show us complete downregulation, while out of remaining 17, 10 pNB (10+/-2.92, n = 12 VNCs) showed partial and 7 pNBs (7.67+/-3.5, n = 12 VNCs) showed no AbdA downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Thus, both RNAi and mutant data for Notch demonstrate that Notch probably does not induce AbdA expression in pNB of A3-A7 segment. Moreover, if Notch was indeed capable of inducing AbdA expression in pNBs, in that case overexpression of NICD (Notch Intracellular domain) in abdominal pNBs should induce AbdA and hence <italic>F3-lacZ</italic> in majority of these cells. We overexpressed NICD from mid L2 stage, and larvae were dissected after 14hrs at 30°C (approximately in early L3 stage, 70Hrs AEL, t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8G Fig</xref>). However, we did not see ectopic induction of <italic>F3-lacZ</italic> in response to NICD overexpression in majority of the abdominal pNBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s005">S5L Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>These results suggested to us that Notch signaling may not be the trigger for AbdA induction in pNBs of A3-A7 segments but instead may have a direct role in pNB apoptosis. In order to validate this, we induced Notch knockdown and AbdA over expression simultaneously from early L1 stage (<italic>gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>; inscGAL4&gt;UAS-Notch-RNAi</italic>, <italic>UAS-abdA</italic>, <italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic>) and dissected larvae at late L3 stage of development (t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). If Notch signaling was working only through AbdA activation, over expression of AbdA in Notch knockdown background should have caused the apoptosis of abdominal pNBs. On the contrary, in our experiments, we found that Notch knockdown blocked apoptosis of abdominal pNBs even when AbdA was over expressed in these cells (16.8+/-3.2 surviving pNBs, in 11 VNCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Even though AbdA was expressed in surviving abdominal pNBs in late L3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6D”</xref>), we wanted to ensure that sufficient levels of AbdA were expressed in pNBs in earlier stages, for this we analyzed VNCs in mid L3 stages as well. We found sufficient levels of AbdA were expressed in abdominal pNBs in mid L3 stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s006">S6A” and S6B” Fig</xref>). These observation and downregulation of apoptotic <italic>enhancer-lacZ</italic> in response to RNAi mediated knockdown of Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g003">Fig 3D–3D””</xref>), further reinstate our proposition of a direct role of Notch in abdominal pNB apoptosis.</p>
<p>We also observed that the number of thoracic pNBs found in these VNCs were comparatively less in late L3 stages, which suggested that AbdA was able to cause apoptosis in thoracic region despite Notch knockdown in these cells. Noticeably, some of the surviving pNBs in thoracic segment expressed AbdA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). We think these cell types are refractory to AbdA mediated cell death. This possibly points towards a segment specific role of Notch in pNB apoptosis.</p>
<p>Next, we checked for the role of Notch signaling in pNB apoptosis in Dfd-SEG. For this RNAi mediated knockdown for Notch was induced from late embryonic stage and its effect was assessed in late L3 stage (t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). We could consistently recover 2–3 ectopic pNBs (8.61+/- 0.75, for n = 26 L3 VNCs) in Dfd-SEG as against 6 pNB seen in control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6C and 6E</xref>). A closer observation of the ectopic pNBs show that they have normal levels of Grh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) and also expressed low levels of Dfd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). A comparative quantitation of pNBs recovered for both abdominal segments and Dfd-SEG region, upon Notch knockdown is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6E</xref>.</p>
<p>These results indicate a role of Notch signaling along with Hox and Grh in mediating pNB apoptosis in both abdominal and Dfd-SEG regions. In both cases, we found that Notch signaling does not impact the levels of Grh. Our results with abdominal pNBs further suggests that Notch knockdown is epistatic to AbdA overexpression in pNBs. Therefore, we believe that Notch does not regulate Hox expression and instead plays a direct role in pNB apoptosis.</p>

<title>Exd but not Hth plays an important role in pNB apoptosis</title>
<p>Hox genes have been known to function with two other TALE-HD containing transcription factors, Hth and Exd. We tested the role of Exd in pNB apoptosis in abdominal region by making MARCM clones. We recovered NB containing <italic>exd</italic> mutant clones in abdominal region (n = 16 clones in A3-A7 segment of 13 larval VNCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7A–7A””</xref>). These pNB also showed a normal expression of Grh (n = 7 clones scored in 6 VNCs) and AbdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Exd is known to function with Hth, which helps in its nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref047">47</xref>]. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>hth</italic><sup><italic>P2</italic></sup> mutant clones in abdominal region did not block pNB apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7B–7B””</xref>). We noticed that clones were marked with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7B’</xref>), suggesting that pNBs divided normally following the exit from quiescence but then underwent apoptosis (n = 23 clones scored in 10 VNCs). Since <italic>hth</italic><sup><italic>P2</italic></sup> is a strong hypomorph, we tested 6 <italic>hth</italic> RNAi lines.

<p>These results led us to investigate a similar role for Exd and Hth in Dfd-SEG region as well. None of the <italic>exd-RNAi</italic> lines tested could give us ectopic pNBs in abdominal region. However, knockdown of <italic>exd</italic> from early embryonic stages (t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8E Fig</xref>) resulted in approximately 2 ectopic pNBs in Dfd-SEG region in late L3 stage VNCs (1.75+/-0.61 for 19 VNCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). The ectopic NBs obtained were at the characteristic location where <italic>ect1</italic><sup><italic>Dfd</italic></sup> ectopic pNB lineage is normally observed and these lineages were Dfd<sup>+</sup> as well.

<p>Next, we checked for potential Hox, Exd and Grh binding sites in entire 1Kb <italic>F3B3</italic> genomic region. Since Grh plays an important role in this apoptosis and Hox protein bind to AT rich sequences occurring at a high frequency in the genome, we decided to narrow our search for Hox sites by scanning for potential Grh binding sites in the vicinity. We identified 14 such sites conforming to variation of the known Grh binding consensus sequence (WCHGGTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref048">48</xref>], these sites also had AT rich sequences (potential AbdA and Exd binding sites) in 20bp flanking region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref049">49</xref>]. These 14 Grh sites and surrounding AT rich sequences were categorized into two type of motifs.

(B) Shows western blot for GST pulldown assay showing that AbdA-Grh physically interact with each other. Anti-His antibody is used to detect His tagged Grh protein (running approximately 90Kda) pulled down by GST-AbdA. Input is His-Grh lysate. Control commassie stained gel for GST alone and GST-AbdA lanes showing comparative protein loaded in two lanes is shown below the western blot. (C) EMSA for motif-30 (lane 1–13) show that Grh and Hox bind on DNA alone (lane 2, 4–5 respectively). Hox-Grh together show a band of mobility lower than Grh alone (lane 6–7). Hox-Exd show binding (lane 8–9, black arrowhead) on DNA. Hox-Exd-Grh-DNA tetracomplex shows the lowest mobility (lane 12–13, white arrowhead). (D) EMSA with oligo mutant for Grh1 binding site (lane 19–26) show that Hox-Exd binding is intact (lane 24). Hox-Grh complex is compromised (lane16 vs 23) and tetracomplex is disrupted (lane 18 vs 26). (E) EMSA with oligo mutant for Grh2 binding site (lane 32–39) shows that Hox-Exd (lane 37) and Hox-Grh (lane 29 vs 36) complex are reduced but still present. Band for tetracomplex is slightly reduced in intensity but is intact (lane 39), indicating that Grh1 (not Grh2) binding site is critical for tetra-complex assembly. Hox binding sequence is colour coded in red (italicised and underlined as well). Grh1 and 2 binding site sequences are shown in green. Exd binding site sequence is shown in blue. Oligos used are shown at the bottom of the gel. Proteins added to a specific lane are shown at the top of the lane.

On increasing AbdA in presence of fixed concentration of Grh (200ng), a band of mobility slightly lower than Grh band alone was observed (lane 6 and 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). As expected increasing concentration of AbdA in presence of fixed concentration of Exd (200ng) showed AbdA-Exd complex formation on the DNA (lane 8 and 9, black arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Similarly, Grh in the presence of a fixed concentration of Exd (200ng) together showed only a slight increase in Grh binding on DNA (lane 10 and 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Importantly, when Grh and Exd concentrations were kept constant (200ng each), addition of AbdA led to a band of lowest mobility. This tetracomplex (DNA-AbdA-Exd-Grh) is shown by a white arrowhead for lane 12 and 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). All subsequent EMSA experiments were done with fixed concentration of all the proteins (200ng).</p>
<p>Next, in order to test the specificity of Grh binding, oligos mutant for potential Grh1 and Grh2 binding site were analyzed. We observed dramatic decrease in Grh binding in oligo with mutation for Grh1 binding site when compared to wild type oligo (lane 15 vs 20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). It was also noticed that AbdA-Grh complex formation on DNA was compromised (lane 16 vs 23, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). We found that AbdA-Exd complex was unaffected (lane 24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8D</xref>) while tetracomplex could not be visualized in case of Grh1 binding site mutant oligo (lane 18 vs 26, white arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). This indicates that Grh1 site is critical for tetra-complex formation and plays an important role in assembly of Hox-Grh complex.</p>
<p>In Grh2 binding site mutant oligo, we could not find a significant decrease in Grh binding (lane 28 vs 33, green arrow head, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). We also found that AbdA-Grh complex is slightly reduced but is still present (lane 29 vs 36). This could be attributed to two reasons, one possibility is that Grh2 binding site plays a role in AbdA-Grh complex formation; this seems unlikely since mutation of Grh1 binding site abolished the AbdA-Grh binding completely. The more likely explanation could be that since Grh2 binding site overlaps with both Hox1 and Hox2 binding sites, and therefore the mutation of Grh2 site affects the assembly of AbdA-Grh complex.</p>
<p>We also found that AbdA-Exd binding on oligo mutant for Grh2 binding site was reduced but was still present (lane 37, black arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). This could be attributed to the fact that Grh2 site also overlaps with Hox2 site and hence could affect AbdA-Exd binding which happens on Hox2-Exd site (confirmed in later analysis in next section). Most importantly we found that tetracomplex was still intact on the oligo mutant for Grh2 binding site (lane 31 and 39, white arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8E</xref>) suggesting that Grh1 site is more important for the assembly of tetracomplex. These results suggested to us that AbdA and Grh might interact with each other physically.</p>
<p>To test this idea, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> GST-pull down assay, wherein bacterially expressed GST and GST-AbdA protein were bound to GST beads and incubated with His-Grh bacterial lysate (input). The proteins pulled down (from His-Grh lysate) by GST-AbdA and GST alone were separated on SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-His antibody. We found that while GST alone showed no band, GST-AbdA could successfully pull down His-Grh (approximately 90Kda- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>These results indicate that AbdA and Grh are not only important for tetracomplex formation, they also physically interact with each other.</p>

<title>AbdA-Exd are critical for tetracomplex formation</title>
<p>Next, we examined oligos mutants for AT rich sequences to identify Hox and Exd binding sites. Motif-30 oligo mutant for potential Hox1+2 binding sites showed no AbdA binding (lane 122 vs 128, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s007">S7J Fig</xref>), suggesting that these were Hox binding sites. Subsequently, we tested AbdA and Exd binding on oligo mutant for potential Exd binding site. We found that a lower mobility complex was formed by AbdA in presence of Exd protein on wild type oligo (lane 41 vs 43, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) which was abolished in oligo mutant for Exd binding site (lane-50, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, Exd site is shown in blue). This suggested that AbdA-Exd complex most likely assembles on Hox2-Exd sites, more so considering the proximity of the two sites. Mutation of Exd site also abrogated tetracomplex (lane 44 vs 52, white arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), while Grh protein still bound to DNA (lanes 46, 51–52, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p>

<p>In case of oligo with Hox1 binding site mutation, we noticed a decrease in AbdA binding on DNA (lane 54 vs 61, red arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). We also found that Grh binding (lane 55 vs 59, green arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) was reduced but still present. This could be due to the fact that Hox1 mutation is in middle of the Grh binding sites and therefore affected Grh binding onto DNA. Moreover, we found that AbdA-Exd complex binding (lane 63, black arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) was intact but tetracomplex binding was dramatically diminished (lane 57 vs 65, white arrowhead). We believe this also could be due to effect of Hox1 mutation affecting nearby Grh1 binding site (as discussed above), and hence the tetracomplex formation.</p>
<p>Next, we tested oligo mutant for Hox2 binding site. We found that both AbdA binding (lane 68 vs 74, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) and AbdA-Exd binding (lane 70 vs 76, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) were abolished in this case. Though the Grh binding could still be detected (lane 73) the tetracomplex formation was completely abolished (lane 71 vs 77, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). Since we could not observe any AbdA-Grh complex, this suggests that AbdA-Grh complex uses Hox2-Grh1 binding site. In corroboration to this, we found that in Hox1+2 double mutant oligo, AbdA-Exd, (lane 122 vs 129, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s007">S7J Fig</xref>), AbdA-Grh (lane 124 vs 130, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s007">S7J Fig</xref>) and tetracomplex binding is completely abolished (lane 125 vs 132, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s007">S7J Fig</xref>). Also the effect on complex formation was much stronger in this case compared to individual mutants for Hox1 and Hox2 sites.</p>
<p>The above experiments suggest that AbdA-Exd complex is critical for the tetracomplex formation. AbdA-Exd along with Grh most likely assembles a tetracomplex on Hox2-Exd and Grh1 site on DNA. We believe that this tetracomplex could contribute to regulation of RHG genes through <italic>F3B3</italic> enhancer.</p>

<title>AbdA, Exd, Grh and Su(H) binding sites are critical for maintenance of apoptotic enhancer activity</title>
<p>In order to test the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of various motif tested for AbdA, Exd and Grh binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, enhancer mutagenesis was carried out. All the mutagenesis studies were carried on the 717 bp subfragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). Three kind of mutant constructs were made. In first construct, Grh binding sites in all 8 motifs (present in 717 bp) were mutagenized leaving Hox-Exd binding sites mostly intact (<italic>717-Grh</italic><sup><italic>mutant</italic></sup><italic>-lacZ</italic>).

A third construct was designed to test direct role of Notch signaling in abdominal pNB apoptosis. Since Notch intracellular domain goes into the nucleus and activates gene through its executive TF Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), we identified and mutagenized all recognizable Su(H) binding sites in 717 bp enhancer (<italic>717-Su(H)</italic><sup><italic>mutant</italic></sup><italic>-lacZ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). We could identify seven such binding sites which were variations of known consensus binding sequence for Su(H) (RTGRGAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref050">50</xref>]. All the transgenic lines were crossed into the background of <italic>UAS-p35</italic> and were subsequently checked for the expression of reporter lacZ in abdominal pNBs in late L3 stage. For comparison of lacZ levels <italic>tubulin-GAL80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>; inscGAL4</italic> was used to drive the expression of p35 to block the apoptosis of the pNBs. This helped us to visualize the sustained expression of lacZ in later stages, which serves as a hallmark for identification of abdominal apoptotic enhancer. Since the expression of <italic>717-lacZ</italic> was restricted only to Vl lineage in late L3 stage, we compared wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10B</xref>) and mutant versions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10C–10E</xref>) of the enhancer for their capacity to drive the expression of lacZ reporter in these cells. We found that reporter lacZ expression was completely missing in abdominal Vl pNBs of all the three mutant versions of the enhancer in late L3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10C–10E</xref>). Next, we decided to visualize the expression of the reporter in early L3 stage of development.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A large fraction of cell death in developing organism happens in CNS, which underlines its importance in CNS morphogenesis. The coupling of death in CNS with spatial developmental cues like Hox genes is a convenient strategy evolved by nature for patterning of neural tissues to coordinate developmental apoptosis with spatial regionalization of the organism. Therefore, it is of interest to understand the molecular details of this mechanism. We have investigated this in abdominal and Dfd-SEG region of larval CNS. We find that Hox mediated pNBs apoptosis happens through a battery of common players (Hox-Exd-Grh-Notch) perhaps using a similar mechanism, albeit through a different enhancer.</p>

<title>Enhancer regulating the transcription of RHG genes in pNBs</title>
<p>Previous report suggest that RHG genes (mainly <italic>grim</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic>) express and function in a combinatorial manner in dying pNBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref038">38</xref>]. Wherein <italic>rpr</italic> deletion alone shows no block of apoptosis, <italic>grim</italic> deletion alone shows a delay till late L3 stage, while double deletion completely block this cell death. This indicates that <italic>grim</italic> is the major player and <italic>rpr</italic> probably takes over in absence of <italic>grim</italic>. Since abdominal pNBs are destined to die, therefore, regulation of these genes is designed to ensure that once their expression is switched on, it should be maintained in these cells till they undergo apoptosis. It is also expected that their coordinated expression in a cells of a specific region may be regulated by a single shared enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref038">38</xref>]. Similarly, their expression in different regions of developing CNS may be controlled by multiple region-specific enhancers. Our data support these ideas in a limited context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g011">Fig 11A</xref>). We find that the larval abdominal pNB apoptosis is regulated by an enhancer lying within 1kb region (<italic>F3B3</italic>) of <italic>NBRR</italic>. This 1 Kb region is a subfragment of 5 Kb embryonic NB specific apoptotic enhancer (also known as <italic>enh-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>]) and is deleted in <italic>M22</italic> (14.5 kb deletion).

Thus, apoptosis of larval pNBs in abdominal and Dfd-SEG region are controlled through two distinct enhancers (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g011">Fig 11A</xref>).</p>

<title>AbdA, Exd, Grh binding on enhancer is important for maintenance of the expression of RHG genes</title>
<p>It is known that abdominal pNBs do not die in a synchronous manner. They start dying from early L3 stage and over a period of next 48 hrs different pNBs activate AbdA at different times and undergo apoptosis. We observed the same from our analysis of different <italic>enhancer-lacZ</italic> lines, wherein some cells show lacZ expression just prior to early L3 stage, while others express lacZ later on. We also observed that intensity of lacZ reporter in pNBs becomes stronger from early to late stages. This suggests that lacZ reporter expression in pNB can be categorized into two phases, initiation phase followed by maintenance phase of expression. In agreement to this, we find that different <italic>enhancer-lacZ</italic> lines (<italic>F3</italic>, <italic>F4</italic>, <italic>F3B</italic>, <italic>F3B3</italic>, and <italic>717-lacZ</italic>) show a sustained lacZ expression in the pNBs till late larval stages in a cell death blocked background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10B</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified 8 motifs with composite AbdA-Exd-Grh binding sites within 717bp enhancer. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding assay suggested that Hox-Exd and Grh form a tetracomplex on 3 out of 8 motifs analyzed by us (motif-27, 30 and 32). Of these 3 motifs we used motif-30 as a model to understand the complex assembly and found that all the three proteins (Hox, Exd and Grh) are critical for tetracomplex formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">9</xref>). In order to test the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the composite Grh-AbdA-Exd binding sites found within different motifs of apoptotic enhancer, we mutagenized these binding sites. We tested the capacity of the resulting mutagenized enhancer to drive lacZ in abdominal pNBs. We found that, in both <italic>717-Grh</italic><sup><italic>mutant</italic></sup><italic>-lacZ</italic> and <italic>717-HEG</italic><sup><italic>mutant</italic></sup><italic>-lacZ</italic>, enhancers were normal for the initiation of the lacZ expression in pNBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s010">S10B–S10D Fig</xref>), but interestingly the mutant enhancers were incapable of sustaining the expression of lacZ reporter in these cells till later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10</xref>). This implies that these motifs play an important role in maintenance rather than initiation of RHG gene expression. In our experiment we mutagenized AbdA, Exd and Grh binding sites in all 8 motifs found in 717bp enhancer (<italic>717-HEG</italic><sup><italic>mutant</italic></sup><italic>-lacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). Since our analysis cannot discriminate whether 3 tetracomplex forming motifs are more critical compared to rest of the 5, therefore the results does not imply that tetracomplex is central for the maintenance activity of the apoptotic enhancer. But considering the direct physical interaction of Grh with AbdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) and binding assays wherein majority of sites show Abd-Exd and AbdA-Grh complex formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), we believe that AbdA, Exd and Grh proteins together play a role in maintenance activity of the enhancer and a part of the same may be contributed by tetracomplexes assembled on the enhancer. Interaction of helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein (Grh in this study) and HD containing TFs (AbdA in this study) have been reported earlier. It has been shown that HLH and HD transcription factor (Meis/Prep and Pitx family) interact with each other to synergize the transcriptional response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref052">52</xref>]. However, Hox per se had not been shown to interact with HLH proteins so far.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we have focused on Grh binding sites with nearby AT rich sequences. Some of these sequences turned out to be Hox-Exd binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g008">Fig 8C–8E</xref>, motif-30 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), which did not fit conventional consensus sequence A/TGATNNATNN. Therefore, it will be of interest to find out which of the domains known to be important for AbdA-Exd interaction (like YPWM and UbdA motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref054">54</xref>]) play an important role for the complex formation on motif-30. Also, whether any of these domains will contribute to AbdA’s interaction with Grh as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref055">55</xref>]. Since our results suggest that above mentioned motifs are important for maintenance but not initiation of the enhancer activity, DNA motifs necessary for enhancer initiation are yet to be identified. We observed multiple standalone Hox binding sites in 717bp enhancer with no recognizable Grh and Exd binding sites in vicinity. These individual Hox binding sites were intact in all the three mutant versions of the enhancer tested by lacZ reporter assay. We believe that these standalone Hox sites could be the first ones to be occupied in response to increasing levels of AbdA in pNBs, and help in initiating the expression of RHG genes. Subsequently, AbdA-Exd could get recruited on the composite sites (Grh-AbdA-Exd sites) and helps to maintain the levels of RHG genes which eventually lead to death of pNBs. Since Grh is proposed to be responsible for installation of apoptotic competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>], it could also be possible that it occupies its binding sites prior to AbdA pulse coming on. The idea of standalone Hox binding sites being the first responders to increasing Hox protein expression fits well with the fact that less regulation may be required at the at initial stage of enhancer firing. Therefore it is possible that at this stage individual Hox sites on the enhancer may get bound by any Hox protein. This is supported by the fact that overexpression of Abdominal-A or Antennapedia (Antp) or Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in thoracic pNBs resulted in their apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>]. The occupation of composite site of Grh-Hox-Exd come next and are important for maintenance of gene expression and eventual cell death.</p>

<title>Hox-Grh code and pNB apoptosis in abdominal and Dfd-SEG</title>
<p>So far, role of Grh has been reported in cell proliferation and in installing the competence to undergo AbdA mediated apoptosis. In this study we show that Grh along with AbdA contributes to transcriptional regulation of RHG genes in causing larval pNB apoptosis. This is based on the observation that Grh and AbdA knockdown downregulated apoptotic <italic>enhancer-lacZ</italic> (1Kb <italic>F3B3-lacZ</italic> reporter line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Moreover, the enhancer mutagenized for Grh binding sites could not maintain its expression in late L3 stages in cell-death blocked background. This observation further supports a transcriptional role for Grh along with AbdA in RHG regulation in pNBs.</p>
<p>We also observe that pNBs in abdominal and Dfd-SEG express Grh but have a very low or no Hox expression (Grh<sup>+</sup>/Hox<sup>-</sup>), while their progeny show opposite expression code (Grh<sup>-</sup>/Hox<sup>+</sup>). It is observed in abdominal region (during L3 stages), that changing expression code of pNB from <bold>Hox</bold><sup><bold>-</bold></sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> to <bold>Hox</bold><sup><bold>+</bold></sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> (AbdA<sup>+</sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup>) results in its apoptosis. We believe that a similar theme for pNB apoptosis is being to be followed in Dfd-SEG as well, where pNBs are known to undergo Hox dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>]. We find that this apoptosis is also dependent on Grh and like in abdominal segments expression of Dfd in L2 stage may change <bold>Dfd</bold><sup><bold>-</bold></sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> state of pNBs to <bold>Dfd</bold><sup><bold>+</bold></sup>/Grh<sup>+</sup> state and cause their apoptosis. It is interesting to note that common TF code of pNBs within different region of VNCs (abdominal and Dfd-SEG) may help them to respond to similar signals (like Hox expression in pNBs) resulting in common outcome (apoptosis in this case).</p>
<p>We tried testing sufficiency of Hox and Grh in causing the apoptosis in different regions, by expressing Grh in Hox positive neurons. We did not see any increase in apoptosis in abdominal neurons or neuron in any other region (Dfd-SEG and thorax) of CNS. Similarly, in Dfd-SEG region overexpression of Dfd even from early embryonic stages could not cause the death of remaining 6 pNBs. This is different from the abdominal pNB which die precociously on AbdA expression or thoracic pNBs which die on expression of AbdA or Ubx or Antp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>]. This indicated that there are other molecular players in addition to Grh which are important for Hox mediated pNB apoptosis. These factors may not be same across different regions (abdominal and Dfd-SEG), but they are likely to function with Grh and contribute to apoptosis. Moreover within a set of pNBs, these factors may be expressed differentially, i.e. they may be expressed in 4 dying pNBs but not in rest of 6 pNBs within Dfd-SEG region. Hence identifying potential partners of Grh may be useful to understand how heterogeneity is generated within a population of pNBs.</p>

<title>Role of Notch signaling in pNB apoptosis</title>
<p>Notch mutant clones generated in A1 and A2 segments of VNC very consistently downregulated AbdA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). This supported the earlier claim that Notch signaling could regulate the expression of AbdA in pNBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>], but interestingly, no AbdA mediated pNB apoptosis is reported in these two segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>]. AbdA mediated pNB apoptosis is a hallmark of A3-A7 segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref035">35</xref>], where even though we recovered ectopic pNBs (both by Notch MARCM and by RNA interference) we could not observe significant and consistent downregulation of AbdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). The levels of Grh were unaffected in these pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref>). Simultaneous Notch knockdown and AbdA overexpression from early L1 stage (t-shift as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007043.s008">S8A Fig</xref>) blocked abdominal pNB cell death. This suggests that Notch signaling is epistatic to AbdA apoptosis happening in abdominal segments. On the other hand in thoracic segments, Notch knockdown failed to rescue AbdA induced death of some of the thoracic pNBs. Thus, we think that Notch signaling has a direct role in abdominal pNB apoptosis which seems specific for abdominal segments.</p>
<p>In case of <italic>717-Su(H)</italic><sup><italic>mutant</italic></sup><italic>-lacZ</italic>, we found that the initiation of the reporter lacZ was slightly delayed but more importantly the maintenance of the expression in late L3 stage was completely crippled. This led us to suggest that perhaps Notch signaling does have a direct role in apoptosis unlike what has been reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref025">25</xref>]. Whether Notch plays a role only in maintenance or both in initiation and maintenance of the enhancer is currently not clear.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that all recognizable Su(H) binding sites found in 717 bp enhancer are not close (in range of 20bp) to Grh-AbdA-Exd motifs. Therefore, how does Notch signaling play a role regulation of apoptotic enhancer remains to be investigated. One possibility is that Notch signaling is involved in initiation of the expression in collaboration with individual Hox binding sites, but this still doesn’t explain its role in enhancer maintenance.</p>
<p>Notch knockdown results in blocking of cell death of pNBs in Dfd-SEG, similar to abdominal pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). Considering this we think that Notch perhaps plays similar roles in apoptosis in both these regions. Since the enhancer required for the activation RHG genes in Dfd-SEG is different from abdominal enhancer, and is yet to be identified, therefore it is difficult to currently test this idea at the moment.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Exd play a Hth independent role in pNB apoptosis</title>
<p>We also tested role of known Hox cofactors Exd and Hth. Interestingly, we found that while Exd plays an important role in AbdA mediated apoptosis, Hth was not critical for this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Similarly in Dfd-SEG region knockdown of Exd but not Hth resulted in ectopic pNBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007043.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we are inclined to believe that while Exd is important for Hox mediated pNB apoptosis in both abdominal and Dfd-SEG region, Hth is not required in this process. Since Hth function as a nuclear transporter of Exd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref047">47</xref>], our results suggest a Hth independent mechanism to transport Exd into the nucleus in pNBs. We were unable to test this idea directly, since we could not detect Exd protein in abdominal pNBs with the available antibodies and hence localization of Exd in <italic>hth</italic> mutant could not be assessed.</p>

<title>Notch-Hox-Exd-Grh mediated pNB apoptosis is a common mechanism</title>
<p>Hox mediated apoptosis of pNB is a mechanism which is used in multiple regions of developing CNS in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007043.ref024">24</xref>]. We propose that Notch-Hox-Exd-Grh are a part of common machinery employed in pNBs, involved in activation of RHG genes in developing CNS. Understanding how Notch signaling coordinate this apoptosis with Hox-Exd-Grh (in abdominal and other regions), and characterization of the assembly of this multi-protein complex on DNA will be of interest in future. Grh is not expressed in post embryonic neurons, therefore whether these neurons employ overlapping players and same enhancer or have an independent mechanism for apoptosis needs further investigations.</p>

Deletion combination show many surviving NBs at this stage compared to wild type. Partial Z project has been shown as representative image. Dotted lines enclose abdominal region. (C) Plot showing number of NBs counted in Abd-A stained region of late L3 larval brains in wild type and various mutant combinations. “n” indicates number of mid L3 larval brains counted for each genotype. Average values are shown in bars. Error bars shown are standard deviation. (D) Genomic mapping of the <italic>M22</italic> deletion: A schematic representation of the <italic>NBRR</italic> is shown. The blue arrowhead marks the position where the MiMIC element is inserted with respect to 5’ end of <italic>NBRR</italic>. PCR was used to map the extent of genomic deletion as shown. Amplicons B and D (highlighted by red bars) are amplified in wild type CS but not M22/Df(3L)<italic>H99</italic> or MM3/ Df(3L)<italic>H99</italic> (deletes entire NBRR along with other regions and hence serves as negative control). On the other hand, amplicons A and C (highlighted by green bars) were amplified both in CS and M22/ Df (3L) <italic>H99</italic> but not in MM3/Df(3L)<italic>H99</italic> suggesting that these amplicons flank the M22 deletion. Based on mapping results, the <italic>M22</italic> deletion roughly spans from 3L: 18,348,306 to 18, 362,966 (release 6).</p>
<p>Amplicon A: 3L: 18,347,043..18,348,306 (1264 bp).</p>
<p>Amplicon B: 3L: 18,347,864..18,349,377 (1514 bp).</p>
<p>Amplicon C: 3L: 18,362,966..18,363,997 (1032 bp).</p>
<p>Amplicon D: 3L: 18,361,407..18,362,459 (1053 bp)</p>

<title>Analysis of Hox, Exd and Grh binding on motifs from 1kb <italic>F3B3</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) Grh binds to motif-23 (lane2) which also shows the formation of a Hox-Exd complex (lanes 10, 11) but no higher shift is observed upon the addition of Grh to this complex.(B) Grh does not bind to motif-24 (lanes 15, 16) but a strong Hox-Exd assembles on it (lanes 23, 24) even though Exd (lanes 17, 18) and Hox alone (lanes 19, 20) show no significant binding. (C) Both Grh (lane 30) and Hox-Exd (lanes 38, 39) assemble on motif-25 but no tetracomplex results upon the addition of all the three proteins (lanes 40, 41). (D) Motif-27 show both Grh binding (lane 43) and Hox-Exd complex formation (lanes 51, 52) and addition of all the three leads to the formation of a tetracomplex (lanes 53, 54.) (E) No tetracomplex formation is seen in case of motif-28 (lane 66, 67), though both Grh (lane 56) and Hox-Exd (lane 63, 64) bind to it. Addition of Hox to Grh results in the formation of a lower mobility complex (lane 60, 61). (F) Grh fails to bind to motif-29 oligo (lane 69) but Hox-Exd complex show a strong binding on the same (Lane 77, 78). Predictably, addition of Grh does not alter the complex formation (lanes 79, 80). (G) Both Grh (lane 82) and Hox (lane 84, 85) bind to motif-31 and a Hox-Exd complex is also detected (lane 90, 91) but the presence of all the three proteins is not sufficient for the tetracomplex to form (lanes 92, 93). (H) In case of motif-32, Hox alone shows negligible binding but along with Exd, a higher complex forms (lanes 103, 104). Exd alone also binds to this site (lane 96) and a tetracomplex assembles when all the three proteins are added (lanes 105,106). (I) Grh (lane 108), Exd (lane 109) and Hox (lane 110,111) are individually able to bind on motif-33 containing oligo. AbdA-Exd and AbdA-Grh complex can be seen (lanes 116, 117 and lanes 112-113, respectively) but tetracomplex does not form on this site (lanes 118, 119). (J) Mutating both Hox sites in motif-30 results in complete loss of Hox-Exd binding (lanes 128, compare with lane 122) as well as partial loss of Grh binding (Lane 127 vs 121). As a result, the tetracomplex is entirely disrupted (Lane 132, compare with lane 125). Proteins added to a specific lane are shown at the top of the lane. Rectangles indicate constant concentrations of 200ng for Hox (red), Exd (blue) and Grh (green) respectively. Increasing concentration of 100 and 200ng for a Hox and Grh in panel-B are indicated by right triangles of red (Hox) and green (Grh) colour. Red and green arrow heads indicate Hox-DNA and Grh-DNA complex respectively. Black arrowhead indicate Hox-Exd-DNA complex. White arrowhead indicates Hox-Exd-Grh-DNA tetra-complex. The sequence of oligo tested for all these motif are given below the gels, potential Grh binding site is highlighted in green and AT rich sequences are highlighted in red.</p>
