<abstract>
<p><italic>Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)</italic> encodes the transmembrane cellular receptor neuropilin-1, which is associated with cardiovascular and neuronal development and was within the peak SNP interval on chromosome 8 in our prior GWAS study on age-related hearing loss (ARHL) in mice. In this study, we generated and characterized an inner ear-specific <italic>Nrp1</italic> conditional knockout (CKO) mouse line because <italic>Nrp1</italic> constitutive knockouts are embryonic lethal. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization demonstrated weak <italic>Nrp1</italic> mRNA expression late in embryonic cochlear development, but increased expression in early postnatal stages when cochlear hair cell innervation patterns have been shown to mature. At postnatal day 5, <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO mice showed disorganized outer spiral bundles and enlarged microvessels of the stria vascularis (SV) but normal spiral ganglion cell (SGN) density and presynaptic ribbon body counts; however, we observed enlarged SV microvessels, reduced SGN density, and a reduction of presynaptic ribbons in the outer hair cell region of 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO mice. In addition, we demonstrated elevated hearing thresholds of the 2-month-old and 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO mice at frequencies ranging from 4 to 32kHz when compared to 2-month-old mice. These data suggest that conditional loss of <italic>Nrp1</italic> in the inner ear leads to progressive hearing loss in mice. We also demonstrated that mice with a truncated variant of <italic>Nrp1</italic> show cochlear axon guidance defects and that exogenous semaphorin-3A, a known neuropilin-1 receptor agonist, repels SGN axons <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data suggest that Neuropilin-1/Semaphorin-3A signaling may also serve a role in neuronal pathfinding in the developing cochlea. In summary, our results here support a model whereby Neuropilin-1/Semaphorin-3A signaling is critical for the functional and morphological integrity of the cochlea and that <italic>Nrp1</italic> may play a role in ARHL.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Neuropilin-1 is a member of the neuropilin family acting as an essential cell surface receptor involved in semaphorin-dependent axon guidance and VEGF-dependent angiogenesis and lies within our previously identified ARHL GWAS interval. In this study, we investigated the role of Neuropilin-1/Semaphorin-3A signaling in the functional and morphological integrity of the cochlea, specifically the innervation and vascularization patterns. Detailed analyses of the cochleae of 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO mice showed abnormalities in ribbon synapses, innervation of the hair cells, and microvessels of the stria vascularis. We show also that Neuropilin-1/Semaphorin-3A signaling plays an important role in cochlear innervation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), or presbycusis, is a progressive bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref001">1</xref>] characterized by four types of pathology: (1) sensory deficits resulting from loss of outer hair cells as seen in loss of high frequency auditory brainstem response, (2) neural deficits from auditory nerve degeneration resulting in poor speech recognition, (3) degeneration of the stria vascularis leading to flat audiometric losses across frequencies; and (4) cochlear conductive deficits associated with increased stiffness of the basilar membrane resulting in evenly sloping audiometric losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref002">2</xref>]. Familial studies of presbycusis have attributed approximately half of audiometric variances to hereditary factors; however, the highly variable age of onset, disease progression, and severity of ARHL demonstrate the current uncertain contribution of individual genetic factors to cochlear integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref003">3</xref>]. Our group has recently demonstrated that ARHL in humans is a polygenic trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref004">4</xref>]. Human genetic studies suggest associations between ARHL and several genes including GRHL2, ITGA8, IQGAP2, GRM7, PCDH15, PCDH20, APOE, EDN1, ESRRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref002">2</xref>]. Although very little is known about ARHL in humans, numerous studies have been published on ARHL in mice. A genetic component to ARHL in inbred mice has been described with approximately 18 Mendelian loci reported to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref008">8</xref>]. It has been our overriding hypothesis that true ARHL in mice, as in humans, is a polygenic trait with the composite phenotype resulting from genomic variation at multiple loci likely different from the Mendelian loci described thus far.</p>
<p>To define the genetic architecture of ARHL in mice, we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a meta-analysis strategy by combining data sets from five cohorts containing 937 samples in total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref009">9</xref>]. The results of the meta-analysis led us to an approximately 2 Mb interval containing <italic>Nrp1</italic>, a gene that is involved in cardiovascular and neuronal development and is closely related to <italic>Neuropilin-2</italic> (<italic>Nrp2</italic>), a gene involved in cochlear epithelial innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref010">10</xref>]. Neuropilin-1 is a transmembrane receptor type I protein that is known to bind both vascular endothelial growth factor beta (VEGFb) and semaphorin classes including subtypes 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. Semaphorin-3A is involved in axonal guidance via chemorepulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref011">11</xref>]. Semaphorin-3A -induced neuronal growth cone collapse has been shown to require neuropilin-1 in conjunction with Plexin-A co-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref012">12</xref>]. Previous cardiovascular studies have shown that altered endothelial cell migration, abnormal blood flow, and enlarged vessels are major defects caused by targeted inactivation of the <italic>Nrp1</italic> gene in mice. Additionally, homozygous <italic>Nrp1</italic> mutant mice are known to have a perinatal lethal phenotype due to impaired heart development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, using an inner ear-specific knock out, we investigated the role of <italic>Nrp1</italic> in the functional and morphological integrity of the cochlea in mice. The results of this study suggest <italic>Nrp1</italic> may be involved in ARHL.</p>

<p>We next performed immunostaining using P5 cochleae to determine the precise distribution of neuropilin-1 and semaphorin-3A in the postnatal cochlea. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g002">Fig 2</xref>, neuropilin-1 is visible in SGNs and the SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g002">Fig 2A, 2B, 2D and 2E</xref>), but not expressed after conditional deletion of <italic>Nrp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g002">Fig 2C and 2F</xref>). Semaphorin-3A protein was visible within the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>) and SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g002">Fig 2J and 2K</xref>), but not after the semaphorin-3A antibody was pre-adsorbed by the blocking peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g002">Fig 2I and 2L</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that <italic>Nrp1</italic> is expressed at minimal levels by SGNs and cells of the stria vascularis before birth while <italic>Nrp1</italic> levels become elevated in these locations after birth. <italic>Sema3a</italic> is expressed by cells within the cochlear epithelium and SGNs, which is complementary to the expression patterns of <italic>Nrp1</italic>. The simultaneous expression of both neuropilin-1 and semaphorin-3A shortly after birth suggested these factors may be involved in the process of SGN pruning and refinement, which occurs during this time in cochlear development.

<title>The number of OHC ribbon synapses and SGN density are reduced in 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO mutants</title>
<p>To investigate the function of neuropilin-1 in the cochlea, we generated an inner-ear specific conditional knockout mouse using <italic>Pax2</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> and loxp-driven <italic>Nrp1</italic> removal (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Methods</xref> for details). Using this line, we first wanted to determine whether <italic>Nrp1</italic> is required for the formation or maintenance of ribbon bodies, which represent glutamatergic synapses connecting hair cells and SGNs. To visualize and quantify ribbon bodies, cochlear whole mount preparations from WT, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice at P5 (n = 4 per group) and 4 months (n = 5 per group) were immunostained with antibodies that bind to ribeye, a splice variant of CtBP2. The tissue samples were stained with Hoechst33342 to confirm whether the ribbon bodies were located on either OHCs or IHCs. The time points described above were chosen so that we could track any possible changes in synaptic connectivity from just after birth to full maturity within the cochlea. CtBP2 counts of both IHCs and OHCs at P5 showed no differences between WT and <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g003">Fig 3</xref>). No significant changes in immunostaining of IHCs was observed between <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and WT at 4 months; however, at this time point, the synaptic ribbon density (CtBP2 counts) in the OHC region in 4-month-old mice was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.01) for <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mutants (1.9 puncta/cell) compared to the controls (1.4 puncta/cell). Given this reduction in ribbon synapses, we next wanted to determine whether <italic>Nrp1</italic> loss also conferred a loss of SGNs (possibly through apoptosis). Thus, we quantified SGN density at the apical, middle, and basal turns of the cochlea at P5 (n = 4 per group) and at 4-months (n = 5 per group) for WT, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As expected from our ribbon synapse counts, at P5 no significant changes in SGN density were observed among the different genotypes or regions of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). However, the SGN counts in 4-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) showed decreased density of the neuronal cell bodies in <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice compared to WT controls (apical turn p = 0.03, middle turn p = 0.03, and basal turn p = 0.002). Interestingly, the number of SGNs lost in the absence of <italic>Nrp1</italic> is unexpectedly high compared to the number of IHC ribbon synapses lost (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Discussion</xref>). Nevertheless, the loss of OHC synaptic ribbons and diminished SGN density in 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice, suggests that <italic>Nrp1</italic> may play a role in maintaining SGN integrity during postnatal stages.</p>

For each sample, we also performed anti-Myo6 and anti-Sox2 immunostaining to identify the hair cells and supporting cells, respectively.

Cochleae from <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> mice showed a normal distribution of hair cells and supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g007">Fig 7B, 7C, 7E and 7F</xref>) indicating the innervation defects here were not due to changes in organ of Corti formation. Using E18.5 samples from the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> mice, we next delineated the distribution of SGN afferents using Syt1 antibodies and cochlear efferents using Gap43 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref010">10</xref>]. Compared to the apex and middle regions of control cochleae, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> cochleae showed a significant increase in Syt+ fibers in the OHC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g007">Fig 7K and 7O</xref>), but no changes in the distribution of Gap43+ efferent fibers.

These unusual bundles often took torturous paths toward the organ of Corti and terminated in the hair cell region or just beyond.

<title>siRNA mediated knockdown of <italic>Nrp1</italic> decreases semaphorin-3A action</title>
<p>To further investigate the role of Neuropilin-1/Sema-3A in mediating SGN migration and refinement, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting <italic>Nrp1</italic> mRNA to reduce neuropilin-1 protein levels in SGNs in cell culture. A transient transfection with predesigned siRNA oligonucleotides decreased neuropilin-1 protein expression as measured by Western immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The SGN explant culture showed that semaphorin-3A, at a concentration of 250 ng/mL, mediated axonal repulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The neurite outgrowth experiment was continued using the concentration of <italic>Nrp1</italic> siRNA oligonucleotide (50nM) that produced the greatest knockdown (approximately 60% decrease from the control). <italic>Nrp1</italic> knockdown caused by siRNA transfection decreased neurite outgrowth and abolished the ability of Sema3a to decrease neurite outgrowth, suggesting that Sema3a repulses SGNs in an Nrp1-depended manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g008">Fig 8I</xref>). In contrast, the negative control scrambled siRNA neither decreased Nrp1 protein nor abolished Sema3a activity. These experiments further support a key role for Nrp1/Sema3a signaling in cochlear innervation.</p>

<title>Exogenous semaphorin-3A inhibits SGN outgrowth in cochlear explants</title>
<p>To investigate the interaction between semaphorin-3A and SGNs, we established whole cochlear cultures from E17.5 mice and placed them in media containing either control IgG-Fc or semaphorin-3A-Fc (20nM). To determine whether semaphorin-3A altered hair cell innervation, the tissue samples were labeled with TUJ1 and Myo6 antibodies and imaged by confocal microscopy. Compared to control samples that showed robust hair cell innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g008">Fig 8G</xref>), samples treated with semaphorin-3A-Fc showed significantly reduced innervation of the sensory epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g008">Fig 8H</xref>).

<p>Peak-to-peak analysis of wave I was calculated from the ABR data described above. Wave I is thought to indicate the summed activity of SGN contact with hair cells, so a normal DPOAE with a diminished wave I peak would suggest dysfunction of the SGNs, IHCs, or the synapses between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref019">19</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There exists a growing literature supporting the notion that ARHL may be associated with degenerative changes in the cochlear nerve and its synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref022">22</xref>]. Although this phenomenon and that of the classically defined neural presbycusis are now well studied histologically, little is known about the molecular basis for this pathology. Using a meta-analysis GWAS approach we have defined several candidate regions for ARHL in mice, one of which included <italic>Nrp1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Nrp1</italic> is a well-known factor in neuronal and cardiovascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref017">17</xref>]. Its homolog, <italic>Nrp2</italic> has been shown to be involved in inhibiting type I SGNs from the OHC region in the developing cochlea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref010">10</xref>]. While substantial data exists for the role of <italic>Nrp1</italic> in tumorigenesis and embryonic development, to date, the role of <italic>Nrp1</italic> in the postnatal development of the cochlear apparatus remains unclear. According to previously published cochlear nerve microarray data, <italic>Nrp1</italic> expression in the spiral ganglion shows a peak at E16.5 followed by a dip between E16 and P0, and a general trend of increased expression up to two weeks into postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref023">23</xref>]. These findings are consistent with our data as we found upregulated <italic>Nrp1</italic> postnatal expression in the organ of Corti and in the SGNs in the first postnatal week, a critical period for maturation of hair cell innervation which suggests a role for <italic>Nrp1</italic> in this process.</p>
<p>In the peripheral auditory system, the type I SGN afferent fibers undergo significant reorganization during embryonic development in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref010">10</xref>]. In this study, we have identified <italic>Nrp1</italic> to be a critical component of this reorganization process. Previously, mice lacking normal <italic>Nrp1</italic> function (<italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Sema-</italic></sup> mutants) showed pathfinding defects in vestibular ganglion neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref017">17</xref>], defasciculation of the intercostal nerves, and crossing bundles to neighboring nerves of the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Sema-</italic></sup> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref024">24</xref>]. Many previous studies have also demonstrated a role for semaphorin-3A in axonal chemorepulsion, including repulsion of sensory and cortical axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref025">25</xref>]. Our SGN explant and semi-intact cochlear cultures also demonstrated semaphorin-3A repels SGNs, which suggests semaphorin-3A can normally inhibit SGN outgrowth. Complementary to these findings, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> cochleae showed dramatically enhanced innervation by Syt-positive fibers during developmental stages, suggesting excessive innervation by SGNs possibly due to the absence of a repulsive signal. We do not yet know whether this was due to increased numbers of SGNs, increased complexity of individual SGNs, or ectopic innervation of the cochlea by a different population of neurons (e.g. vestibular neurons). During embryonic development, Type II SGNs pass by the IHCs and reach the OHC area then extend toward the base of the cochlea forming <italic>en passant</italic> contacts with 3 to 10 OHCs within the same row. These projections gather beneath the rows of OHCs to form 3 outer spiral bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref015">15</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Nrp1</italic> conditional mutants show disorganized outer spiral bundles at early neonatal stages (P5) and that these pathfinding defects are apparent in the older (4-month-old) mice. In addition, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> cochleae showed excessive numbers of SGNs present in the OHC region in late embryonic stages.</p>
<p>There were several pieces of evidence shown here that implicate <italic>Nrp1</italic> in age-related hearing loss. First, we found that SGN density was lost in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> cochleae over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Since most of these neurons are likely type I SGNs, this potentially explains why the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed elevated ABR thresholds and wave 1 amplitude reductions. Larger ABR wave I amplitude shifts at equal sound pressure levels are associated with greater auditory nerve threshold elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref026">26</xref>]. Second, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> cochleae showed conspicuous defects in the stria vascularis, which normally maintains the ionic composition of the endolymph and promotes normal auditory transmission. Although we did not detect any significant changes to otoacoustic emissions in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (suggesting normal OHC function), it is possible that these mice have defects in IHC function that also, like the loss of SGNs, contributes to their altered hearing thresholds. The <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice did show reduced numbers of OHC ribbon synapses, but type II SGNs do not contribute to the canonical auditory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref027">27</xref>], so it is unlikely that this phenotypic defect contributes to the changes in hearing thresholds.</p>
<p>One curious finding here was that the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed a profound loss of SGNs and only a mild loss of IHC ribbon synapses. Although overall the differences between controls were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007048.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), we did observe an almost 50% decrease in IHC ribbon synapses in 3 out of 5 of the 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> mutants examined. Since the majority of SGNs are type I and terminate on IHCs, it would be expected that there would be a commensurate reduction in IHC ribbon bodies. One obvious cause for this discrepancy is that many of the CtBP2-positive bodies in IHCs from the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> cochleae may represent orphaned synapses that lack a postsynaptic terminal. A second less likely possibility is that some remaining type I SGNs extend collateral processes that form synapses with the IHCs.</p>
<p>Overall, these data suggest that reduced SGN density in 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> mutants, in addition to abnormal axonal pathfinding, lead to impairment of the OHCs synaptic integrity. Consistent with the abnormal neuronal phenotype in 4-month-old <italic>Nrp1</italic> deficient mice, we also observed a decline in ABR wave I amplitudes as they matured.</p>
<p><italic>Nrp2</italic>, the other member of the neuropilin family, is responsible for encoding a transmembrane receptor protein with sequence homology to <italic>Nrp1</italic> but with different ligand binding affinities. Neuropilin-2 receptors bind Sema-3 subtypes 3C and 3F, VEGF-A and VEGF-C isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref028">28</xref>]. While <italic>Nrp2</italic> plays a role in neuronal pathfinding, it has not been linked to neuron survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref010">10</xref>]. We have shown, however, that <italic>Nrp1</italic> likely plays a role in long-term neuronal survival and maintenance throughout life as SGN cell counts diminish with age in <italic>Nrp1</italic> CKO mice. These results were consistent with previously published data showing that <italic>Nrp1</italic> is an essential factor in survival of the GnRH and trigeminal neurons by interacting with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>While our results support a model in which <italic>Nrp1</italic> signaling is necessary for the establishment of SGN projections in the postnatal period, <italic>Nrp1</italic> also appeared to play an essential role in normal vascular development of the cochlea. Our results show that <italic>Nrp1</italic> deletion leads to enlarged vessels in the stria vascularis of early postnatal and adult mice, which may have an impact on the maintenance of the endocochlear potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref031">31</xref>].</p>

<title>Real-time PCR</title>
<p>Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice (n = 8) and DBA/2J mice (n = 7) were euthanized, and bilateral inner ears were harvested. Cochlear tissues were collected, and left and right ear samples were combined and immediately processed with RNAqueous Total RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was then converted to cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Life Technologies). PCR was performed using the primer pairs acquired from applied biosystems: assay ID: Mm00435379_m1. Each sample was run in triplicate along with the housekeeping gene, <italic>GAPDH</italic>. Relative quantities of the transcripts were determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method using <italic>GAPDH</italic> as a reference.</p>

<title>Immunostaining of the cochlea</title>
<p>Cochlear whole mount sample preparation: Mouse cochleae were dissected after the second hearing measurement and were fixed with 4% PFA overnight. Fixed samples were decalcified using 10% EDTA, and dissected using the mouse cochlear dissection method from Eaton Peabody Laboratories at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Institute website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/otolaryngology/investigators/laboratories/eaton-peabody-laboratories" xlink:type="simple">http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/otolaryngology/investigators/laboratories/eaton-peabody-laboratories</ext-link>). For the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-</italic></sup> mice samples, embryonic cochleae were fixed for 30 minutes in 4% PFA and then rinsed extensively in 1X PBS before dissection and immunostaining.</p>
<p>Cochlear frozen section sample preparation: Fixed heads were sequentially dehydrated in 15% and 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek) and snap frozen on dry ice. Blocks were sectioned (12 μm thickness) on a Leica 3050 S cryostat in a cranial-to-caudal coronal direction.</p>
<p>SGN explant three-dimensional culture: Sensory epithelia of cochleae with attached SGNs were dissected from the E16.5 embryos and placed in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Invitrogen). The isolated SGNs were cut into four equal pieces starting from one turn away from the apex of cochlea. Each SGN explant was transferred in a drop of phenol red-free Matrigel (Corning) and placed on poly-D-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. After complete solidification of the Matrigel, DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% N2 supplement, and 0.3 mg/ml ampicillin were added and maintained in the culture for 3 days. After fixation, dissected cochleae or tissue sections were permeabilized with 0.2% TrionX-100 followed by incubation in 10% blocking serum for 2 hours at room temperature. The samples were incubated with the primary antibody at 4°C for 24 to 48 hours and exposed to secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. Using a Carl Zeiss LSM 780 laser scanning microscope (AxioObserver.Z1), 3 representative images were taken for each slide, and the total, average, and maximal neurite lengths per SGN explant were measured using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007048.ref034">34</xref>]. Antibodies used in this study were as follows: Alexa 488-conjugated mouse anti-neuron specific class III beta tubulin (anti-TUJ1) (1:300; Covance), rabbit anti-Neuropilin-1 (1:50;Abcam), rabbit anti-Semaphorin-3A (1:100; Abcam), mouse anti-CtBP2 (1:200; BD Biosciences), mouse-anti-TUJ1 (1:1,000, Covance), rabbit-anti-myosin VI (1:1,000, Proteus Biosciences), goat-anti-Sox2 (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), chicken-anti-synaptotagmin-1 (1:1,000, Aves Labs), mouse-anti-GAP43 (1:2,000, Chemicon), Alexa Fluor-488 anti-mouse (1:500; Life technologies), Alexa Fluor 594 anti-goat (1:500; ThermoFisher). Fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 (0.1 μg/mL; Southern Biotech) was used for DNA labeling. Blocking peptide for Anti-Semaphorin-3A antibody (Abcam) was used for Sema-3A immunostaining (negative controls). For synaptic ribbon-to-hair cell ratios, tissue sections at the basal turn of the cochlea were selected, and the number of synaptic ribbons was compared separately to the number of inner hair cells and to the number of outer hair cells per section. The synaptic ribbon-to-hair cell ratios for WT and <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> 4-month-old mouse cochleae (n = 5 per group) and P5 mouse cochleae (n = 4 per group) were assessed. Spiral ganglion cells of the P5 and 4-month-old mice were counted at apical, mid, and basal turns of the cochlea (n = 5 per group at each turn). To quantify numbers of Syt1+ fibers in the OHC region of <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> cochleae and their littermate controls, we determined the number of fiber tracks extending into the OHC region and normalized that value to the longitudinal distance of the cochlea within that region. Sample sizes: 9 WT cochleae and 13 <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>sema-/sema-</italic></sup> cochleae.</p>

<title><italic>Nrp1</italic> siRNA knockdown, Western immunoblotting</title>
<p>SGN explants in antibiotic-free medium were transfected with 50 nM predesigned <italic>Nrp1</italic> siRNA oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Some explants were treated with 250 ng/ml Sema-3A-Fc (R&amp;D Systems). We used a scrambled siRNA oligonucleotide that did not exhibit homology to any known encoding region as a negative control. The siRNA-mediated knockdown efficiency was determined by Western immunoblotting. After <italic>Nrp1</italic> siRNA transfection and semaphorin-3A treatments, the Matrigels covering SGN explants were removed with cell recovery solution (Corning) and the explants were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Explant extracts were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk and then incubated with rabbit-anti-Neuropilin-1 (1: 1000 dilution; Abcam) overnight, followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (Thermo Scientific). The bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning using the Omega 12 IC Molecular Imaging System and the Ultra Quant software. β-Actin loading control was carried out.</p>

<title>Cochlear explant experiments and quantification procedures</title>
<p>E17.5 cochleae were dissected in chilled HBBS/HEPES, and the cochlear capsule and stria vascularis were removed. The tissue samples were placed on polycarbonate filters and incubated at 37°C. The culture medium: DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% N2 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), and 0.0001 ciprofloxacin (Sigma). Either purified Sema-3A-Fc (R&amp;D Systems) or human IgG-Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch) was added to the medium for a final concentration of 20nM. After 20hr of incubation, the cochleae were removed from the filters, fixed for 15 min in cold 4% PFA, then processed for immunostaining (anti-TUJ1 and anti-Myo6) and confocal imaging. To image the tissue samples, confocal z-stacks were acquired starting at the “top” of the hair cells (lumen of the cochlear duct) through the “bottom” of the supporting cells (past the basement membrane). To quantify how Sema-3A-Fc altered cochlear innervation, maximum-intensity z-projects were generated only from the z-planes that included the hair cells. Using ImageJ, a region of interest (ROI) around the inner and outer hair cells was selected from each sample and the area occupied by TUJ1-positive neurons was normalized to the area of the ROI. For each sample, equivalent thresholding was used.</p>

<title>Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs)</title>
<p>ABR and DPOAE testing was performed for <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> (n = 8), <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> (n = 8), and WT mice (n = 11) at 2 and 4 months of age. DPOAE testing was performed for <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>;Pax2</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> and WT mice at 4 months of age. Stainless-steel electrodes were placed subcutaneously at the vertex of the head and the right mastoid with a ground electrode at the base of the tail. Auditory signals were presented as tone pips with a rise and fall time of 0.5 msec and a total duration of 5 msec at the frequencies 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 kHz. Tone pips were delivered below threshold and then increased in 5 dB increments until the goal of 100 dB was reached. Signals were presented at a rate of 30/second. Responses were filtered with a 0.3 to 3 kHz pass-band (x10000 times). For each stimulus intensity, 512 waveforms were averaged. Hearing threshold was determined by inspection of ABR waveforms and was defined as the greatest intensity at which no reliable ABR waveforms were generated. Data were stored for offline analysis of peak-to-peak (P1-N1) values for wave 1 amplitudes. ABR thresholds were determined by an independent observer who was blinded to the genotypes of the mice. Peak-to-peak (P1-N1) values for wave 1 amplitudes were calculated using the ABR Peak Analysis software (Bradley Buran, Eaton-Peabody Laboratory). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were recorded with a custom-designed transducer and data-acquisition system based on a National Instruments PXI hardware configuration developed at the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The 2f1-f2 DPOAE was measured with an f2/f1 ratio of 1.22 for f2 = 8, 11, 16, 22 and 32 kHz at primary tone levels (L2) presented from 20 to 70 dB SPL in 10 dB steps to form an input/output function. DPOAE threshold was determined from the input/output function as the extrapolated primary tone level (L2) required to produce a DPOAE of 0 dB SPL. DPOAEs with at least 3 dB signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio were included in all analyses; however, when the SNR was &lt; 3 dB, the DPOAE was assigned the level of the noise floor and included. This was done to avoid excluding the very lowest level DPOAEs, which carry information by virtue of their reduced amplitude. DP-grams (DPOAE amplitude across frequency, 8–32 kHz) were also constructed at L2 = 70 dB SPL for all mice; only points &gt; 3 dB SNR were included in this analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis for ABR, and wave I amplitude were performed using analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and post hoc comparisons with Fisher’s LSD test. For neurite outgrowth analysis, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Dunn's Test were used. Synaptic ribbon count, and spiral ganglion neuron counts were performed using the student’s t-test. GraphPad Prism 7 software was used to perform the tests. Continuous variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). A 2-tailed p value less than 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results of this study support a potential role for <italic>Nrp1</italic> expression variation to be associated with ARHL in mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest <italic>Nrp1</italic> plays a role in the postnatal development and maintenance of the cochlear neuronal network. Our findings also support the role of <italic>Nrp1</italic> in normal development of the stria vascularis microvasculature. Taken together, these data suggest that both neuronal and vascular abnormalities of <italic>Nrp1</italic> deficient mice contribute to abnormal hearing in 4-month-old mice. To further understand the impact of Neuropilin-1/Sema-3A on ARHL, future studies will likely include investigation of tissue-specific knock outs of <italic>Sema3a</italic> and <italic>VEGF-B</italic> in the inner ear, neuronal cell type-specific immunostaining of these selected animal models, and assessment of cochlear hemodynamics and electrophysiology of the <italic>Nrp1</italic> deficient mice.</p>
