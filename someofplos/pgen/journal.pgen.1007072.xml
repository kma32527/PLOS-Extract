<abstract>
<p>We identified a non-synonymous mutation in <italic>Oas2</italic> (I405N), a sensor of viral double-stranded RNA, from an ENU-mutagenesis screen designed to discover new genes involved in mammary development. The mutation caused <italic>post-partum</italic> failure of lactation in healthy mice with otherwise normally developed mammary glands, characterized by greatly reduced milk protein synthesis coupled with epithelial cell death, inhibition of proliferation and a robust interferon response. Expression of mutant but not wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> in cultured HC-11 or T47D mammary cells recapitulated the phenotypic and transcriptional effects observed in the mouse. The mutation activates the OAS2 pathway, demonstrated by a 34-fold increase in RNase L activity, and its effects were dependent on expression of RNase L and IRF7, proximal and distal pathway members. This is the first report of a viral recognition pathway regulating lactation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Using ENU-mutagenesis in mice we discovered a pedigree with lactation failure. Mammary development through puberty and pregnancy appeared normal in mutant animals, but the activation of lactation failed in the immediate post partum period and no milk reached the pups. Failure of lactation was accompanied by greatly diminished milk protein synthesis, decreased epithelial cell proliferation, increased epithelial cell death and a robust interferon response. A non-synonymous mutation in <italic>Oas2</italic> (I405N) in the viral sensor Oas2 was found and expression of mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> in mammary cells recapitulated these phenotypes. RNase L, the most proximal effector of OAS2 action, was activated in the mammary glands of mutant mice and in mammary cells expressing mutant Oas2. Knockdown of RNase L, or the distal pathway member IRF7, prevented these effects, indicating that the mutation in OAS2 caused activation of the viral signaling pathway. These results show that viral detection in the mammary gland can prevent lactation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzymes are activated by detection of double stranded RNA produced during the viral life cycle, and in response polymerize ATP into 2´-5´ linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) of various lengths. The 2-5As then bind and activate latent RNase L, which degrades viral and host single stranded RNAs, so disrupting the viral life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref001">1</xref>]. It has been reported that OAS1 has antiviral activity independently of RNAse L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref002">2</xref>], that OAS2 binds to NOD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref003">3</xref>], and that OASL binds RIG-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref004">4</xref>], pointing to additional mechanisms of action. Although mechanistic detail is lacking, it is proposed that OAS enzymes can activate anti viral responses via mechanisms independently of 2-5A production, by direct interactions within the viral signaling complex. For example, this complex is tethered to the mitochondrial outer membrane by the scaffold protein MAVS, and contains RIG-I, related helicase MDA5, and possibly OAS family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref005">5</xref>]. OAS family members may also mediate apoptosis outside the context of viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref007">7</xref>]. Here we report a mutation of OAS2 that produces lactation failure in an otherwise normal mouse. This is the first demonstration that a viral recognition pathway can regulate lactation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis and a screen for failed lactation we established a mouse line in which heterozygous (wt/mt) dams showed partial penetrance of poor lactation, producing litters that failed to thrive, while homozygous (mt/mt) dams experienced complete failure of lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), providing a dominant pattern of inheritance. Development of the mammary ductal network during puberty, and of the lobulo-alveolar units during pregnancy, was normal in mt/mt dams (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The onset of milk protein synthesis also showed no defects during pregnancy by immunohistochemistry or western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s001">S1C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Lactation failure in mt/mt mice at 2 days <italic>post-partum</italic> (2dpp) was seen as failure of alveolar expansion and retention of lipid droplets and colostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1B–1G</xref>). Western blotting for milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>) showed greatly reduced expression of all the major milk components at 2dpp relative to the level of the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin 18. Quantitative PCR for the mRNAs for the milk proteins whey acidic protein (WAP) and β-casein (β-Cas) showed reduced levels in mt/mt dams (mt) compared to wt/wt dams (wt) at 18 days <italic>post-coitus</italic> (dpc) and especially at 2dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1I and 1J</xref>). The number of cleaved Caspase-3 positive epithelial cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1K</xref>) and BrdU incorporation by the epithelium was reduced, indicating increased cell death rate and decreased cell proliferation respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1L</xref>).</p>

<p>We used immunohistochemistry to examine STAT1 activation as it is an interferon regulated gene involved in mammary gland involution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref008">8</xref>]. In wt/wt dams at d18.5 of pregnancy and 2 days post partum, we observed scattered regions of phosphorylated Stat1 staining in tightly packed areas of small and unexpanded alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1M</xref>). These regions were very rare at the other stages of development examined. In mt/mt animals Stat1 phosphorylation was again seen within regions of small unexpanded and tightly packed alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1N</xref>), but at day 18.5 of pregnancy, these regions of STAT1 phosphorylation occurred at a far greater frequency than in wt/wt glands, and instead of receding in the post partum period like wt/wt glands, the frequency of this pattern of staining increased further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1O</xref>). We examined Stat1 phosphorylation in mammary glands formed by transplant of epithelium from mt/mt or wt/wt animals into the mammary fat pads of prepubescent wild type mice cleared of endogenous epithelium. We again observed a statistically significant increase in Stat1 phosphorylation in mt/mt transplants in the pre-partum period (transplants can’t interrogate the post partum period), demonstrating that the ENU-mutation operates autonomously via the mammary epithelial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1P</xref>).</p>
<p>We used the Affymetrix Mouse Transcriptome Assay (MTA) 1.0 GeneChip to measure changes in gene expression underlying these events. We profiled RNA transcripts in the mammary glands at 18dpc and 2dpp from wt/wt and mt/mt mice. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of genes was carried out using the Limma t-statistic as a measure of ranked differential expression and visualized with the Enrichment Map plugin for Cytoscape. We compared gene expression changes between mt/mt and wt/wt mice at 18dpc or 2dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g002">Fig 2</xref>, shown in detail <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This identified a robust enrichment of a prominent cluster of gene sets involved in the interferon response in postpartum mt/mt but not wt/wt mammary glands, which increased in magnitude between 18dpc and 2dpp. Genes in these sets included the interferon-induced genes <italic>Isg15</italic>, <italic>Mx1</italic>, <italic>Rsad2</italic>, <italic>Oas1</italic>, <italic>Oas2 and OasL1</italic>. Interferon-induced genes involved in the molecular pattern response pathway were also induced, such as <italic>Ddx58</italic> (RIG-1), <italic>Dhx58</italic> (RIG-1 regulator), <italic>Mavs</italic> and <italic>Nlrc5</italic> (NOD5). Additional downstream transcriptional regulators of the interferon response, such as <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Irf7</italic> and <italic>Irf9</italic>, were upregulated. In mt/mt glands this was accompanied by increased expression of a broad range of mitochondria-associated cell death genes such as <italic>Tnsfs10</italic> (TRAIL), <italic>Acin1</italic>, <italic>Birc2</italic>, <italic>Traf2</italic>, <italic>Bcl2l1</italic> (BCL-XL), <italic>Bcl2l11</italic> (BIM), <italic>Apaf1</italic>, <italic>Dffb</italic>, <italic>Xaf and Ripk1</italic>. Very similar results were obtained using an independent analysis technique based on self-organizing maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These results are also presented as a.txt table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s010">S1 Table</xref>) of the 5000 probes showing most-changed expression. This transcriptional data indicates that a robust interferon response is induced by the mutation.</p>

<title>Effects of OAS2 mutation on global patterns of gene expression in the mammary gland.</title>
<p>Whole mouse mammary glands from homozygous <italic>Oas2</italic> mutant (mt) or wild type (wt) animals were profiled using Affymetrix MTA arrays. Differential gene expression was ranked by the limma t-statistic and this was used as the input for gene set enrichment analysis to identify functional signatures. The enrichment-map plug in for Cytoscape was used to visualize the results. Each node represents a gene set and the expression of genes comprising the leading edge of some of these sets is shown as heat maps of the t-statistic. Labels indicate the function of the clustered gene sets. Gene expression in mt animals is compared with wt animals at 2dpp (node center color) or 18dpc (node edge color). Red indicates enrichment of expression the gene set and blue suppression of expression.</p>

<p>PCR genotyping of polymorphic markers and their co-inheritance with lactation failure narrowed the mutation to a 4Mb region of chromosome 5 between rs3662655 and rs2020515. We expected 4–8 ENU mutations per 4Mb and our strategy was to sequentially sequence exomes and then to experimentally validate when an exonic mutation was discovered. Sequencing revealed a T to A base change in <italic>Oas2</italic>, resulting in a non-conservative isoleucine to asparagine amino acid substitution (I405N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) in a conserved region of the OAS2 catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>).

<p>We measured RNase L activity in the mammary glands of wt/wt and mt/mt mice at 18 days post coitus (dpc) and 2 days post partum (dpp) using a recently developed technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref009">9</xref>]. In wt/wt mice we observed a fall in RNase L activity from pre lactation at 18 dpp to lactation at 2 dpp despite the rise in OAS2 over this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g003">Fig 3B</xref> top panel). In contrast mt/mt animals showed an increase in RNase L activity over this period, so that at 2 dpp, RNase L activity was 34 fold higher in mt/mt animals. PCR for RNase L-cleaved rRNA showed a six-fold increase RNase L activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g003">Fig 3B</xref> lower panel), while non-RNase L generated cleavage was negligible. Bioanalyzer profiles of RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s005">S5C Fig</xref>) showed increased RNA degradation in mt/mt animals, but not to the extent that appreciable loss of the 18S or 28S ribosomes was seen, and which may be a result of both RNase L dependent and independent mechanisms. Although robust activation of RNase L can cause the loss of the 18S and 28S ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref010">10</xref>], recent findings show that ribosomal degradation is not required for RNase L to stop protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref009">9</xref>]. To determine if the mutation altered OAS2 enzyme activity we purified the mutant and wild type forms of mouse OAS2 expressed in HeLa cells by FLAG-immunoprecipitation. Using a cell-free system we observed that both mutant and wild type forms of OAS2 showed induction of enzyme activity by the double-stranded RNA mimic poly (I:C), seen as the formation of a series of 2-5A species resolved by denaturing PAGE. Both mutant and wild type forms of OAS2 showed similar sensitivity to increasing poly (I:C) concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Western blotting showed that the immunoprecipitates used in these experiments had similar OAS2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). These experiments show that the ENU-induced mutation in OAS2 does not change the size range of oligoadenylates that it produces, its capacity for 2-5A synthesis, or its sensitivity to activation by poly (I:C). This assay uses a cell free system, so we cannot exclude a mechanism where mutant OAS2 activates RNase L activity via an indirect effect to increase the active 2-5A pool without altering its rate of synthesis, such as reduced 2-5A depletion or loss of 2-5A sequestration. Another possibility is that mutant OAS2 has an altered molecular interaction with a species that increases its enzymatic activity, but which is lost in the immunoprecipitation of OAS2 in this assay. Regardless, the mutation in <italic>Oas2</italic> activates RNase L in mice and tissue culture models.</p>
<p>We constructed a model of doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of mutant or wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> in T47D human breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). These models produced a 20-fold induction of <italic>Oas2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Western analysis showed the appearance of mouse OAS2 protein following Dox administration just below endogenous human OAS2, both above a non-specific band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Thus although PCR showed a small amount of leakiness in this system it seems negligible by western blot. Cells expressing either mutant or wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> showed a similar sensitivity to poly (I:C) that was not changed significantly by induction with Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Induction of mutant, but not wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> for 72 h reduced cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Increased cell detachment was observed, but the magnitude of this effect was highly variable between experiments using mutant cells and so did not reach statistical significance at p&lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Reduced re-plating efficiency however following trypsinization was significant, indicting that cell surface re-expression of adhesion molecules following their trypsin digestion was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Western analysis of two of these molecules, Beta-1 Integrin (ß1) and E-Cadherin (EC), showed reduced expression in response to Dox-induction of mutant <italic>Oas2</italic>, especially for Beta-1 Integrin, shown in the far right hand side lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). We used flow cytometry to simultaneously measure cell viability by propidium iodide exclusion and cell death by cell surface expression of Annexin V, in response to <italic>Oas2</italic> expression. While induction of wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> expression produced no apoptotic response, induction of mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> produced a doubling in the number early apoptotic cells within the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). Induction of wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> did not alter the distribution of cells among the phases of the cell cycle, while induction of the mutant produced a shift of cells out of S-phase and into G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Thus the effects of mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> expression in T47D cells reproduce the phenotypes of cell death and reduced cell proliferation seen in the mouse, and indicate that epithelial cell adhesion may also be affected.</p>

<p>Mouse HC-11 cells express milk proteins in response to withdrawal of EGF and the addition of prolactin and dexamethasone, providing a way to examine the effects of mutant and wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> expression on milk protein expression. The inducible vector system used successfully in T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) proved to be very leaky in HC-11 cells, resulting in high baseline expression of <italic>Oas2</italic> in the pooled clones without DOX treatment. Cloning, in an attempt to find cells without leaky expression, was unsuccessful, but resulted in cell lines with similar levels of constitutive expression of mutant or wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> that was many fold greater than seen in untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4K</xref>). Treatment with prolactin and dexamethasone induced beta casein levels in the cell line expressing wild type <italic>Oas2</italic>, and this effect was comparable in magnitude to that seen in parental HC-11 cells, but in the two lines expressing mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> the induction of beta casein was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4L</xref>), reproducing the suppression of milk protein synthesis seen in the ENU-mutant mouse. Transient expression of wild type and mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> in HC11 cells also showed an increase in the basal rate of cell death, reproducing the cell death phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g004">Fig 4M</xref>).</p>
<p>We used Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Assay 2.0 GeneChips to profile the changes in gene expression that occurred in T47D cells when either wild type or mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> was induced for 72h, presented as GSEA/Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), self organizing maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) and as table containing the top 500 differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s011">S2 Table</xref>). We compared the transcriptional effects of mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> in T47D cells to the effects in the ENU mouse shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g002">Fig 2</xref> using Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), or self-organizing maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). The transcriptional effects of mutant OAS2 in T47D cells were very similar to those observed in the ENU-mutant mouse, with the interferon response most prominent. This demonstrates that expression of mutant but not wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> in T47D cells reproduces the molecular phenotypes observed in the ENU mutant mice. While the phenotype in mice is likely to involve additional cells of the immune system, these effects in T47D cells show that the transcriptional phenotype can be elicited via the innate immune response of the mammary epithelial cell, in agreement with the findings made using transplanted ENU-mutant mammary epithelium into wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1P</xref>).</p>
<p>OAS2 activates RNaseL. In T47D cells we used siRNA against human <italic>RNASEL</italic> to knockdown its expression in the context of Dox-induction of mutant or wild type mouse <italic>Oas2</italic>. In these experiments the induction of <italic>Oas2</italic> in response to Dox was robust and knockdown of <italic>RNASEL</italic> was very effective, as demonstrated by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) and by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Induction of wild type <italic>Oas2</italic> had no effect on RNase L activity, cell death or cytokine levels and knockdown of RNASEL was without consequence to these endpoints. In contrast, induction of mutant <italic>Oas2</italic> produced a large increase in RNase L activity, cell death, and interferon gamma and GM-CSF protein secretion, changes that were prevented by knockdown of RNASEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5D–5G</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression of the IRF transcription factors, especially IRF7, was increased by mutant OAS2. We knocked down IRF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5H</xref>) and found a similar prevention of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5I</xref>), indicating that the signaling pathway activated by mutant OAS2 also involves IRF7, a distal member of the viral-detection signaling pathway. Knockdown of IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5J</xref>), which often acts together with IRF7, had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g005">Fig 5K</xref>), suggesting IRF3 acts to oppose signaling via the OAS2 pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These experiments show that the <italic>Oas2</italic> mutation caused activation of OAS2 driven signaling to prevent the activation of lactation in the post partum period. The effect of the mutation could be detected via Stat1 activation from mid pregnancy and was most apparent in the post partum period, and was only required in the mammary epithelial cell for effect. The mutation increased RNase L activity but the enzymatic activity of mutant OAS2 was unaltered. Thus RNase L activation must occur via mechanisms that increase the effect of 2-5A without a change in its production, such as by reducing 2-5A degradation, increasing the efficiency of 2-5A interaction with RNase L or OAS2 interaction with dsRNA, or by causing relief of a mechanism that sequesters 2-5A. The activation of RNAse L is not sufficient to degrade the ribosomes, indicating that the loss of milk production does not occur via a generalized loss of translation. Thus while RNase L expression is required for activity of the mutation, the mutation may act via regulatory mechanisms that do not require 2-5A activation of RNase L. RNase L may be simply permissive of an alternative mechanism of action, such as altering interactions of OAS2 with its cellular binding partners, by changing its subcellular localization, or by decreasing the rate of OAS2 degradation. Thus it is possible that RNase L and OAS2 could also both be involved in as yet undiscovered molecular complexes that initiate activation of this pathway. For example OAS2 has been reported to bind NOD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref003">3</xref>], and the composition and mechanism of action of this mitochondrial-signaling complex is currently the subject of intense worldwide study, but its definition is proving to be elusive. The non catalytic OAS1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref011">11</xref>] and OASL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref012">12</xref>] have mechanisms independent of 2-5A production involving molecular interactions. This is the first genetic demonstration that OAS2 can signal in ways other than by alterations in enzyme activity. This mutation may prove to be important for the discovery of the mechanisms signaling the detection of viral infection, which remain largely unknown, because it provides a single point of pathway activation, unlike the existing reagents used for this purpose. Like other family members, OAS2 may regulate apoptosis independently of its function to control viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Lactation failure and milk stasis characterize mastitis, raising an interesting new avenue of investigation opened by our findings. The major consequence of mastitis is reduced weight-gain of the infant, precipitating a switch to bottle-feeding where available, or reduced neonatal health where it is not. Our results raise the possibility that the OAS2 pathway may be involved in its pathogenesis. Bacterial infection is commonly thought to be the cause of mastitis but the evidence resoundingly shows that bacterial infection is the sequelae of an unknown primary cause of the disease. For example, in women the severity of symptoms of mastitis do not correlate with the level of bacterial infection, the disease is often observed in the absence of bacteria in the milk, bacteria are often found in the milk of healthy mothers, and meticulous hygiene or prophylactic antibiotics do not prevent mastitis (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref013">13</xref>]). Recent Cochrane Systematic Reviews concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support antibiotic use for the prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref014">14</xref>] or treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref015">15</xref>] of mastitis. The strongest risk factors for mastitis in women involve incomplete or interrupted milk flow from one or more galactophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref013">13</xref>] and the World Health Organization recognizes milk stasis as the cause of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus bacterial infection most likely represents progression of mastitis to a more pathogenic form involving abscess formation, but it is not the primary cause.</p>
<p>The concept of physiological inflammation as the primary cause of mastitis was proposed in 2001, though no mechanism was proposed at the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref017">17</xref>], and the unavailability of breast tissue from women with mastitis makes the study of mechanism near impossible. Using mice, Ingman and colleagues hypothesize that molecular pattern receptors like <italic>Tlr4</italic> recognize molecules released by tissue damage caused by milk engorgement, which trigger an innate immune response and milk stasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref018">18</xref>]. Alleles of <italic>Tlr4</italic>, a bacterial associated molecular pattern receptor, are linked with the occurrence of mastitis in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref019">19</xref>]. <italic>Tlr4</italic> has also been linked to a number of the systemic symptoms of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref013">13</xref>]. As we show, stimulation of the OAS2 pathway can produce the accepted cause of mastitis, milk stasis, opening a new avenue of investigation into human mastitis as a disease amenable to anti-inflammatory therapy. Our findings also open the question of the role of viruses in the initiation of mastitis. Even non-infectious forms could play a role. Fragments of the mouse mammary tumor virus are present in the genome of all laboratory mice and they continue to produce transcripts in response to the hormones of pregnancy, while homologous fragments exist in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref021">21</xref>], which may promote milk stasis and inflammation via OAS2 activation.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a viral recognition pathway has been implicated in the regulation of lactation. Transmission of viruses via milk is a well-documented phenomenon and the evolution of mechanisms to prevent it would be expected. This would not necessarily be lethal for the neonate as all mammals have multiple and independent lactation systems. Mice, for example have 10 mammary glands each containing a single ductal system. Each human breast contains between 6 and 8 independent ductal systems, exiting at the nipple without joining. Viral infection in one ductal system, or one mammary gland, could initiate milk stasis in that system, leaving the others to continue lactation. Social systems in humans and mice allow the feeding of neonates by multiple mothers. There could be an intriguing evolutionary twist here resulting from the evolutionary arms-race between viruses and their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref022">22</xref>]. Since HIV transmission via the milk occurs far more frequently if mastitis is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref023">23</xref>], could viruses have adapted to this defense and learned to induce a limited mastitis to aid viral transmission?</p>
<p>A molecular mechanism is suggested by our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) that requires further investigation. STAT1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007072.g001">Fig 1</xref>), presumably resulting from the production of interferon due to OAS2 pathway activation, would be expected to cause the induction of the SOCS proteins, which inhibit STAT phosphorylation via targeting the JAK kinases, including JAK2 which phosphorylates STAT5 in response to prolactin, the major hormone driving the onset of lactation. Many aspects of this pathway have been demonstrated in mice such as the regulation of lactation by prolactin via STAT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref025">25</xref>] and the SOCS proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref028">28</xref>], the induction of STAT1 in conditions of sterile mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref029">29</xref>] and the ability of STAT1 to regulate prolactin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007072.ref030">30</xref>]. In the T47D transcript profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s006">S6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s008">S8</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s011">S2 Table</xref>) we observed increases in the levels of SOCS 1,4,5 and 6. In the ENU mice we observed a decrease in STAT5 phosphorylation. So it is possible that OAS2 pathway stimulation, resulting from the natural rise in OAS2 at d18.5 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007072.s005">S5</xref> Figs), produces a persistent interferon response in OAS2 mutant animals, because mutant OAS2 activates RNase L which via the resulting interferon response maintains high OAS2 levels, establishing a positive feed-back loop which then persistently prevents prolactin from activating STAT5 (maybe via SOCS) to induce the activation of milk secretion during the post partum period.</p>

More than 250 mice were screened from many successive cohorts of mice from backcrosses to CBA/CaJ to narrow the region to a 3 Mb interval. Sequencing of candidate genes was performed to locate the causal ENU base substitution using an affected mouse homozygous for the linkage region. Primers were designed for candidate genes to amplify all exons +/- 15 bp to cover splice junctions. Sanger sequencing was used to identify the causal mutation by comparing the sequence of the affected individual against a C57BL/6 mouse reference genome.
