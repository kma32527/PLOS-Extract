<abstract>
<p>Cytokine signaling is responsible for coordinating conserved epithelial regeneration and immune responses in the digestive tract. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut, Upd3 is a major cytokine, which is induced in enterocytes (EC) and enteroblasts (EB) upon oral infection, and initiates intestinal stem cell (ISC) dependent tissue repair. To date, the genetic network directing <italic>upd3</italic> transcription remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we have identified the key infection-responsive enhancers of the <italic>upd3</italic> gene and show that distinct enhancers respond to various stresses. Furthermore, through functional genetic screening, bioinformatic analyses and yeast one-hybrid screening, we determined that the transcription factors Scalloped (Sd), Mothers against dpp (Mad), and D-Fos are principal regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> expression. Our study demonstrates that <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in the gut is regulated by the activation of multiple pathways, including the Hippo, TGF-β/Dpp, and Src, as well as p38-dependent MAPK pathways. Thus, these essential pathways, which are known to control ISC proliferation cell-autonomously, are also activated in ECs to promote tissue turnover the regulation of <italic>upd3</italic> transcription.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Tissue regeneration is a fundamental process that maintains the integrity of the intestinal epithelium when faced with chemical or microbial stresses. In both healthy and diseased conditions, pro-regenerative cytokines function as central coordinators of gut renewal, linking inflammation to stem cell activity. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the upstream events that stimulate the production of the primary cytokine Unpaired 3 (Upd3) in response to indigenous or pathogenic microbes have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>upd3</italic> expression is driven in different cell types by separate microbe-responsive enhancers. In enterocytes (ECs), cytokine induction relies on the Yki/Sd, Mad/Med, and AP-1 transcription factors (TFs). These TF complexes are activated downstream of the Hippo, TGF-β and Src-MAPK pathways, respectively. Inhibiting these pathways in ECs impairs <italic>upd3</italic> transcription, which in turn blocks intestinal stem cell proliferation and reduces the survival rate of adult flies following enteric infections. Altogether, our study identifies the major microbe-responsive enhancers of the <italic>upd3</italic> gene and sheds light on the complexity of the gene regulatory network required in ECs to regulate tissue homeostasis and stem cell activity in the digestive tract.</p>

The transit of nutrients through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is accompanied by frequent introduction of biotic and abiotic stresses. In particular, digestive tissue is constantly exposed to a high density of microbes, including benign microbiota and invasive pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref001">1</xref>]. The gut epithelium performs a multifaceted role in maintaining the barrier between the host and its environment through immune responses and the maintenance of a continuous cellular monolayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref002">2</xref>], while digesting and absorbing nutrients. Preservation of epithelial integrity in the GI tract requires continual tissue turnover by coordinated shedding of epithelial cells along with division and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref003">3</xref>]. Disorders in epithelial regeneration or intestinal immunity lead to intestinal maladies including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref004">4</xref>]. Cytokines, which are central to gut homeostasis, are produced by epithelial and immune cells to properly orchestrate immune and repair responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref003">3</xref>]. The control of cytokine signaling in the digestive tract is complex, and characterizing the regulators of cytokine expression is a critical step towards fully understanding the mechanisms underlying intestinal homeostasis.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has emerged as a powerful model to study gut homeostasis, epithelial immunity and ISC regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref005">5</xref>], and acts as a model for intestinal infection and pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref006">6</xref>]. Like the mammalian intestine, the midgut of <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains ISCs that divide and differentiate to replace the absorptive, polyploid enterocytes (ECs) and secretory enteroendocrine cells (EEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref005">5</xref>]. During division, midgut ISCs self-renew and give rise to a pool of transient, differentiating precursor cells called enteroblasts (EBs), which terminally differentiate into ECs. Similarly, EE cells are replaced via ISCs that divide and give rise to pre-EE progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref007">7</xref>]. Also like the mammalian intestine, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut is regionalized. Specifically, it can be divided into five main regions: the cardia (at the foregut-midgut junction), R1 and R2 composing the anterior midgut, R3 also known as the copper cell region, and R4 and R5 that constitute the posterior midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>In response to infection by microbial pathogens or, to a lesser extent, ingestion of dietary microbes, the midgut activates multiple layers of innate immunity. Among these are the induced synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NADPH oxidases Dual oxidase (Duox) and NADPH oxidase (Nox), and the production of antimicrobial peptides under the regulation of the immune deficiency (Imd) and JAK-STAT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>]. Imd pathway activation is triggered by the detection of bacteria via peptidoglycan recognition receptors (PGRP-LE and PGRP-LC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref015">15</xref>] while JAK-STAT pathway activation results from the expression and secretion from the gut epithelium of <italic>Drosophila</italic> IL-6 family cytokines: Unpaired 3 (Upd3) and Unpaired 2 (Upd2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to immune activation, enteric infections also stimulate EC delamination and tissue turnover resulting in ISC-dependent tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref018">18</xref>]. This regenerative process has been shown to depend strongly upon the activation of multiple pathways in progenitor cells, including the Hippo, Wingless, JAK-STAT and EGFR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref020">20</xref>]. Bacterial infection, as well as genetically induced apoptosis in ECs, triggers the transcription and secretion of Upd3 in ECs and EBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>], which subsequently initiates a homeostatic feedback loop and ultimately activates ISC-mediated regeneration. The Upd cytokines activate the JAK-STAT pathway in progenitor cells and visceral muscles, which in turn stimulates the release of epidermal growth factors (EGFs) by these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref022">22</xref>]. Upd3-dependent secretion of the Epidermal Growth Factors (EGFs) Vein from visceral muscle and Spitz from EBs stimulates the EGFR pathway in ISCs to promote proliferation. Upd3-mediated JAK-STAT activity is also required to promote rapid EB differentiation, thus accelerating epithelium turnover upon infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>]. Cytokines, such as Upd3, therefore act as master regulators of intestinal homeostasis, as they are both required and sufficient to trigger immunity and tissue repair. Accordingly, the loss of Upd3 increases susceptibility to enteric infections, while ectopic induction of Upd3 induces dysplastic lesions in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref016">16</xref>]. However, a detailed knowledge of upstream enteric stress sensors as well as the downstream transcriptional regulatory network controlling Upd3 production in ECs remains elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we initiated analysis of the transcriptional regulation of <italic>upd3</italic>, the primary cytokine responsible for inducing ISC proliferation and midgut renewal. We first identified two microbe-responsive enhancer sequences in the <italic>upd3</italic> gene that direct its expression in ECs, and an additional enhancer that regulates <italic>upd3</italic> induction in progenitor cells. A subsequent EC-specific RNAi knockdown screen of all the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factors (TFs) was performed to determine which TFs govern the activity of the central infection-responsive enhancer region. From this screen, we identified 39 TFs required for enhancer induction, and 103 TFs that triggered aberrant induction when knocked down. This study was complemented by an <italic>in vitro</italic>, yeast one-hybrid screen as well as bioinformatic analyses of the enhancer sequence to identify TFs that may act as direct regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> expression. Notably, we identified the Yorkie (Yki)/Scalloped (Sd) complex, the AP-1 complex (D-Jun and D-Fos), Mad and Snail (Sna) as key regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> transcription. We proceeded to explore the upstream regulatory pathways that control the activity of these major TFs. We determined that transcriptional induction of <italic>upd3</italic> in ECs requires the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) p38b and D-ERK, downstream of Src oncogene (Src) Family Kinases (SFKs) and Raf, which converge on AP-1 activation. Surprisingly, the Stress Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK) cascade seems to be necessary for only a minimal portion of AP-1 function in ECs. In addition, a Misshapen (Msn)-Warts (Wts)-Yki/Sd pathway, independent of Hippo (Hpo), is essential for full <italic>upd3</italic> expression. Finally, we found that the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) pathway is also required for <italic>upd3</italic> induction in ECs. Altogether, these results improve our understanding of the complex regulation of midgut tissue renewal by identifying the key TFs and pathways that control cytokine signaling in the intestinal epithelium in response to infection.</p>

<title>Upd3 transcription is regulated by a combination of microbe-responsive, cell-specific and region-specific enhancers</title>
<p>Upon oral infection by entomopathogenic bacteria like <italic>Erwinia carotovora ssp</italic>. <italic>carotovora 15</italic> (<italic>Ecc15</italic>) or <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic> (<italic>Pe</italic>), Upd3 acts as a signal to trigger antibacterial and reparative host responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref023">23</xref>]. We characterized this response through RT-qPCR measurements of midgut <italic>upd3</italic> expression, taken over the course of a week following ingestion of <italic>Ecc15</italic> or <italic>Pe</italic>. We found that <italic>upd3</italic> transcription was strongly induced in response to ingestion of these pathogens and peaked between 8-24h post-infection before returning to basal levels within 96h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). In addition, peak expression of <italic>upd3</italic>, as well as the time that it takes to return to basal expression, increases with bacterial dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>upd3</italic> is regulated by infection at the transcriptional level and varies with the amplitude of the given threat.</p>
<p>As an initial step to characterize <italic>upd3</italic> regulation in the digestive tract, we sought to identify the key enhancer regions that control its expression, especially its induction in response to pathogens. To this end, we generated twenty-one GFP transcriptional reporters covering the entire <italic>upd3</italic> locus. Overlapping fragments of ~1–1.5Kb were cloned upstream of a GFP reporter, starting from 4.2Kb upstream of the <italic>upd3</italic> start site and ending 7.3Kb downstream of the gene. Reporters were designated <italic>upd3-A-GFP</italic> through <italic>upd3-R-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s011">S1 Table</xref>). We first evaluated the transcriptional activity of these reporters both in unchallenged (UC) and orally infected flies. Seven lines gave no detectable signal in the digestive system under any condition (enhancers A, D, F, J, N, O1, O2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The remaining enhancer regions were divided into five categories based on their expression profile: seven enhancer regions drove GFP expression constitutively, with little change in response to infection by <italic>Ecc15</italic>. <italic>1)</italic> For five of these lines, the signal was limited to specific regions of the gut, including the foregut and hindgut (<italic>upd3-H-GFP</italic>), the foregut only (<italic>upd3-K-GFP</italic>), the hindgut only (<italic>upd3-P1-GFP</italic>), and the copper cell region (<italic>upd3-G-GFP</italic> and <italic>upd3-P2-GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). <italic>2)</italic> The remaining two constitutive enhancer regions (<italic>upd3-M-GFP</italic> and <italic>upd3-Q-GFP</italic>) are active throughout the midgut in populations of small cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Interestingly, cells expressing <italic>upd3-M-GFP</italic> accumulate upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Overlap of the <italic>upd3-M-GFP</italic> signal and immunostaining of the progenitor marker <italic>esg-lacZ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref024">24</xref>] revealed that the <italic>upd3-M-GFP</italic> reporter is specific to ISCs and EBs, and that the increase in total signal upon infection is thus secondary to progenitor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). <italic>3)</italic> Two additional enhancer regions (<italic>upd3-E-GFP</italic> and <italic>upd3-E0F-GFP</italic>) drove GFP expression in sporadic ECs of the R2 and R4 midgut segments upon infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). <italic>4)</italic> One enhancer drove inducible <italic>upd3</italic> expression only in the salivary glands (<italic>upd3-L-GFP</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). <italic>5)</italic> Finally, we identified four infection-responsive enhancer regions, which show little or no GFP signal in UC conditions, but are activated upon infection: these include two overlapping regions of the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter (regions B-C), region I, and region R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Enhancer lines <italic>upd3-B-GFP</italic>, <italic>upd3-C-GFP</italic>, and <italic>upd3-I-GFP</italic> express GFP exclusively in ECs during infection, as shown by co-immuno-staining of GFP and the EC marker <italic>Myo-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). The <italic>upd3-I-GFP</italic> signal was stronger in the copper cell region and less consistent in the rest of the midgut. In contrast, <italic>upd3-R-GFP</italic> shows activity upon infection only in the ISC and EB cells, marked by <italic>esg-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Of note, the expression patterns identified in our study recapitulate the known <italic>upd3</italic> signaling dynamics in the gut, including induction in ECs and progenitor cells upon stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref023">23</xref>], as well as robust local expression in the middle midgut and in the cardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref008">8</xref>], suggesting that we adequately captured the complexity of <italic>upd3</italic> regulation. Altogether, these results indicate that <italic>upd3</italic> expression is controlled by several classes of enhancers, including microbe-responsive and region and/or cell type-specific regulators.</p>

<title>Microbe-responsive <italic>upd3</italic> enhancers are stress-activated enhancers</title>
<p>Upd3 acts as a major regulator of intestinal epithelial renewal and its expression is induced by a diversity of enteric stresses, not only limited to bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref016">16</xref>]. For instance, feeding bleomycin (bleo), which induces gut epithelial cell loss, or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) that disrupts basal membrane, induces <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and promotes intestinal epithelial turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref025">25</xref>]. Furthermore, basal levels of <italic>upd3</italic> expression and subsequent tissue turnover have been shown to be regulated by the microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref026">26</xref>].

These results suggest that the regulation of <italic>upd3</italic> expression integrates signals from multiple stimuli, including various intestinal injuries and even benign gut microbes.</p>

<p>We next examined whether these diverse stimuli all activate the microbe-responsive enhancers that we had previously identified. To this purpose, we fed <italic>upd3-C-GFP</italic>, <italic>upd3-I-GFP</italic>, and <italic>upd3-R-GFP</italic> flies damaging bacteria (<italic>Ecc15</italic> and <italic>Pe</italic>) and harmful chemicals (DSS and bleo) at doses that trigger comparable epithelium renewal rates. <italic>Upd3-C-GFP</italic> induced GFP expression in response to every treatment except DSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Enhancer region R responded to <italic>Ecc15</italic>, <italic>Pe</italic>, bleo, and weakly to DSS by inducing GFP in progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). In <italic>upd3-I-GFP</italic> flies, a GFP signal was only detected upon infection with <italic>Ecc15</italic>, and mostly in the copper cell region, while little signal was detected in response to <italic>Pe</italic> and no significant signal was observed in response to bleo or DSS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Our findings imply that different stresses (i.e. DSS vs other stressors) may be interpreted through distinct cellular mechanisms and thus stimulate cytokine production via separate enhancers. They also suggest that all stressors that affect ECs (<italic>Ecc15</italic>, <italic>Pe</italic>, bleo) stimulate <italic>upd3</italic> expression mainly through enhancer region B-C.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether the infection responsive enhancers C and R also react to the presence of microbiota. To this end, we generated CR and GF <italic>upd3-C-GFP</italic> and <italic>upd3-R-GFP</italic> flies and monitored their levels of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). The basal GFP signals of CR flies is already very low with few GFP-positive cells detectable microscopically per midgut, rendering qualitative analysis challenging. We therefore estimated enhancer C and R activity by quantifying GFP levels by RT-qPCR. This revealed a significant reduction in enhancer C and R-driven GFP expression in GF midguts compared to CR ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Our results demonstrate that both indigenous and pathogenic bacteria, as well as chemical stressors like bleo, all regulate <italic>upd3</italic> expression through enhancers C and R, albeit to differing degrees. Altogether, these data suggest that enhancers C and R are microbe-responsive and act as stress sensing enhancers.</p>

<title><italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> screens to identify key TFs regulating infection-induced <italic>upd3</italic> transcription</title>
<p>We next aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms that control <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in response to infection. As <italic>upd3</italic> transcription is induced by infection in both ECs (enhancers B-C and I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1G Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>]) and EBs (enhancer R in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref023">23</xref>]), we began by determining which cell type contributes the most to global <italic>upd3</italic> production in the midgut upon infection. RT-qPCR analysis of <italic>upd3</italic> expression in guts in which <italic>upd3</italic> was knocked-down by RNAi in ECs (<italic>Myo-Gal4</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup><italic>&gt;UAS-upd3-IR</italic>) or EBs (<italic>Su(H)-Gal4</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup><italic>&gt;UAS-upd3-IR</italic>) confirmed that ECs are the principal source of <italic>upd3</italic> in the gut upon infection with <italic>Ecc15</italic> or <italic>Pe</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). In agreement with this, knockdown of <italic>upd3</italic> in ECs strongly reduced ISC proliferative activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). This suggests that the key enhancers controlling the levels of Upd3 in the gut are those functional in ECs (regions B, C and I). As <italic>upd3-I-GFP</italic> responds only moderately to infection by <italic>Ecc15</italic>, but not <italic>Pe</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), we decided to focus on enhancer regions B and C, which respond strongly to infectious bacteria and cellular stress. To further investigate the importance of the B-C enhancer region in activating <italic>upd3</italic> expression in response to infection we created two new reporter lines, one that comprises the entire <italic>upd3</italic> locus (all enhancers included) and encodes an NLS-GFP-tagged Upd3 protein (full locus) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), and one in which the B-C sequence was deleted from the full locus (full locus–(B+C)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). While the complete <italic>upd3</italic> sequence was able to direct an infection-induced GFP signal in the midgut, deletion of the B-C region eliminated all signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), demonstrating that enhancers B and C are central to <italic>upd3</italic> regulation. In addition, quantification of <italic>upd3-C-GFP</italic> signal revealed that the kinetics of GFP induction upon infection is in accordance with total gut <italic>upd3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s001">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s003">S3D</xref> Figs). Finally, the promoter of the <italic>upd3</italic> reporter construct, <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic>, which covers regions B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), drove a strong and consistent signal in the same cells that are marked by <italic>upd3-C-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). We conclude that the regulation of enhancer regions B and C (and thus of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic>) is sufficient to induce <italic>upd3</italic> with a faithful EC expression pattern during enteric infection.</p>
<p>In order to identify the key regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> acting through enhancers B and C, we initiated a comprehensive set of <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> screens. First, a functional RNAi screen was performed by driving RNAi-mediated knockdown of 632 TFs (84% of all known and predicted TFs of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>) using all available <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenic lines of the TRiP collection (Transgenic RNAi Project, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref027">27</xref>]. The Gal4/Gal80<sup>TS</sup> system (<italic>Myo-Gal4</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup>, <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic>) allowed us to express RNAi specifically in the ECs of adult flies, thus minimizing developmental or systemic side effects. When available, two different <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> lines were tested (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s012">S2 Table</xref>), bringing the total number of lines to 755. Following one week of RNAi induction, five guts were dissected from both unchallenged (UC) and <italic>Ecc15</italic> orally infected flies, and ß-galactosidase enzymatic activity levels were measured as a read-out of <italic>upd3</italic> induction. F1 progeny (<italic>Myo-Gal4</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup>, <italic>upd3-lacZ&gt;UAS-RNAi</italic>) with <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity that was, compared to controls, increased or decreased by 40% upon infection and/or increased or decreased by 50% in UC conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">methods</xref> section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>) were selected as positive hits. We further estimated the strength of the positive hit phenotypes by calculating their z-score compared to the entire population of crosses tested under the same conditions (UC or <italic>Ecc15</italic> infected) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Based on these criteria, we identified 149 lines with significantly altered <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression in either challenged or unchallenged conditions. Positive hits were retested at least twice and 138 TFs were found to significantly alter <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression when suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Specifically, RNAi against 17 TFs in ECs resulted in reduced basal <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> in UC flies, and knockdown of 66 TFs increased <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> under the same UC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, 24 TFs seemed required for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression upon infection while RNAi against 53 TFs increased <italic>Ecc15</italic>-induced <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). These results indicate that the knockdown of many TFs results in <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction rather than inhibition. This is in agreement with the fact that disrupting gut homeostasis by modulating key TFs such as <italic>GATAe</italic>, <italic>Ptx1</italic>, <italic>Activating transcription factor 3</italic> (<italic>Atf3)</italic>, <italic>X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1)</italic>, either in normal or stressed conditions, can indirectly result in higher expression levels of <italic>upd3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref008">8</xref>]. Based on EC-specific transcriptomic data obtained by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) of ECs coupled to RNA-seq, we established that 92% of TFs identified as positive hits by our screen are expressed in ECs (RPKM ≥ 0.1) and 63% of the TFs required for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression are transcriptionally regulated (fold RPKM induction ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5) upon <italic>Pe</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s005">S5E Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref029">29</xref>]. This indicates that most of the TFs identified as <italic>upd3</italic> regulators by our screen are expressed in ECs and regulated upon enteric infection, and serves as an indirect control of our screen quality. Surprisingly, TFs that alter <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression in basal conditions or upon infection are poorly correlated with one another (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s005">S5F Fig</xref>), suggesting that different mechanisms regulate <italic>upd3</italic> expression in basal homeostasis and upon infection. Interestingly, positive hits in our screen were enriched for TFs involved in animal development and tissue growth rather than stress or immune responses, again suggesting that epithelial morphogenesis and dynamics are critical to <italic>upd3</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s005">S5G Fig</xref>). Altogether, our functional genetic screen identified multiple TFs that have the capacity to modulate the expression of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic>, particularly in response to infection.</p>

<p>RNAi knockdown of TFs in ECs can influence <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression in multiple ways: TFs could be acting via direct regulation of the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter region, indirect regulation through secondary genes or even non-cell-autonomously through changes in gut physiology that subsequently alter <italic>upd3</italic> expression. To complement our RNAi screen and identify the direct regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> transcription, we thus undertook two parallel approaches. First, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screen to assess the direct interaction between the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter and all <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3A’</xref>). This additional screen identified 81 yeast one-hybrid-positive TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Among these, 21 (more than 25%) showed altered <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression when knocked down, suggesting a role in <italic>upd3</italic> gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To further indicate the binding potential of TFs of interest, an <italic>in silico</italic> search for known TF-binding sites (TFBS) was performed in the same genomic region using the JASPAR and RedFly databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s012">S2 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref031">31</xref>]. We identified seven TFs that are positive for all three approaches, thus specifying them as direct regulators of <italic>upd3</italic>: <italic>D-Fos</italic> or <italic>kayak</italic>, <italic>sd</italic>, <italic>Trithorax-like (Trl)</italic>, <italic>pangolin (pan)</italic>, <italic>giant</italic>, <italic>Ptx1</italic>, <italic>and achintya (achi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Knockdown of two of these TFs caused abnormal induction of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<italic>Ptx1</italic> and <italic>achi</italic>). The five others were found to be required for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression either basally (<italic>giant</italic>) or both during infection and in basal conditions <italic>(D-Fos</italic>, <italic>sd</italic>, <italic>Trl and</italic>, <italic>pan</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Of note, Sd and D-Fos have multiple binding sites in infection-responsive enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), and are critical for <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in both UC and infected conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We therefore propose that these TFs act as direct, master regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> expression in the gut.</p>
<p>Next, we examined TFs that strongly alter <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression upon knockdown, but lack evidence for binding potential to the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter region. These important TFs required for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction include: Sna, a key regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT); Jra (D-Jun), the partner of D-Fos in the AP-1 transcriptional complex; Yki, the transcriptional partner of Sd in the Hippo pathway; Mad, a transcription factor that mediates TGF-β/Dpp signaling; and one thus far uncharacterized TF (CG33213) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that the homeodomain TFs, Retinal Homeobox (Rx) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx) are also required for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity, primarily upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting these TFs could be involved in tissue repair. Among these TFs, Sna, Mad, Rx and Ubx were not found to bind to the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter by the yeast one-hybrid assay, although there are some binding sites in the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter region for these TFs according to the JASPAR database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This suggests that there is a possibility that they could act directly. Finally, global regulators of transcription such as the transcriptional corepressor CtBP, the H3K4 methyl-transferase Trithorax-Related (Trr) and MBD-like, a member of the NuRD complex also influenced the regulation of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, we also identified TFs that cause increased <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression when knocked-down. For instance, Ptx1, a master regulator of middle midgut identity, has TFBS sites in <italic>upd3</italic>, interacts with <italic>upd3</italic> in the one-hybrid screen and its knockdown strongly induces <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> in both UC and infected guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref028">28</xref>]. This indicates that Ptx1 could act as a direct negative regulator of <italic>upd3</italic> in the middle midgut. The TFs Anterior open (Aop), Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein-17A (CrebB-17A), Longitudinals lacking (Lola), Atf3, and Achi also show potential to bind to the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter region in our one-hybrid screen and trigger <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction when depleted in ECs. RNAi against <italic>GATAe</italic>, <italic>Xbp1</italic>, <italic>deformed wings</italic> (<italic>dwg</italic>), and <italic>hangover</italic> (<italic>hang</italic>) results in elevated levels of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> in both <italic>Ecc15</italic> infected and UC conditions, but the absence of TFBS and association in our one-hybrid screen suggests that this is likely an indirect effect due to disruption of intestinal homeostasis. We also found a distinct set of epigenetic factors that strongly increase <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity when knocked-down. Among these, there are known positive regulators of transcription such as MBD-R2 (NSL complex); the Tip60 acetylase; the histone acetyl-transferase Chameau (Chm), Domino (Dom) of the SWI-SNF complex and Trl of the eponymous TRL complex. In summary, our combination of <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in silico</italic> screens allowed us to identify putative direct positive and negative regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> induction, as well as key transcriptional regulators of gut homeostasis.</p>

<p>Among our positive hit TFs that are strongly required for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction, we took note of Sna, as well as the homeodomain TFs, Rx and Ubx, and the epigenetic regulator, Trl. Despite the fact that Trl was the only one with a yeast one-hybrid predicted TFBS, knockdown of any of these TFs blocked infection-induced <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity by 40% or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

In addition, most of its upregulation occurs in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<sec id="sec007">
<title>The Hippo pathway controls <italic>upd3</italic> induction in response to infection through the TFs Yorkie and Scalloped</title>
<p>The Hippo pathway consists of a kinase cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of Wts, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits the transcription factor Yki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref036">36</xref>]. When released from phosphorylation-induced restraint, Yki is transported to the nucleus, where it dimerizes with other TFs to promote transcription of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref037">37</xref>]. Hippo regulation plays an important role in tissue regeneration and growth. In addition, Yki has been shown to control epithelium turnover, acting cell-autonomously in ISCs via a Hpo/Wts/Yki pathway and non-cell-autonomously in EBs via the Msn/Wts/Yki pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Yki and its partner Sd were found in our TF RNAi screen to be required in ECs for <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in both basal and <italic>Ecc15</italic>-infected conditions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g003">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g005">5A and 5B</xref>). In addition, Sd was found to interact with the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter by yeast one-hybrid, suggesting that the Hippo pathway may be directly involved in basal and infection-induced <italic>upd3</italic> expression. We also noted that Trr, a major constituent of the TRR histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex, and Trl, which are both required for full Yki-Sd mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref040">40</xref>], are also required during infection for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Conversely, overexpressing Yki, or knockdown of either <italic>wts</italic> or its activator, <italic>msn</italic>, in ECs was enough to induce the transcription of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). However, RNAi mediated depletion of <italic>hpo</italic>, which encodes another Wts phosphorylating kinase, had no significant effect on <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).

<title>The TGF-β/Dpp pathway is required for <italic>upd3</italic> induction in response to infection</title>
<p>The TGF-β/Dpp pathway has emerged as a major regulator of intestinal homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as it has been found to be involved in diverse processes including ISC proliferation, ISC quiescence, EC differentiation and EC protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref048">48</xref>].

Thus, we explored whether ECs require a fully functional Dpp pathway to regulate the transcription of <italic>upd3</italic>. EC-specific RNAi against the Dpp type-1 receptors, <italic>thickveins</italic> (<italic>tkv</italic>) and <italic>saxophone</italic> (<italic>sax</italic>), or the type-2 co-receptor <italic>punt</italic> (<italic>put</italic>), all decreased infection-responsive <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Dpp triggered aberrant induction of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We additionally tested the Dpp pathway via manipulation of the glycogen-synthase-3-kinase Shaggy (Sgg), which has been shown to negatively regulate Mad through phosphorylation of linker serines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref049">49</xref>].

A role for the Dpp pathway in regulating <italic>upd3</italic> was further supported by RT-qPCR of <italic>upd3</italic> in flies expressing EC-specific RNAi against <italic>tkv</italic> or <italic>Medea</italic> (<italic>Med</italic>), a TF that acts together with Mad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref050">50</xref>], as both led to decreased induction of <italic>upd3</italic> upon <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Altogether, our data demonstrate that the Dpp pathway is required for proper <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in response to infection.</p>

<title>Src-Raf-Dsor1-ERK and Licorne-p38 pathways converge to regulate <italic>upd3</italic> transcription upon infection</title>
<p>D-Fos and D-Jun were among the TFs in our screen that most strongly impacted <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity upon infection. When activated by upstream kinases these two TFs act together as the AP-1 transcription factor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref051">51</xref>].

<p>We next aimed to identify the upstream pathway(s) that regulate(s) D-Fos and D-Jun in response to <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection. Phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the AP-1 complex is carried out by both Stress Activated Protein Kinases (SAPKs) and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref052">52</xref>]. SAPKs and MAPKs act in phosphorylation cascades that result in the activation of terminal kinases such as JNK, Basket (Bsk), p38 and ERK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8F Fig</xref>). It has been previously shown that artificial activation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SAPK, Bsk, by overexpression of Hemipterous (Hep) induces <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in the gut, possibly through the activation of apoptosis or by directly regulating AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref019">19</xref>]. We first evaluated whether apoptosis is required for <italic>upd3</italic> expression in response to microbes. To this end, we manipulated the expression of caspase and autophagy genes in ECs and measured the resulting <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity. Our results confirmed that promotion of autophagy or apoptosis, by overexpression of <italic>Autophagy-related 1 (Atg1)</italic> or Death regulator Nedd2-like caspase (<italic>Dronc</italic>), respectively, induced <italic>upd3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). However, inhibiting either pathway by RNAi against <italic>Dronc</italic>, <italic>Death-associated APAF1-related killer (Dark)</italic>, <italic>Atg1</italic>, <italic>Atg7</italic> or <italic>Atg18</italic>, or by overexpression of the caspase inhibitor P35 (<italic>UAS-P35</italic>), had no significant negative effect on <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> levels during infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, detection of caspase activity in ECs by the <italic>UAS-Apoliner</italic> system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s007">S7C Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref053">53</xref>], in conjunction with immunostaining for <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic>-derived β-galactosidase, revealed that cytokine production during enteric infection is not restricted to ECs with increased caspase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s007">S7D Fig</xref>). Altogether these data suggest that apoptosis and autophagy are not the key inducers of <italic>upd3</italic> expression upon infection.</p>
<p>We next sought to evaluate the contribution of JNK to <italic>upd3</italic> induction upon infection with <italic>Ecc15</italic>. We first verified whether <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection triggers JNK activation in ECs, via co-immunostaining of the phosphorylated form of JNK and an EC marker (<italic>Myo-Gal4</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup><italic>&gt;UAS-GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). In agreement with previous publications, ectopic activation of the JNK pathway in ECs, by overexpressing Bsk or a constitutively active form of Hep, strongly promoted <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). However, EC-specific expression of a dominant negative form of Bsk (<italic>UAS-Bsk</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup>), or knockdown of <italic>bsk</italic> expression, decreased <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity following oral infection by only 20% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Additionally, RNAi knockdown of <italic>hep</italic> did not decrease <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). This suggests that JNK only plays a minor role in <italic>upd3</italic> regulation, and thus additional stress pathways may be responsible for stimulating AP-1 in response to oral bacterial infection.</p>
<p>Another possible candidate for AP-1 regulation is the p38 family of stress responsive MAPKs. The p38 kinases can regulate the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8F Fig</xref>), and have been shown to be involved in the response to oral infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref054">54</xref>]. Immunostaining for phosphorylated p38 kinases revealed a substantial increase in p38 phosphorylation in ECs upon infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). To investigate the role of the p38 pathway further, we knocked down the three p38 kinases of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>p38a</italic>, <italic>p38b</italic> and <italic>p38c)</italic>, independently. Only knockdown of <italic>p38b</italic> gave a mild, but significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We similarly tested the involvement of the upstream p38 MAPKK, Licorne (Lic), and found that knockdown of <italic>lic</italic> in ECs also blocks increased <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> transcription in response to oral infection. These experiments suggest that the stress in ECs caused by enteric infection triggers activation of a Lic/p38b pathway that mediates part of the induction of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to JNK and p38 kinases, the D-ERK kinase is also able to activate the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8F Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref051">51</xref>]. Thus, we decided to investigate whether the MAPK/D-ERK pathway could also act upstream of AP-1 to regulate <italic>upd3</italic> upon infection. Immunostaining for the phosphorylated form of Rolled (Rl), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of ERK, revealed that infection with <italic>Ecc15</italic> triggers D-ERK activation in ECs within two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of <italic>rl</italic> in ECs resulted in a strong decrease in <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), suggesting that the MAPK/ERK pathway is necessary for infection-regulated <italic>upd3</italic> induction. MAPKs are activated in a phosphorylation cascade downstream of MAPKKs and MAPKKKs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8F Fig</xref>). Two of the four <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAPKKs (Lic and Hep) were previously tested for a role in <italic>upd3</italic> regulation, and thus we proceeded to test the remaining two: Downstream of raf1 (Dsor1) and MAP kinase kinase 4 (Mkk4). As for ERK, Dsor1 was critical for full induction of <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Accordingly, expressing a dominant negative form of the upstream MAPKKK, Raf, in ECs also decreased <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> regulation by infection, while blocking other MAPKKKs, TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), Apoptotic signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and MEKK1, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, constitutively active Raf expression is sufficient to induce <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). These data together suggest the possibility of a Raf/Dsor1/ERK pathway that regulates <italic>upd3</italic> expression via AP-1 in response to midgut infection or damage. Activation of Raf by phosphorylation is typically accomplished via Ras, downstream of growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8F Fig</xref>). However, although overexpression of constitutively active Ras is sufficient to induce <italic>upd3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), blocking Ras itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8C Fig</xref>) or signaling through the key Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) EGFR and PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (Pvr) (<italic>UAS-Ras</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-EGFR</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Pvr-</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup>) did not impair <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8E Fig</xref>). Likewise, RNAi knockdown of the Pvr ligand, PDGF- and VEGF-related factor 2 (Pvf2), had no effect on <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> regulation. Raf signaling can occur downstream of additional tyrosine kinases, including the Src family kinases (SFKs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s008">S8F Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref056">56</xref>]. Immunostaining for the phosphorylated form of Src kinases revealed that infection with <italic>Ecc15</italic> triggers Src activation in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). To determine if the Src complex is also required for <italic>upd3</italic> regulation, we knocked down <italic>Src42A</italic> and <italic>Src64B</italic> by RNAi in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Depletion of either <italic>Src42A</italic> or <italic>Src64B</italic> decreased <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction upon infection. Conversely, the expression of a constitutively active form of Src42A in ECs triggered <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> induction in absence of infection, suggesting that a Src/Raf/Dsor1/MAPK pathway is sufficient to activate <italic>upd3</italic> transcription. We further confirmed our results by RT-qPCR of <italic>upd3</italic> in response to infection while blocking expression of <italic>Dsor1</italic>, <italic>p38b</italic> and <italic>Src42A</italic> in ECs by RNAi, as well as by activating the pathway by expression of a constitutively active form of Src42A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). In summary, our results demonstrate that multiple kinase cascades (Licorne-p38b and Src/Raf/Dsor1/ERK) are activated in ECs following oral <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection and converge on the regulation of <italic>upd3</italic>.</p>

<title>Impairment of <italic>upd3</italic> regulatory TFs or their upstream activators in ECs reduces ISC proliferation and compromises adult lifespan</title>
<p>We next aimed to evaluate the physiological consequences of modulating in ECs the pathways that control <italic>upd3</italic> transcription. The number of mitotically active ISCs (phospho-Histone H3 positive cells) following <italic>Ecc15</italic> ingestion was significantly reduced by knockdown of AP-1 and Sd, as well as the MAPK, Rl, the Dpp receptor, Tkv, and the epigenetic regulator, Trl, using the temperature sensitive, EC specific driver line (<italic>Myo</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This suggested that pathways required for EC-derived Upd3 production are required for proper ISC activity upon infection. We therefore monitored the survival of flies expressing EC-specific RNAi against pathway components of the Hippo, Dpp and SFK/MAPK/AP-1 pathways as well as putatively indirect regulators (Sna, Trl, Rx, Ubx) of <italic>upd3</italic> upon infection. These flies had significantly shorter lifespans following <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection compared to wild-type controls, and LT50 values lower than controls by at least two days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007091.g007">Fig 7B–7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s014">S4 Table</xref>). In addition, we also found that, under UC conditions, these knockdown flies have significantly shorter lives than wild-type ones, and correspondingly lower LT50 values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s009">S9A–S9C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s014">S4 Table</xref>), implying that the knockdown of these genes, or the subsequent reduction in basal Upd3 levels compromises midgut epithelial homeostasis. We further confirmed our results by altering the expression of our candidate genes in ECs using multiple independent transgenic <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> lines for each gene and monitoring their survival in both infected and unchallenged conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007091.s014">S4 Table</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Unpaired ligands, as well as mammalian type I family cytokines, such as IL-6, play an essential role in activating JAK-STAT and other signaling pathways upstream of tissue renewal. Our study provides insight into the complex regulation of Upd3, a cytokine that is transcriptionally induced in response to pathogenic and endogenous microbes, and initiates immune activation and stem cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Microbe-responsive enhancers as DAMP sensors</title>
<p>We found that the <italic>upd3</italic> gene is regulated by three classes of enhancers: region-specific, cell-specific and stress/microbe-responsive. This complexity likely reflects the multiple roles of the JAK-STAT pathway in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut, where it acts to stimulate ISC proliferation, promote differentiation and serves as a regional determinant of cell identity, notably in the middle midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref057">57</xref>]. We propose that the different functions of <italic>upd3</italic> are therefore regulated independently by the diverse enhancer regions we identified. We further identified microbial responsive enhancers that are active either in ECs (B-C and I) or in progenitor cells (enhancer R), supporting a distinct regulation of <italic>upd3</italic> in different cell types. Interestingly, the progenitor-specific enhancer R is the only one to be induced by DSS feeding (and only to a low degree), while the EC specific enhancers B-C and I do not promote transcription in these conditions. It has been speculated that DSS elicits stem cell proliferation through alteration of the basal lamina rather than by direct damage to ECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref025">25</xref>], such as that caused by <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection or by bleo treatment. This suggests that different cell-type specific enhancers allow for induction of <italic>upd3</italic> expression in response to a broad variety of stresses.</p>
<p>The regulation of host gene expression by bacteria in <italic>Drosophila</italic> relies mostly on dedicated pathways, Toll and Imd, that trigger effector induction in response to the detection of microbial patterns (MAMPs), such as bacterial derived peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref058">58</xref>]. The microbe-responsive enhancers of <italic>upd3</italic> are activated by both pathogenic and benign microbes, such as <italic>Ecc15</italic> and the gut microbiota, but are also stimulated by toxic chemicals such as bleo or DSS. This result suggests that cytokine production in the gut is primarily triggered in response to damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) rather than the detection of microbes alone. Considering that dietary microbes and the microbiota are constantly associated with the gut tissue, triggering perpetual, low-level Imd activation, responding to DAMPs could be a strategy to couple immune activation and tissue repair to the presence of pathogens rather than beneficial or commensal microbes. Accordingly, we found that <italic>upd3</italic> activation is less pronounced by the microbiota than by pathogens. These pathways have been shown to be activated by various stresses and are central to <italic>upd3</italic> regulation in ECs. A major source of stress in response to microbes, is the production of ROS, partly induced by NADPH oxidases Nox and Duox of the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref060">60</xref>]. Notably, SAPKs and Src kinases are both sensitive to ROS and their activity is modulated by oxidative stress, indicating that a NADPH oxidase, ROS, Src, SAPK/MAPK axis could be involved in <italic>upd3</italic> regulation. Future work should determine the link between infection-induced ROS, Src/SAPK activation and the control of gut homeostasis.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title><italic>upd3</italic> integrates signals from multiple signaling pathways</title>
<p>We further focused on identifying the key TFs that regulate <italic>upd3</italic> in the midgut. We found that altering the expression of 138 over the 708 <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs significantly altered <italic>upd3</italic> expression in the midgut. This number is surprisingly high, as it implies that a quarter of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs directly or indirectly regulate <italic>upd3</italic> transcription. We interpret this high number as an indication that <italic>upd3</italic> acts as a stress marker, and that any physiological alteration in the gut will result in a rupture of gut homeostasis and consequently in the induction of <italic>upd3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref008">8</xref>]. We therefore propose that <italic>upd3</italic> acts as a global sensor of gut stress and in turn initiates a stereotypical immune and homeostatic program.</p>
<p>This poses the question of how multiple stresses can converge on the activation of <italic>upd3</italic> transcription. Our results suggest that in ECs, stresses are mostly integrated by one <italic>upd3</italic> enhancer (B-C) that responds to both chemical and biotic stresses. Integration could occur either because all stresses result in one simple damage signal, for instance cell loss in the epithelium, or as a consequence of multiple types of gut damage. Interestingly, the TFs altering <italic>upd3</italic> expression in basal and infected conditions are not the same, indicating that different cascades regulate <italic>upd3</italic> expression under different conditions. Upon infection, our data show that the Dpp, Hippo, SAPK and MAPK pathways are all involved in the regulation of <italic>upd3</italic>. We therefore propose a model in which the diverse transcriptional regulation of <italic>upd3</italic> is required for its multiple roles in homeostatic regulation.</p>
<p>The different transduction pathways we identified all respond to different cues. We find that the Dpp pathway is likely involved in the activation of enhancer B-C in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. The Dpp pathway is furthermore essential for EC differentiation, growth, survival to infection, and injury-induced Dpp negatively controls midgut homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref045">45</xref>]. Upon enteric infection, the Dpp pathway displays complex behavior. In an early response, Dpp released from hemocytes has been shown to stimulate ISC proliferation, but in a second phase, the Dpp pathway promotes the reestablishment of a quiescent state in these same cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref061">61</xref>]. Our results suggest that upon infection with <italic>Ecc15</italic>, the Dpp pathway also plays a role in ECs by promoting <italic>upd3</italic> transcription, which could synergize with the early proliferative role of this pathway in ISCs. It remains unclear whether Dpp acts directly or indirectly on the <italic>upd3</italic> promoter. We identified Mad and Med as required for <italic>upd3</italic> expression, and TFBS for Mad are found in the promoter region of <italic>upd3</italic>; however, our yeast one-hybrid screen did not detect a direct interaction between these two components.</p>
<p>We did find evidence of direct regulation of the <italic>upd3</italic> gene by transcription factors downstream of the Hippo pathway and SAPK/SFK/MAPK cascades. The Hippo pathway regulates ISC proliferation in the midgut both cell-autonomously and non-cell-autonomously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref063">63</xref>]. The upstream regulators of Hippo signaling remain uncharacterized in the midgut, but the MAPKKKK Msn has been shown to control Wts in progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref064">64</xref>]. Our data suggest that the Yki/Sd complex directly regulates <italic>upd3</italic> in ECs upon infection, and that Msn, but not Hpo, is involved in that process. We furthermore identified D-Fos and D-Jun (AP-1 complex) as direct regulators of <italic>upd3</italic> transcription, acting downstream of Src-Raf-Dsor1-ERK and Licorne-p38b kinase cascades. Stress responsive kinases, as well as SFKs, are key regulators of AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref055">55</xref>]. It remains unclear whether the upstream stimuli inducing SAPK/SFK/MAPKs to regulate <italic>upd3</italic> upon infection include oxidative stress, cytoskeletal modification or a combination of both, but all these stimuli occur upon infection and are possible candidates. We propose that the role of SFKs, MAPKs and SAPKs in the regulation of cytokine expression and cell proliferation is conserved across organisms. Indeed, AP-1 and these conserved pathways have been demonstrated to have an important role in the regulation of cytokine secretion and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref066">66</xref>]. Src kinases have been previously shown to be important for wound healing in multiple models, potentially downstream of ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref068">68</xref>], suggesting that conserved pathways are used in both tissue repair and gut regeneration. Interestingly, the pathways we identified in our study are known to work cooperatively in other systems. For example, mammalian JNK kinases are capable of phosphorylating YAP (Yki homologue), and can inhibit multiple constituents of the Hippo pathway during tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref069">69</xref>]. In addition, mammalian Src has been shown to regulate YAP during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref070">70</xref>]. Finally, it was recently found that binding sites for Yap/Taz/Tead (Yki/Sd in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and AP-1 are associated genome-wide with enhancers of genes involved in oncogenic growth. Altogether, these results and our own suggest that the SAPK/SFK/MAPK pathways in coordination with Hippo and TGF-β pathways work together in a conserved regulatory network that controls tissue growth and repair.</p>

<title>Cell loss, Upd3 regulation and tissue renewal</title>
<p>The maintenance of gut tissue homeostasis relies on the induction of ISC proliferation to compensate for the loss of cells in the epithelium in a homeostatic feedback loop. A simple model of homeostasis would hold that cell death directly triggers <italic>upd3</italic> expression and subsequent ISC proliferation in a coupled manner. In agreement with this model, induction of apoptosis in ECs is sufficient to induce <italic>upd3</italic> expression and trigger ISC proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref017">17</xref>]. However, a recent study using oral infection with a low dose of pathogenic bacteria in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrated that cytokine-induced ISC proliferation can be elicited even by infections that do not induce epithelial cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref071">71</xref>]. This indicates that the coupling of ISC proliferation with cell loss is not complete. In agreement with these results, we found that neither apoptosis nor autophagy alone appear to be necessary for <italic>Ecc15</italic>-induced <italic>upd3</italic> expression. Rather, the results of Loudhaief <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) and our study suggest that cytokine signaling results from stress detection rather than cell death, and that regenerative processes can occur independently of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref071">71</xref>]. This is also in agreement with the fact that the gut microbiota, which induces basal levels of epithelial stress but does not induce massive cell death in the gut, also stimulates basal cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref026">26</xref>]. Pathways such as Hippo regulate both cell death and apoptosis, as well as cytokine production in the gut. We therefore propose that coupling between cell death and cell renewal is a consequence of cross-talk between regulatory pathways, rather than renewal as a direct consequence of cell death.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis is that cell loss without death is coupled to tissue repair. Accordingly, infection induces the loss of ECs from the epithelium prior to anoikis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref019">19</xref>]. It is therefore possible that EC delamination, rather than death, is a key signal for regeneration as evidenced by the observation that loss of EC contact with the basal lamina of the midgut epithelium can trigger Upd3 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref072">72</xref>]. EMT is a process of tissue morphogenesis reminiscent of cell delamination, in which epithelial cells detach and are extruded from the epithelial sheet whereupon they migrate as loosely associated mesenchymal tissue. Curiously, our study shows that the transcription factor Sna, a main regulator of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EMT and a marker of progenitor cells in the midgut, is both transcriptionally induced in ECs upon infection and required for <italic>upd3</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref073">73</xref>]. Sna’s role as a negative regulator of transcription implies that this phenotype is likely a secondary effect. We thus propose that <italic>upd3</italic> expression may be downstream of Sna-dependent, EMT-like shedding of ECs in response to enteric stresses. In such a scenario, cell loss would require an EMT like regulation in ECs and indirectly trigger <italic>upd3</italic> transcription. Epithelial structure and tension modulated by delamination could also result in Src and Hippo pathway activation, and ultimately in <italic>upd3</italic> induction. Future work will determine how ECs are extruded from the epithelial sheet and how cell loss modulates Upd3 production.</p>

<title>Regulatory networks are reused in multiple epithelial cell types to coordinate tissue repair</title>
<p>The regulatory pathways that we find upstream of <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in ECs appear to be the same pathways required in ISCs to control their proliferation. For instance, inactivation of the Hippo pathway or induction of the Dpp pathway in ISCs is sufficient to stimulate stem cell proliferation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref042">42</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref061">61</xref>]. Similarly, the MAPK pathway has been demonstrated to be critical in ISCs for division and differentiation downstream of EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref019">19</xref>]. However, the regulation of these pathways is not always identical between cell types: while the SAPK kinase cascade is strongly required cell-autonomously for ISC activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007091.ref013">13</xref>], its effect on <italic>upd3</italic> induction in ECs is only marginal. Along these lines, MAPKs act downstream of growth factor receptors in ISCs, while we found that Src kinases trigger their activation in ECs. We thus propose that a single regulatory network controls ISC proliferation both cell-autonomously and cell non-autonomously and that the two processes are linked by the secretion of cytokines and growth factors.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Altogether, the results of our study illustrate key aspects of the regulation of cytokine expression by intestinal cells in the gut. We identify microbe-responsive enhancers in the promoter of <italic>upd3</italic> that act as stress sensors, thanks to the cooperative regulation by multiple pathways. Dpp, Hippo, Src, SAPK and MAPK pathways all converge on the transcriptional regulation of <italic>upd3</italic>, thus acting together as a genetic network dedicated to damage detection and response. Strikingly, this genetic network controls both proliferation in stem cells, as well as the expression of cytokines in ECs to subsequently induce ISC proliferation. This genetic regulatory network therefore links stem cell proliferation and cytokine production in one common molecular framework, and paves the way for future studies to decrypt the link between inflammation and cancer in the gut.</p>

<p>(A-B) The relative <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> values for each of the 718 lines used in our screen in either UC conditions (A) or upon infection (B) are depicted here. Three controls are used in these experiments (<italic>Myo-Gal4</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup><italic>; upd3-lacZ</italic> x <italic>attP2</italic>, <italic>attP40</italic> and <italic>Cs</italic>) and their variation across 66 sets of experiments is depicted (brown, vertical line of points). The distribution of these control values due to inter-experimental variation was used to establish thresholds for determining positive hits (yellow dotted line is the threshold for increased expression and blue dotted line is the threshold for decreased expression). (C-D) Venn diagrams representing the overlap between TF hits inducing (C) or reducing (D) <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity when knocked-down in ECs, in both basal condition and upon infection, showing only minor overlap between the two conditions.

Positive hits in the screen are enriched in genes that are expressed and regulated in ECs. (F) A scatter plot representing the relative effect of each TF on basal (x-axis) and infected (y-axis) conditions demonstrates that TFs modulating <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> activity in UC and infected conditions are not correlated.

However, blocking apoptosis or autophagy by RNAi against caspases or autophagy genes, or overexpression of P35, does not impede <italic>Ecc15</italic>-induced <italic>upd3</italic> transcription (B).

<title>Activation of JNK, Hep, Ras and major RTKs induce <italic>upd3</italic> expression but are not required for infection-induced expression.</title>
<p>(A, B) Immunostaining against phosphorylated forms of JNKand p38 reveals that these kinases are activated in response to infection in ECs.

<title>Model of Upd3 regulation in midgut ECs in response to enteric stress.</title>
<p>Schematic representation of the pathways that control <italic>upd3</italic> transcription in ECs during intestinal trauma. Biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as the responsive ROS production, induce epithelial cell extrusion and cell death. The Sna TF may act as an integral component of cellular extrusion by negatively regulating cellular adhesion. SFK and MAPK pathways are activated by cellular stress, and converge on the activation of D-Fos and D-Jun TFs. The Hippo pathway likely responds to tissue loss in the midgut by removing the inhibition of the Yki and Sd TF complex.</p>
