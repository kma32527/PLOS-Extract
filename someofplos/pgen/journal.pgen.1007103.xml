<abstract>
<p>The FrzCD chemoreceptor from the gliding bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> forms cytoplasmic clusters that occupy a large central region of the cell body also occupied by the nucleoid. In this work, we show that FrzCD directly binds to the nucleoid with its N-terminal positively charged tail and recruits active signaling complexes at this location. The FrzCD binding to the nucleoid occur in a DNA-sequence independent manner and leads to the formation of multiple distributed clusters that explore constrained areas. This organization might be required for cooperative interactions between clustered receptors as observed in membrane-bound chemosensory arrays.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>In this work, we show that the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor of the Frz chemosensory system, FrzCD, does not bind the cytoplasmic membrane like most MCPs but bind the bacterial nucleoid directly, thus forming distributed protein clusters also containing the FrzE kinase. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments show that DNA-binding is not sequence-specific and is mediated by a basic aminoacid sequence of the FrzCD N-terminal domain. The deletion of this motif abolishes FrzCD DNA-binding and cooperativity in the response to signals. This work shows the importance of the nucleoid in the organization and functioning of cytoplasmic signaling systems in bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The bacterial cytoplasm is not a homogeneous solution of macromolecules, but rather a highly organized and compartmentalized space where the clustering and segregation of macromolecular complexes at certain cell regions confers functional efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref001">1</xref>]. Bacterial chemoreceptors represent a versatile model system to study the subcellular localization of macromolecules, as they are present in many prokaryotes where they form highly ordered arrays that occupy different positions in cells. Chemoreceptors, also called Methyl-accepting Chemotaxis Proteins (MCP), are capable of transducing external signals to downstream signaling pathways where phospho-cascades, initiating at the level of histine kinases CheAs and culminating at the level of output response regulators CheYs, translate the initial signal into cell behaviors such as regulation of motility, cell development or aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref002">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref004">4</xref>]. A common feature of the MCPs is their ability to form highly ordered hexagonal structures, which, by cryoelectron tomography, look like lattices with each unit composed of an MCP trimer of dimers, two CheW docking proteins and one CheA dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref005">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref008">8</xref>]. Receptor clustering is not strictly required for signal transduction, as one functional unit is enough to generate phosphorylated CheY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref009">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref011">11</xref>]. However, MCP clustering is essential to ensure the amplification of the initial signal, which is a direct consequence of the cooperative interactions between clustered chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref011">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>While the MCP lattices have been described for all studied prokaryotic chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref016">16</xref>] their subcellular localization and distribution can vary among species, often reflecting life style complexity, behaviors and functions. For example, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MCPs localize in one or two polar clusters and more lateral clusters appear as cells become longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref017">17</xref>]. Differently, the TlpT cytoplasmic chemoreceptor from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> forms a cluster positioned at the center of cells or two clusters positioned at the two and three cell quarters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref018">18</xref>]. The determinants of these different localization patterns also vary. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, membrane-anchored MCPs form clusters stochastically and through a self-assembly mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref017">17</xref>]. The TlpA <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> polar chemoreceptor recognizes and associates with strongly curved membrane regions generated during cell septation. These regions become the new poles after cell division, which explains the TlpA polar localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref019">19</xref>]. While in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> the polar targeting of bacterial chemoreceptors is due to intrinsic properties of these proteins, in <italic>Vibrio</italic> species the Che proteins are recruited to the cell poles by a set of specialized proteins responsible of the general maturation of these cell regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref021">21</xref>]. The presence of CheWs and CheAs also seem to be universally important in chemoreceptor cluster formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> is a gliding bacterium that uses the Frz chemosensory system to modulate the frequency at which cells periodically reverse the direction of their movement on solid surfaces to reorient in the environment, analogously to controlled tumbles in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref024">24</xref>]. The Frz regulation of directionality in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> is essential to achieve fruiting body formation, a behavior that bacteria initiate when they are exposed to unfavorable growth conditions. In the Frz pathway, the FrzCD chemoreceptor activates the autophosphorylation of a CheA-CheY fusion, FrzE, which in turn phosphorylates the response regulator FrzZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref025">25</xref>]. The system also possesses two CheW homologues (FrzA and FrzB), a methyltransferase (FrzF) and methylesterase (FrzG). The chemoreceptor of the Frz pathway, FrzCD, lacks the transmembrane and periplasmic domains, which are replaced by a N-terminal domain of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref026">26</xref>]. When FrzCD was first localized in cells, it appeared organized in multiple dynamic cytoplasm clusters that aligned when cells made side-to-side contacts, which has been proposed to be part of a signaling process that synchronizes cell reversals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref027">27</xref>]. However, the determinants of FrzCD localization and its exact link with the regulation of the cell reversal are still unclear.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that FrzCD forms cytoplasmic signaling clusters by directly binding to the nucleoid. This binding, is not absolutely required for signaling but it supports a cooperative dose-dependent response to external signals as detected in single cell assays. Thus, analogously to membrane chemotaxis clusters in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, nucleoid binding could support the formation of chemosensory-like arrays with signal amplification properties.</p>

<p>To directly show that the nucleoid supports Frz protein localization, we constructed a <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> conditional mutant that lacked ParB, a protein important for nucleoid segregation whose absence causes the presence of anucleated cells, cells with abnormal nucleoid condensation and cells where the division septum is improperly positioned over the nucleoid (âguillotinesâ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref031">31</xref>]. When <italic>frzCD-gfp</italic> and <italic>frzE-mCherry</italic> were expressed in the <italic>parB</italic> mutant, we observed that both FrzCD and FrzE clusters always co-localized with the nucleoid and cells lacking the nucleoid also lacked Frz clusters. Similarly, in cells with âguillotinesâ, septa formed in regions occupied by both the nucleoid and Frz clusters instead than in DNA-free regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>As a control, we looked at the cellular localization of another chemoreceptor fusion, DifA-GFP, in the absence of <italic>parB</italic>. DifA has been recently shown to form membrane bound and uniformly distributed clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref028">28</xref>]. In the absence of <italic>parB</italic>, even cells without nucleoid still carried DifA-GFP clusters and these clusters localized similar to the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). These results confirmed that nucleoid-mediated cluster formation is a specific feature of Frz proteins.</p>
<p>To test if FrzCD and FrzE were capable of associating with the nucleoid independently of each other, we expressed <italic>frzE-mcherry</italic> in a strain lacking <italic>frzCD</italic> and <italic>frzCD-gfp</italic> in a strain lacking <italic>frzE</italic> (Mauriello et al., 2009 and this study). As previously shown, in the absence of FrzCD, FrzE-mCherry was homogeneously dispersed in the cytoplasm, and notably also in the polar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref029">29</xref>]. Here we additionally showed that in the absence of <italic>frzE</italic>, FrzCD lost its typical punctate pattern, but the fluorescent signal was still retained towards the center of the cell body and strictly co-localized with the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g001">Fig 1Aâ1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The aberrant localization patterns observed in the deletion mutants were not due to a change in protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Thus, this result confirms that both FrzCD and FrzE are important for cluster formation, whereas FrzCD is responsible for the recruitment of FrzE to the nucleoid.</p>
<p>To check whether the association between FrzCD and the nucleoid was <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus-</italic>specific, we constructed an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain expressing <italic>frzCD-gfp</italic> from a plasmid and under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. Under these conditions, FrzCD also co-localized with the nucleoid and this co-localization was particularly evident in elongated undivided cephalexin- treated cells containing multiple segregated nucleoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g002">Fig 2Aâ2D</xref>).</p>

<title>FrzCD directly binds to the DNA</title>
<p>The possibility that FrzCD interacted with the nucleoid was puzzling especially considering that the direct binding between a chemoreceptor and the DNA has not been reported prior to this study. To explore this possibility, we generated a 6His-tagged FrzCD version, purified it from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and tested its ability to form complexes with DNA. FrzCD binds directly to DNA because its presence altered DNA mobility on agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Binding did not require extended DNA fragments because it was also observed with oligomers of DNA as small as 69 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Moreover, FrzCD DNA-binding did not seem to depend on the DNA sequence nor on its GC content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) as anticipated by the <italic>in vivo</italic> results showing that FrzCD is distributed all over the nucleoid in the absence of FrzE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The shift pattern depended on the FrzCD concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). More specifically, the shift of DNA fragments gradually increased as the FrzCD concentration was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Such migration profiles have been previously described for proteins that can nucleate on DNA molecules in a non -specific manner, i.e. some Type Ib ParA-like proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref033">33</xref>]. However, to exclude that such profiles were due to the formation of FrzCD unfolded aggregates, we checked the oligomerization state of our purified 6His-FrzCD. As expected for an MCP, FrzCD forms a homogenous dimer in solution, corresponding to a molecular weight of ~ 90 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Last, 6His-FrzCD activated the autophosphorylation of the FrzE kinase <italic>in vitro</italic>, proving that it is functional (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>While FrzCD does not appear to bind specific DNA motifs in vitro, it could bind to specific sites <italic>in vivo</italic> (perhaps with the help of additional factors), explaining the formation of clusters. To test this possibility, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using the <italic>frzCD-gfp</italic> strain and polyclonal GFP antibodies. As expected, FrzCD-GFP but not a FrzCD variant that cannot bind DNA (see below) was able to co-immunoprepicipate significant amounts of DNA. Deep-sequence (ChIP-Seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref034">34</xref>] of the immunoprecipitated DNA revealed no enrichment in the pool of DNA fragments obtained with the ChIP meaning that FrzCD-GFP can bind any DNA sequence from the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s005">S5 Fig</xref>; the ChipSeq results have also been deposited on GEO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>, accession number GSE102724)). As a positive control we used a <italic>parB-yfp</italic> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref030">30</xref>]. In this case, as expected, the nucleoid region corresponding to positions 9,109 to 9,110 Kb and containing <italic>parS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref030">30</xref>] was highly represented in the DNA pool obtained with ParB-YFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). We conclude that FrzCD binds DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner to recruit FrzE and thus form clusters containing Frz signaling complexes.</p>

<title>The FrzCD N-terminal region is required for the FrzCD DNA binding</title>
<p>Beside a very conserved C-terminal methylation domain, FrzCD contains a unique 137 residue N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We then asked whether this region corresponded to the FrzCD nucleoid-binding domain and tested its ability to form complexes with the DNA in our gel shift assays. Indeed, the FrzCD N-terminal domain (FrzCD<sup>Î131â417</sup>) also provoked a mobility shift of DNA fragments of different length, albeit at a lower efficiency (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). On the other hand, the FrzCD C-terminal methyl-accepting domain alone (FrzCD<sup>Î1â130</sup>) did not associate with any DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) showing that the methylation domain does not bind DNA.</p>
<p>To confirm a direct interaction between FrzCD and DNA and also better compare the DNA-binding properties of FrzCD and FrzCD<sup>Î131â417</sup>, we performed DNA-protein interaction experiments using Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI), a technique previously used to study protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref035">35</xref>]. FrzCD and DNA interaction was also detected in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Consistent with the gel-shift experiments, binding appeared complex and could not be fitted to a 1:1 interaction model, precluding precise determination of a K<sub>D</sub>. Nevertheless, when we compared the DNA binding curves of FrzCD<sup>Î131â417</sup> and FrzCD, the results confirmed that FrzCD<sup>Î131â417</sup> binds the DNA at a lower efficiency than FrzCD (showing slower association and faster dissociation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>By further analyzing the FrzCD N-terminal domain, we realized that it contains a positively charged peptide of approximately 30 amino acids followed by a more negative region predicted to contain alpha helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3B and 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). By searching for homologs in the UniProtKB/SwissProt Data Base, we found that such FrzCD N-terminal basic peptide was similar to the basic tail present at the N terminus of eukaryotic histones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) whose deletion has been shown to substantially affect histone-DNA interactions and decrease nucleosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref037">37</xref>]. To test whether this sequence had a histone-tail-like function in the binding of FrzCD to DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, we generated a 6His-tagged FrzCD version only lacking the basic amino acid sequence from residue 7 to 27 (FrzCD<sup>Î7â27</sup>), purified it from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and tested its ability to form complexes with the DNA in our gel shift assays. Remarkably, FrzCD<sup>Î7â27</sup> did not shift the migration of DNA fragments on agarose gels, similarly to FrzCD<sup>Î1â130</sup> missing the entire N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3D and 3G</xref>). In the BLI assay, binding of FrzCD<sup>Î7â27</sup> to DNA was still detectable, however it was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). This result suggests that the positively charged motif is required for efficient DNA binding but it may not be the sole determinant.</p>
<p>The different DNA binding efficiencies of the four FrzCD, FrzCD<sup>Î1â130</sup>, FrzCD<sup>Î131â417</sup> and FrzCD<sup>Î7â27</sup> alleles were not due to altered protein stability and folding because all recombinant proteins, except as expected FrzCD<sup>Î131â417</sup> (the signaling domain) were able to activate the autophosphorylation of the FrzE kinase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>FrzCD cluster dynamics and organization</title>
<p>To understand how FrzCD clusters are formed along the nucleoid, we analyzed the cluster dynamics at high temporal resolution. Contrarily to previous assumptions based on lower resolution analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref027">27</xref>], these results show that FrzCD clusters dynamics are limited to constrained areas of the nucleoid and are featured by undirected Brownian-like motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g004">Fig 4Aâ4C</xref>). This mobility decreased with the increase of cluster intensity, suggesting that clusters containing more molecules might be more tightly anchored to the chromosome and, hence, more fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To test whether the signaling state of FrzCD also affects the cluster mobility, we tested whether clusters were also constrained in strains carrying point mutations in methylation sites either generating FrzCD loss of function (<italic>frzCD</italic><sub><italic>E202A-E203A</italic></sub>-<italic>gfp</italic>) or, oppositely, FrzCD gain of function (<italic>frzCD</italic><sub><italic>E168A-G169A</italic></sub>-<italic>gfp</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref027">27</xref>].

<p>Given that FrzCD clusters are not very dynamic and form in a limited number of sites per chromosome, we wondered how these clusters were segregated to daughter cells following cell division. Analysis of the number of FrzCD clusters as a function of chromosome length revealed a linear correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), suggesting that more clusters are assembled as the DNA is being replicated. A demograph representation revealed that the clusters appear distributed similarly on replicating and segregated chromosomes and indeed their number increases with chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). This distribution might ensure equal partitioning in daughter cells.</p>

<title>The nucleoid-dependent assembly is important for cooperative signal-dependent response</title>

In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chemosensory cluster formation is also not critical for signal transduction but it confers properties such as the amplification of signal, a direct consequence of the cooperative interactions between clustered chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref011">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, we decided to check if the formation of DNA-bound Frz clusters can also promote cooperativity in the signaling activity of the Frz chemosensory system. For this, we took advantage of a newly developed microfluidic single cell assay where the frequency of reversals can be measured as a function of increasing concentrations of an artificial Frz-signal activator, isoamyl alcohol (IAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref025">25</xref>]. Consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref025">25</xref>], in cells where FrzCD formed nucleoid bound clusters, IAA induced a dose-dependent response with a sigmoidal shaped curve that could be fitted by the Hill equation with a coefficient <italic>n</italic> = 3.017 +/- 0.2 (P = 0.0007), thus revealing possible cooperativity in IAA-dependent Frz activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Such response is FrzCD-dependent because a <italic>ÎfrzCD</italic> strain does not reverse at any IAA dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007103.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In the <italic>frzCD</italic><sup><italic>Î6â130</italic></sup> mutant, the cells still responded to IAA in a dose-dependent manner but in this case, the calculated Hill coefficient was <italic>n</italic> = 1.15 +/- 0.01 (P = 0.008), revealing that cooperation is lost in this mutant.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In bacteria, transmembrane chemoreceptors use the bacterial inner membrane as a platform to form the well described arrays of trimers of dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref038">38</xref>]. Remarkably, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> Frz system forms clusters not on the membrane, but directly on the bacterial chromosome. Cluster assembly is directed by the chemoreceptor FrzCD, which binds to the DNA by a N-terminal domain carrying a positively charged tail similar to that found in eukaryotic histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref037">37</xref>]. While the binding of FrzCD to DNA is essential to target the Frz chemosensory system to the nucleoid, it is not sufficient for Frz cluster formation, as it requires downstream interactions with the FrzE kinase. Because FrzCD appears to bind DNA in a non-sequence specific manner, DNA-bound clusters do not occupy fixed localization sites and move across small areas on the nucleoid surface. Analogous to trans-membrane proteins diffusing in the bacterial membrane, the FrzCD cluster dynamic behavior may be affected by the size of the complex (and thus the number of interactions with DNA), explaining why bright clusters show Brownian-like motions that only explore constrained nucleoid areas.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the Frz cluster formation on the nucleoid occurs in a stochastic manner similarly to the assembly of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Che lattices in the membrane. First, the initial binding of FrzCD to DNA might take place anywhere on the nucleoid as such binding is not DNA-sequence specific. Once recruited to the nucleoid, small FrzCD foci diffuse, non-directionally, across confined small areas until they might nucleate large fixed clusters by attracting more FrzCD molecules. âNewbornâ FrzCD foci might also, at one point, be incorporated by existing neighboring clusters. Thus, the areas explored by FrzCD clusters might represent the minimal critical distance from other clusters at which foci can exist. The existence of such minimal critical distance is supported by the fact that the number of Frz clusters increases linearly with the nucleoid size, suggesting that more clusters can form when more surface becomes available. Thus, like for transmembrane chemoreceptors, FrzCD molecules might either nucleate new dynamic foci if they are far enough from existing clusters, or encounter and join neighboring clusters. This simple mechanism might ensure correct partitioning of the clusters in daughter cells without the need for a faithful partitioning system. Such partitioning system appear, in fact, to be required in the presence of a single cluster like in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> where PpfA ensures the faithful segregation of Tlp clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Cluster formation is unlikely to be uniquely linked to partitioning constraints during cell division. Indeed, the FrzCD variants that do not bind to the nucleoid form diffused signaling complexes that can be easily partitioned between daughter cells via diffusion. We therefore favor that nucleoid binding confers particular signaling properties to Frz complexes. In support of this, chromosome-bound complexes respond to signals in a cooperative manner, while soluble complexes do not. This could be explained if Frz clusters were arranged on the chromosome similar to the transmembrane chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref039">39</xref>], forming ordered signaling arrays with signal amplification properties.</p>
<p>But, what signals are sensed by the chromosomal complexes? Frz clusters have been previously associated to the regulation of the cell reversal frequency in response to cell-cell contact. In fact, FrzCD clusters align in adjacent <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> cells, a behavior that also seemed to induce cell reversals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref027">27</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, adjacent cells of a <italic>frzE</italic> strain did not produce cluster alignment. We now find that what seemed to be more diffused FrzCD clusters in the <italic>frzE</italic> strain at the time, are, in fact, FrzCD molecules dispersed on the nucleoid. Moreover, we now show that the Frz cluster dynamics are independent on the Frz signaling activity. Thus, the observed FrzCD cluster alignment might be more likely determined by similar dynamic rearrangements of the nucleoid of adjacent cells rather than by an active regulated mechanism. Therefore, we propose that chromosome assembly allows the formation of ordered chemosensory complexes that sense a yet unidentified intracellular signal. Finally, it cannot be excluded that the Frz complex responds to or even regulates chromosomal processes, although there is currently no evidence for such activity of the Frz system.</p>
<p>Finally, the analysis of the FrzCD sequences from some related species of Î´-proteobacteria shows that while the FrzCD C-terminal region is very conserved, its N-terminus largely varies. Nevertheless, the FrzCD N-terminus always shows a positively charged sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) suggesting that the non-sequence-specific recruitment of Frz proteins to the nucleoid essentially requires the presence of a positively charged protein domain rather than a specific amino acid sequence.</p>
<p>This type of cellular organization may be common to other bacterial macromolecular complexes to provide important regulatory functions. In this sense, the Frz example provides new perspectives to the role of the bacterial nucleoid as a scaffold for the spatial control of cellular functions.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays were performed with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> purified recombinant proteins. 4 Î¼g of FrzE<sup>kinase</sup> were incubated with 1Î¼g of FrzA and increasing concentrations (3Î¼g) of different FrzCD proteins (entire FrzCD, FrzCD<sup>c</sup>, FrzCDÎ6â130, FrzCDÎ7â27 or FrzCDÎ131â417) in 25 Î¼l of buffer P (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mM DTT; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 50mM KCl; 5 mM EDTA; 50Î¼M ATP, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 200 Î¼Ci ml<sup>-1</sup> (65 nM) of [Î³-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer, 3000 Ci mmol<sup>-1</sup>) for 10 minutes at room temperature in order to obtain the optimal FrzE<sup>kinase</sup> autophosphorylation activity. Each reaction mixture was stopped by addition of 5 Ã Laemmli and quickly loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were revealed using Coomassie Brilliant Blue before gel drying. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using direct exposure to film (Carestream).</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis</title>
<p>For fluorescence microscopy analyses, 5 Î¼l of cells from 4 x 10<sup>8</sup> cfu ml<sup>-1</sup> vegetative CYE cultures were spotted on a thin fresh TPM agar pad at the top of a slide (Mignot <italic>et al</italic>., 2005). A cover slip was added immediately on the top of the pad, and the obtained slide was analyzed by microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 E PFS inverted epifluorescence microscope (100 x oil objective NA 1.3 Phase Contrast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>To study the colocalization with the DNA, the TPM agar pads were supplied with 1Î¼g/ml DAPI stain and 1 mM IPTG. Prior to imaging, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells were grown in 1 mM IPTG for one hour, then spotted on agar pads containing or not 10Î¼g/ml cephalexin and incubated for 1 hour. Cell fluorescence profiles were obtained with the âplot profileâ function of FIJI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref045">45</xref>]. FrzCD cluster numbers and distances, nucleoid areas and cell areas were automatically determined and verified manually with the âMicrobeJâ Fiji/ImageJ plugin created by A. Ducret, Brun Lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indiana.edu/~microbej/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.indiana.edu/~microbej/index.html</ext-link>). All data plots and statistical tests were obtained with the R software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To study the dynamics of FrzCD-GFP clusters we automatically tracked clusters (imaged every second) by MicrobeJ and recorded parameters such as the mean square displacement (MSD), the confinement radius and the fluorescence intensity along the time.</p>
<p>For manual image analysis we chose a sample size that allowed an error on the mean (sem) lower than 10%. For results generated by automated analyses, we analyzed all the available samples. We chose all cells where clusters and nucleoids were tractable by our image analysis tools (Fiji and MicrobeJ). For the cluster dynamic determinations we analyzed all clusters that were tractable for at least 5 consecutive frames.</p>

<title>Reversal frequencies</title>
<p>These assays were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref025">25</xref>] by using homemade PDMS glass microfluidic chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref046">46</xref>] treated with 0.015% carboxymethylcellulose after extensive washing of the glass slide with water. For each experiment, 1mL of a CYE grown culture of OD = 0.5 was injected directly into the chamber and the cells were allowed to settle for 5 min. Motility was assayed after the chamber was washed with TPM 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer. For IAA injections, IAA solutions made in TPM 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer at appropriate concentrations were injected directly into the channels and motility was assayed directly under the microscope. Time-lapse movies of strains carrying a FrzS-YFP fusion were shot for 20 minutes with frames captured every 15 seconds.</p>
<p>To discriminate bona fide reversal events from stick-slip motions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref025">25</xref>], the fluorescence intensity of FrzS-YFP was measured at cell poles over time. In fact, this protein has been shown to switch from the leading cell pole to the lagging pole when <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> cells reverse their movement direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007103.ref047">47</xref>]. For each cell that was tracked, the fluorescence intensity and reversal profiles were correlated to distinguish bona fide reversals from stick-slip events. About one hundred cells for the wild type and <italic>frzCD</italic><sup><italic>Î1â130</italic></sup> strains and fifty for the <italic>ÎfrzCD</italic> strain were analyzed (refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007103.s010">S3 Table</xref> for the exact number of cells analyzed for each strain and IAA dose). The number of reversals was plotted against time. The best fits for the reversal frequencies values at the different IAA doses were obtained with the following Hill equation:
