<abstract>
<p>The transition from vegetative growth to multicellular development represents an evolutionary hallmark linked to an oxidative stress signal and controlled protein degradation. We identified the Sem1 proteasome subunit, which connects stress response and cellular differentiation. The <italic>sem1</italic> gene encodes the fungal counterpart of the human Sem1 proteasome lid subunit and is essential for fungal cell differentiation and development. A <italic>sem1</italic> deletion strain of the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> is able to grow vegetatively and expresses an elevated degree of 20S proteasomes with multiplied ATP-independent catalytic activity compared to wildtype. Oxidative stress induces increased transcription of the genes <italic>sem1</italic> and <italic>rpn11</italic> for the proteasomal deubiquitinating enzyme. Sem1 is required for stabilization of the Rpn11 deubiquitinating enzyme, incorporation of the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 into the 19S regulatory particle and efficient 26S proteasome assembly. Sem1 maintains high cellular NADH levels, controls mitochondria integrity during stress and developmental transition.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The cellular ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential to control cell cycle, gene expression or the response to oxidative stress. Sem1 is conserved in eukaryotes from single cell yeasts to humans as intrinsically disordered and multifunctional protein. Sem1 supports the assembly of several multiprotein complexes but becomes eventually exclusively a subunit of the lid of the 26S proteasome, a cellular machine with a molecular mass of about two megadalton. Defects in the function of the proteasome, which degrades a large fraction of intracellular proteins, result in cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. We showed that Sem1 from a multicellular fungus is required for accurate 26S proteasome assembly and specific activity as prerequisites for mitochondria integrity, oxidative stress response and cell differentiation. Our findings of the complex and dynamic interplay between multiple cellular processes mediated by a small conserved intrinsically unordered protein sheds light and supports current efforts to understand and explore in more details potential therapies to eventually treat age-related human diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 26S proteasome represents the major cytoplasmic and nuclear ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation machinery and is composed of a barrel-like 2.5 MDa 20S proteolytic core particle (CP) capped with one or two 19S regulatory particles (RP). Proteins destined for degradation are unfolded, de-ubiquitinated and translocated by the RP to the CP where proteolytic activity takes place. Each regulatory particle consists of a lid and a base. The lid is composed of a nine-subunit protein composed of six PCI (<underline>P</underline>roteasome/<underline>C</underline>OP9/<underline>I</underline>nitiation factor) domain proteins (Rpn3, 5, 7, 9, 12), two MPN (<underline>M</underline>pr1p and <underline>P</underline>ad1p <underline>N</underline>-terminal) domain proteins (Rpn 8, 11) and the Sem1 (<underline>S</underline>uppressor of <underline>E</underline>xocytosis <underline>M</underline>utation 1) / Dss1 (<underline>d</underline>eletion of <underline>s</underline>plit hand/<underline>s</underline>plit foot 1) protein. Sem1 was originally identified in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in genetic suppression studies of the exocyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref001">1</xref>]. It is a multifunctional and intrinsically disordered protein, associating with several functionally diverse protein complexes where it is also supporting assembly without being a subunit of the final active complex itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref002">2</xref>]. This includes the human BRCA2 complex (breast cancer complex) required for homologous recombination, the TREX2 complex (transcription export complex 2) needed for mRNA elongation and nuclear export, or the yeast Csn12-Thp3 complex involved in RNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Deletion of the Sem1 encoding gene in yeasts resulted in viable cells with phenotypes including temperature sensitivity, enhanced filamentation and cell cycle delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref003">3</xref>]. Dss1 represents the human homolog and was able to rescue the growth defect of both <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> mutant strains, suggesting a conserved molecular function from yeast to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Sem1 in multicellular metazoans is difficult to address, as deletion of the corresponding gene in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> revealed essential functions in oogenesis resulting in embryonic lethality and larval arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref006">6</xref>]. The fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> can be used as model system as it not only grows by forming polar reiterated cellular units but can also differentiate and produce fruiting bodies including specialized cell types, which are surrounded by a tissue of auxiliary cells for nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The function of the fungal Sem1 counterpart was analysed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic>. The encoding gene was named here for convenience <italic>sem1</italic> and corresponds to <italic>semA</italic> according to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> nomenclature. Fungal Sem1 protein is associated with the 19S RP and links an appropriate oxidative stress response to cellular differentiation and coordinated fungal development. The majority of the proteasomes in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain were 20S core particles, which provides an increased ATP-independent protease activity. The small proportion of cellular <italic>Δsem1</italic> deficient 19S and 26S proteasomes lacked any interaction with the chaperon Ecm29, which facilitates the association of the 19S RP with the 20S CP. The <italic>Δsem1</italic> 19S regulatory particles were also deprived from detectable incorporation of the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10, which facilitates the association of the lid with the base. The cellular redox state in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> is linked to Sem1-dependent transition from vegetative growth to differentiation. Sem1 links increased 26S proteasome stability to mitochondria integrity and is a prerequisite for an appropriate oxidative stress response required for multicellular development.</p>

<title>Sem1 of the multicellular fungus <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> is required for the formation of mature cleistothecia with meiotic ascospores</title>
<p>Sem1 proteins are conserved throughout eukaryotes from fungi to humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The impact of Sem1 on developmental programmes of a multicellular fungus was analysed. Filamentous fungi perform the transition from vegetative growth as hyphae to multicellular development by forming fruiting bodies consisting of tissues with distinct specialized cells. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> exhibits an asexual and a sexual life cycle propagated by spores. Light promotes asexual development and reduces sexual development, whereas darkness and oxygen limitation promote the sexual life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Deletion of the gene encoding fungal Sem1 resulted in a viable <italic>Δsem1</italic> deletion strain, which exhibited a reduced growth rate with a smaller colony size compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The mutant strain accumulated a reddish pigment similar to a fungal strain defective in the COP9 signalosome, required for specific ubiquitination of substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref011">11</xref>]. Conidia are the asexual spores of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> and are formed at conidiophores. Conidia formation, which is normally favoured in light, is delayed in the absence of Sem1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Conidia formation was examined during 6 days of asexual growth. In the absence of Sem1, significant reduction of conidia was observed compared to wildtype and complementation strains. The wildtype and complementation strain produced ≈ 150x10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml after only 2 days, whereas the mutant strain was able to produce less than 1% after 2 days (5000 spores/ml). The number of spores in the mutant strain increased over time, reaching a maximum after 5 days with approximately 64% of the spores produced by wildtype or complementation strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To determine whether the delay in conidiophore formation can explain the reduced conidia in the absence of Sem1, the morphology of conidiophores was examined after 20h, 26h and 48h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). No conidiation was observed in the absence of Sem1 after 20h. After 26h, most of the conidiophores of wildtype and complementation strains showed several lines of conidia, whereas the deletion strain only produced metulae and phialides. After 48h, all strains were able to produce conidiophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A gene encoding endogenously tagged Sem1-GFP complements these developmental phenotypes resulting in a functional gene that can be used to investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> Sem1 localization and interaction partners.</p>

<title>Sem1 is required for the maturation of cleistothecia in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic>.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> The <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain is delayed in formation of green asexual spores on minimal media in light in comparison to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> wildtype strain (<italic>sem1</italic>) or the complementation strain (<italic>Δsem1</italic>::<italic>sem1-gfp</italic>) with a functional Sem1-GFP. <bold>(B)</bold> <italic>Δsem1</italic> grows slower compared to <italic>sem1</italic> or complementation strains. Upper panel- the respective strains were point-inoculated with 10,000 spores and incubated in light for the indicated time points. Lower panel- the colony diameter was plotted. The wildtype grows 1.3±0.03 cm per day and <italic>Δsem1</italic> grows 0.81±0.03 cm per day. Significance of differences was calculated with t-test compared to <italic>sem1</italic>, **p&lt;0.01, n = 4. <bold>(C)</bold> Deletion of <italic>sem1</italic> impairs asexual spore formation. Spores were visible in all strains only after 2 days of asexual growth. Wildtype and complementation produced ≈ 150x10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml, this number remained similar over the time course. Increased conidia were measured in the deletion strain over time, with maxima of ≈ 94x10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml after 5 days of asexual growth (64% compared to wildtype). For the quantification of asexual spore, plates were inoculated with 10,000 spores and harvested at the indicated time points. The values shown are the average ± SD from 2 independent experiments. Significance of differences was calculated with t-test compared to <italic>sem1</italic>, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01. <bold>(D)</bold> <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain shows delayed formation of conidiophores (red circles). All asexual growth impairments were restored in the complementation strain. <bold>(E)</bold> Sem1 is required for maturation of sexual fruiting bodies (cleistothecia) in darkness. <bold>(F)</bold> <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain is block in early sexual development and develop only Hülle cells and primordia (p) after 10 days of sexual growth.

<p>Growth of the deletion strain was examined in the dark, which promotes the formation of sexual fruiting bodies named cleistothecia, containing meiotic ascospores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1E and 1G</xref>). Cleistothecia maturation includes the formation of hyphal nests and primordia of fruiting bodies, a development that requires one week for wildtype or the <italic>sem1-gfp</italic> complemented strain. In contrast, the <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain showed after one week mostly white air mycelium and only nests with primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Cleistothecia from wildtype and complementation strains contained meiotic ascospores, which were able to germinate, suggesting the ascospores are viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, squeezed panel). Cultivation of <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain for 10 days still resulted in only white air mycelium and nests with primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, 10 days panel). Even after 10 days, cleistothecia from <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain contained only an empty cleistothecia-envelop without any ascospores, indicating a specific blockage in sexual fruiting body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, squeezed panel). The average size of these empty cleistothecia-envelops was 5850±823 μm<sup>2</sup>.

<p>Cellular proteasomes with functional Sem1 comprise approximately half of the proteasomes as composed particles, ranging from 45% for Sem1 to 59% for Sem1-GFP. This includes 18% and 41% double-capped proteasomes for wildtype and Sem1-GFP complemented strain, respectively. Single capped proteasomes vary between 18% for the complemented and 27% for the wildtype strain in the analysed fungal extracts.</p>
<p>The ratio between assembled 26S and 20S proteasomes was significantly shifted within <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain, which comprised only 6% composite proteasomes including only 2% double-capped proteasomes. Accordingly, the <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain produced primarily 20S proteasome complexes (94%), whereas the 20S proteasome complexes of wildtype (55%) and Sem1-GFP complementation (41%) strains represent approximately half of the total cell extract derived proteasome fraction.</p>
<p>This increase in the percentage of 20S proteasomes from 50% to more than 90% of the total cellular proteasomes corroborates that Sem1 is required for an efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly of 26S proteasomes and that Sem1-GFP can fulfil this function. The function of Sem1 might either be to accelerate the assembly or to stabilize functional 26S proteasomes or a combination of both. 20S CP might represent, even in the presence of Sem1, a substantial part of the cellular proteasome complexes during vegetative growth of the fungus.</p>

<p>Activities of purified proteasomes were measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of a fluorogenic peptide in the presence of ATP and KCl. <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain proteasomes showed 2.3 time higher rates of peptidase activities compared to the wildtype strain in the presence of ATP and KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, blue curves). Proteasome specificity was further demonstrated by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which inhibited these peptidase activities almost completely to 3% or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, green curves).</p>
<p>The overall proteasome activities in the presence of ATP were compared to the basal ATP-independent peptidase activities derived primarily from 20S CP in the absence of ATP and potassium ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, red curves). These ATP-independent peptidase activities were lower than the overall activities of proteasomes in all strains, as the absence of ATP and potassium ions retard spontaneous activation of the 20S core particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref012">12</xref>]. In the presence of Sem1, the ATP-independent overall peptidase activity was 26% compared to ATP-dependent activity. This value increased to 75% in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> proteasome fraction. The ratio of 26S/20S peptidase activity in the wildtype and complementation strain was 3.8 times and 2.7 times higher, respectively, indicating that 26S proteasomes are more active than the 20S proteasomes. This ratio of peptidase activity was only 1.3 in <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain, indicating similar peptidase activities in <italic>Δsem1</italic> regardless to the presence or absence of ATP and 19S RP. These data further support the finding of the electron microscopy analysis that Sem1 is required for the efficient assembly of functional 26S proteasomes.

<p>Sem1-dependent transcription of six genes providing cellular ubiquitin was examined to analyse whether Sem1 affects cellular ubiquitin homeostasis. The <italic>ubi1</italic> gene encodes a protein where ubiquitin is fused to the small ribosome subunit; thereby synthesis of fusion protein will yield ribosomal protein and ubiquitin. The <italic>ubi4</italic> gene product contains four head to tail repeats of ubiquitin and supplies monoubiquitin to the cell. RT-PCR revealed that the transcription levels of both <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis genes of ubiquitin were similar in <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The genes <italic>doa4</italic>, <italic>ubp6</italic> and <italic>ubp14</italic> encode deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which recycle polyubiquitin chains. The <italic>rfu1</italic> gene encodes an inhibitor of Doa4 and balances the amount of monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref013">13</xref>]. Transcript levels of these four genes involved in recycling of polyubiquitin were comparable in strains with or without functional Sem1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These data suggest that cellular ubiquitin synthesis and recycling functions were independent of Sem1.</p>
<p>A possible function of Sem1 on the ubiquitination pathway was analysed. The last step of the ubiquitination cascade is the attachment of ubiquitin to target substrates by neddylated E3 ubiquitin cullin RING ligases (CRLs). CRLs are under the control of the COP9 signalosome and its deneddylase Csn5/CsnE. COP9 is required for sexual fungal development and physically interacts with Den1/DenA, a second conserved deneddylase, which promotes asexual development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref016">16</xref>]. The <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain showed reduced amounts of neddylated (65%) and unneddylated Cul1/CulA (40%) compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The majority of the CulA proteins were in their unneddylated and inactive form. RT-PCRs revealed that the expression levels of <italic>csnE</italic>, <italic>culC</italic> or <italic>culD</italic> genes were decreased in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain compared to wildtype, whereas <italic>denA</italic> transcripts were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). This could be due to Sem1’s chaperon functions for the assembly of various protein complexes involved in transcription, RNA splicing or nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Reduced levels of neddylated cullins and subsequently a limited ubiquitin conjugation of substrates in the absence of Sem1 suggest an important function of Sem1 in the ubiquitination pathway of target proteins due to its impact on transcription and on proteasome assembly and function.</p>

<title>Sem1 increases the stability of the intrinsic lid deubiquitinating enzyme Rpn11</title>
<p>Accelerated proteolysis due to increased numbers of proteasomes can cause decreased levels of ubiquitin conjugates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref018">18</xref>]. Transcript levels of genes encoding proteasomal subunits or ubiquitin receptors were compared between strains with or without Sem1 to examine whether increased transcription contributes to decreased ubiquitination observed in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s002">S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>rpn3</italic> transcription of wildtype cells was significantly higher than in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain, where transcription was reduced. The <italic>rpn3</italic> gene encodes a protein which is tethered by Sem1 to the proteasome lid during biogenesis and interacts in the mature lid with Rpn7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref019">19</xref>]. The reduced transcription of rpn3 transcripts suggest limited incorporation of Rpn3 protein into the 26S proteasome.</p>
<p>The <italic>rpn10</italic> gene encodes one of the intrinsic ubiquitin receptors of the proteasome and is located at the interface of the regulatory particle between the base and the lid. Expression of <italic>rpn10</italic> as well as of other <italic>rpn</italic> transcripts for the lid subunits were similar in strains with or without Sem1, except for <italic>rpn11</italic> mRNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s002">S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The transcription level of <italic>rpn11</italic> encoding the intrinsic ubiquitin isopeptidase of the 26S proteasome was doubled in the mutant strain compared to wildtype. Controlled <italic>rpn11</italic> expression using an inducible <sup><italic>P</italic></sup><italic>TetOn</italic>-<italic>rpn11</italic> fusion gene was applied to examine whether increased amounts of <italic>rpn11</italic> transcripts result in higher deubiquitinase activity and reduce the overall population of ubiquitinated proteins. The <sup><italic>P</italic></sup><italic>TetOn</italic>-<italic>rpn11</italic> strain was only able to grow in the presence of a threshold concentration of at least 5μg/ml doxycycline, indicating that Rpn11 is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Eight-fold increase in the transcription of <italic>rpn11</italic> did not affect the expression of the control genes <italic>sem1</italic> or <italic>csn5</italic>, but led to an overall decrease in ub-conjugated proteins compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s003">S3B and S3C</xref> Fig). This supports that significantly increased Rpn11 isopeptidase activity can contribute to the reduction in ubiquitin conjugates as observed in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Cellular Rpn11 protein levels for the deubiquitinating enzyme were compared to ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 levels in cells with or without Sem1. The genes encoding Rpn11 or Rpn10 were replaced by functional Rpn-GFP fusions. Rpn10-GFP derived from <italic>Δsem1</italic> or wildtype strain resulted in stable Rpn10 protein levels. In contrast, Rpn11-GFP was instable and resulted in only 35% of full-length protein in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>These data imply a possible effect of Sem1 on the transcription of specific proteasomal genes. Increased <italic>rpn11</italic> transcripts result in less full-length Rpn11 protein in a <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain lacking the conserved zinc–binding site in the MPN+ domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s003">S3D Fig</xref>), suggesting that Sem1 supports cellular Rpn11 stability. Reduced amounts of an intact 26S proteasomes observed by electron microscopy correlate with the reduced Rpn11 protein levels in <italic>Δsem1</italic>. Incorporation of the deubiquitination enzyme into the 26S proteasomes presumably provides a Sem1-mediated Rpn11 stabilization in fungal wildtype cells.</p>

Rpn5 inhibits the Rpn11 deubiquitinase and the increased intensities of Rpn5 might reflect its importance to reduce false DUB activity.

<p>Neither the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 nor the tethering protein Ecm29 could be identified with any of the <italic>rpn</italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> strains when Sem1 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Consistently, in the absence of Sem1, Rpn10-GFP failed to pull any of the base and lid related proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<title>Sem1 interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 and the intrinsic lid deubiquitinating enzyme Rpn11</title>
<p>The domain architecture of the lid of the proteasome is conserved in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain possesses a lid where the Rpn10 ubiquitin receptor is missing and the Rpn11 deubiquitinase protein levels are reduced, although <italic>rpn11</italic> transcript levels are increased. This suggests that Sem1 supports the assembly of stable functional capped 26S proteasomes by a molecular mechanism, which includes the physical interaction between Sem1 and Rpn10 to assemble lid to base and that Sem1 protects Rpn11 protein integrity, which is required for the specific ATP/ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteasome activity.</p>

<p>Bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies (BiFC) were performed to determine whether Sem1 interaction with Rpn10 and Rpn11 can be monitored in fungal cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Fungal strains expressing functional Sem1 fused through its C-terminus to the C-terminal half of YFP and C-terminal Rpn10 and Rpn11 fusions to the N-terminal half of YFP were examined (strains <italic>sem1-yfp</italic><sub>c</sub><italic>+rpn10-yfp</italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>sem1-yfp</italic><sub>c</sub><italic>+rpn11-yfp</italic><sub>n</sub>, respectively). The fluorescence observed in strains containing fused Sem1-Rpn10 and fused Sem1-Rpn11 was significantly higher compared to the respective control strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g006">Fig 6B</xref> right panel). These cellular interactions of Sem1 could be due to an escorting of these proteins for lid assembly.</p>
<p>A homology model of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> 19RP based on the cryoEM structure of human proteasome was generated (EMDB-4002, PDBs: 5L4K and 5L46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref026">26</xref>]) to examine the possibility of interactions between Sem1-Rpn10 and/or Sem1-Rpn11 upon assembly of the lid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The modeled C-terminal fragment of Sem1 is bound in a structurally conserved cleft between the lid subunits Rpn3 and Rpn7. This structural conservation results in a very similar binding mode of Sem1 observed for yeast and human proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In that binding mode, the extension of Sem1 towards the N-terminus reaches to the other side of the lid (opposite) due to an opening in the center of the lid. The missing (not modeled) N-terminal tail, comprising approximately 30 amino acids, could be responsible for direct interactions of Sem1 with both Rpn10 and Rpn11 forming the opposite surface of the lid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>These data corroborate direct interactions between Sem1-Rpn10 as well as Sem1-Rpn11 in the fungal cell. Sem1 might escort Rpn10 and Rpn11 proteins to the lid and support the assembly and positioning of both proteins into a stable capped 26S proteasome through the assistance of its flexible N-terminal tail.</p>

<p>In contrast to wildtype, the 19S regulatory particle lacking Sem1 associated to proteins related to NADH or ATP production (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g007">7A</xref>). The dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase Pdh1 (AN6708) is part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Cytoplasmic Pcy1 (AN4462) converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Both enzyme products are used by the mitochondrial TCA cycle. The Sem1-interacting protein Rpn3 associated only in the absence of Sem1 with the ADP/ATP carrier Pet9 (AN4064) of the mitochondrial inner membrane, which exchanges cytosolic ADP for mitochondrial synthesized ATP. Rpn3, Rpn5 or Rpn10 interacted in the absence of Sem1 with the mitochondrial porin Por1 (AN4402). This outer membrane protein is required for maintenance of mitochondrial osmotic stability and membrane permeability. The 19S RP without Sem1 associates with the β-subunit of the mitochondrial processing protease Mpp (AN0747), which cleaves the N-terminal targeting sequence from mitochondrial-imported proteins. Subunit II of complex III (AN8373) and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex I (AN4288) are two components of the mitochondrial inner membrane electron transport chain which interact with RPs without Sem1. These findings suggest a specific physical interaction of RP subunits in the absence of Sem1 with mitochondria, which is not found when Sem1 is present.</p>

<p>The morphology of the mitochondria in <italic>Δsem1</italic> and wildtype strains were compared to examine the impact of the association of lid subunits with the TCA cycle and respiratory chain related proteins, which were exclusively found in the absence of Sem1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<p>The total cellular NADH production was determined in <italic>Δsem1</italic> and compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).

Deleting <italic>sem1</italic> resulted in only 26% of NADH compared to wildtype (13.84±3.7 ΔOD<sub>460nm</sub>/g mycelium).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The conserved Sem1 protein supports the assembly of multiple cellular complexes and represents the ninth <italic>bona fide</italic> subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. A novel cellular function was detected, which connects the proteasome function and the cellular redox state at the molecular level. Oxidative imbalances in the multicellular ascomycete <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> resulted not only in increased transcription of genes for detoxification enzymes such as catalases, but also in increased transcription of <italic>sem1</italic> and <italic>rpn11</italic> encoding the proteasomal deubiquitinating enzyme. Sufficient amounts of Sem1 and Rpn11 proteins are necessary during oxidative stress to provide higher amounts of correctly assembled 26S proteasomes. A lack of Sem1 resulted in increased oxidation-driven 20S proteasomes and instable capped proteasomes lacking the Rpn10 ubiquitin receptor, a functional Rpn11 deubiquitinating enzyme and the chaperone Ecm29 that connects the CP to the RP. Decreased amounts of Sem1 compromise multicellular fungal development, which requires internal reactive oxygen signals as triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007141.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Sem1 links cellular redox state, mitochondria integrity, efficient assembly of several complexes including the 26S proteasome to multicellular differentiation. Oxidative stress induces the oxidative stress response. Multicellular development requires an internal reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a signal as well as protection against oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced transcription of genes for proteasome subunits <italic>sem1</italic> and <italic>rpn11</italic> (indicated with +). Capped proteasomes, which can be formed in the presence or absence of Sem1, differ in composition and quantity. Sufficient amounts of Sem1 and Rpn11 are required during oxidative stress to provide correctly assembled 26S proteasomes including the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10, the tethering factor Ecm29 and stabilized full-length deubiquitinating enzyme Rpn11. Consequently, these stable capped 26S proteasomes are fully functional and can selectively catalyse ubiquitinated proteins (indicated as diamonds) in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent manner. Decreased amounts of Sem1 result in damaged mitochondria, unstable capped 26S proteasomes and increased levels of activated oxidation-driven 20S core proteasomes, which can efficiently hydrolyse proteins in an ATP/ubiquitin-independent manner.</p>

<p>Sem1 is required for morphological integrity and functionality of the mitochondria, evident by the structural defects caused by the absence of Sem1. A physiological link between dysfunctional mitochondria due to mistransferred proteins and a proteostatic response had been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref031">31</xref>]. Lack of Sem1 results in a five-fold decrease in cellular NADH production compared to a wildtype strain. Consistently, Sem1 is required to allow fungal vegetative growth in the presence of oxidative-stress inducing compounds such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or menadione. An appropriate oxidative stress response therefore includes in a wildtype fungus not only increased transcription of genes for detoxificating enzymes such as <italic>catA</italic> or <italic>sodB</italic> genes, but also increased transcripts for subunits of the 19S RP of the proteasome such as <italic>sem1</italic> or <italic>rpn11</italic>. This corroborates that increased protein levels for these subunits are part of the cellular answer to stress. Mutant strains without Sem1 protein are hypersensitive towards stress, although they constitutively induce transcription of genes for detoxification enzymes. The Sem1-dependent stress response is linked to coordinated fungal secondary metabolism. This link is reminiscent to genetic studies with mutant strains defective in COP9 signalosome or CAND proteins, which control the activity of cullin E3 ubiquitin ligases. Impaired function of COP9 signalosome, CAND or Sem1 results in a redox imbalance and in accumulation of red orcinol derived secondary metabolites visible in the fungal colony as red dye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Multicellular development specifically requires protection against oxidative stress, as internal cellular stress signals are required for the progression of differentiation. This includes transient increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) for developmental programmes in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref032">32</xref>] or fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref030">30</xref>]. In fungi, increased ROS production interferes with hyphal fusion as one of the initial steps from vegetative hyphal growth to multicellular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref033">33</xref>]. In humans, increased ROS production is associated with mitochondria disorders, aging or neurodegenerative diseases, where unfolding of oxidized proteins promotes accumulation of protein aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Sem1 of the unicellular yeast had been proposed to stabilize the interactions between the lid and the base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref036">36</xref>]. In multicellular <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic>, Sem1 is not only required for correct 26S assembly, but represents a lid subunit which is mandatory for 26S proteasome composition, stability and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref038">38</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> can form a lid without Sem1, as it had been described for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, where a comparison between wildtype and <italic>Δsem1</italic> lids by single particle cryo-EM analyses revealed significant structural differences with rearrangements of Rpn3 and Rpn7 in the <italic>Δsem1</italic> lid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref039">39</xref>]. Sem1-dependent functions on assembly and stabilization of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> 26S proteasome were visualized by negative staining electron microscopy, where <italic>Δsem1</italic>-deficient proteasomes from mutant strains consist mostly of 20S proteasomes with only low abundance of 26S proteasome complexes. Sem1 fulfils its stabilization function by the recruitment of Rpn10, which is mandatory to stabilize the interaction between lid and base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref021">21</xref>]. In addition to the incorporation of Rpn10, Sem1 is required for the recruitment of Ecm29 as facilitator, which associates the 19S regulatory particle to the 20S core particle. Direct interactions between Sem1 and the base were not reported, but Rpn10 makes extensive connections with different lid and base subunits, namely the Rpn11/Rpn8 heterodimer, Rpn9 and Rpn12 or the base subunits Rpn1 and the Rpt4/Rpt5 heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref043">43</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> Rpn10 is a stable protein, which is unable to associate with any lid or base subunit without Sem1. The molecular function of Sem1 could be to escort Rpn10 to the lid and to stabilize it during the assembly. The homology model of the 19S regulatory particle of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> positions the C- terminal fragment of Sem1 between Rpn3 and Rpn7 and the last modeled N-terminal residue of Sem1 in the cleft formed by Rpn3. This cleft is located in a close proximity to an opening in the centre of the lid, which could be a structural feature allowing the N-terminal tail of Sem1 to pass through and interact with Rpn10 and Rpn11. Thereby, it is conceivable that this cleft accommodates the N-terminal tail of Sem1 and stabilizes the interaction of Rpn10 and Rpn11 within the lid. This is in agreement with recent cross-linking experiments between the N-terminal part of Sem1 and C-terminal part of Rpn11 in the fully assembled lid but not in LP2 (lid particle 2), the lid intermediated consisting all eight lid subunits except of Rpn12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref044">44</xref>]. A cross-linking between Sem1 and Rpn10 was not yet described. Modelling the corresponding regions of Sem1 from human or <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> into the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> model leads to similar results. The <italic>in vivo</italic> BiFC study show direct physical interaction between Sem1 and Rpn10 and supports an escorting and assembly function of Sem1 for Rpn10 prior and during 26S proteasome assembly. Conclusively, the data suggests that the presence of Sem1 is a prerequisite to Rpn10 and is essential for accurate and efficient assembly of a stable capped 26S proteasome.</p>
<p>Oxidation drives 26S disassociation presumably by posttranslational modifications of α5, α6, α7 rings of the 20S CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref046">46</xref>]. It was demonstrated that S-glutathionylation through redox-regulation promotes gate opening of the 20S CP, which is otherwise closed unless 19S RP is bound to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref047">47</xref>]. Cellular proteolysis of the oxidation-driven 20S proteasomes derived from the <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain impaired in redox regulation resulted in higher degradation rates compared to the wildytype 20S proteasomes. As ATP/ubiquitin-independent degradation requires 20S proteasome complexes but no ATP and no polyubiquitinated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref048">48</xref>], this presumably allows the <italic>Δsem1</italic> strain to maintain efficient degradation. In the mutant strain the 20S proteasomes are kinetically favoured regardless of the absence of 19S RP or ATP. The <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain produces less NADH, which potentially reduces oxidative respiration and ATP production.</p>
<p>Mutant analysis revealed that the presence of the sem1 gene correlated with increased ubiquitin-conjugates and reduced ATP/ubiquitin-independent degradation in comparison to the mutant strain lacking sem1. A ubiquitin receptor function has been described for the human counterpart Dss1 with a ubiquitin binding site overlapping the Rpn3-Rpn7 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref049">49</xref>]. This suggests that Sem1 can associate with the proteasome leaving the two acidic patches available for ubiquitinated substrates and/or can even dynamically associate with the proteasome to escort ubiquitinated substrates to the proximity of proteasomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref002">2</xref>]. The observed decreased levels of ubiquitinated substrates in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> mutant strain lacking <italic>sem1</italic> could be related to CRLs and the attachment of ubiquitin to substrates. In yeast, the deletion of Sem1 resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates presumably due to non-functional proteasomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref003">3</xref>]. Decreased cellular levels of ubiquitin-conjugates were also observed in mammalian epithelial cells exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> as a consequence of the oxidation of cysteine residues in the active sites of E1-E3 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007141.ref052">52</xref>]. In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic>, oxidative stress not only reduces the amount of the E3 Cul1 scaffold subunit, but also influenced the transcription of <italic>culC</italic> for Cul3, <italic>culD</italic> for Cul4 and <italic>csnE</italic> for the COP9 signalosome subunit Csn5. This suggests that ubiquitinated proteins are regulated in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> in response to oxidative stress where ATP/ubiquitin-independent degradation takes place.</p>
<p>Sem1 represents a novel molecular link between proteasome assembly and specificity, mitochondrial integrity and cellular development. The viable <italic>Δsem1</italic> mutant strain from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> is a valuable tool to investigate ATP/ubiquitin-independent proteolysis to elucidate the cross talk between cullins, COP9 signalosome and proteasome in response to oxidative stress. Understanding Sem1 function during mitochondrial stress will provide new insights for our understanding of mitochondrial-associated pathogenesis. Increased Sem1 activity might delay mitochondria dysfunction and can be used for further therapies. Elucidating the mechanisms by which Sem1 affects and regulates oxidative stress is beneficial in the efforts to understand and treat age-related human diseases and explore potential therapies.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007141.s007">S1 File</xref>-supporting information). The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans sem1</italic> gene corresponds to <italic>semA</italic> in the fungal nomenclature. Spore concentration was determined by Z2 Coulter particle count and size analyser (Beckmann counter). Vegetative growth was performed in flasks with indentations containing supplemented liquid media and 5x10<sup>5</sup> spores/ml at 37°C for 20 hours. For asexual and sexual development 10 μl of 10000 spores/ml were spotted on supplemented MM and incubated at 37°C. For the time point experiment, asexual spores were counted with Thoma chamber. Incubating the plates in constant white light triggered asexual sporulation, whereas sexual fruiting body formation was induced by oxygen limitation (the plates were sealed) and darkness. Asexual spores were counted using Thoma chamber. For sexual growth, 100 μl of 1x10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml were spared on supplemented MM and incubated at 37°C and incubated in the dark with limited oxygen for 7 and 10 days.</p>
