<abstract>
<p>Integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes into cellular chromatin is common in HPV-associated cancers. Integration is random, and each site is unique depending on how and where the virus integrates. We recently showed that tandemly integrated HPV16 could result in the formation of a super-enhancer-like element that drives transcription of the viral oncogenes. Here, we characterize the chromatin landscape and genomic architecture of this integration locus to elucidate the mechanisms that promoted <italic>de novo</italic> super-enhancer formation. Using next-generation sequencing and molecular combing/fiber-FISH, we show that ~26 copies of HPV16 are integrated into an intergenic region of chromosome 2p23.2, interspersed with 25 kb of amplified, flanking cellular DNA. This interspersed, co-amplified viral-host pattern is frequent in HPV-associated cancers and here we designate it as Type III integration. An abundant viral-cellular fusion transcript encoding the viral <italic>E6/E7</italic> oncogenes is expressed from the integration locus and the chromatin encompassing both the viral enhancer and a region in the adjacent amplified cellular sequences is strongly enriched in the super-enhancer markers H3K27ac and Brd4. Notably, the peak in the amplified cellular sequence corresponds to an epithelial-cell-type specific enhancer. Thus, HPV16 integration generated a super-enhancer-like element composed of tandem interspersed copies of the viral upstream regulatory region and a cellular enhancer, to drive high levels of oncogene expression.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for ~5% human cancers. A key event in the development of many of these cancers is integration of the viral genome into host chromatin. Integration results in dysregulated expression of the viral oncogenes, which promotes unregulated cellular division and the accumulation of cellular mutations, ultimately leading to cancer. Genetic rearrangement and/or amplification of cellular sequences flanking sites of integration are frequent in HPV positive tumors, and this can influence transcription of the viral oncogenes from integrated loci. We show an example where the HPV16 genome integrated adjacent to a cellular, tissue-specific enhancer and subsequently the viral DNA and flanking cellular sequences were co-amplified into a tandemly interspersed viral-cellular sequence array. The genetic and epigenetic signature of this site promoted the formation of a <italic>de novo</italic> super-enhancer-like element to drive high viral oncogene expression. This provides insight into the genesis of super-enhancer-like elements and is a novel mechanism by which HPV integration can promote oncogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High oncogenic-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agent responsible for virtually all cervical cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref001">1</xref>], and a growing number of other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref002">2</xref>]. During the normal viral life cycle, HPVs are maintained as extrachromosomal elements within the cell nucleus. However, during persistent infection with oncogenic HPVs the viral genome can become accidently integrated into the host chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref003">3</xref>]; this is a key event in many HPV-associated cancers. For the most part, HPV integration sites are randomly distributed throughout the host genome but preferentially associate with common fragile sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref005">5</xref>] and transcriptionally active regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref007">7</xref>]. The viral genome is usually found integrated as either a single copy or multiple, tandem, head-to-tail repeats at a single locus within the host genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, there are often associated focal amplifications and rearrangements of the surrounding cellular flanking sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref012">12</xref>]. These features result in a range of integration sites that are unique in terms of their genetic/epigenetic composition and transcriptional potential.</p>
<p>There are several mechanisms through which HPV integration can promote oncogenesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref013">13</xref>]). Often there is disruption of the viral <italic>E2</italic> gene, which eliminates its repressive function over the <italic>E6/E7</italic> oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref003">3</xref>]. Dysregulation of E6/E7 expression promotes cellular proliferation, abolishes cell cycle checkpoints and induces progressive genetic instability at the integrated locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref014">14</xref>]. Insertional breakpoints can also occur within the <italic>E1</italic> gene, eliminating downstream E2 function and the growth suppressive properties of the E1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, upon integration, the viral <italic>E6/E7</italic> oncogenes are expressed from the early viral promoter as a viral-host fusion transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref018">18</xref>]. Such fusion transcripts have increased stability, resulting in increased <italic>E6/E7</italic> oncogene expression compared to that expressed from extrachromosomal HPV genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. Less frequently, HPV integration occurs within host cancer-associated gene loci or pathways and modifies target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref021">21</xref>], which can further support neoplastic progression.</p>
<p>We have recently demonstrated that tandemly integrated HPV16 in the cervical-derived cell line 20861 can form a Brd4-dependent super-enhancer-like element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>]; this is a novel mechanism that drives viral oncogene expression from the integrated locus. Super-enhancers are large clusters of enhancer elements that are highly occupied by the transcriptional machinery and often develop to drive oncogene expression in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref026">26</xref>]. Treatment of 20861 cells with BET-inhibitors disrupts Brd4 binding to this <italic>de novo</italic> super-enhancer, resulting in downregulation of <italic>E6/E7</italic> and induction of cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In this follow up study, we have characterized the genomic architecture of the integration site in 20861 cells to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms operating at this locus. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS), hybrid capture sequencing, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and fiber-FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), we show that the HPV16 genome is integrated into an intergenic region in chromosome 2 and both the viral genome and approximately 25 kb of flanking cellular DNA are amplified to about 26 copies. The combination of the viral upstream regulatory region (URR) and a basal cellular enhancer in the flanking cellular sequence results in strong enrichment of super-enhancer markers at the integration locus and high expression of a fusion transcript encoding E6/E7, which is spliced into a cryptic acceptor site in the cellular sequence. This hijacking of a basal cellular enhancer, resulting in the formation of a viral-cellular super-enhancer, is a novel mechanism by which HPV integration can promote neoplasia.</p>

<title>Characterization of the viral integration site in 20861 cells</title>
<p>The original W12 cell line, derived from a cervical intraepithelial lesion, contained mostly extrachromosomally replicating HPV16 genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. However, cells containing integrated HPV16 genomes were found to frequently outgrow the culture and so the Lambert laboratory isolated a series of clones that contained either extrachromosomal or integrated viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. One of these clones, 20861, has been well characterized and is frequently used as a representative cell line with integrated HPV16 DNA, while the 20863 clone contains extrachromosomal genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>]. We have recently shown that viral oncogene expression in 20861 cells is driven by a super-enhancer-like element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we further characterize the HPV16 integration site in 20861 cells in several ways. First, the overall arrangement of the locus was analyzed by Southern blot. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 20861 and 20863 cells. The DNA was digested with either HindIII, which does not cut the HPV16 genome and therefore allows visualization of the supercoiled and relaxed circle forms of the extrachromosomal genome, or with BamHI, which linearizes the viral DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, 20863 showed the expected forms of extrachromosomal DNA. However, the pattern of bands observed in 20861 DNA indicated that there was rearrangement of viral and cellular DNA at the integration locus, as almost no unit length genomes were observed. The observed pattern is virtually identical to the original analysis of the W12 clones determined by Lambert and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. Quantitation of the Southern blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g001">Fig 1A</xref> determined that there were ~24 copies of the integrated viral genome in 20861 cells and ~230 extrachromosomal HPV16 copies in 20863 cells, similar to the copy numbers previously defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<p>To determine the location of the integration site within the cellular genome, we initially used a technique called Amplification of Papillomavirus Oncogene Transcripts (APOT). This technique amplifies sequences derived from polyadenylated RNA consisting of viral E6/E7 sequences spliced to host derived transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref027">27</xref>]. RNA was isolated from 20861 cells and reverse transcribed using an oligo-dT primer. The viral-host fusion transcript was amplified from the cDNA by PCR using forward primers from the E6/E7 region and oligo-dT reverse primers, and the resulting PCR products were purified and sequenced. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, this identified a fusion transcript that had spliced into a cryptic acceptor at chr2: 28,595,675 (hg19). The cellular exon spanned nucleotides 28,595,425–28,595,675 and did not align with any annotated genes, or contain an open reading frame (ORF). The size of the fusion transcript was shorter than that observed by Jeon and colleagues using Northern blot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>] and, as we show below, is a minor, shorter RNA species that uses the same viral-host splice sites.</p>

<title>The cellular integration locus is co-amplified with HPV16</title>
<p>To verify the location of the viral integration site, a FISH probe was generated from a cellular BAC clone RP11-1140H22 (chr2: 28,504,596–28,660,966; hg19), which spanned the integration locus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, hybridization of 20861 cells with the cellular genomic DNA BAC probe, along with an HPV16 probe, revealed that both probes colocalized in &gt;70% of cells. As expected, the cellular probe gave rise to two signals in HPV-negative NIKS human keratinocyte control cells. However, the signal that overlapped the HPV16 integration locus in 20861 cells was far stronger. This indicated that cellular sequences flanking the HPV16 integration site had been co-amplified along with the viral genome. In addition, Brd4 colocalized with the 20861 HPV integration site as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>]. To confirm the amplification of cellular sequences flanking the integration site, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the copy number of the sequences flanking the HPV16 integration site relative to the <italic>ACTB</italic> gene. This showed that there were approximately 20 copies of the region flanking the integration site relative to HPV16 in W12 20861 cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s006">S6D Fig</xref>).

<p>To define the amplification at the HPV16 integration site in 20861 cells, 2 x 150 bp paired-end libraries were generated from total genomic DNA and subjected to WGS using the HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina Genome Network). WGS data were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) with ~7X sequencing coverage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007179.t001">Table 1</xref>). This showed a 12 bp deletion at chr2: 28,595,730–28,595,741 that marked the main HPV insertional breakpoints (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The flanking amplified cellular sequence spanned 25.2 kb (chr2: 28,583,052–28,608,216; approximately 12.5 kb either side of the integrated viral genome), and overlapped with 941 bp of exon 2 of the human non-coding RNA AK055918 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The depth of coverage over this region was increased 28-fold along with the integrated HPV16 genome (very similar to the 24–26 copies of viral genome measured by Southern blot analysis and qPCR). We identified a gap in the aligned HPV sequence reads in the WGS analysis of the cell line 20861, within the <italic>E2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

We also observed a minor fraction of sequence reads in 20861 cells that still aligned to these deleted HPV sequences, suggesting that those viral sequences originated from a different, minor integration site (see below, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Hybrid capture sequencing of 20861 integration site</title>
<p>To confirm the precise viral-host junctions, we re-sequenced the viral and viral-host insertional breakpoint sequences in 20861 and 20863 genomic DNA, using custom hybrid capture baits (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>). This much more sensitive approach verified that the major HPV16 insertional breakpoints were at chr2:28,595,730 and at chr2:28,595,741. The viral-host fusion reads confirmed that the viral genome was integrated within the <italic>E2</italic> gene at the position of the deletion (HPV genome nt position 3052–3152). The reads also confirmed the 12 bp deletion at the host insertion site in chr2 (28,595,730–28,595,741).</p>
<p>Additional viral insertional breakpoints were detected in both 20861 and 20863 reads, but these sequences were only supported by a few reads each (out of many millions of reads per sample), suggesting that they were minor integration sites likely representing minor sub-clonal cell populations (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Another explanation for their relatively low counts was that they represented non-specific technical artifacts related to the very sensitive hybrid capture method, PCR amplification of libraries, or deep sequencing of the libraries.</p>

<title>HPV16 genome copies are interspersed with cellular DNA</title>
<p>Integration events can be classified as Type I, in which a single viral genome is found integrated into the host DNA; or Type II, in which multiple tandemly repeated viral genomes are integrated at a single locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. It has been proposed previously that approximately 30 copies of HPV16 are tandemly integrated at a single locus in 20861 cells in what was presumed to be a Type II pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>]. However, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g002">Fig 2</xref> that there is co-amplification of the flanking cellular sequences to a copy number similar to that of the integrated HPV16 genome. To further determine the organization of the integration site, we performed molecular combing/fiber-FISH to detect HPV16 genomes on stretched, individual DNA molecules. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g003">Fig 3</xref>, measurement of linear fluorescent signals showed that the HPV16 genome was repeated in tandem units with interspersing cellular DNA of about 27 kb, in good agreement with the 25.2 kb amplified region measured by sequencing. We have designated this integration pattern of interspersed viral and host DNA as a Type III integration event, to distinguish it from Type II events in which no intervening host sequence is present. Analysis of 75 independent DNA fibers containing the Type III 20861 integration site showed that up to 28 copies of interspersed viral DNA could be detected on a single fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Given the low probability of combing a complete integration site, the largest repeated number of genomes (28 copies, N = 2) is likely to be the actual size of the site, and is consistent with our genomic sequencing data. The signal length of the integrated HPV16 genome measured on average 7.0 kb ± 1.6 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), whilst the intervening space between the tandemly repeated viral copies measured approximately 27.3 kb ± 9.6 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Discrepancies in unit length measurements across individual fibers can be accounted for by the inherent limit of resolution for this technique, which is about 1 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<p>The unit length of the intervening host sequence closely matched the 25.2 kb amplified cellular region identified from WGS, suggesting that the region flanking the integration site had amplified into a viral-host concatemer. To confirm this, and further validate the location of the integration site within chromosome 2, two-color fiber-FISH was performed on the combed DNA strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref029">29</xref>]. Using DNA probes against HPV16 (red signal), and the amplified region at chr2: 28,583,052–28,608,216 (green signal), we confirmed that the repeating unit was indeed a viral-host concatemer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the major Type III integration event represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g003">Fig 3</xref>, we observed a second integration pattern in 20861 cells that appeared to be a Type II integration event, as it contained tandemly integrated HPV16 genomes without interspersed cellular sequence (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This integration pattern accounted for ~30% of the total number of DNA fibers containing integrated HPV16 compared to the Type III integration event. The location of this integration event is not clear, but it is likely close to the site on chromosome 2 (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>) as there are no other prominent foci apparent by FISH of interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Chromatin profile of the 20861 integration site</title>
<p>We have shown previously that integration of HPV16 in 20861 cells results in the formation of a super-enhancer-like element that drives viral E6/E7 mRNA expression from the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>]. This element was originally detected because of extremely high levels of H3K27ac and binding of MED1 and Brd4 at the HPV integration locus. To address exactly where these super-enhancer markers were binding with respect to the integrated viral genome and flanking cellular sequences, we performed ChIP-seq analysis using antibodies against Brd4 and H3K27ac. Alignment of paired-end reads immunoprecipitated with these antibodies to the human reference genome (hg19) showed strong enrichment of Brd4 and H3K27ac signals adjacent to the integration locus in 20861 cells relative to levels observed in 20863 cells, which do not contain integrated HPV16 at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To address enrichment patterns across the entire integrated locus (viral and cellular sequences) in 20861 cells, we aligned the ChIP-seq reads to our custom reference assembly of the integration locus. This showed very strong enrichment of the super-enhancer markers across both viral and cellular sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), even after accounting for amplification of this region. Two peaks were observed, one that was centered on the viral URR and another in the cellular flanking sequence about 6 kb upstream.

<title>Enrichment of super-enhancer markers over the viral URR is not observed in other integrated W12 sub-clones</title>
<p>To determine whether there was similar enrichment of the super-enhancer markers at other HPV16 integration sites we examined in detail two additional W12 clones, 20831 and 20862. We generated and analyzed WGS data at comparable depths of sequencing coverage for these additional clones (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007179.t001">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These clones were originally reported to contain approximately 60 copies of tandemly integrated HPV16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>], however WGS and qPCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007179.t001">Table 1</xref>) indicated a lower copy number, suggesting that viral genome copies had been lost over time.</p>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by qPCR showed that strong enrichment of super-enhancer markers over the viral URR was not observed in 20831 and 20862 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g006">Fig 6</xref>), and, unlike in 20861 cells, the prominent nuclear BRD4 focus was not characteristic of these cells by immunofluorescence (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We propose that super-enhancer function is likely dependent on the genetic and epigenetic architecture of the locus. The 20831 and 20862 cells were also subjected to RNA-seq and ChIP-seq with Brd4 and H3K27ac antibodies. This revealed that in both cell lines the virus was integrated at HPV16:3740-chr3:189,662,800, indicating that this integration event likely occurred prior to the isolation of individual clones. This is consistent with the studies of Jeon and Lambert that indicated that these clones had very similar properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>]. This Type III integration site was not present in the 20861 or 20863 cells, however (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Additional integration breakpoints were undetectable in 20831 and 20862 cells through WGS. Unlike 20861 and 20863 cells, these clones were not subjected to hybrid capture.</p>

<p>Fiber-FISH analysis of 20831 and 20862 cells showed that, as with 20861 cells, both cell lines contained Type II and Type III integration patterns (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s005">S5</xref> Figs). This was further substantiated by Southern blot analysis (shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). When digested with a restriction enzyme that cleaves the viral genome once, Type II integration gives a viral genome unit length of ~7.9 kb, while Type III integration results in bands comprised of the viral-host junctional sequences. Quantitation of the Type II and III fragments gives an approximation of the relative proportion of viral copies at each integration site. A combination of Southern blot analysis, WGS and qPCR of viral sequences demonstrated that the 20831 and 20862 cells contained less than the original estimated 60 genome copies. We believe that the copy number of viral genomes at the tandem integration sites is mutable, likely because of recombination events at these loci. A summary of the relative genomic properties of the HPV integration sites in 20861, 20831 and 20862 cells is presented in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s006">S6C Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>In 20831 and 20862 cells, the viral genome was integrated in an intergenic region between the <italic>TP63</italic> and <italic>LEPREL1</italic> genes on chromosome 3, and it appeared that approximately 89 kb of the flanking cellular sequence (chr3: 189,573,774–189,662,800; hg19), which also overlapped with 41.3 kb of the <italic>TP63</italic> gene, had been amplified around 6.6- and 2.5-fold in 20831 and 20862 cells, respectively. RNA-seq identified a viral-cellular fusion transcript of approximately 1.5 kb transcribed from the integration locus in both W12 sub-clones (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), the expression of which was approximately 2.2-fold (20831 cells) and 6.6-fold (20862 cells) lower than the fusion transcript expressed from the 20861 Type III integration site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Alignment of ChIP-seq reads to the sequences flanking the integration sites in 20831 and 20862 cells showed similar levels of Brd4 binding and H3K27ac modification to those observed in the same region of 20861 and 20863 cells, which do not have HPV integrated in this region (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Similarly, there was not a strong enrichment of super-enhancer markers across the integration site in 20831 and 20862 cells when signals were aligned to our custom reference genome (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). It should also be noted that the higher copy number of viral genomes relative to the amplified cellular flanking sequence is the result of additional ChIP-seq signals that originate from the Type II integration sites that also exist in these two sub-clones (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s005">S5</xref> Figs). In conclusion, the formation of an HPV induced super-enhancer at the site of integration is not a universal event.</p>

<p>Notably, the high peak of H3K27ac activity over the amplified cellular sequence at the 20861 HPV integration locus overlapped with an epithelial-specific enhancer identified from ENCODE data (Bernstein Lab, Broad Institute; Farnham and Snyder Labs, Stanford University) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref033">33</xref>], as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g007">Fig 7</xref>.

Furthermore, the ENCODE data also shows this peak to be enriched in H2A.Z, H3K9ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me2 in NHEK (normal human epidermal keratinocytes). This indicates that HPV16 integrated adjacent to, and multimerized, a basal cellular enhancer, which subsequently synergized with the viral URR enhancer to create a super-enhancer-like element in 20861 cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have recently shown that tandem copies of integrated HPV16 DNA formed a super-enhancer-like element that drives expression of the viral oncogenes in the cervical neoplasia derived cell line, 20861 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>]. In this follow-up study, our aim was to characterize the genetic and epigenetic architecture at this integration locus to better understand the mechanisms that led to the formation of a <italic>de novo</italic> super-enhancer.</p>
<p>Early studies of HPV integration had defined the sites of viral integration as either Type I (a single integrated copy), or Type II (tandem head-to-tail repeats of multiple viral genomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. Subsequent studies have shown that the flanking cellular sequences are often co-amplified and rearranged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref012">12</xref>] and so here we designate tandem copies of the HPV genome interspersed with cellular DNA as Type III integrants. WGS of 20861 DNA showed that the viral genome was integrated into chromosome 2 (chr2:28,595,730–28,595,741) and had been amplified about 26-fold along with 25 kb of flanking cellular DNA, forming a Type III viral-host concatemer. This indicates that co-amplification of viral and host DNA occurred after the initial integration event. The initial amplification of virus-host sequences could happen if the viral E1 and E2 replication proteins were still expressed from intact genomes and could initiate DNA synthesis from the integrated viral origin. This could result in onion skin replication and/or rolling circle type replication, which could give rise to viral-host concatamers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref035">35</xref>]. Homologous recombination could result in further multimerization of the integration locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref036">36</xref>]. The Type III viral-host concatemer in 20861 cells was further confirmed using fiber-FISH analysis of the integration site with DNA probes against HPV16 and the amplified cellular flanking sequence. This powerful technique allowed us to verify and visualize the repeating tandem units of viral DNA and interspersing cellular DNA at the molecular level.</p>
<p>The transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of the 20861 Type III integration site was analyzed using next-generation sequencing techniques. We initially identified a viral-host fusion transcript by APOT and, as is commonly found, the HPV16 splice donor at nt 880 was joined to a cryptic splice acceptor in the adjacent cellular DNA. RNA-seq analysis confirmed the use of this viral-host splice site, but also identified longer transcripts derived from this locus. This is all consistent with previous RNA analysis of 20861 cells using Northern blots and S1 nuclease mapping analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>ChIP-seq analysis showed two strong peaks of enrichment of the super-enhancer markers Brd4 and H3K27ac at both the viral URR and adjacent cellular sequence at the integration locus, the latter of which was not observed in the same region of cellular DNA in the W12 20863 sub-clone that harbors extrachromosomal viral DNA. The strong peak of H3K27ac modification within the amplified cellular flanking sequence overlapped with an epithelial-specific enhancer (also defined by H3K27ac) in the ENCODE datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref033">33</xref>]. The identified enhancer was shown to be particularly active in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK), as well as HeLa cervical carcinoma and MCF-7 mammary gland adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that it may play a role in regulating pathways relevant to epithelial cell function and/or cancer. We postulate that it is synergy between this enhancer element and the viral URR that led to the development of a super-enhancer-like element that drives high-level expression of the viral <italic>E6</italic> and <italic>E7</italic> oncogenes. We suspect that any enhancer that is active, or could be activated, could be hijacked and amplified and under the correct circumstances develop into a super-enhancer.</p>
<p>HPV integration can occur randomly throughout the entire human genome, but has a tendency towards transcriptionally active regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref007">7</xref>]. Integration may also occur in transcriptionally inactive regions, but it is likely that these do not promote strong expression of E6 and E7 leading to the outgrowth of a clonal population. Integration into transcriptionally active regions could enhance viral gene expression in general, but the hijacking of an adjacent enhancer element could further promote viral oncogene expression. We propose that in 20861 cells, the virus integrated adjacent to, and hijacked, a basal tissue-specific enhancer. Subsequent co-amplification of the viral genome and surrounding cellular sequences resulted in the development of a viral-cellular super-enhancer-like element to strongly drive oncogenic progression.</p>
<p>To show that the development of the 20861 super-enhancer was most likely due to synergy between the viral URR and the adjacent cellular enhancer, we examined two other W12 sub-clones, 20831 and 20862, that were originally described to have ~60 tandem copies of integrated HPV16 DNA. These clones did not show any enrichment of the super-enhancer marker Brd4 at the integration locus by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, ChIP-seq signals for super-enhancer markers at the 20831/20862 integration site were similar to patterns observed in 20861 and 20863 cells, which do not contain integrated HPV at this locus. Correspondingly, these clones had previously been reported to express lower levels of E6/E7 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>]. We discovered that these clones were related to each other as they both contained HPV16 integrated into the same site in chromosome 3, which is very consistent with earlier analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>]. However, we noted that the number of viral genomes were less than originally reported, and our preliminary observations suggest that the copy numbers at each integration site are unstable/dynamic. Focal amplification was significantly greater at the Type III integration site in 20861 cells relative to the other integrated W12 sub-clones, which may be the result of increased genomic instability at the locus due to higher <italic>E6/E7</italic> oncogene expression. We also examined an additional six cervical carcinoma derived cell lines (C-33A, C-411, CasKi, HeLa, ME-180 and SiHa) for a prominent Brd4 focus but none was apparent. Therefore, the development of a strong super-enhancer at the site of HPV integration is not universal and likely results from a combination of factors.</p>
<p>The location of HPV insertional breakpoints within the human genome can influence the transcription of neighboring genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref037">37</xref>] and HPV integration into, or adjacent to, cancer-associated genes has been reported to be a potential mechanism for HPV-mediated oncogenic progression in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref038">38</xref>]. Altered transcription can be restricted to the disrupted gene with minimal or no effects on neighboring transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref020">20</xref>], or can extend to contiguous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref020">20</xref>]. However, in almost all cases oncogenesis is primarily driven by, and dependent on, the <italic>E6</italic> and <italic>E7</italic> viral oncogenes.</p>
<p>At the 20861 Type III integration locus, the HPV16 genome integrated into an intergenic region on chromosome 2, and the subsequent focal amplification of the surrounding cellular sequence overlapped with a non-coding RNA located downstream of the integration site. Integration also resulted in upregulation of <italic>FOSL2</italic> (3.5-fold, adjusted p-value 9.2 x 10<sup>−6</sup>), which is located approximately 20 kb downstream of the HPV integration site, just outside the amplified region (GEO accession number GSE75987) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to driving high <italic>E6/E7</italic> expression, the super-enhancer increased transcription of neighboring genes. We previously showed that disruption of Brd4 from the 20861 super-enhancer resulted in down-regulation of <italic>E6</italic> and <italic>E7</italic> gene expression and induction of cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref022">22</xref>]. However, <italic>FOSL2</italic> levels were only minimally reduced, indicating that 20861 cell proliferation is completely dependent on expression of the <italic>E6</italic> and <italic>E7</italic> oncogenes.</p>
<p>Southern blot analysis of the W12 cell clones had indicated that they contained both unit length genomes (most likely head-to-tail copies of the viral DNA; Type II integration) as well as amplified viral-cellular junctional DNA (Type III integration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>]. The fiber-FISH experiments presented here confirmed that the clones examined all contained at least two independent integration events. Each clone examined contained a Type II and a Type III integration site located at different regions of the host genome. Although each clone contains Type II and Type III integration sites, our data suggests that only the Type III integration site is transcriptionally active. RNA-seq analysis detected only transcripts from the Type III viral-host junctional sequences in all three clones. We confirmed this by absolutely quantifying the amount of mRNA containing the viral E6*I splice with that of the downstream cellular sequences (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s006">S6E–S6G Fig</xref>). This is in line with previous studies, which reported that fusion mRNAs were expressed from a single integration site in tumors containing multiple integration loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref040">40</xref>]. This is also consistent with initial studies that showed that no RNA sequences from the 3’ end of the HPV16 early region could be detected in 20861, 20831 and 20862 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>]. Distinct from 20861 cells, the 20831/20862 fusion transcript contained the HPV16 E1^E4 splice (nt 880^3358) before running into the cellular sequence at nt 3741. It has been shown that viral sequences from the HPV16 3’ early region decrease the steady-state expression, stability and translation of early mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref041">41</xref>] and replacement of these sequences with host sequences can increase expression of <italic>E6</italic> and <italic>E7</italic>.</p>
<p>In normal cells, repetitive DNA sequences are silenced through methylation to prevent genomic instability at these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref042">42</xref>]. Kalantari et al. have previously shown that tandemly integrated viral DNA is hypermethylated in CasKi, 20831 and 20862 cells, whereas viral DNA is hypomethylated in 20861 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref043">43</xref>]. We show here that the majority of viral genome copies are located in the transcriptionally active Type III integration locus in 20861 cells, while in 20831/20862 cells most viral genomes are in the Type II integration locus. It is possible that the head-to-tail tandem copies of the viral genome at Type II integration sites are recognized and silenced through spreading methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref044">44</xref>], whereas Type III integration events can escape such epigenetic silencing due to the intervening cellular sequences.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which integration of the HPV genome into the host can deregulate expression of the <italic>E6</italic> and <italic>E7</italic> oncogenes and promote oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref013">13</xref>]. Here, we describe a new way in which the virus hijacks an adjacent cellular enhancer to drive strong, deregulated expression of E6/E7. Amplification of the viral-host DNA at this site resulted in the formation of a strong super-enhancer-like element. Thus, there is no universal mechanism by which integration of an oncogenic HPV promotes oncogenesis; instead it depends on many stochastic factors such as viral copy number, associated amplification and rearrangements, the existence of a convenient host splice acceptor and/or polyadenylation site, and the epigenetic signature of the locus.</p>

<p>Total DNA was harvested with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). 1 μg total DNA was digested with either a single-cut linearizing enzyme (BamHI) for the HPV16 genome or a non-cutter (HindIII) to linearize cellular DNA. After digestion, samples were separated on 0.8% Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) agarose gels. A known quantity of linear HPV16 DNA was run on the same gel as the samples. DNA was visualized with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide and transferred onto nylon membranes with a TurboBlotter downward transfer system (Whatman). Membranes were UV cross-linked, dried, incubated with prehybridization blocking buffer (3× SSC [1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate], 2% SDS, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA), and then incubated overnight with [<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP-labeled HPV16 DNA in hybridization buffer (3× SSC [1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate], 2% SDS, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.02 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 25 ng [<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP-labeled HPV16 DNA).

<title>Custom viral genome hybrid capture sequencing</title>
<p>To confirm virus-host insertional breakpoints, we designed a custom panel of Agilent SureSelect XT v.G.1 HPV16 genome sequences to detect viral genomic sequences and flanking host genomic DNA sequences in various samples (manuscript in preparation, Symer et al., similar in overall approach to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007179.ref048">48</xref>]). We performed the enrichment and library preparation using a protocol on the Agilent Bravo following the manufacturer’s protocol in the Genomics Shared Resource, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 (2 x 150-bp paired-end reads) at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. More than 5 million reads were sequenced per sample (i.e. for cell line 20861, we generated 5.5 million reads, and for 20863, 23 million reads; see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s008">S1 Table</xref>).

<title>HPV-mediated super-enhancer formation does not occur at all sites of tandem HPV integration.</title>
<p><bold>A,</bold> Alignment of RNA-seq reads from W12 20831 and 20862 cells to the human (hg19) and HPV type 16 isolate 16W12E (AF125673.1) reference genomes showed expression of a viral-cellular fusion transcript spliced into a cryptic acceptor within an intergenic region at chr3: 189,662,800. Data are averaged from three biological replicates. <bold>B,</bold> Alignment of ChIP-seq reads to the human reference genome (hg19) in 20863 cells containing extrachromosomal HPV16, and 20861, 20831 and 20862 cells containing integrated HPV16 genomes. Brd4 and H3K27ac signatures encompassing the integration locus at chr3: 189,662,800 are similar across all four W12 sub-clones. Data are averaged from two biological replicates. <bold>C,</bold> Alignment of ChIP-seq reads to human and HPV type 16 isolate 16W12E (AF125673.1) reference genomes in 20831 and 20862 cells did not show enrichment of super-enhancer markers over the Type III integration site as is the case in 20861 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007179.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Enrichment of reads over the viral genome is indicative of signal at Type II integration sites which account for a higher proportion of the viral copy numbers within these two subclones (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007179.s005">S5</xref> Figs). Histograms represent depth of coverage of aligned reads. Amplified region is marked by a black horizontal bar; HPV16 genome and cellular genes are represented by green and blue horizontal arrows, respectively.

<title>HPV insertional breakpoints in 20861 and 20863 cells, detected by custom viral genome hybrid capture sequencing.</title>
<p>Break IDs were assigned arbitrarily by Hydra insertional breakpoint detection software. Positions of neighboring genes were defined by the orientation of the most proximal integrated HPV16 genome. <italic>Bold font;</italic> the most strongly supported insertional breakpoints matched analysis of WGS data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007179.t001">Table 1</xref>). We used hydra protocol to detect HPV breakpoints from paired-end sequencing data. We show breakpoints supported by at least four discordant read pairs (i.e. one end aligned to HPV and the other end aligned to human genome). We annotated the nearest three (or less) genes located within 300 kb from the breakpoints, using the NCBI RefSeq database. All human genome coordinates are based on UCSC hg19 genome assembly.</p>
