<abstract>
<p>In response to stress and injury a coordinated activation of conserved signalling modules, such as JNK and JAK/STAT, is critical to trigger regenerative tissue restoration. While these pathways rebuild homeostasis and promote faithful organ recovery, it is intriguing that they also become activated in various tumour conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how similar pathways can achieve context-dependent functional outputs, likely depending on cellular states. Compromised chromatin regulation, upon removal of the Polycomb group member <italic>polyhomeotic</italic>, leads to tumour formation with ectopic activation of JNK signalling, mediated by <italic>egr</italic>/<italic>grnd</italic>, in addition to JAK/STAT and Notch. Employing quantitative analyses, we show that blocking ectopic signalling impairs <italic>ph</italic> tumour growth. Furthermore, JAK/STAT functions in parallel to JNK, while Notch relies on JNK. Here, we reveal a signalling hierarchy in <italic>ph</italic> tumours that is distinct from the regenerative processes regulated by these pathways. Absence of <italic>ph</italic> renders a permissive state for expression of target genes, but our results suggest that both loss of repression and the presence of activators may collectively regulate gene expression during tumorigenesis. Further dissecting the effect of signalling, developmental or stress-induced factors will thus elucidate the regulation of physiological responses and the contribution of context-specific cellular states.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Signalling pathways modulate cellular responses in developmental and regenerative processes but can also be misused by cancer cells to promote tissue invasion and growth. How signalling outputs are integrated to direct a variety of responses ranging from organ repair to tumour onset remains elusive. Loss of the epigenetic Polycomb repressive complex PRC1, which regulates cell identity during normal development, leads to tumour formation in epithelial tissues, supported by aberrant signalling activities. Employing quantitative and genetic methods, we dissect the signalling hierarchy between the pathways involved in tumour growth, namely JNK, JAK/STAT and Notch. We find that JNK activation in <italic>ph</italic> tumours is mediated by <italic>eiger</italic> and its receptor <italic>grindelwald</italic>. We identify a signalling hierarchy where JNK and JAK/STAT function in parallel in the tumour model, which is in contrast to a coordinated sequential activation of the same pathways in a regenerative context. Our data also reveal a higher regulatory complexity underlying tumour growth, as signalling-dependent activators can contribute to tumorigenic gene expression in addition to loss of repression. This dual mode of regulation may be relevant in a range of tumour models and organisms, since aberrant signalling and deregulated gene expression programs are general hallmarks of cancer tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissues are capable of restoring homeostasis after damage or stress through coordinated signalling responses. However, cells sometimes deviate from this normal repair path to attain a tumorigenic state, often entailing the usage of similar signalling modules. Cancer cells become self-sufficient in controlling cell division and metabolic programs, hijacking growth pathways and evading cell death. How cells acquire unconventional mechanisms during transformation to direct tumour-sustaining signals is still largely unknown.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> tumour models revealed key oncogenic features in tissues, which appear conserved across species. These include loss of cell polarity, compromised epithelial architecture and oncogenic cooperation. For instance, activation of known tumour drivers such as Ras, Notch, Myc or EGFR lead to benign hyperplasia in imaginal discs, but in combination with loss of epithelial integrity result in neoplastic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref004">4</xref>]. Epithelial tumours in humans also lose polarity as they acquire malignant properties, pointing towards the importance of altered cellular interactions for disease progression in tissues harbouring pre-cancerous lesions. The interactions between defective cells and the environment as well as the adjacent healthy tissue have been increasingly recognized to be relevant for tumour development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues are particularly well suited to address the events that occur during the early steps of tumorigenesis, which are difficult to dissect in human cancers that are often detected only at much later stages.</p>
<p>A number of ectopic signalling activities have been reported in several tumour models, with some shared morphological and molecular similarities. Cell overproliferation and defects in epithelial architecture are observed in tissues lacking functional polarity components (such as <italic>scribble</italic>, <italic>dlg</italic> or <italic>lgl</italic>) in combination with activated forms of oncogenes like <italic>ras</italic><sup><italic>V12</italic></sup> or <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>act</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref011">11</xref>]. Invasive properties of polarity-deficient cells have been shown to depend on JNK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref013">13</xref>]. Tumour cell clusters sort out from the neighbouring wild-type tissue, as shown by clonal analysis, and display rounded shapes that resemble cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref015">15</xref>]. Interestingly, mutations in epigenetic silencers, including Polycomb group (PcG) members, also lead to tumour formation in epithelial tissues, without the need for additional oncogenic cooperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>]. These tumours share many of the previously mentioned features, as clones displaying polarity defects grow beyond the normal boundaries of the host tissue leading to its deformation. Activation of JAK/STAT and Notch signalling has been reported in tumours lacking a functional Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) due to loss of <italic>polyhomeotic</italic> (<italic>ph</italic>), which contribute to their growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref018">18</xref>]. Other signalling pathways, including EGFR, Ras, Hippo and Myc have been previously examined, but were reported to be unchanged or only having some ectopic activation in <italic>ph</italic> tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>]. It becomes clear that faithful chromatin regulation is key during development and tissue homeostasis, pointing towards the consequences of abnormal epigenetic control in compromised tissue function or rendering tumour formation.</p>
<p>Despite the recurrent observations of ectopic signalling activities in tumours, their contribution during early tumorigenesis has rarely been addressed. It is puzzling how developmental signalling ensures the formation of normal tissue structures but lead to abnormal growth when activated by tumour cells. For example, regeneration of imaginal discs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires JNK signalling, which in turn activates the JAK/STAT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>]. Both pathways regulate the regenerative response, after transiently overcoming Polycomb silencing, and allow cell fate reallocation. However, they also become activated in tumours resulting from permanent abrogation of Polycomb function. Here, we sought to functionally address how ectopic JNK, JAK/STAT and Notch signalling contribute to <italic>ph</italic> tumour growth and which relationships exist among these pathways. We can thus identify signalling hierarchies that are context-specific and determine the necessary elements required for tumour development that differ from regeneration. Our results support a dual relevance for ectopic signalling pathways and the loss of the PRC1 silencing in promoting gene expression programs supporting tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>In the absence of the PRC1 member <italic>ph</italic>, tumours display ectopic JNK, JAK/STAT and Notch signalling</title>
<p>Loss of the PRC1 component <italic>Polyhomeotic</italic> (<italic>ph</italic>) leads to tumour formation characterized by compromised epithelial integrity and cell polarity, neoplastic overgrowth and poor differentiation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>].

Clones mutant for <italic>ph</italic> form rounded structures that sort out from the adjacent tissue monolayer, forming a multi-layered tissue with defective epithelial architecture that can be visualized with a nuclear DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). This is in contrast to the organized tissue architecture of eye-antennal discs with neutral clones (control clones that only express GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>).

<p>JNK signalling has been widely reported to become activated in response to tissue damage, associated with loss of epithelial integrity and often in tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref012">12</xref>]. We monitored JNK signalling with a fluorescent reporter that is driven by the transcription factor AP-1, the canonical heterodimer activated by the JNK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref021">21</xref>]. Ectopic expression of the JNK reporter was largely detected to overlap with <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1A’ and 1A”</xref>), while the reporter was virtually silent in wild-type eye discs and unaffected by neutral clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1D’ and 1D”</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine how JNK becomes activated upon loss of <italic>ph</italic>, we considered a possible role for <italic>eiger</italic> and its receptor <italic>grindelwald</italic>, which have been shown to mediate JNK activation in other tissue damage contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref022">22</xref>]. Indeed, we found that this ligand-receptor pair is also required for JNK activation in <italic>ph</italic> clones, since the JNK reporter is downregulated when knocking-down either gene in <italic>ph</italic> tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>). Furthermore, as Egr-dependent expression of Matrix metalloprotease-1 (Mmp1) has been linked with invasiveness in <italic>ras</italic><sup><italic>V12</italic></sup>/<italic>scrib</italic> tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref022">22</xref>], we assessed whether this target would also require <italic>egr</italic>/<italic>grnd</italic>-mediated JNK activation in <italic>ph</italic> tumours. Mmp1 staining revealed that its upregulation in <italic>ph</italic> tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) is prevented by blocking JNK signaling either with <italic>bsk</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) or upon knocking down <italic>egr</italic> or <italic>grnd</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). These data show that functional JNK activation depends on <italic>eiger</italic>/<italic>grindelwald</italic>, and is required for Mmp1 upregulation.</p>
<p>We confirmed that JAK/STAT and Notch signalling were activated in eye discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones, using available reporters for each pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref024">24</xref>]. The STAT reporter was expressed in most <italic>ph</italic> clones but also extended beyond them in some instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1B’ and 1B”</xref>), in line with a wider range of activation due to secretion of <italic>upd</italic> ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>]. The reporter is normally detected in a specific pattern in wild-type discs, namely in the antenna region and some photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1E”</xref>), which is clearly altered in discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1B”</xref>). Finally, the Notch reporter was detected in a subset of <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1C’ and 1C”</xref>), while its endogenous expression was mostly restricted to a circle prefiguring the developing antennal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1F’ and 1F”</xref>). The ectopic activation of JNK, JAK/STAT and Notch signalling in <italic>ph</italic> clones prompted us to ask whether each pathway is important for tumour development or if some are rather peripheral to tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Impaired JNK, JAK/STAT or Notch signalling impact on <italic>ph</italic> tumour growth</title>
<p>To functionally test the contribution of each pathway to <italic>ph</italic> tumour growth, we used genetic tools to block signal transduction in <italic>ph</italic> mutant clones and examined their effect. We used the established <italic>ph</italic> tumour model in eye-antennal discs by inducing eyFlp-driven MARCM <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup> null clones surrounded by normal tissue, and also allowing restricted expression of additional transgenes within the mutant clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>]. Due to the neoplastic nature of <italic>ph</italic> clones, which spatially grow beyond the epithelial plane, we implemented a quantitative framework to measure clone volume in a large number of discs. While clonal area is often the main parameter used to measure growth differences, the aberrant tumoral growth beyond the epithelial plane prompted us to recognise the need for volume measurements in this context. This approach takes into account the intrinsic variability of tumour tissues and provides a robust ground with statistic power to measure differences in tumour growth upon genetic abrogation of signalling modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>First, we devised a standard method to capture the 3D character of <italic>ph</italic> clones and measure their number and respective volume across 50 <italic>ph</italic>-containing eye discs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). We observed a range of different clone sizes in each disc, reflecting the intrinsic diversity observed previously. We identified three categories that describe the observed distribution in clone volumes (small, medium and large), which were pseudo-coloured according to their dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). On average, there were around 26–33 clones per disc (distributed among the three classes), with only one or two large clones consistently found in each disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2B and S2B’ Fig</xref>), but which made up a significant proportion of the total tumoral tissue (up to 45% of the total GFP volume per disc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). The distribution of tumour volume into three categories was generally consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), so even though the total volume might vary across discs, the proportional contribution remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2B’ Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We then extended this quantitative framework to measure the consequences of blocking each pathway to tumour growth. JNK signalling was blocked by expressing a dominant negative form of the <italic>basket</italic> kinase (UAS-bsk<sup>DN</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref025">25</xref>]. We observed a decrease in the average clone volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and pseudo-coloured volumes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), although the total number of clones per disc remained generally constant. We observed a decrease in the volume taken up by medium and large <italic>ph</italic> clones upon blocking JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), while the tumour volume made up by small clones increased in comparison to the baseline <italic>ph</italic> condition (without block) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In addition, this is also reflected by a decrease in the number of medium and large clones (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2F–2C</xref>), which were rarely found, and a corresponding increase in the number of small clones. Thus, upon blocking JNK signalling, there was a volume shift from medium and large categories to clones with smaller volume. As we established that JNK activation is dependent on the TNF receptor <italic>grnd</italic> and its ligand <italic>egr</italic>, we also measured the effect on <italic>ph</italic> tumour volume upon knockdown. We confirmed their impact on tumour growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2H–S2K Fig</xref>), which is also clearly observed in comparison to blocking the three pathways (tumour volume measurements summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2L Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>JAK/STAT signalling was perturbed through expression of a mutated form of the sole <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor, <italic>domeless</italic> (UAS-dome<sup>ΔCYT</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref026">26</xref>], as a way to block the pathway irrespective of one or more ligands that could activate it. As with JNK, we similarly found that blocking JAK/STAT signalling resulted in a reduction of clone volume, as we found mostly small and a few medium clones but not large ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2G–2I</xref>). The effect was more pronounced with impaired JAK/STAT, depicted for example by an even smaller volume taken up by medium clones in this condition (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">2C</xref>). As for the Notch pathway, we expressed a dominant negative transgene of the receptor in <italic>ph</italic> clones (UAS-N<sup>DN</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref027">27</xref>], which also yielded clones to mostly shift to the small volume category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2J–2L</xref>). We also noted that, in this case, the number of clones was slightly reduced in comparison with blocking the other two pathways, even though a similar trend to detect mostly clones with small volume was observed. As controls, we quantified the size of neutral clones expressing either of the constructs used to block the three pathways. We verified that these clones showed normal morphology, stayed in the epithelial plane, and that the area taken by neutral clones in eye discs did not significantly change upon blocking these pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2C–S2G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These data show that all three pathways activated in <italic>ph</italic> clones (JNK, JAK/STAT and N) contribute to tumour growth, as impairing signalling through any of the three cascades impacts on clone volume. Although medium and large clones are commonly seen in <italic>ph</italic> clones where these pathways are active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), there is a shift towards smaller clones upon impaired signalling (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2F, 2I, 2L to 2C</xref>), suggesting that clones are not able to grow as much in the absence of these signalling modules. As all three pathways support <italic>ph</italic> tumour development, we took advantage of this simple model to determine what relationships might exist among them and thus define context-specific hierarchies relevant to tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>JNK signalling acts in parallel to JAK/STAT but upstream of Notch</title>
<p>To dissect whether these three functionally relevant pathways act independently or show levels of crosstalk, we combined specific signalling read-outs with a blockage of each cascade. We started by testing the effect of blocking JNK in the other two modules, by expressing UAS-bsk<sup>DN</sup> in <italic>ph</italic> clones. We established how broadly activated was each signalling reporter in tumours by determining the proportion of <italic>ph</italic> clones showing reporter activity in respect to all marked clones across several discs. We could then measure the effect on each signalling reporter upon blocking individual pathways. The JNK pathway was widely abrogated, as the TRE-DsRed reporter was robustly downregulated in <italic>ph</italic> clones expressing UAS-bsk<sup>DN</sup> (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g003">3A–3D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">1A–1A”</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined how blocking JNK impacted on the other two cascades. Indeed, JNK has been shown to act upstream of JAK/STAT in response to tissue damage and promote regeneration by upregulating the <italic>unpaired</italic> ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>]. However, the 10xSTAT-GFP reporter was comparably detected upon expression of bsk<sup>DN</sup> as in <italic>ph</italic> clones alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g003">Fig 3E–3H</xref>). This suggested that the same signalling pathways that are subjected to different hierarchical controls specify either regenerative or tumorigenic development.</p>
<p>Finally, we observed a reduced expression of the Notch reporter (NRE-EGFP) when co-expressing bsk<sup>DN</sup> in <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g003">Fig 3I–3L</xref>). These data suggested that, although JAK/STAT functions in parallel to JNK in <italic>ph</italic> tumours, the Notch pathway relies on JNK signalling and thus may function downstream.</p>
<p>To further explore the connection between JNK and Notch, we asked whether this could be ligand-dependent or independent. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>], we could also verify that Serrate is upregulated in <italic>ph</italic> tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s003">S3D–S3F Fig</xref>), while Delta expression is similar to that of control discs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>). Thus, we asked if this could depend on JNK. We first hypothesized it could indeed act through Serrate transcriptional regulation, but we did not observe a marked effect on Ser immunoreactivity when blocking JNK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s003">S3D–S3F Fig</xref>), apart from clones getting smaller. This pointed to an alternative target, so we tested the receptor itself, using an antibody against the Notch intra-cellular domain (NICD). Discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones showed ectopic NICD signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s003">S3H Fig</xref>), and we observed a reduction NICD signal in <italic>ph</italic> clones upon blocking JNK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s003">S3I and S3J Fig</xref>). The pattern was more comparable to that of control discs with neutral clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s003">S3G Fig</xref>), although we noted that some variability, namely in bigger clones. These data suggest that JNK can exert an effect at the level of NICD regulation, although we cannot exclude indirect regulation since several other factors are involved in its processing. Nevertheless, it points to ligand-independent regulation, as Delta and Serrate were vastly unaffected when blocking JNK signalling.</p>

<title>JAK/STAT signalling functions independently of JNK and Notch</title>
<p>We blocked JAK/STAT signalling by expressing the previously mentioned dominant negative receptor transgene (UAS-dome<sup>ΔCYT</sup>), and examined its consequence with reporters of all three pathways.

Consistently, the JNK reporter remained active as in <italic>ph</italic> clones alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref>), suggesting that JAK/STAT and JNK act independently in <italic>ph</italic> tumours.

<title>Impairment of Notch signalling has little effect on JNK and JAK/STAT</title>
<p>To examine how Notch signalling could influence the other pathways, we carried out similarly designed experiments using UAS-N<sup>DN</sup> in <italic>ph</italic> clones. The JNK reporter was detected in a similar proportion of mutant clones as in <italic>ph</italic> tumours alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref>). The JAK/STAT reporter was modestly reduced upon blocking Notch signalling in comparison to <italic>ph</italic> clones alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g005">Fig 5E–5H</xref>). However, we noticed that this is likely contributed by downregulation of the reporter mostly in smaller clones, as larger ones still express NRE-EGFP. A clear difference was observed in the NRE-EGFP reporter when expressing N<sup>DN</sup>, confirming signalling blockage for the target pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g005">Fig 5I–5L</xref>). Thus, blocking Notch does not impinge on JNK and has a modest effect on JAK/STAT signalling reporters.

<p>Taken together, the previous set of observations highlight a signalling hierarchy specific to <italic>ph</italic> tumours, where JAK/STAT signalling functions simultaneously but independently to the JNK pathway, unlike previous observations in a regenerating tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>].

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Co-activation of JNK and JAK/STAT is not sufficient to trigger tumour phenotypes</title>
<p>To further explore the role of JNK and JAK/STAT signalling in directing cellular responses to damage, we asked whether simultaneous function of these two pathways could be sufficient to drive any tumour-resembling characteristics in epithelial tissues. We were motivated by the differences in outcome, from a JNK-dependent input on the JAK/STAT in tissue regeneration, contrasted by the current observations of simultaneous function of these pathways in <italic>ph</italic> tumours. We thus took a simple approach to test the effect of triggering both pathways simultaneously, attempting to induce a signalling context similar to that of <italic>ph</italic> clones. We focused on JNK and JAK/STAT as these were activated in parallel in tumours, while Notch seemed to have inputs from JNK, and Notch expression leads to tissue hyperplasia on its own, which could lead to confounding effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>We used the same system as for <italic>ph</italic> clones to facilitate comparison, by generating MARCM eyFlp clones in eye-antennal discs but without the <italic>ph</italic> mutation. Discs with neutral clones (GFP-marked cells) show a normal appearance with a typical planar-organized layer of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4A–S4C Fig</xref>). When activating JNK in such clones, by expressing an activated form of <italic>hemipterous</italic> (UAS-hep<sup>act</sup>) that acts upstream of the main JNK kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref033">33</xref>], a reduced number of clones was recovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4D–S4G Fig</xref>), in line with the well-described pro-apoptotic function of JNK that can lead to elimination of cells from the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref034">34</xref>]. We also confirmed that the JNK reporter was detected in or around clones with overactive JNK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To trigger JAK/STAT, we induced neutral clones overexpressing the sole JAK kinase <italic>hopscotch</italic> (UAS-hop) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref035">35</xref>]. The STAT reporter was detected in these clones, in addition to the endogenous pattern in the eye-antennal disc ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref023">23</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4J Fig</xref>), but the clones remained in the epithelial layer and had patchy shapes similar to neutral clones without additional transgene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4H–S4K Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We then co-expressed UAS-hep<sup>act</sup> and UAS-hop in otherwise wild-type cells, to over-activate both pathways as we observe in <italic>ph</italic> mutant clones. Even in this condition, discs appeared to broadly retain a normal morphology, and clonal shape was rather similar to that of neutral clones, growing in non-preferential directions within the epithelial plane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4L–S4N Fig</xref>). We did not observe formation of cyst-like structures or local alterations to tissue morphology that could be attributed to the nature of clones in respect to the surrounding wild-type tissue. We noted that more clones were recovered when co-expressing both UAS-hep<sup>act</sup> and UAS-hop than with UAS-hep<sup>act</sup> alone, likely due to increased survival of cells with JNK signalling conferred by JAK/STAT, as recently reported in response to damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref036">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, we could not identify characteristic tumour features in tissues carrying clones with simultaneous expression of JNK and JAK/STAT components.</p>
<p>These data suggest that co-induction of JNK and JAK/STAT signalling is not sufficient by itself to promote tumour-associated malformations, even though both pathways are ectopically activated in <italic>ph</italic> tumours. Therefore, epithelial tumour initiation likely depends on additional elements that are not fully reunited by collective function of these pathways. The chromatin state is a likely determining factor to modulate signalling responses, which is clearly altered in clones lacking <italic>ph</italic>. In light of these considerations, we sought to identify additional requirements to JNK and JAK/STAT in the development of <italic>ph</italic> tumours.</p>

As Polycomb complexes target hundreds of developmental and signalling genes, a general assumption in the field has laid the expectation that PRC1 targets would become de-repressed in its absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref037">37</xref>]. Following the lead that there must be additional requirements for <italic>ph</italic> tumour formation than concomitant JNK and JAK/STAT, we revisited the state of known Polycomb targets in <italic>ph</italic> clones. An early report of <italic>ph</italic> clones in wing discs showed a compartment-specific upregulation of established target genes, including <italic>engrailed</italic>, <italic>hedgehog</italic> (<italic>hh</italic>), <italic>patched</italic> and <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref015">15</xref>]. This suggested that a more complex modulation, potentially dependent on additional activators, could underlie the re-expression of Polycomb targets in distinct tissues or contexts.</p>
<p>We analysed the expression of known PcG targets in eye-antennal discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones. <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>wingless</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>) are PcG targets that encode ligands for conserved pathways (homologs of TGF-β and Wnt signalling) involved in regulating growth and patterning of imaginal discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref008">8</xref>]. We combined an available <italic>dpp</italic> reporter, dpp-lacZ, in a <italic>ph</italic> mutant background and checked its expression in eye discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones. The <italic>dpp</italic> reporter is normally expressed in a section of the antennal region as well as the morphogenetic furrow of the eye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>), which we also observed in discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6A and 6A’</xref>). However, dpp-lacZ was not detected in the vast majority of <italic>ph</italic> clones, and there were instances where the typical row of expression along the furrow seemed to be deformed by the neighbouring mutant clones which seemed to push adjacent cells away from their usual pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We examined the tissues in further detail to uncover the 3D structures formed by <italic>ph</italic> tumours, by analysing z-sections closer to the disc surface (‘top’) or towards the middle (‘mid’). The <italic>dpp</italic> reporter was expressed in a row of cells at the surface where no clone was yet present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), but the expression of dpp-lacZ was interrupted by a GFP-marked <italic>ph</italic> clone at a deeper z-position in the same disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This suggested that <italic>ph</italic> clones did not globally express dpp-lacZ throughout the eye discs.</p>

<p>To assess <italic>wg</italic> expression in <italic>ph</italic> clones, we resorted to a viable genetically engineered fly strain with an endogenously tagged <italic>wg</italic> version, <italic>wg</italic><sup>HA</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref038">38</xref>]. The characteristic <italic>wg</italic> expression pattern in posterior photoreceptors and in a defined location of the antenna was similarly confirmed, both in wild-type discs as in discs with neutral clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). However, <italic>ph</italic> clones generally lacked <italic>wg</italic><sup><italic>HA</italic></sup> staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6D and 6D’</xref>). By taking a closer inspection of tissue sections, we observed that the expression of <italic>wg</italic><sup>HA</sup> was reduced or interrupted in <italic>ph</italic> clones surrounded by wild-type tissue where <italic>wg</italic><sup>HA</sup> was normally expressed in regions with differentiating photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). Even though <italic>wg</italic> can be secreted and potentially function at a longer range, as it does in wing disc patterning, our data suggest that this PcG target gene is also not globally upregulated in <italic>ph</italic> clones.</p>
<p>Finally, we analysed the expression of Distal-less, encoded by <italic>Dll</italic> and required for determination of ventral imaginal disc identity and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref040">40</xref>]. Dll expression is restricted to the antenna in wild-type eye-antennal discs, and with control discs with neutral clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s005">S5E and S5F Fig</xref>). Discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones also displayed a pattern restricted to the antenna and no staining was observed in clones growing in other disc locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6G and 6G’</xref>). Furthermore, when clones grew in the antennal region the Dll staining was only found in tissue sections close to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6H</xref>) but was interrupted at deeper z-sections where <italic>ph</italic> clones grew in the same disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). Thus, the PcG target <italic>Dll</italic> also does not appear to be re-expressed in the absence of PRC1 silencing.</p>
<p>The previous examples challenge the notion of a full and generalized de-repression of PcG targets in <italic>ph</italic> clones. Instead, we considered that abrogation of PRC1 function could yield a permissive chromatin state but additional factors would be required to activate the expression of PcG targets. The relevance of <italic>Cubitus interruptus</italic> (<italic>Ci</italic>) reported years ago as a compartment-specific activator of <italic>dpp</italic> in <italic>ph</italic> clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref015">15</xref>], led us to consider that other transcription factors, namely downstream targets of signalling pathways, could have additional roles in activating Polycomb-silenced genes.</p>

<title>The canonical JNK activator AP-1 is required for de-repression of a PRE in <italic>ph</italic> clones</title>
<p>Our previous results showed that simultaneous JNK and JAK/STAT signalling were not sufficient to induce tissue aberrations but loss of <italic>ph</italic> was also insufficient for broad de-repression of a selected number of PcG targets. We therefore hypothesized that a combination of activators and loss of Polycomb repression is required for context-specific target gene expression in <italic>ph</italic> tumorigenesis. Although it is difficult to predict the full extent of activators that could trigger genes previously inaccessible due to Polycomb silencing, we focused on effectors of relevant signalling pathways as potential candidates. For example, motifs for the canonical transcription factors downstream of JNK and JAK/STAT (AP-1 and Stat92E, respectively) have been associated with open chromatin regions in other tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref041">41</xref>]. However, to test the possibility of a dual requirement of activators and loss of <italic>ph</italic> silencing, we sought to identify an element responsive to both inputs, ideally located close to a Polycomb response element (PRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref043">43</xref>]. We recurred to a reporter of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>reaper</italic> that became activated in response to loss of cell polarity in a JNK-dependent manner, and which we found to also harbour a PRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>To functionally test the involvement of JNK signalling to activate PcG-target genes, we assessed expression of the rpr(PRE)-GFP reporter in discs with neutral or <italic>ph</italic> clones. We first checked the normal expression pattern of the rpr(PRE)-GFP reporter in wild-type eye-antennal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g007">Fig 7A–7A”</xref>). Reporter expression was previously shown to require JNK-dependent inputs, which is generally absent in eye discs, and the reporter was generally silent throughout the disc. Interestingly, the reporter became readily detected in most <italic>ph</italic> clones, suggesting that it becomes responsive in absence of PRC1 repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g007">Fig 7B–7B”</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined whether blocking JNK, through expression of UAS-bsk<sup>DN</sup> in <italic>ph</italic> clones, had an effect on the rpr(PRE)-GFP reporter. We observed reduced reporter expression in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g007">Fig 7C–7C”</xref>), compared to its marked expression in <italic>ph</italic> clones alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g007">Fig 7B–7B”</xref>). These observations suggested that the reporter becomes active in the absence of <italic>ph</italic> (and not in the surrounding wild-type tissue) in a JNK-dependent fashion. We built up on the previous analysis of specific AP-1 binding sites present in the reporter that were required for its expression in polarity-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref034">34</xref>]. We thus used the version of the reporter with mutated AP-1 sites, rpr(PRE) [ΔAP1<sup>P+D</sup>]-GFP, and observed a reduced expression in comparison to <italic>ph</italic> clones alone, similarly to blocking JNK with bsk<sup>DN</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g007">Fig 7D–7D”</xref>).</p>
<p>We sought to extend this type of analysis to additional cis-regulatory elements containing PREs, some of which have recently been shown to have a dual function, also behaving as enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref044">44</xref>]. We obtained and tested 4 of the PRE reporter lines showing also enhancer function in the embryo (namely, bx-PRE, Scr10Xba.1-PRE, P{C4-418bis}-PRE, and eve-PRE300. Of these, 3 displayed ectopic expression when combined with <italic>ph</italic>, in eye disc clones, in comparison with a low-level patterned expression in control discs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s006">S6A–S6H Fig</xref>). The exception was the <italic>eve</italic> PRE, reported to act as an enhancer in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref044">44</xref>], which we found unaltered in <italic>ph</italic> clones in the eye disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s006">S6G and S6H Fig</xref>). This could be consistent with the notion that a putative activator responsible for activation in the embryo might not be present in the eye disc.</p>
<p>We also surveyed a resource of developmental enhancer elements (‘Vienna Tiles’ collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref045">45</xref>]) for other available reporters that overlapped with previously-mapped PcG binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref043">43</xref>]. We identified several enhancer reporter lines that contained PREs and combined 4 more with the <italic>ph</italic> mutation. Since this collection was developed with a Gal4 read-out, the MARCM system would be incompatible so we generated <italic>ph</italic> clones using the ubi-RFP twin-spot system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref046">46</xref>], thus <italic>ph</italic> clones are negatively marked in this case (absence of RFP signal). Although the Gal4 antibody had some background, we could observe stronger staining within <italic>ph</italic> clones (non-RFP tissue) for 3 out of 4 tested Vienna-Gal4 enhancer reporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s006">S6I–S6L Fig</xref>). These were reporters in proximity of <italic>charlatan</italic> (<italic>chn</italic>, where responsive clones were mostly detected in eye disc regions anterior to the morphogenetic furrow), <italic>Abd-A</italic> (responsive clones tended to be in more posterior regions) and <italic>Abd-B</italic> (more common in clones posterior to the furrow, although we noted a weaker signal in this case). The last VT-Gal4 reporter did not show upregulation in <italic>ph</italic> clones, as its expression was uniform/low across the entire disc (both RFP+/- cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s006">S6L Fig</xref>). Together, these data suggest that some cis-regulatory elements may have a dual function as enhancer reporter lines show de-repression in the absence of <italic>ph</italic> silencing. The region-specific biases that were observed will need to be tested with better reporters, yet are consistent with the proposed function of additional activators in a tissue- or region-specific manner.</p>
<p>The use of a reporter responsive to both loss of <italic>ph</italic> and the JNK transcription factor AP-1 supports a role for JNK-dependent activation of at least some PcG target genes in the absence of PRC1 function. These data suggest that loss of <italic>ph</italic> may render a permissive chromatin state at targets that are normally silenced during development, but additional factors such as signalling activators may also play a role in tumorigenesis. This points out that further regulatory complexity needs to be considered in addition to loss of repressive complexes in order to understand tumour-driving gene expression programs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When we consider the lifespan and complexity of multicellular organisms, the emergence of cancer is a rather rare event, yet with severe destructive consequences. This points to the existence of fail-safe mechanisms that ensure tissue homeostasis and are often efficient in protecting the organism, by mounting a response to damage or eliminating abnormal cells arising from stochastic or mutagenic events. Motivated by shared similarities between faithful regenerative responses and tumour onset, which activate common pathways, we sought to dissect context-specific properties.</p>
<p>Here, we have identified a tumour-specific signalling hierarchy in tissues with dysfunctional Polycomb silencing in the absence of <italic>ph</italic>. Our data suggested that the function of additional activators may be required for <italic>ph</italic> tumourigenesis in addition to aberrant signalling modules. Furthermore, this suggests a higher complexity in driving tumorigenic gene expression than previously anticipated.</p>

<title>Ectopic JNK, JAK/STAT and Notch signalling contribute to <italic>ph</italic> tumour development</title>
<p>Abnormal signalling has been widely reported in a many cancer types across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref048">48</xref>]. It is clear that cancer cells can utilize signalling modules to obtain growth advantage and invade healthy tissues, but it is often difficult to tease apart whether this is a consequence of transformation or an intrinsic feature of tumour onset. <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumour models are useful to study early transformation mechanisms, as genetic tools permit to study tumours after only a few rounds of cell division from the initiating clone.</p>
<p>We used specific reporters for three signalling pathways that were ectopically activated in <italic>ph</italic> tumours, and functionally tested to which extent they contributed to tumour growth (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">2</xref>). JAK/STAT and Notch signalling were previously noted to be upregulated in <italic>ph</italic> clones, and we also observed JNK activation in the majority of clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref018">18</xref>]. We developed a quantitative framework to measure the functional effect of blocking the three relevant pathways and found that all contribute to tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2F, 2I and 2L</xref>).</p>
<p>Impairment of JNK and JAK/STAT yielded a reduction in clone volume, as shown by a shift of the volume taken by large clones to mostly small or very few medium clones, but the number of clones arising was not greatly altered (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2F and 2I to 2C</xref>). Impairment of Notch also resulted in a marked decrease of clone volume, but in this case the number of recovered clones also decreased slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2L</xref>).</p>
<p>Applying similar approaches to other tumour models could be useful, as representative data will hardly translate the intrinsic complexity of tumour structures.</p>

<title>Crosstalk between signalling pathways activated in <italic>ph</italic> tumours</title>
<p>JNK, JAK/STAT and Notch have been implicated in a wide variety of processes, from normal development to damage responses or even other tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref049">49</xref>]. JNK emerges as a central stress pathway activated in several contexts and leading to a range of behaviours including apoptotic cell elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref034">34</xref>]. It is commonly activated in tumours and is required for invasion and malignant phenotypes, mediated for instance by its target Mmp1 or in cooperation with other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref051">51</xref>]. JAK/STAT has been linked with stem cell niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref049">49</xref>] but is also expressed in developing discs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref023">23</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g001">Fig 1E”</xref>) as well as during regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>]. A recent report proposes that, in response to tissue damage, JAK/STAT signalling enables cells with active JNK to survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref036">36</xref>], and pro-survival cues have also been described during appendage development and specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref052">52</xref>]. Finally, Notch has been long known to induce tissue hyperplasia, and can promote tumorigenesis in cooperation with additional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref053">53</xref>]. Following the observations that some of these pathways were activated in situations leading to opposing outcomes, such as regeneration and tumour formation, we dissected the signalling hierarchy characteristic of <italic>ph</italic> tumours.</p>
<p>Blocking JNK signalling did not greatly impact on JAK/STAT but led to significant abrogation of the Notch reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We were at first surprised by the lack of a dependency of JAK/STAT on JNK, as the ordered activation of the JAK/STAT ligand <italic>upd</italic> was shown to be JNK-dependent during disc regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>]. However, de-repression of <italic>upd</italic> ligands was previously shown in <italic>ph</italic> tumours, which could render a deregulated state to allow parallel signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>]. JNK was also shown to positively regulate an enhancer of upd3 in wing discs with disrupted polarity by knocking down <italic>dlg</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref018">18</xref>]. However, since there are additional ligands for the pathway, there could be alternative means to activate it. These observations, together with the data presented here, indicate that alternative mechanisms likely activate the JAK/STAT pathway in <italic>ph</italic> tumours, since JAK/STAT activity could still be detected with the 10xSTAT reporter. We also considered that non-canonical signalling activities were common in tumours unlike in developmentally regulated contexts, pointing to possible differences that might underlie distinct outcomes. We thus asked if conversely blocking JAK/STAT had an effect on JNK, and found that these two modules do seem to act in parallel in <italic>ph</italic> tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Notch signalling was also unaffected by blocking JAK/STAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g004">Fig 4</xref>), and impairing Notch signal transduction led to abrogation of its own reporter but had no effect on JNK and a mild effect on JAK/STAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These data suggested that Notch could function downstream of JNK, but this axis likely acts in parallel to JAK/STAT (model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). The slight effect on the JAK/STAT reporter was mostly contributed by its decrease in smaller clones, which may be connected to modulation of survival in response to JNK, as shown to be mediated by JAK/STAT in tissue recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref036">36</xref>]. It can also be due to Notch-mediated regulation of <italic>upd</italic>, which had previously been shown during eye disc development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref030">30</xref>]. Whether cell-autonomous or non-autonomous regulation occurs in <italic>ph</italic> clones remains to be tested, as both cases were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref029">29</xref>]. It will be interesting to examine in more detail whether Notch can play a similar role in promoting survival, which can be expected due to its ability to induce tissue hyperplasia and also by our observations that blocking Notch led to a decrease in the number of recovered <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g002">Fig 2L</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the plethora of responses directed by all these pathways, delineating epistatic relationships among them has been done in a small range of contexts. An elegant exception was the identification of a synergistic cooperation between Src/JNK and activated Notch, leading to increased malignancy in addition to hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref011">11</xref>]. In this situation, JAK/STAT was reported to act downstream of JNK, which was in turn activated by synergistic Src/N activation. However, N<sup>act</sup> was used as the initial trigger to carry out a screen for modifiers of the hyperplasia phenotype. Therefore, despite the different hierarchies found in this study, the early requirement for Notch was an intrinsic feature of that model. Together, these studies point to a prevailing involvement of these pathways in supporting tumour formation, although there may be context-specific mechanisms that need to be further explored.</p>

<title>Absence of <italic>ph</italic> renders a permissive state that may require additional activators</title>
<p>Intrigued by the parallel function of JNK and JAK/STAT in <italic>ph</italic> tumours, in contrast to a rather linear sequence during regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref019">19</xref>], we asked whether collective signalling through both cascades could yield tumorigenic-like properties. However, expression of upstream components triggering JNK or JAK/STAT, either alone or in combination, did not seem to recapitulate aberrations typically seen in tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that additional elements were required to develop tumours in addition to simultaneous JNK and JAK/STAT. We thus asked how genes could become deregulated in tumourigenesis, in particular how PcG targets that are silenced during development get de-repressed in <italic>ph</italic> tumours. Although some examples were previously examined, namely members of the Notch and JAK/STAT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref054">54</xref>], we found that de-repression may be dependent on additional regulation. We showed that at least three PcG target genes were not generally expressed throughout the majority of <italic>ph</italic> clones, and their endogenous pattern was rather interrupted when <italic>ph</italic> clones grew in those regions of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, loss of <italic>ph</italic> seems to render a permissive state that may still require positive inputs for expression of PcG targets, rather than global de-repression. Together with early observations of irradiation-induced <italic>ph</italic> clones in wing discs, where upregulation of several PcG targets was compartment-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref015">15</xref>], these data suggest a more complex modulation of gene expression in tumorigenesis. There could be a role for other activators, as proposed for <italic>Ci</italic>-dependent regulation of dpp-lacZ in <italic>ph</italic> clones solely in the anterior compartment of wing discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>We propose that transcription factors acting downstream of the involved signalling pathways seem reasonable candidate activators to counteract reduced Polycomb repression, which will need to be broadly tested in future studies. We hypothesized that a combinatorial function of activators in a permissive state resulting from abrogation of PRC1 could synergistically contribute to tumorigenesis in <italic>ph</italic> clones. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that some PREs can have a dual functionality as enhancer elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref044">44</xref>]. Some enhancers and their target genes were also shown to become more broadly expressed in embryos lacking <italic>ph</italic>, favouring the possibility that developmental transcription factors can activate target genes in broader domains when Polycomb silencing is abrogated. This is also supported by our observations that 6/8 additional PRE reporters with enhancer functions became de-repressed in <italic>ph</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), some of them with a region-specific pattern, resembling the previous report of <italic>dpp</italic> in wing discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>We used a reporter that integrated JNK inputs and contained a PRE, enabling us to test the possibility of overlapping requirements in a particular context. In this case, we had a data-driven candidate regarding a particular activator, based on previously described JNK input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref034">34</xref>]. We observed that reporter expression in <italic>ph</italic> clones required JNK-dependent inputs from the canonical transcription factor AP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007187.g007">Fig 7</xref>), suggesting that both loss of repression and activators may play a role to drive tumorigenic gene expression. In light of the dual functionality of cis-regulatory elements as PREs and enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref044">44</xref>], the absence of <italic>ph</italic> may lead to a state where some ectopic activators become able to target enhancers that were previously unavailable. This would also be in line with a recent observation that embryonic H3K27me3 prevents unscheduled accumulation of H3K27ac (active enhancer mark) at regulatory regions, with precocious activation of lineage-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref055">55</xref>]. The global effects in altered chromatin dynamics, and the involvement of signalling-dependent and other activators, remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Our analyses established a signalling hierarchy in <italic>ph</italic> tumours that does not follow the ordered activation of JAK/STAT downstream of JNK as shown in regeneration. These differences may be at the basis of distinct outcomes despite utilization of the same modules, as it is currently unknown how signalling inputs are integrated to achieve a variety of cellular behaviours. For instance, JNK has been implicated in transient downregulation of PcG silencing to allow cellular reprogramming during regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref056">56</xref>], but full abrogation of <italic>ph</italic> likely results in a peculiar chromatin state. Alterations in the local chromatin environment may permit signalling-induced transcription factors to target previously inaccessible elements. Thus, the overlap of signalling-dependent regulation with context-defining chromatin states may prime tissue responses towards faithful or damaging outcomes. It will be rewarding to explore how signalling pathways can instruct different responses at a genomic level, which will be aided by emerging technologies.</p>

<title>Quantitative measurements of <italic>ph</italic> clone volumes</title>
<p>We developed a pipeline to obtain accurate measurements of GFP-marked clone volumes in eye discs. To automate image segmentation and identification of clones across imaginal discs, we used Ilastik (Interactive Learning and Segmentation Toolkit, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ilastik.org" xlink:type="simple">ilastik.org</ext-link>) to build an unbiased supervised learning classification of clone regions and surrounding tissue (with 4–5 discs). Confocal images of tumoral discs were acquired with a 0.8–1 μm z-stacks, usually with 28–35 stacks per disc. The classification method was then used for the test set of discs (up to 50 per condition) as well as upon blocking each signalling pathway. After unbiased classification of clones, a Matlab script (kindly developed by Aaron Ponti, SCF, D-BSSE) was used to enable us to use Imaris (Bitplane) to obtain volume data for each spatially defined clone, and the respective total clone number per disc. This methodology is therefore useful to robustly obtain tri-dimensional (volume) information of tumour clones, which have a considerable z-component, while control clones remain in the epithelial plane and thus ‘clonal area’ is generally measured in the field. This approach enabled us to obtain a distribution of clone volumes grouped into three categories (small, medium and large), fitting their contribution to the total tumour (GFP) volume per disc (large: more than 20%, medium: 2–20%, small: less than 2%). We could then build upon this quantitative description when blocking each signalling pathway, and thus capture the full dynamic range of the response in an unbiased manner.</p>
<p>For control (neutral FRT19A clones) in otherwise wild-type discs (or with transgenes to block signalling, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2C–S2G Fig</xref>), we measured the area occupied by the clones (GFP) and the remaining eye-antenna disc tissue, since these discs were flat (clone volume would not be appropriate for these). We used z-projection of ~3–6 stacks per disc, to obtain the focus of the epithelial layer and thus measure the maximum area of the flat disc. We then segmented the GFP-marked regions (with an automated tool to avoid detection by the user) within the DAPI-delimited tissue outline and measured the area taken by GFP and non-GFP territories, both in ‘black FRT19A’ clones only, and those additionally expressing transgenes to block the three pathways studied. We plotted the proportion of the GFP/non-GFP regions measured in each condition (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007187.s002">S2C–S2G Fig</xref>).

The endogenous expression of the reporters in control discs is shown on the right panels <bold>(B,D,F)</bold>, respectively. Although the eve-PRE300 was reported to be de-repressed in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007187.ref044">44</xref>], the expression pattern in eye-antennal discs with <italic>ph</italic> clones <bold>(G)</bold> was similar to that of control discs <bold>(H)</bold>, pointing to an embryonic specificity for the activity of this enhancer/PRE. <bold>(I-L)</bold> Four additional developmental enhancers that overlapped with PcG binding sites were also tested (from the Vienna Tiles Gal4 collection): VT17013-gal4 (<italic>chn</italic>) <bold>(I-I”)</bold>, VT42795-gal4 (<italic>Abd-A</italic>) <bold>(J-J”)</bold>, VT42867-gal4 (<italic>Abd-B</italic>) <bold>(K-K”)</bold> and VT33934-gal4 (<italic>CG34260</italic>) <bold>(L-L”)</bold>. Tissue morphology is shown on the first row of this set (DAPI staining), and <italic>ph</italic> clones are now marked by the absence of RFP signal (red, second row) (twin-spot clones as the gal4 reporters would not be compatible with MARCM clones). Anti-Gal4 staining was used to detect reporter expression (bottom row, in green).

The last reporter tested <bold>(L”)</bold> was not responsive throughout the disc, showing a homogeneous background that similar to that seen in control discs.

<title>Diagram depicting signalling hierarchies in <italic>ph</italic> tumours and regenerative tissue recovery.</title>
<p>The current model underlying the crosstalk between signalling pathways in the context of <italic>ph</italic> tumorigenesis is represented on the left, while the involvement of the same modules during regeneration is shown on the right. Different signalling hierarchies are observed in each context and can thus point to distinct outcomes.</p>
