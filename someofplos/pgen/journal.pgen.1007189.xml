<abstract>
<p>Circadian clocks are molecular timekeeping mechanisms that allow organisms to anticipate daily changes in their environment. The fundamental cellular basis of these clocks is delayed negative feedback gene regulation with PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME containing protein complexes as main inhibitory elements. For a correct circadian period, it is essential that such clock protein complexes accumulate in the nucleus in a precisely timed manner, a mechanism that is poorly understood. We performed a systematic RNAi-mediated screen in human cells and identified 15 genes associated with the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation machinery, whose expression is important for circadian clock dynamics. Among them was Transportin 1 (TNPO1), a non-classical nuclear import carrier, whose knockdown and knockout led to short circadian periods. TNPO1 was found in endogenous clock protein complexes and particularly binds to PER1 regulating its (but not PER2’s) nuclear localization. While PER1 is also transported to the nucleus by the classical, Importin β-mediated pathway, TNPO1 depletion slowed down PER1 nuclear import rate as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. In addition, we found that TNPO1-mediated nuclear import may constitute a novel input pathway of how cellular redox state signals to the clock, since redox stress increases binding of TNPO1 to PER1 and decreases its nuclear localization. Together, our RNAi screen knocking down import carriers (but also export carriers) results in short and long circadian periods indicating that the regulatory pathways that control the timing of clock protein subcellular localization are far more complex than previously assumed. TNPO1 is one of the novel players essential for normal circadian periods and potentially for redox regulation of the clock.</p>

<p>Circadian clocks are endogenous timekeeping mechanisms allowing organisms to anticipate daily changes in their environment. In mammals, the fundamental mechanism of these clocks is a delayed negative feedback loop, in which timely auto-repression of clock components is essential. This repression occurs at a transcriptional level and requires clock proteins to enter the nucleus in a precisely timed manner, a regulation that is little understood. We performed a systematic genetic screen for factors modulating subcellular localization in oscillating human cells and identified Transportin 1 (TNPO1) as a non-classical carrier protein required for a normal circadian period. The primary target of TNPO1 within the circadian clockwork is PERIOD1, whose nuclear shuttling is modulated by TNPO1. In addition, TNPO1-mediated nuclear import may constitute a novel input pathway of how cellular redox state signals to the clock, since redox stress increases binding of TNPO1 to PER1 and decreases its nuclear localization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that have evolved in almost all eukaryotes to anticipate daily rhythms in their environment. In mammals, circadian rhythm generation is a cell-autonomous process with transcriptional-translational feedback loops as fundamental mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref001">1</xref>]. A key step is the rhythmic inhibition of the CLOCK-BMAL1 transactivation activity by a negative feedback complex that contains PER and CRY proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref002">2</xref>], which thereby inhibit their own expression. Circadian oscillations only occur because this negative feedback is delayed, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. after complex maturation, modification and nuclear translocation of PER and CRY proteins. While it is widely accepted that the regulation of subcellular localization of negative feedback components is a critical step for the generation of a normal near-24-hour period, our understanding of the mechanisms of nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of mammalian clock proteins is limited.</p>
<p>Several studies highlighted the importance of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of clock proteins for the regulation of subcellular localization. For example, oscillations in nuclear abundance of CLOCK-BMAL1 are largely dominated by rhythmicity of BMAL1 protein and its PTMs, since overall CLOCK levels are barely rhythmic and the absolute abundance of BMAL1 protein seems to be much lower than of CLOCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref003">3</xref>]. Thus, BMAL1 levels are likely rate limiting for CLOCK-BMAL1 nuclear abundance. Indeed, BMAL1 is required for nuclear localization of CLOCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref004">4</xref>], and nucleo-cytoplasmatic shuttling of BMAL1 seems to play an essential role for it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref005">5</xref>]. A critical signal in this context is the phosphorylation of BMAL1 at Ser90 mediated by CK2α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref006">6</xref>], which promotes CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimerization and—probably thereby—nuclear accumulation of both proteins.</p>
<p>Circadian inhibition of CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional activity is fundamentally determined by the precisely timed activity of the PER/CRY complex. This nuclear complex has been found to be bigger than 1 MDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref002">2</xref>] and consists–in addition of PER and CRY proteins–of several additional proteins that are likely recruited to the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer to contribute to transcriptional shutdown. Thus, the timing of nuclear localization and activity of this complex as well as its inactivation is of critical importance for circadian period. PTMs of PER and CRY proteins play dominant roles in this context. PER and CRY proteins are heavily phosphorylated in a circadian manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref003">3</xref>] regulating their subcellular localization as well as stability, which ultimately impacts in the nuclear activity of the PER/CRY complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref013">13</xref>]. As it is the case for CLOCK and BMAL1, also PER and CRY proteins support each other’s nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref015">15</xref>], thus anything affecting PER or CRY protein stability will likely also influence the activity of the inhibitory complex as a whole. PER proteins are the rate limiting component of the PER/CRY complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref016">16</xref>] and have been suggested to be primarily responsible for the timely nuclear accumulation of the dominant CLOCK/BMAL1 repressors–the CRY proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref019">19</xref>]. Thus, PER stability as well as nuclear accumulation dynamics is of utmost importance for circadian rhythm generation.</p>
<p>These studies demonstrate the critical role of timely nuclear localization of clock proteins for circadian rhythm generation. The precise molecular mechanism, by which nuclear localization of clock proteins occurs, however, is very little understood. Because of their size and the fact that they form various complexes already in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref002">2</xref>], clock proteins cannot passively diffuse into the nucleus but have to be actively transported through the nuclear pore <italic>via</italic> nuclear import carriers. The predominant, “classical” nuclear import pathway involving Importin α and β, which recognize so-called classical nuclear localization signals (cNLS), seems to play an important role in this context. Within the last two decades several functional cNLS were identified in clock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref023">23</xref>]. Indeed, misregulation of Importin α2 (KPNA2) impairs clock development and alters the localization of PER proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref024">24</xref>]. Also RNAi-mediated downregulation of Importin β (KNPB1) affects circadian dynamics probably by decreasing nuclear localization of PER and CRY proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>While these studies focused on specific components of the classical nuclear import pathway, the fact that ~60 different proteins comprise the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation machinery, suggests a much more complex regulation. Here, we present a systematic approach to test the impact of 62 genes involved in nuclear-cytosolic translocation for circadian rhythm generation. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown and live cell bioluminescence recording of circadian rhythms in reporter cells, we identify fifteen of those genes whose expression is essential for normal circadian dynamics. Among them was Transportin 1 (TNPO1), a non-classical nuclear import carrier, whose knockdown or knockout led to short circadian periods. One cargo of TNPO1 is PER1; it interacts with TNPO1, and its (but not PER2’s) nuclear accumulation as well as nuclear import kinetics is reduced upon <italic>Tnpo1</italic> knockdown. Interestingly, oxidative stress conditions increased binding between TNPO1 and PER1 and impaired nuclear PER1 import suggesting that TNPO1-mediated PER1 nuclear localization is a redox-sensitive input into the circadian clock.</p>

<title>The non-classical nuclear import carrier TNPO1 regulates circadian rhythms</title>
<p>To identify nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation associated genes essential for circadian dynamics we RNAi-knocked down the expression of 62 genes of the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation machinery. These included 29 nuclear pore complex components as well as 27 nuclear import and export carriers. Human osteosarcoma (U-2 OS) reporter cells—an established and robust cellular clock model—expressing luciferase from a <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter fragment were transduced with up to three shRNA constructs per target gene, and circadian luciferase activity rhythms were monitored over a period of one week. Fifteen genes turned out to be essential for normal ~24 hour period length. The depletion of nine of them led to period lengthening and six of them to period shortening (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s010">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Interestingly, while the genes whose knockdown led to longer periods included the classical import carrier <italic>Kpnb1</italic> (also known as Importin β), depletion of the alternative nuclear import carrier <italic>Tnpo1</italic> (also known as Karyopherin β2) led to an opposite period phenotype shortening the circadian period by 1–1.5 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). In addition, knockdown of <italic>Tnpo1</italic> altered clock gene expression resulting in early phases of circadian rhythms and–in particular for the <italic>Period</italic> genes–also in reduced overall expression levels (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Together, these data suggest the existence of a yet unknown nuclear import pathway important for circadian oscillations.</p>

<p>U-2 OS <italic>Bmal1-</italic>luciferase reporter cells were transduced with RNAi constructs targeting 62 genes associated with nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation and bioluminescence rhythms were recorded for several days. Significant period alteration compared to non-silencing controls (ns, blue) was determined by one-way ANOVA of all constructs targeting one gene; a Dunnetts posttest assessed the effects of individual constructs. Multiple testing was corrected for by a Bonferroni-Holm correction. Horizontal dotted lines indicate two standard deviations of the ns control period. Targeting <italic>Fbxl3</italic> was used as positive control (green). Genes for which at least two shRNA constructs led to a significant period alteration in the same direction are labeled (red dots); non-significant values are depicted in grey; dot size indicates the significance of period deviation: smallest: 0.05 &gt; q &gt; 0.005, medium: 0.005 &gt; q &gt; 0.001, largest: q &lt; 0.001). When only one RNAi construct was available for gene knockdown, period deviation is depicted as empty circle (error bars = SD, n = 3).</p>

<p>To validate these results, we created a total <italic>Tnpo1</italic> knockout cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. We lentivirally transduced U-2 OS reporter cells with CRISPR/Cas9 vectors harboring different guide RNAs (gRNA1 and gRNA2), selected for positively transduced cells and tested circadian dynamics. One of the two tested guide RNAs (gRNA1) caused a significant period shortening of the cell population by ~1 hour (gRNA1; p &lt; 0.001) as well as an efficient depletion of TNPO1 protein, while gRNA2 was ineffective with regard to both period shortening and protein depletion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). To test, whether we obtained a total knockout of the <italic>Tnpo1</italic> gene in the gRNA1 targeted cells, we performed limited dilution and sequenced the single cell clones to detect insertions or deletions (indels) causing shifts of the open reading frame. From the identified six single cell clones with indels on both <italic>Tnpo1</italic> alleles, only one had indels causing frame shifts that lead to premature STOP codons in the open reading frame of <italic>Tnpo1</italic>. As expected from the cell population, this total knockout clone also displayed ~1–1.5 hour shorter circadian rhythms as well as no detectable TNPO1 protein expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>PER and CRY proteins contain functional TNPO1 recognition motifs</title>
<p>In contrast to classical nuclear localization signals, most TNPO1 cargoes contain non-classical motifs, so called M9 NLSs. While M9 NLSs are less well defined compared to classical NLSs, most M9 NLSs contain a PY motif (23 out of 24 known TNPO1 cargos; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref026">26</xref>]). In addition, it has been shown that TNPO1 interaction to e.g. FOXO4 is independent of M9 NLSs and rather mediated by covalent intermolecular disulfide bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref027">27</xref>]. If the period shortening upon <italic>Tnpo1</italic> depletion is a direct effect on the core circadian oscillator, canonical clock proteins might be direct targets of TNPO1 and thus might contain recognition motifs in their primary structure. To identify potential TNPO1-binding sites in circadian clock proteins, we searched for putative M9 NLSs in the protein sequences of BMAL1, CLOCK, CRY1, CRY2, PER1 and PER2. In addition to classical NLSs, five of the investigated clock proteins contain at least one evolutionary conserved PY motif (CRY1, CRY2, PER1, PER2 and BMAL1; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s011">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Due to the lack of structural knowledge, for many of these motifs it is unknown, whether they are surface-exposed in the native protein. Nevertheless, we tested, whether these sequences (40–50 amino acids) are in principle able to promote nuclear localization in a TNPO1-dependent manner. To this end, we expressed them as fusion proteins with cyan or yellow fluorescent protein (CFP or YFP) and analyzed the subcellular localization of these fusion proteins in U-2 OS and HEK293 cells either with or without endogenous TNPO1. While six of the ten investigated clock protein-derived PY-peptides could not drive CFP in the nucleus, four PER and CRY peptides promoted CFP nuclear localization similar to a positive control peptide derived from the known TNPO1 cargo hnRNP A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref028">28</xref>]. These effects were at least in part TNPO1-dependent, since nuclear localization of the fusion proteins was diminished when endogenous <italic>Tnpo1</italic> was downregulated (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). In addition, mutation analyses showed that the TNPO1-promoted nuclear localization of the YFP fusion protein does not only depend on the presence of the PY-motif, but also of upstream basic residues that have been suggested to contribute to TNPO1 recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref029">29</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Together, these data are compatible with a role for TNPO1 in regulating the nuclear localization of the negative limb circadian clock proteins.</p>

<title>PER proteins interact with TNPO1</title>
<p>To test whether TNPO1 interacts with endogenous circadian clock proteins, we analyzed nuclear circadian clock protein complexes in unsynchronized U-2 OS cells using immunoprecipitation with two different anti-CLOCK or control IgG antibodies followed by mass spectrometry. Indeed, endogenous TNPO1 was found to be part of such complexes together with known circadian clock proteins such as CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, CRY1 and others (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). To test for binding of TNPO1 to PER and CRY proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells with epitope-tagged clock proteins but only detected very weak if any interaction signals (not shown). To increase the sensitivity of detecting also transient interactions, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using a luciferase-based readout. Since the putative TNPO1 recognition motifs of CRY proteins are not surface-accessible in the native protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref031">31</xref>] we focused on PER proteins as established regulators of the negative feedback complex’s subcellular localization. MYC-tagged TNPO1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cell lysates also containing PER1 or PER2 fused to full-length firefly luciferase. In addition, switching the orientation of the assay, we immunoprecipitated V5-tagged PER1 and PER2 and tested for TNPO1-luciferase binding. Only for PER1 a consistent and significant interaction with TNPO1 was detected in both orientations of the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>), while PER2 was only weakly detected in TNPO1-complexes (and <italic>vice versa</italic>). These results are further supported by luciferase complementation experiments where full-length PER proteins and TNPO1 were expressed as fusion proteins with firefly C- and N-terminal luciferase fragments in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref032">32</xref>]. Upon binding of PERs with TNPO1, a functional luciferase is reconstituted whose activity was measured in cell lysates. In this assay, PER1 and to a lesser extent (not significant) also PER2 but not the negative control βGAL promoted luciferase complementation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). Taken together, in both types of binding assays PER1 showed a robust interaction with TNPO1, while TNPO1 binding to PER2 was less reliably detectable suggesting that PER1 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> cargo of TNPO1. This is further supported by results from immunoprecipitation experiments using U-2 OS cells stably expressing a PER1-luciferase fusion protein, where we detected specific interaction with PER1 upon immunoprecipitation of endogenous TNPO1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To investigate, which region of the PER1 sequence is responsible for TNPO1 interaction, we generated truncated versions of PER1, which lack either one or two C-terminal PY-motifs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g003">Fig 3D</xref> top</bold>).

<title>Nuclear localization of PER1 is regulated by TNPO1</title>
<p>It has been shown that the classical Importin α/β pathway has a dominant role for nuclear localization of PER proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref020">20</xref>]; yet we still detected substantial nuclear staining of a PER1-Venus fusion protein, whose classical NLS has been mutated, which is further increased when nuclear export is pharmacologically inhibited (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>).

<p>Interestingly, increased binding upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment did not lead to an increased nuclear import–on the contrary.

This effect was TNPO1-dependent and specific for PER1, since H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treatment neither affected PER1 localization in <italic>Tnpo1</italic>-depleted cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>) nor did it alter PER2-Venus subcellular localization (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). In addition, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treatment also affected the subcellular localization of the truncated version PER1<sub>1-924</sub>-Venus, but not the shorter PER1<sub>1-706</sub>-Venus version (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007189.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007189.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nuclear localization of circadian clock proteins at the right time of day–in particular of the negative limb–is crucial for circadian dynamics, since it defines the delay in negative feedback that determines the endogenous period. For example, in the nucleus PER and CRY proteins are thought to be almost exclusively present in a large 1.9 MDa complex. In the cytoplasm, however, PER and CRY proteins are incorporated into at least four (putative precursor) complexes of ∼0.9–1.1 MDa, two of which include PER1 but not PER2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref002">2</xref>]. Given the sizes of these complexes, active nuclear transport involving specialized import carriers is required for a directed and timely nuclear localization. Here, we show that nuclear shuttling of clock proteins (specifically PER1) is far more complex than previously assumed. Using systematic genetic perturbation of more than 60 components involved in nuclear-cytosolic translocation, we identified Transportin 1 (among others)—a non-classical nuclear import carrier—to be essential for a normal circadian period. TNPO1 interacts with PER1’s C-terminal region and is required for its timely nuclear localization, while TNPO1 depletion has no effect on PER2 localization.</p>
<p>Yet, both PER proteins also contain recognition motifs for the classical import mediated by the Importinα/β pathway that has been shown to be also critical for PER protein localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref035">35</xref>] as well as correct circadian period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref025">25</xref>]. This implies that at least PER1 (and maybe also associated proteins) is transported to the nucleus by the classical pathway as well as the non-classical pathway via TNPO1. In fact, upon mutation of the classical NLS, the nuclear localization of PER1 is not completely abolished. It is not uncommon that one protein can be transported in the nucleus by more than one carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref026">26</xref>]. Importantly, we do not exclude that TNPO1 has additional cargoes, whose timely transport is important for circadian dynamics. For example, although the PY-motifs found in CRY proteins are not surface-exposed in the native proteins, it is formally possible that CRYs bind to TNPO1 <italic>via</italic> their (reactive) cysteine residues that can occur in an oxidized state in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>It is intriguing that the effect on the circadian period upon knockdown of Importin β or TNPO1 goes in the opposite direction–long for Importin β depletion and short for TNPO1 depletion—although the depletion of both carriers leads to attenuated nuclear localization of PER1. This may be explained by the higher specificity of TNPO1 for primarily PER1-containing cytosolic sub-complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref002">2</xref>], while Importin β probably contributes to shuttling of all PER/CRY complexes in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref025">25</xref>]. While the short period upon TNPO1 depletion is in agreement with the short period in wheel running behavior of <italic>Per1</italic> knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref037">37</xref>], a mechanistic explanation is still difficult, since we do not fully understand, whether PER1 is the only TNPO1 cargo relevant for circadian dynamics, whether PER1-containing complexes are shuttled at different circadian times and with a different kinetics and whether (compared to PER2) PER1 has a fundamentally different role in the nucleus. We speculate that <italic>Tnpo1</italic> knockdown blocks an efficient nuclear transport of PER1 leading to an altered composition of the nuclear PER/CRY complex with more PER2 occupying the “PER slots” in the complex. We hypothesize that a complex with more PER2 has a higher repressive potential (which may explain the lower transcript levels of <italic>Per</italic> genes upon <italic>Tnpo1</italic> knockdown). This is in agreement with recent data from the Weitz lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref002">2</xref>] showing that loss of PER1 or PER2 differentially affects the actions of CK1δ within the nuclear PER complex, which might have an effect on its repressive power. An alternative hypothesis may be that <italic>Tnpo1</italic> knockdown allows PER1 to incorporate into the PER/CRY complexes more rapidly leading to a faster “maturation” and shuttling of the nuclear complex, since the competition between Importin β-mediated and TNPO1-mediated nuclear translocation is shifted towards the presumably faster Importin β-mediated shuttling. This might lead to both a more efficient transcriptional repression (reflected by lower transcript levels of <italic>Per</italic> genes) and a shorter period.</p>
<p>In recent years, it became increasingly obvious that cellular redox state and the canonical transcriptional-translational circadian clock are intimately linked (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref038">38</xref>]). Yet, while it is well accepted that redox state is under circadian regulation and feeds back to the clock (also as possible adaptation to redox stress) the underlying molecular mechanisms are very poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional link between redox state and circadian clock by showing that TNPO1-PER1 interaction is strengthened upon oxidative stress—very similar to the effects observed for other TNPO1 cargoes, i.e. FOXO4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref027">27</xref>] and DJ-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref033">33</xref>]. Whether this increased binding occurs via disulfide bonds (as for the FOXO-TNPO1 interaction) is currently unclear, but it is conceivable given the reactive cysteine residues described for PER proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref036">36</xref>]. In fact, both truncation of the C-terminal ~500 amino acids of PER1 that contain two PY-motifs and seven conserved cysteine residues as well as mutation of all these residues abolished TNPO1 binding. Since for PER2 C-terminal cysteine residues (amino acids 1210 and 1213 of mPER2) have been implicated in CRY1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref036">36</xref>], it is possible that also for PER1 such C-terminal cysteine residues are relevant for CRY binding. Further work is needed to pinpoint the exact location and characterize a potentially differential role of the putative reactive cysteine residues in PER1.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, increased binding to TNPO1 upon oxidative stress did not lead to accelerated nuclear import–on the contrary, import was slowed down. This was very specific for PER1 and TNPO1, since firstly PER2 import rate was unaffected by redox stress and secondly redox stress had not effect on PER1 import kinetics when TNPO1 was depleted. We can only speculate, why increased binding of PER1-TNPO1 leads to slower import (similar to <italic>Tnpo1</italic> knockdown): We probably observe in FRAP experiments the combined effect of Importin β and TNPO1 on PER1 import rate. Assuming that Importin β-mediated transport is faster than TNPO1-mediated transport, a stronger binding to TNPO1 might shift the relative contribution of the two carriers towards the slower one. Preventing PER1 nuclear localization in oxidative conditions might be a mechanism to boost the expression of the antioxidant defense master regulator <italic>Nrf2</italic>, a CLOCK/BMAL1 target gene that can it is inhibited by PER/CRY complex in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref039">39</xref>]. In addition, PER1 has been assigned an anti-apoptotic role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref041">41</xref>], thus a reduced nuclear localization of PER1 in oxidative conditions might be protective through promoting apoptosis. Future experiments are required to unravel the mechanisms and impact of TNPO1-mediated redox crosstalk to the clock.</p>
<p>Apart from TNPO1, we identified several additional players associated with nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation to be important for circadian dynamics. Again, knockdown of such components resulted in period changes with opposite directions even if they seem to be involved in similar processes. For example, knockdown of nuclear pore complex proteins NUP160, NUP153 or NUP85 led to long and knockdown of NUP54 to short periods for yet unknown reasons. Similarly, depletion of nuclear export carrier XPO1 (also known as Exportin 1) resulted in long period, while knockdown of RanBP16 (also known as Exportin 7) in short periods. The genes <italic>kpnb1</italic>, <italic>xpo1</italic>, <italic>sec13</italic>, which show a circadian phenotype upon knockdown in our screen, have been previously suggested to alter circadian dynamics upon knockdown or inhibition. KPNB1 mediates PER/CRY nuclear translocation and is required for a normal circadian clock function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref025">25</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibition of XPO1 has been shown to lengthen the circadian period in an inhibitor dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation protein SEC13 was identified as an essential component for normal circadian rhythm generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref042">42</xref>]. Different members of the kapα-family, KPNA1, KPNA3 and KPNA7 have been shown to bind to wild type CRY2 but not a cNLS mutant of the circadian clock protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref021">21</xref>]. In line with those findings, altered PER1/PER2 localization upon misregulation of <italic>kpna2</italic> expression was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref024">24</xref>]. However, we did not find alterations upon knockdown of individual members of the <italic>kapα</italic> family members, which may be due to redundancy or compensation effects by other members of this gene family. In general, in screening endeavors, negative results need to be carefully interpreted, because of such effects and because knockdown efficiency cannot be evaluated for every single shRNA construct.</p>
<p>Together, these data emphasize our lack in knowledge about how the cell achieves timely subcellular localization of clock protein complexes and its associated consequences for circadian dynamics. We predict several levels of complexity: (i) clock proteins have more than one carrier, e.g. PER1 (and associated proteins) is transported by Importin β and TNPO1; (ii) transport processes might be regulated in a time-dependent manner; e.g. <italic>Tnpo1</italic> transcript levels are rhythmic (almost in-phase with <italic>Per1</italic>) and anti-phasic to <italic>Importin β</italic> transcript rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref044">44</xref>]; (iii) signaling may have an impact on the relative usage of the alternative carriers; e.g. redox stress increases interaction of PER1 with TNPO1 and slows down its nuclear import. Considering a similar complexity for nuclear export processes of both clock proteins and clock mRNAs, it becomes obvious that much more work is needed to unravel such regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, the work presented here identifying TNPO1 as carrier for PER1, its role for circadian dynamics as well as its regulation by cellular redox state is a first step in this direction.</p>

After the final wash of the ChIP, proteins bound to ChIP-grade agarose beads (Cell Signaling) were digested into peptides as follows. First, 50 μl of digestion buffer (2 M urea in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT and 1 μg of trypsin) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Subsequently, beads were spin down and the supernatants collected and saved. Then, another 50 μl of 2 M urea in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mM chloroacetamide was added to the beads prior to incubation at 37°C for 5 min. Beads were then spin down and the supernatants were collected and combined with those saved from the previous step. The supernatant mixture was then incubated over-night at 25°C to complete protein digestion that was stopped in the morning by adding 1 μl trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were then cleaned for MS measurement using SDB-RPS stage tips as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007189.ref048">48</xref>].

<title>TNPO1 interacts with PER1.</title>
<p>HEK293 cells were cotransfected with renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase fragments (LUC1 or LUC2) fused to indicated proteins. LUC1 (the N-terminal fragment of luciferase) was fused N-terminally to TNPO1 (LUC1-TNPO1), whereas LUC2 (the C-terminal fragment of luciferase) was C-terminally fused to either PER1 (dark red, PER1-LUC2) or PER2 (red, PER2-LUC2). Upon binding of PERs with TNPO1, a functional luciferase is reconstituted whose activity was measured in cell lysates. CRY1 binding to PER proteins served as positive controls (green) and LUC2-<italic>β</italic>GAL as negative control (grey). Reconstituted firefly luciferase activity was normalized on full length renilla luciferase activity.
