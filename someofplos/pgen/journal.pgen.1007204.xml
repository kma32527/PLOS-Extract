<abstract>
<p>Across metazoans, cell cycle progression is regulated by E2F family transcription factors that can function as either transcriptional activators or repressors. For decades, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F family has been viewed as a streamlined RB/E2F network, consisting of one activator (dE2F1) and one repressor (dE2F2). Here, we report that an uncharacterized isoform of dE2F1, hereon called dE2F1b, plays an important function during development and is functionally distinct from the widely-studied dE2F1 isoform, dE2F1a. dE2F1b contains an additional exon that inserts 16 amino acids to the evolutionarily conserved Marked Box domain. Analysis of <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific mutants generated via CRISPR/Cas9 indicates that dE2F1b is a critical regulator of the cell cycle during development. This is particularly evident in endocycling salivary glands in which a tight control of dE2F1 activity is required. Interestingly, close examination of mitotic tissues such as eye and wing imaginal discs suggests that dE2F1b plays a repressive function as cells exit from the cell cycle. We also provide evidence demonstrating that dE2F1b differentially interacts with RBF1 and alters the recruitment of RBF1 and dE2F1 to promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that dE2F1b is a novel member of the E2F family, revealing a previously unappreciated complexity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RB/E2F network.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F1 (dE2F1) protein has been studied as one of the principal regulators of cell cycle control in both mitotic cells and cells undergoing a variant cell cycle called the endocycle. dE2F1 is the sole “activator” E2F of the highly streamlined <italic>Drosophila</italic> RB/E2F network. However, there has been evidence suggesting that this simplistic view of the activator E2F may not be true and that dE2F1 can also provide a repressive function. Elucidating the dual role of dE2F1 in transcriptional regulation has been elusive. In our report, we investigate an uncharacterized isoform of dE2F1 that we have termed as dE2F1b. Notably, the evolutionarily conserved Marked Box domain, which is important for target specificity and protein-protein interactions, is altered in this isoform. Our findings suggest that dE2F1b is required for proper cell cycle control in both mitotic and endocycling cells. Strikingly, we show that dE2F1b has repressive functions in a context-dependent manner. Overall, our findings reveal an unanticipated complexity to dE2F1, providing important insights into the dual function of dE2F1 in transcriptional regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The E2F family of transcription factors was first cloned as a cellular factor that binds to the Early E2 region of the adenovirus genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref001">1</xref>]. Since its discovery, families of E2F transcription factors have been identified in metazoans ranging from nematodes to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref002">2</xref>]. One of the important features of E2F transcription factors is their ability to bind to a consensus sequence, TTTCCCGC, which is commonly found in cell cycle-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref004">4</xref>]. While most E2Fs heterodimerize with DP to bind the consensus sequence, a subset of E2F proteins bind DNA without the help of DP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref005">5</xref>]. Regardless, the ability of multiple members of E2F to bind and regulate the same gene allows fine regulation of target gene expression during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>E2F family proteins can be classified as either “activators” or “repressors” based on their role in transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref006">6</xref>]. This classification was largely attributed by studies in fruit flies, which have only two E2F genes, <italic>de2f1</italic> and <italic>de2f2</italic>. Genetic and biochemical assays demonstrated that dE2F1 and dE2F2 have antagonistic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref007">7</xref>]. While both can directly bind to a common set of genes, dE2F1 promotes whereas dE2F2 represses transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref008">8</xref>]. As a consequence, the phenotype observed in <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant flies can be largely suppressed by inactivating dE2F2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref007">7</xref>]. The simplicity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F network provided an example in which the interplay between activator and repressor E2Fs coordinates target gene expression and cell cycle progression. Curiously, while the anti-proliferative effect of dE2F2 was clearly demonstrated in the <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant background, <italic>de2f2</italic> mutant flies do not display a strong cell cycle defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref009">9</xref>]. This suggests that in the presence of dE2F1, dE2F2’s role as a repressor is largely dispensable. Notably, there has been evidence suggesting a repressive role for dE2F1 during development, although the molecular mechanism underling this observation has been elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In mammals, E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 are considered to be activator E2Fs while E2F4 to 8 are considered to be repressor E2Fs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref002">2</xref>]. Since they have similar DNA-binding specificities, functional redundancies within activator and repressor E2Fs clearly exist. Indeed, all three activator E2Fs must be inactivated in mice to completely inhibit E2F-dependent transcription program and cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition, a study by Tsai <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that activator E2Fs can compensate for each other’s function as long as their expression is properly controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref013">13</xref>]. Specifically, Tsai <italic>et al</italic> generated mice expressing <italic>E2F1</italic> under the control of the <italic>E2F3</italic> promoter in the <italic>E2F1</italic> to <italic>3</italic> triple-mutant background. These mice are phenotypically similar to <italic>E2F1</italic> and <italic>E2F2</italic> double knockout mice and not to <italic>E2F2</italic> and <italic>E2F3</italic> double knockout mice. This study elegantly demonstrated that it is the expression pattern, not the protein sequence, that determines the functional specificity of activator E2Fs during mouse development.</p>
<p>Despite the genetic evidence showing similarities between the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of activator E2Fs, member-specific activities among mammalian activator E2Fs have been identified. A key molecular difference between activator E2Fs resides in the Marked Box (MB) domain. Domain swapping experiments coupled with transcriptome analysis revealed that the MB domain is responsible for generating E2F1- and E2F3-specific gene signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref014">14</xref>]. This finding was further supported by the observation that the MB domain mediates specific protein-protein interactions. For example, E2F3 was shown to specifically interact with an E-box transcription factor, TFE3, through the MB domain to cooperatively regulate target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref015">15</xref>]. The MB domain was also shown to be important for the physical interaction between E2Fs and the C-terminal (C-term) domain of RB family proteins in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref018">18</xref>]. Structural studies have identified amino acid residues that are important for member-specific interaction between E2F and RB family proteins. Interestingly, these residues include the key amino acids that mediate an E2F1-specific interaction with the RB tumor suppressor protein, pRB, that allows the pRB/E2F1 complex to silence repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref020">20</xref>]. Overall, the MB domain plays a crucial function, allowing members of activator E2Fs to carry out specific functions.</p>
<p>We recently reported that the fruit fly activator <italic>E2F</italic>, <italic>de2f1</italic>, is transcribed from multiple transcription start sites, and that specific promoters are required for proper cell cycle exit during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref021">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the annotated sequences show that an alternatively spliced isoform of <italic>de2f1</italic> is associated with the promoter we identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0011766.html" xlink:type="simple">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0011766.html</ext-link>). The alternatively spliced form, hereon referred as <italic>de2f1b</italic>, contains an extra exon that adds 48 nucleotides to the <italic>de2f1</italic> isoform that has been widely studied for more than two decades, hereon referred as <italic>de2f1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Notably, the additional exon of <italic>de2f1b</italic> alters the amino acid sequences within the MB domain. In this study, we provide evidence that dE2F1b is a novel member of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F family that is functionally distinct from dE2F1a. We demonstrate that dE2F1b is an essential isoform of dE2F1 through molecular complementation tests. While neither dE2F1a nor dE2F1b alone is sufficient to efficiently rescue the early larval lethality of <italic>de2f1</italic> mutants, co-expression of both isoforms is. In addition, generation of a <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific mutant via CRISPR/Cas9 revealed that dE2F1b is a critical regulator of the cell cycle. We also provide evidence to suggest that dE2F1b is required to negatively regulate E2F target gene expression in specific contexts although dE2F1 has been classified as an activator E2F. Overall, our study identifies dE2F1b as a novel member of E2F and reveals a previously unappreciated complexity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RB/E2F network.</p>

<title>Two alternatively spliced forms of <italic>de2f1</italic>, <italic>def1a</italic> and <italic>de2f1b</italic>, are required to rescue larval lethality of <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant flies.</title>
<p>(A) A schematic of the coding region of the <italic>de2f1</italic> gene showing the two alternatively spliced forms of <italic>de2f1</italic>, <italic>de2f1a</italic> and <italic>de2f1b</italic>. The exon highlighted in red indicates the <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific exon, exon 3b. Primer locations for absolute quantification of total <italic>de2f1</italic> and <italic>de2f1b</italic> are indicated in blue and red, respectively. (B) RT-qPCR is performed to estimate the absolute levels of the total <italic>de2f1</italic> RNA and <italic>de2f1b-</italic>specific RNA at different developmental stages (E: embryonic, L: larval, P: pupal and A: adult). The y-axis indicates the copy number per 1 unit of cDNA (1 unit of cDNA represents 25 ng of RNA). The error bars indicate standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) of triplicated independent biological replicates. (C) The copy numbers of the total <italic>de2f1</italic> RNA and <italic>de2f1b-</italic>specific RNA in indicated third instar larval tissues are determined. The graph shows the percentage contribution of the <italic>de2f1b-</italic>specific transcript to the total <italic>de2f1</italic>. Error bars indicate s.e.m. (D) Molecular complementation tests are performed in <italic>de2f1</italic> mutants by expressing either <italic>de2f1a</italic> or <italic>de2f1b</italic> alone or by expressing both. A survival curve from third instar larval stage (L3) to adult of indicated genotypes is presented. The percent survival is determined by comparing the observed frequency of survival to the expected frequency based on Mendelian ratio (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">materials and methods</xref>). (E) A control (<italic>yw</italic>), <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant (<italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>729</italic></sup><italic>/Df</italic>) and rescued (<italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>729</italic></sup><italic>/Df</italic>, <italic>UbiG4&gt;dE2F1+dE2Fb</italic>) larvae are shown.</p>

As a first step to gain insights into the biological function of <italic>de2f1b</italic>, we determined the expression level of total <italic>de2f1</italic> and <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific transcripts at different developmental stages. We performed quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) using RNA isolated from embryos, larvae, pupae, and adult flies, then calculated the copy number per unit of cDNA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">materials and methods</xref>). The copy number of total <italic>de2f1</italic> per unit of cDNA ranges from 1.4 X 10<sup>5</sup> to 3.7 X 10<sup>5</sup>, the lowest being at the pupal stage and the highest being at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The <italic>de2f1b</italic> transcript is expressed at a lower level, ranging from 1.6 X 10<sup>4</sup> to 5.6 X 10<sup>4</sup> copies per unit of cDNA. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>de2f1b</italic> peaks at the larval stage, 5.6 X 10<sup>4</sup> copies, when the total <italic>de2f1</italic> level is relatively low, 1.6 X 10<sup>5</sup> copies. Therefore, the <italic>de2f1b-</italic>isoform represents approximately one third of the total <italic>de2f1</italic> at the larval stage, the highest of all stages. We also determined the relative expression level of total <italic>de2f1</italic> and <italic>de2f1b</italic> transcripts in several third instar larval (L3) tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Notably, 5.3 X 10<sup>4</sup> copies of the <italic>de2f1b</italic> isoform is expressed in salivary glands, representing 56% of the total <italic>de2f1</italic>. In eye and wing imaginal discs, <italic>de2f1b</italic> represents less than 20% of total <italic>de2f1</italic>. Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>de2f1b</italic> expression is developmentally regulated and contributes to a significant fraction of the total <italic>de2f1</italic> transcript the salivary gland.</p>
<p>Because the only difference between dE2F1a and dE2F1b is the 16 amino acids coded by exon 3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), we were unable to directly detect dE2F1b at the protein level. Our efforts to raise a peptide antibody against the 16 amino acids did not yield a functional antibody. Nevertheless, we asked whether dE2F1b plays a specific role during development by performing a molecular complementation test in a <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant background. <italic>de2f1</italic> mutants have severe developmental defects and mostly die at the early larval stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref023">23</xref>]. We expressed either <italic>de2f1a</italic> or <italic>de2f1b</italic> alone or together in a <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant background and determined their ability to rescue the early larval lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). <italic>de2f1a</italic> or <italic>de2f1b</italic> expression alone produces third instar larvae at a much lower frequency than the expected ratio. In addition, the rescued animals are developmentally delayed, only progressing to third instar larvae 10 days after egg laying (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Strikingly, expression of both isoforms results in third instar larvae at the expected frequency with only one day of developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Moreover, a majority of the rescued third instar larvae complete pupariation and became pharate adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>) while none of <italic>de2f1a</italic> or <italic>de2f1b</italic> alone larvae progress to pharate adults. Importantly, doubling the amount of <italic>de2f1a</italic> by expressing two copies of the transgene results in only 23.1% of survival at the third larval stage and all surviving larvae fail to progress to pharate adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). These results indicate that it is the presence of both isoforms that is important for rescue, and not the dosage of the transgenes. Overall, the molecular complementation tests indicate that dE2F1b is a functionally important isoform of dE2F1 and that dE2F1a and dE2F1b likely play distinct roles during development.</p>
<p>To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of <italic>de2f1b</italic>, a <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific mutant line was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This was achieved by targeted removal of the <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific exon and its surrounding splicing acceptor and donor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant line was validated by sequencing of its genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and through RT-PCR to verify the absence of exon 3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, cDNA from <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants was sequenced to confirm that this deletion does not result in a frameshift mutation in <italic>de2f1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). At the organismal level, homozygous <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant flies develop normally with no apparent defects until the late pupal stage where about 50% of <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants fail to complete metamorphosis and die prior to eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Similar eclosion rates were observed in both <italic>de2f1b</italic> homozygous mutants and trans-heterozygous mutants of <italic>de2f1b</italic> and a deficiency covering <italic>de2f1</italic>, indicating that this phenotype is specific to the <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutation. We also observed that <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants are female sterile but male fertile, indicating an ovary-specific defect. Indeed, ovaries from well-fed five days old <italic>de2f1b</italic> females are dramatically smaller than the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). At the late third instar larval stage (105–110 hrs after egg laying, AEL), while the sizes of <italic>de2f1b</italic> and control L3 larvae are comparable, the overall size of the <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary gland is consistently smaller than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This observation together with the expression data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1C</xref> suggests dE2F1b plays a critical function during salivary gland development. To determine the effect of <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutation on the overall level of <italic>de2f1</italic> transcript, RT-qPCR was performed using RNA isolated from third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Surprisingly, the total level of <italic>de2f1</italic> is increased in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant larvae and the expression of E2F target genes, <italic>cyclin E</italic> (<italic>cycE</italic>) and <italic>ribonucleotide reductase small subunit</italic> (<italic>rnrS</italic>), is also increased in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant larvae. Overall, the <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific mutation results in tissue specific defects and an overall increase in dE2F1 expression/activity during development.</p>

<p>We next examined the <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant salivary gland in closer detail. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval salivary gland is an endoreplicating tissue where cells undergo a dramatic period of growth by increasing in ploidy through a variant cell cycle called the endocycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref024">24</xref>]. It consists of repeated cycles of G1 and S phases without intervening mitoses. While other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues grow by endocycle, L3 salivary glands are exceptional in that their cells contain more than 1000 copies of their genome in the form of polytene chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref025">25</xref>]. To determine whether the size defects observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2D</xref> is related to DNA content, we visualized nuclei using 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). During larval growth, the salivary glands grow from the distal-tip to the proximal-end in a coordinated fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref026">26</xref>]. In control late-stage (105–110 hr AEL) L3 salivary glands, this coordinated growth is apparent since the nuclear sizes are similar across a single tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, in late-stage <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands, a striking variation of nuclear size was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3A</xref> yellow arrows). Quantification of the overall distribution of nuclear area of three individual salivary glands of control and <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants indicates that, on average, nuclear sizes are smaller and are significantly variable in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants than in control salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Notably, quantification of DAPI intensity revealed that <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands have nuclei with lower DNA content on average than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This result indicates that the smaller nuclear sizes observed in <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands likely reflects lower DNA content. We next determined the pattern of S-phase cells in late-stage <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands using ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling, a thymidine analog. While control late-stage L3 salivary glands have S-phase cells prominently in the proximal region, S-phase cells with variable intensities of EdU are found throughout <italic>de2f1b</italic> late-stage L3 salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). This result indicates a failure to properly control endocycle progression in <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands. Importantly, salivary glands of <italic>dDP</italic> mutant flies that do not have functional dE2F1 and dE2F2 did not display significant variability in the nuclear size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>), suggesting that this phenotype is specific to <italic>de2f1b</italic> and not a general consequence of deregulating E2F function.</p>

<p>Endocycle progression in the salivary gland requires dE2F1-dependent periodic expression of CycE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref025">25</xref>]. In G1 phase of the cell cycle, dE2F1 accumulates to promote timely expression of CycE at the G1 to S phase transition. During S phase when CycE level is high, dE2F1 is targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by CRL4<sup>CDT2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref026">26</xref>]. Consequently, CycE and dE2F1 expression are coupled to the cell cycle and largely show a mutually exclusive pattern of expression in early-stage (80–85 hr AEL) L3 salivary glands, when cells are actively cycling ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref026">26</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4A</xref> upper panel). This stereotypic pattern of CycE and dE2F1 expression is disrupted in early-stage <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant salivary glands. dE2F1 is more broadly expressed and cells expressing extremely high levels of CycE are mostly absent in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4A</xref> lower panel). In addition, more cells in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant salivary glands co-express CycE and dE2F1. While only 30% of CycE and 12% of dE2F1 expressing cells co-express the other protein in control salivary glands, these numbers increase to 85% and 45% respectively in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We also compared the expression pattern of dE2F1 and a dE2F1 activity reporter, PCNA-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The PCNA-GFP reporter expresses GFP under the control of a region of the <italic>PCNA</italic> promoter that contains well-characterized E2F-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, PCNA-GFP shows a pattern of expression that is similar to CycE in control salivary glands. PCNA-GFP expression is highest in cells with a low level of dE2F1 and low in cells with a high level of dE2F1 (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4B</xref> upper panel). Two interesting differences are observed in <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4B</xref> lower panel). First, the overall intensity of PCNA-GFP is weaker than control although dE2F1 is expressed at a similar level. Second, contrary to what was observed in control salivary glands, PCNA-GFP expression lacks signs of oscillation, being more evenly expressed throughout the salivary gland. Overall, these results indicate that dE2F1b is required for strong activation and periodic expression of its target genes during early L3 salivary gland development.</p>

<p>We next examined late-stage L3 salivary glands (105–110 hr AEL) to determine the overall consequences of the <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutation. In late-stage control salivary glands, dE2F1 is evenly expressed at a lower level than the early stage salivary but higher at the proximal tip where high CycE expression and strong PCNA-GFP activity are also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4C</xref> upper panel). In the middle and at the distal tip of the late-stage salivary gland, CycE expression and PCNA-GFP activity is almost undetectable. This indicates that, by this stage, most cells have completed the endocycle and dE2F1 activity is suppressed and limited to the proximal tip of the salivary gland. In late-stage <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands, we observed what seems to be sustained expression of dE2F1, CycE and PCNA-GFP throughout the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4C</xref> lower panel). Importantly, dE2F1 and CycE expression is not limited to the proximal region and visible in the middle and distal tip of <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4C</xref> lower panel). Interestingly, we reproducibly detected cytoplasmic dE2F1 signal in many cells of the <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary gland (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). However, the significance of this observation is currently unclear and further studies will be necessary to elucidate its importance. Nevertheless, this result demonstrates that coordinated downregulation of dE2F1 expression and activity is disrupted in late-stage L3 <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands. To support this observation, the expression levels of other dE2F1 target genes were determined by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We observed approximately a two-fold increase in G1/S-phase target expression such as <italic>rnrS</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic>. Notably, the total level of <italic>PCNA</italic> is not increased in this assay. The PCNA-GFP shows strong expression in the proximal region of control salivary glands, which is lost in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants. Perhaps, higher <italic>PCNA</italic> expression observed in the middle and distal regions of late-stage <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands is balanced out by the loss of strong <italic>PCNA</italic> expression in the proximal region. We also observed a three- to four-fold increase in a number of E2F-regulated G2/M genes such as <italic>cyclin B</italic> (<italic>CycB</italic>) and <italic>fizzy</italic> (<italic>fz</italic>) in <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands. To determine if the sustained expression of dE2F1 target genes is responsible for the salivary gland defects, we reduced the expression level of a key dE2F1 target gene, <italic>cycE</italic>, via RNAi-mediated knockdown. The RNAi-construct was expressed with the <italic>heatshock</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> driver without heat shock, to partially suppresses CycE expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Strikingly, the variability of nuclear sizes in <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3</xref> is significantly suppressed by <italic>cycE</italic> knockdown, indicating that the failure to properly downregulate <italic>cycE</italic> contributes to this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that dE2F1b is an isoform of dE2F1 that is necessary for tight regulation of dE2F1 expression and activity during salivary gland development.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref> raise the possibility that dE2F1b plays a repressive function at the late-stage of salivary gland development, either by limiting total level of dE2F1 or by directly repressing target gene expression. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that they are an indirect consequence of incomplete endocycle, which is supported by the DAPI quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). To gain better insights into dE2F1b’s function, we analysed <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant mitotic tissues such eye and wing imaginal discs, which do not have visible developmental defects. Curiously in eye imaginal discs, a number of studies have reported that the dE2F1 protein, despite being an activator, is expressed highest in the morphogenetic furrow where cells are arresting in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5A</xref> upper panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref028">28</xref>]. Strikingly, in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant eye discs, dE2F1 expression in the morphogenetic furrow is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5A</xref> lower panel). In addition, PCNA-GFP expression is ectopically detected in the morphogenetic furrow and the posterior regions of the <italic>de2f1b</italic> eye disc where it is normally repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5B</xref> left panel). A similar change in the expression pattern of a dE2F1 target gene, <italic>rnrS</italic>, is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5B</xref> right panel). Interestingly, changes in E2F target gene expression do not greatly alter the pattern of S-phase cells in <italic>de2f1b</italic> eye discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). However, a reproducible presence of ectopic S-phase cells and CycE expression at the posterior region of <italic>de2f1b</italic> eye discs are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5C</xref> asterisks). Notably, we did not observe any ectopic cell death at the same region, suggesting that ectopic S-phase cells observed in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant eye discs is not a consequence of simply increasing overall dE2F1 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref028">28</xref>]. In wing imaginal discs, PCNA-GFP expression is normally repressed in the zone of non-proliferating cells (ZNC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5D</xref> arrow heads), where cells are arrested in either G1 or G2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref029">29</xref>]. Similar to the morphogenetic furrow, dE2F1 expression is highest at the ZNC. Strikingly, dE2F1 expression is also greatly reduced and PCNA-GFP is ectopically expressed at the ZNC in <italic>de2f1b</italic> wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Although direct detection of dE2F1b is required as conclusive evidence, our data suggest that dE2F1b is expressed at developmental stages when cells undergo cell cycle arrest, and that it provides a repressive function on target gene expression in this context.</p>

<p>To gain molecular insights into how dE2F1b mediates its repressive function, we determined the promoter occupancy of dE2F1 and RBF1, a negative regulator of dE2F1. Recruitment of total dE2F1 and RBF1 to known target genes was quantified between control and <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant larvae using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with qPCR. Anti-dE2F1 ChIP revealed increased recruitment of dE2F1 to S-phase genes such as <italic>rnrS</italic>, and <italic>PCNA</italic> promoters in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant compared to control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Contrary to dE2F1, anti-RBF1 ChIP using the same chromatin extracts showed an overall decrease in the recruitment of RBF1 to the same set of target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Importantly, RBF1 recruitment to a previously identified dE2F2-specific gene, <italic>trc8</italic>, is largely unchanged if not increased in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants, indicating that the decrease in RBF1 recruitment is specific to dE2F1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref030">30</xref>]. A potential explanation is that dE2F1, whose expression is increased in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), competes away dE2F2 that normally forms a stable complex with RBF1. However, dE2F2 ChIP shows that dE2F2 recruitment is unaltered in <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant larvae, indicating that the changes in dE2F1 and RBF1 recruitment are dE2F2-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These observations demonstrate that the lack of dE2F1b promotes dE2F1 recruitment, presumably dE2F1a, and decreases RBF1 recruitment to target promoters, providing a possible molecular explanation of how dE2F1b negatively regulates gene expression.</p>

<p>Two functional domains of activator E2Fs physically interact with RB family proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref018">18</xref>]. The transactivation (TA) domain interacts with the “pocket” domain of RB, which consists of the A and B domains of RB family proteins, and the MB domain interacts with the C-terminal domain of RB family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Because the <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific exon alters the amino acid sequence of the MB domain, we tested if dE2F1a and dE2F1b differentially interact with RBF1 through GST pull-down assays. We made three GST-fusion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), Large Pocket (LP), which includes A, B and C-terminal domains, Small Pocket (SP), which include A and B domains without the C-terminal domain, and C-terminal domain alone (C-term). Not surprisingly, LP pulls down both dE2F1a and dE2F1b expressed in S2 cells since both isoforms contain the same TA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). However, C-term only pulls down dE2F1a and not dE2F1b, indicating that the 16-amino acid insertion interferes with this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Moreover, the SP reproducibly fails to pull down dE2F1b as efficiently as dE2F1a. These results suggest that the 16-amino acid insertion alters the way that dE2F1 interacts with RBF1.</p>

<p>Because dE2F1a and dE2F1b differentially interact with RBF1, we examined if RBF1 can equally affect dE2F1a- and dE2F1b-dependent transcription. For this task, dE2F1a or dE2F1b was overexpressed using an eye-specific GAL4 driver, <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> (<italic>GMRG4</italic>), and PCNA-GFP was used to monitor their activities. Interestingly, while overexpression of Myc-tagged dE2F1a or dE2F1b in the eye using the <italic>GMRG4</italic> driver results in similar levels of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), dE2F1b is more efficient at activating PCNA-GFP than dE2F1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, second panel). dE2F1b can ectopically activate PCNA-GFP in the entire posterior region of the eye disc while the effect of dE2F1a overexpression is limited to several ommatidial rows posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. We also observed a similar effect on CycE expression, showing a stronger induction by dE2F1b than by dE2F1a. Importantly, the fact that dE2F1b is a better activator of transcription than dE2F1a likely explains why PCNA-GFP expression is weaker in early L3 <italic>de2f1b</italic> salivary glands than the control although the overall dE2F1 expression is relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To determine the effect of RBF1 on dE2F1a- and dE2F1b-dependent transcription, we co-expressed RBF1. RBF1 expression strongly suppresses the ectopic PCNA-GFP and CycE expression induced by dE2F1a as well as dE2F1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, third panel). These results demonstrate that although dE2F1a and dE2F1b differentially interact with RBF1, their activities can be negatively regulated by RBF1. We next asked if the ability of dE2F1a and dE2F1b to promote transcription is equally affected by CycE. The MB domain-mediated interaction between different E2F and RB family proteins was recently demonstrated to affect how phosphorylation by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) disrupt the RB-E2F complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, we wanted to determine if the increased CycE expression by dE2F1b contributes to its ability in efficiently activating PCNA-GFP. Strikingly, <italic>cycE</italic> knockdown resulted in different consequences on dE2F1b- and dE2F1a-induced PCNA-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B</xref> bottom panel). While the co-expression of <italic>cycE RNAi</italic> has little to no effect on the dE2F1a’s ability to ectopically induce PCNA-GFP expression, it strongly suppresses the dE2F1b-induced expression of PCNA-GFP. Moreover, the dE2F1b-induced adult eye phenotype, but not the dE2F1a-induced eye phenotype, is suppressed by <italic>cycE</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that while both dE2F1a and dE2F1b can activate transcription, dE2F1b’s ability promote transcription is largely dependent on CycE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Having only one “activator” E2F and one “repressor” E2F, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RB/E2F network is widely accepted as a streamlined version of the mammalian RB/E2F network. Here, we present an additional level of complexity to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RB/E2F network. Alternative splicing generates two isoforms of <italic>de2f1</italic>, one of which was previously uncharacterized. Through molecular complementation tests and generating an isoform-specific mutant, we demonstrated that dE2F1b is an important regulator of the cell cycle during development, particularly in the salivary gland. Curiously, we also found evidence to suggest that dE2F1b may have a repressive function on target gene expression in a context-specific manner.</p>
<p>The widely-used <italic>de2f1a</italic> cDNA was isolated more than two decades ago from an eye imaginal disc cDNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref031">31</xref>]. Given that the <italic>de2f1b</italic> contributes to only about 10% to the total <italic>de2f1</italic> transcript in the eye disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), it is not surprising that it is <italic>de2f1a</italic> and not <italic>de2f1b</italic> that was originally cloned. Our molecular complementation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>) indicates that dE2F1a and dE2F1b may have distinct roles during development. It will be interesting to revisit some previous experiments where the existence of dE2F1b was not considered. For example, a dominant modifier screen on an dE2F1b-induced eye phenotype may identify a different set of genes from those identified with dE2F1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref032">32</xref>]. Our data also suggest that RNA splicing is an important step of regulating dE2F1 function. Interestingly, splicing factors have been identified as regulators of dE2F2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref033">33</xref>]. Identification of factors involved in the alternative splicing of <italic>de2f1</italic> will likely reveal previously unappreciated regulators of the cell cycle. Notably, the difference between the two <italic>de2f1</italic> isoforms lies in the MB domain, which is associated with member-specific functions in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref014">14</xref>]. Perhaps, <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolved to express E2Fs with distinct functions through alternative splicing rather than having multiple E2F genes.</p>
<p>The <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific mutant described in this study has an increased level of <italic>de2f1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation is that dE2F1b normally limits overall <italic>de2f1</italic> expression. At this point, it is difficult to test this hypothesis since a dE2F1b specific antibody does not exist. An alternative explanation is that exon 3b, which was deleted in our study, contains important regulatory sequences that control <italic>de2f1</italic> expression at the level of transcription or RNA processing. When we designed the <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific mutant, we decided to remove the entire exon 3b sequence instead of mutating splicing donor and acceptor sites. We reasoned that this approach would cleanly remove the <italic>de2f1b</italic> isoform without causing aberrant alternative splicing. However, if indeed exon 3 contains regulatory sequences, this approach may have resulted in an unintended effect on <italic>de2f1</italic> expression. While we did monitor dE2F1 protein expression throughout our study, it will be important to engineer a new set of <italic>de2f1b</italic> alleles by specifically targeting splicing donor and acceptor sites. These alleles can help determine if the <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutant defects described in this study are indeed specifically caused by the lack of the <italic>de2f1b</italic> isoform.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not surprising that <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants have defects in salivary glands. Several studies have previously demonstrated that deregulated dE2F1 activity results in endocycle defects. <italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>su89</italic></sup> mutants, which have a point mutation that weakens the interaction with RBF1, have defects in endocycling tissues in a <italic>de2f2</italic> mutant background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref034">34</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>i2</italic></sup> mutants, which have a truncation in the C-terminal transactivation domain, are female sterile due to defects in ovarian follicle and nurse cells, which are also endocycling cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref036">36</xref>]. It is worth noting that <italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>su89</italic></sup> and <italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>i2</italic></sup> are hypermorphic and hypomorphic mutants of <italic>de2f1</italic> respectively, and they both have endocycle defects. Clearly, dE2F1 activity has to be tightly controlled in these tissues. We found evidence to show that dE2F1b is not only a potent activator of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), but also capable of carrying out a repressive function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In addition, we also showed that dE2F1b can efficiently induce CycE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, second panel). We speculate that the dual function of dE2F1b on gene expression and its ability to strongly induce CycE makes dE2F1b an ideal dE2F1 isoform that governs salivary gland development.</p>
<p>An unanticipated finding from this study is that while dE2F1b is a potent activator of transcription, it can provide a repressive function in a context-specific manner. The <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific exon alters amino acid sequences in the MB domain that make direct contact with the C-term of RB family proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Our GST pull-down experiments showed that while both dE2F1a and dE2F1b are capable of binding to LP of RBF1, dE2F1b fails to interact with C-term of RBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This result suggests that dE2F1a and dE2F1b differentially interact with RBF1 and may form different protein complexes. It is plausible that the MB domain of dE2F1b specifically interacts with proteins that can provide a repressive function. Indeed, the MB domain of activator E2Fs is shown to mediate protein-protein interactions in a member-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref015">15</xref>]. Another interesting aspect of the MB domain-mediated interaction is that it influences the way that CDKs affect the stability of the RB-E2F complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that while both dE2F1a and dE2F1b can interact with RBF1, dE2F1b is able to form a stable repressive complex with RBF1 when the CDK activity is low. Indeed, the repressive function of dE2F1b is observed in the morphogenetic furrow of the eye disc and in ZNC of the wing discs where cells are arrested in G1 or G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Moreover, dE2F1b-dependent transcription can be efficiently suppressed by <italic>cycE</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the clear differences between the two dE2F1 isoforms is their relationship with CycE. dE2F1b more strongly induces CycE expression than dE2F1a and is more sensitive to <italic>cycE</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). These results suggest that dE2F1b function is more tightly linked to the cell cycle than dE2F1a. If this is true, what then is the role of dE2F1a during development? It is conceivable that dE2F1a carries out cell cycle-independent functions associated with activator E2Fs. For example, mammalian E2F1 is shown to specifically regulate cell death genes and its ability to silence repetitive sequences is clearly cell cycle-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the MB domain of E2F1 interacts with the C-term of RB in the GST pull-down assay while the MB domains of E2F2 and E2F3 do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref019">19</xref>]. Similarly, we observed that the MB domain of dE2F1a interacts with C-term of RBF1 while the MB domain of dE2F1b does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). It is possible that dE2F1a has a cell cycle-independent function similar to those associated with E2F1 in mammals. It will be interesting to generate a <italic>de2f1a</italic> specific mutant to precisely determine its function during development.</p>
<p>While dE2F1b is a canonical E2F by structure, its repressive function may be analogous to the function of atypical E2Fs in mammals, E2F7 and E2F8. First, both dE2F1b and E2F7/8 negatively regulate E2F target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref040">40</xref>]). Second, one of the key genes regulated by dE2F1b and E2F7/8 is an activator E2F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref042">42</xref>]). Third, the tissues that are primarily affected by the inactivation of dE2F1b and E2F7/8 are endoreplicating tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007204.ref044">44</xref>]. E2F7/8 knockout mice have ploidy defects in trophoblasts and hepatocytes. The functional similarity between dE2F1b and E2F7/8 suggests that although the exact mechanism may be different, the interplay between members of E2F proteins may be evolutionarily conserved.</p>

The gRNA plasmids and donor plasmid were co-injected into isogenized <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> embryos. Hatched G0 flies were crossed to balancer stocks. Balanced stocks were screened using a fluorescent microscope and PCR to confirm the insertion of the ScarlessDsRed cassette into the <italic>de2f1</italic> gene locus in the right orientation. We received the selected <italic>de2f1b-DsRed</italic> mutant lines and used <italic>PiggyBac</italic> transposition to excise the cassette.

<title>Rescue experiment</title>
<p>All molecular complementation crosses were conducted in the <italic>de2f1</italic><sup><italic>729</italic></sup>/<italic>Df(3R)Exel6186</italic> mutant background and UAS-FM-dE2F1a, UAS-FM-dE2F1b, and UAS-FM-dE2F1a + UAS-FM-dE2F1b (recombined) transgenes were driven by <italic>Ubiquitin-Gal4</italic>. To determine rescue efficiency, viability was assessed by counting the total number of L3 larvae, pupae, pharate adults, and adult flies that eclosed. For each rescue cross, minimum of 30 virgin females were use. The rescue was confirmed using RT-PCR specific to endogenous transcript by targeting 5’ UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007204.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). For every cross, the predicted Mendelian frequency of the rescue genotype is 1 in 9. This was obtained by first determining the expected frequency of the rescued genotype based on the Mendelian ratio, which is 1 in 16. When taking into account the homozygous Balancers that die at the embryonic stage, the predicted Mendelian survival frequency becomes 1 in 9. For each cross, the number of progeny counted is as follows: control n = 710, dE2F1a rescue n = 625, dE2F1b rescue n = 545, dE2F1a+dE2F1b rescue n = 515, <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant n = 572, and 2XdE2F1a rescue n = 469. Percentage survival at L3, for each genotype is the following: control = 100%, dE2F1a rescue = 14.4%, dE2F1b rescue = 19.8%, dE2F1a+dE2F1b rescue = 100%, <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant = 0%, and 2XdE2F1a rescue = 23.1%. Percentage survival at pupal stage for each genotype is the following: control = 100%, dE2F1a rescue = 8.6%, dE2F1b rescue = 13.2%, dE2F1a+dE2F1b rescue = 100%, <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant = 0%, and 2xdE2F1a rescue = 23.1%. Lastly, percentage survival at pharate stage (adult for control) is the following: control = 99%, dE2F1a rescue = 0%, dE2F1b rescue = 0%, dE2F1a+dE2F1b rescue = 83.89%, <italic>de2f1</italic> mutant = 0%, and 2xdE2F1a rescue = 0%. These values are used to plot a Kaplan-Meier curve to visualize percentage survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007204.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

For Immunostaining, third instar imaginal discs and salivary glands were dissected in PBS and immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature with the exception of tissues subjected to anti-dE2F1 staining that were fixed for 30 minutes on ice. Fixed tissues were then washed with 0.3% PBST (0.3% TritonX-100 in 1XPBS) and 0.1% PBST (0.1% TritonX-100 in 1XPBS). Samples were incubated with appropriate amount of primary antibody in 0.1% PBST and 1%BSA overnight. Samples were then washed with 0.1% PBST, incubated in secondary antibody in 0.1% PBST and 1% BSA for 2 hours, followed by several washes in 0.1% PBST prior to mounting. To visualize S-phase cells, Ethynyl-2’-Deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assay (Invitrogen C10339) was used according to the manufacturer’s specifications in third instar eye imaginal discs and salivary glands. DNA was visualized with 0.1 μg/mL DAPI. All salivary glands were appropriately staged as either early (80–85 hours after egg laying, AEL) or late (105–110 hours AEL) L3 salivary glands for immunostainings. Representative images were selected from a minimum of 10 independent tissues that were appropriately labelled.</p>

<p>(A) Control eye discs and eye discs overexpressing dE2F1a (GMRG4&gt;dE2F1a) and dE2F1b (GMRG4&gt;dE2F1b) are shown. Apoptotic cells and S-phase cells are visualized by a cell death marker, Cleaved <italic>Drosophila</italic> Caspase-1 (Dcp-1, green) and EdU (red) respectively. The asterisks show apoptotic cells and arrow head show S-phase cells that are induced by overexpression of dE2F1a or dE2F1b. (B) Eye discs of control and <italic>de2f1b</italic> mutants are immunostained for a neuronal marker (ELAV, blue) and a cell death marker, Cleaved Drosophila Caspase-1 (Dcp-1, green). </p>

<title>Overexpression of dE2F1a and dE2F1b in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye.</title>
<p>(A) Immunoblot (upper panel) and immunostaining (lower panel) with anti-Myc compare the expression levels of dE2F1a and dE2F1b. 20 pairs of the discs for each genotype were used for the Immunoblot and β-tubulin is used as a loading control. The GMR-Gal4 driver is used to express Myc-tagged dE2F1a or dE2F1b in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye.</p>

<title>Multiple sequence alignment of the Marked Box (MB) domain of fruit flies and human.</title>
<p>The MB domain sequences from the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> dE2F1 isoforms, dE2F1a and dE2F1b, and all six canonical E2Fs from human, E2F1 to 6, are aligned. Highlighted in green are four amino acids that are identified to be important for specific interactions between E2F and RB family proteins (18). Red letters indicate the amino acid sequences coded by the <italic>de2f1b</italic>-specific exon. Asterisks indicate the amino acids in the E2F5 MB domain that makes contact with the C-terminal domain of p107 (18). Arrowheads indicate the amino acids in the E2F1 MB domain that makes contact with the C-terminal domain of pRB (17).</p>
