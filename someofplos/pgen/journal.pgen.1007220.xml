<abstract>
<p>Can genetic adaptation in reef-building corals keep pace with the current rate of sea surface warming? Here we combine population genomics, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Genomics-derived migration rates were high (0.1–1% of immigrants per generation across half the latitudinal range of the GBR) and closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal. Both genetic and biophysical models indicated the prevalence of southward migration along the GBR that would facilitate the spread of heat-tolerant alleles to higher latitudes as the climate warms. We developed an individual-based metapopulation model of polygenic adaptation and parameterized it with population sizes and migration rates derived from the genomic analysis. We find that high migration rates do not disrupt local thermal adaptation, and that the resulting standing genetic variation should be sufficient to fuel rapid region-wide adaptation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> populations to gradual warming over the next 20–50 coral generations (100–250 years). Further adaptation based on novel mutations might also be possible, but this depends on the currently unknown genetic parameters underlying coral thermal tolerance and the rate of warming realized. Despite this capacity for adaptation, our model predicts that coral populations would become increasingly sensitive to random thermal fluctuations such as ENSO cycles or heat waves, which corresponds well with the recent increase in frequency of catastrophic coral bleaching events.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Coral reefs worldwide are suffering high mortality from severe thermal stress episodes induced by acute ocean warming events. Under the current rate of warming, will corals be gone before the end of this century? Here we combine population genomics with biophysical and evolutionary modeling to investigate adaptive potential of a common reef-building coral from the Great Barrier Reef. To approach this task, we have developed a predictive model of polygenic adaptation in a system of multiple inter-connected populations that exist in a heterogeneous and changing environment. Applying this model to our coral species, we find that populations successfully adapt to diverse local temperatures along the range of the Great Barrier Reef despite high migrant exchange and should collectively harbor enough adaptive genetic variants to fuel region-wide thermal adaptation for another century and perhaps longer. In the same time, the model predicts that random thermal fluctuations will induce increasingly severe coral mortality episodes, which aligns well with observations over the last few decades.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mass coral bleaching, caused by global warming, is devastating coral reefs around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref001">1</xref>] but there is room for hope if corals can adapt to increasing temperatures from generation to generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref002">2</xref>]. Many coral species have wide distributions that span environments that differ dramatically in their thermal regimes, demonstrating that efficient thermal adaptation has occurred in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref003">3</xref>]. But can coral adaptation keep up with the unprecedentedly rapid current rate of global warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref004">4</xref>]? One way for corals to achieve rapid thermal adaptation is through genetic rescue, involving the spread of existing heat tolerance alleles from warm-adapted populations to now-warming regions via larval migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref006">6</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated the presence of genetic variants conferring high thermal tolerance in a naturally warm low-latitude population of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref005">5</xref>]). It can be assumed that the effectiveness of GBR-wide adaptation based on these pre-existing variants would depend on the prevailing migrant exchange pathways and on total amount of genetic variation in populations of this coral. While considerable genetic connectivity along the latitudinal range of the GBR has been documented in corals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref009">9</xref>], previous approaches have not been able to resolve the directionality of the migrant exchange to confirm that redistribution of heat-tolerance alleles from warm- to cooler-adapted populations is indeed taking place. In addition, recent declines in coral cover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref010">10</xref>] could have already taken a toll on the total amount of standing genetic variation. Here, we used population genomics coupled with model-based allele frequency spectrum (AFS) analysis to establish directionality of migrant exchange and estimate contemporary and historical effective population sizes (measure of genetic diversity) in <italic>Acropora millepora</italic>, a common but heat sensitive reef-building coral representing the most ecologically prominent and diverse coral genus in the Indo-Pacific. The genomics-based migration rates were cross-validated with biophysical model of larval dispersal. The resulting demographic estimates were used to parameterize a newly developed metapopulation adaptation model to predict future persistence of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> on the GBR.</p>

<p>We used samples collected in 2002–2009 from five populations of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> along the latitudinal range of the GBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Environmental parameters (obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eatlas.org.au/" xlink:type="simple">http://eatlas.org.au/</ext-link>) varied widely among these locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Importantly, maximum summer temperature (the major cause of bleaching-related mortality) followed the latitudinal gradient with one notable exception: one of the near-shore populations from the central GBR (Magnetic Island) experienced summers as hot as the lowest-latitude population examined here (Wilkie Island, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We genotyped 18–28 individuals per population using 2bRAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref011">11</xref>] at &gt;98% accuracy and with a &gt;95% genotyping rate. Analysis of population structure based on ~11,500 biallelic SNPs agreed with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref012">12</xref>] and revealed very low levels of genetic divergence, with only the Keppel Islands population being potentially different from the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> did not exceed 0.014 even between the southernmost and northernmost populations (Keppel and Wilkie). We did not verify whether these <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> measures were significant because our main statistical analysis was based AFS modeling.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Demographic subdivision and migration patterns</title>
<p>Here we applied Diffusion Approximation for Demographic Inference (<italic>∂a∂i</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref013">13</xref>]), a methodology of demographic analysis based on allele frequency spectrum (AFS). AFS is essentially a histogram of number of genetic variants binned by frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). AFS-based analysis is enabled by the multitude of molecular markers provided by next-generation sequencing and offers a number of advantages compared to classical population genetics approaches applied previously to GBR corals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref014">14</xref>], Most importantly, AFS analysis does not rely on assumptions of genetic equilibrium (stability of population sizes and migration rates for thousands of generations) or equality of population sizes. It can fit any user-defined demographic model, for example involving asymmetric migration or population growth and declines, to maximize the likelihood of generating the observed AFS. This approach also allows likelihood-based model comparisons (likelihood ratio tests or tests based on Akaike Information Criterion, AIC) to prove the importance of parameters included in the model.</p>
<p>We used bootstrap-AIC approach to confirm that our populations are separate demographic units. For each pair of populations we generated 120 bootstrapped datasets by resampling genomic contigs and performed delta-AIC comparison of two demographic models, a split-with-migration model and a no-split model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). The split-with-migration model assumed two populations that split some time <italic>T</italic> in the past with potentially different sizes <italic>N1</italic> and <italic>N2</italic>, and exchange migrants at different rates (<italic>m12</italic> and <italic>m21</italic>) depending on direction. The no-split model allowed for ancestral population size to change but not for a population split, so the experimental data were modeled as two random samples from the same population of size <italic>N</italic>. The majority of bootstrap replicates (64–100%) showed AIC advantage of the split-with-migration model for all pairs of populations except Sudbury-Magnetic (41% support, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). This indicates that most <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> populations on the GBR are in fact demographically distinct, despite often non-significant <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> reported by previous studies based on allozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref015">15</xref>] and microsatellite markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref008">8</xref>], or our own PCA and ADMIXTURE results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). This underscores the higher sensitivity of AIC-base AFS analysis compared to classical equilibrium population genetics methods.</p>
<p>AFS-based analysis allows statistically rigorous estimation of unidirectional migration rates between populations. The classical <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>−based approach only allows estimating bi-directional migration rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref015">15</xref>] and even this calculation has been criticized because its underlying assumptions are rarely realistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref016">16</xref>]. We determined unidirectional migration rates from the split-with-migration model and estimated their confidence limits from bootstrap replicates. In theory, migration rate can be confounded with population divergence time, since in the AFS higher migration often looks similar to more recent divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref017">17</xref>]. To confirm that the model with ancient population divergence and migration is preferable to the model with very recent divergence and no migration, we performed the delta-AIC bootstrap comparison between these models and obtained overwhelming support for the model with ancient divergence and migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Notably, for all pairwise analyses migration in southward direction exceeded northward migration, and this difference was significant in seven out of ten pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s003">S2A Fig</xref>). Linear mixed model analysis of direction dependent median migration rates with a random effect of destination (to account for variation in total immigration rate) confirmed the overall significance of this southward trend (<italic>P</italic><sub>MCMC</sub> &lt;1e-4). Full listing of parameter estimates and their bootstrap-derived 95% confidence limits is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s001">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

<p>To investigate whether the southward migration bias was due to higher survival of warm-adapted migrants (due to ongoing sea surface temperature increase) rather than currents, we developed a biophysical model of coral larval dispersal on the Great Barrier Reef. This model quantified the per-generation migration potential among coral reef habitat patches in the GBR based on ocean currents and parameters of larval biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref019">19</xref>], the latter including pre-competency period, competency period and mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref020">20</xref>]. The biophysical model predicted very similar migration rates as our genetic model (Mantel <italic>r</italic> = 0.58, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), recapitulating the southward bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Importantly, the same southward bias was predicted for population pairs in which southward migration corresponded to movement to the same-temperature or even to warmer location, such as migrations to the Magnetic Island. This indicates that southward migration bias is predominantly driven by ocean currents and not by preferential survival of warm-adapted coral genotypes migrating to cooler locations. More generally, this result indicates that currents remain the major factor affecting larval dispersal in our study species, with environmental selection pressures playing comparatively minor, if any, role.</p>

<title>Genetic diversity trends</title>
<p>The GBR has warmed considerably since the end of last century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref021">21</xref>], which may have already reduced genetic diversity in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> populations. We used <italic>∂a∂i</italic> to infer effective population sizes, which is a measure of genetic diversity and one of the key parameters determining the population’s adaptive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref022">22</xref>]. The results of the split-with-migration model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) were consistent for all population pairs and indicated that Keppel population was about one-fifth the size of others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). This result was not surprising since the Keppel population has frequently suffered high mortality due to environmental disturbances compared to the other populations studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref012">12</xref>]. To investigate whether there was a detectable recent drop in genetic diversity associated with GBR-wide coral decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref010">10</xref>] we have used <italic>stairwayPlot</italic>, a model-free method of past effective population size reconstruction based on AFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref023">23</xref>]. Reconstruction of the most recent changes draws information from the rarest alleles and therefore requires large sample sizes, which is why we pooled three highly similar populations from the Central GBR (Sudbury, Orpheus, and Magnetic) to increase the sample size to 84 individuals. We also analyzed Keppel population separately since it was distinct from the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>) and was less genetically diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This analysis confirmed the long-term decline of the Keppel population, possibly since the time of its separation from the main GBR stock, but did not find significant recent decline in the central GBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). To see if a very recent decline was at all detectable with a sample size of 84, we used SLiM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref024">24</xref>] to simulate evolution of 20,000 2bRAD loci in ten populations exponentially declining from 30,000 individuals to 1/10th or 1/3rd of that size over the last 20 generations (in our coral this would correspond to approximately 100 years). As a control, we simulated populations maintaining their size. With the sample size of 84 we could detect the ten-fold population crash in nine cases out of ten (albeit with low confidence) but we could not detect the three-fold decline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, although we did not detect recent drop in genetic diversity in our species, substantial population decline might still be occurring.</p>

<title>Metapopulation adaptation model</title>
<p>To evaluate whether local thermal adaptation could facilitate rapid adaptation of the whole <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> metapopulation to the simulated gradual warming, we developed an individual-based polygenic model of metapopulation adaptation in the SLiM software environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref024">24</xref>]. The model’s code is highly flexible and can simulate any number of populations with any configuration of population sizes, migration rates, and environmental trends. The number and effect sizes of QTLs, mutation rate, heritability, and breadth of tolerance can also be varied in this model. Here, we used population sizes and migration rates inferred from the genetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2A and 2D</xref>) and incorporated differences in mid-summer monthly mean temperature among populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Initially, populations were allowed to adapt to local thermal conditions while exchanged migrants and were at the state of genetic equilibrium at the start of the warming periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). Warming consists in the temperature increase at a rate of 0.05°C per generation in all populations, corresponding to the projected 0.1°C warming per decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref025">25</xref>]. Both during pre-adaptation and warming periods the temperature was allowed to fluctuate randomly between generations to approximate El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or similar but random acute temperature events. During the warming period, a population declining in fitness would shrink in size and stop contributing migrants to other populations.</p>

<title>Adaptation based on standing genetic variation</title>
<p>The fist important result of the model was that high migration rates (on the order of 0.1–1% of immigrants every generation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s001">S1 Table</xref>) did not lead to “migrational meltdown” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref026">26</xref>] of local adaptation: all populations successfully adapted to local thermal conditions, although at the settings for lower efficiency of selection (low heritability and/or broad tolerance) this adaptation became increasingly imperfect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). Moreover, under all parameter settings the pre-adapted metapopulation as a whole was able to persist through the gradual warming for at least 20–50 generations (100–250 years) although the initially warm-adapted populations were going extinct relatively rapidly (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7</xref>). Migration substantially contributed to this persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>), underscoring the importance of divergent local adaptation and genetic rescue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref006">6</xref>] in promoting and redistributing the standing genetic variation.</p>

<p>A notable tendency observed with all parameter settings was that during warming the fitness (and hence the size) of adapting populations began to fluctuate following random thermal anomalies, and the amplitude of these fitness fluctuations increased as the warming progressed even though the amplitude of thermal anomalies did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). These fluctuations correspond to severe mortality events induced by thermal extremes that can occur as a result of ENSO and heat waves and affected warm-adapted populations most, which very much resembles the situation currently observed throughout the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref001">1</xref>].</p>

<title>Adaptation proceeds despite inefficient selection</title>
<p>Efficiency of selection depends on how strongly the phenotype is determined by genotype (heritability), and also on how steeply the fitness declines if the phenotype does not match the environment (breadth of thermal tolerance). In our model, heritability becomes lower with more random variation (determined by the <italic>Esd</italic> parameter, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7</xref>) added to the breeding value. Lower heritability notably diminished the efficiency of local adaptation–during pre-adaptation period, mean fitness of each population was lower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6 Fig</xref>) and the population’s mean phenotype failed to achieve full match to the environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7 Fig</xref>), ostensibly due to less efficient selection against maladapted immigrants. Yet, lower heritability did not result in reduced persistence of the metapopulation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s006">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6</xref>). This is good news for reef-building corals since heritability of thermal tolerance in them is expected to be low: much of natural variation in this trait is due to the type of algal symbionts (<italic>Symbiodinium</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref027">27</xref>]). Photo-symbionts are not transmitted from parent to offspring in the majority of coral species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref028">28</xref>], and although host genetics can have some effect on the choice of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> in the next generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref029">29</xref>] environment has stronger effect on this association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Broader thermal tolerance (determined by parameter σ, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7</xref>) also reduces the efficiency of selection but increases the population’s mean fitness, counteracting the fitness-diminishing effect of lower heritability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). During warming, it prevents extinction despite increasingly poorer match between the population’s mean phenotype and the environment, and thus facilitates longer persistence (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7</xref>). It is also notable that both low heritability and broader tolerance decrease the sensitivity of populations to random thermal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s007">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Model uncertainties</title>
<p>There are many uncertainties in our model associated with coral biology. Below we argue that, while more research is certainly needed to resolve them, our parameter settings were for the most part set to under-estimate adaptive potential.</p>
<p>Mutation rates are generally difficult to estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref031">31</xref>] and therefore in our model we had to rely on order-of-magnitude guesses. Encouragingly, even under relatively low per-locus mutation rate of 1e-6 per gamete per generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref032">32</xref>] we have observed occasional “evolutionary rescue” events: brief periods of accelerated phenotypic evolution due spread of novel beneficial mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref033">33</xref>]. These events substantially contributed to the metapopulation persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, even under ten-fold lower mutation rate (1e-7) the initial adaptive response during the first ~100 generations was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), although there was no subsequent adaptation. While ten-fold higher mutation rate (1e-5) allowed for indefinite adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), such a high mutation rate is unlikely to be realistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<p>Changes in two other parameters could result in considerably longer persistence: larger population sizes and more fine-grained genetic architecture (more QTLs with less effect). Both of these strongly facilitate adaptation beyond the initial “genetic rescue” period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Unlike the high mutation rate, these settings are relatively realistic. Coral population size is likely larger than assumed in our model, which used effective population sizes suggested by genetic analysis as census sizes. However, in highly fecund marine organisms effective population sizes tend to be much smaller than census sizes, sometimes by orders of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref035">35</xref>]. It is also notable that <italic>stairwayPlot</italic> predicted substantially larger effective population sizes than the <italic>∂a∂i</italic>-derived estimates used for the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). As for genetic architecture, our assumption of only ten thermal QTLs was conservative; the actual number of thermal QTLs in acroporid corals is likely much larger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref036">36</xref>]. However, there is currently no data on the distribution of effect sizes of these QTLs, which would be an important subject for future research to improve the model.</p>

<p>As for breadth of thermal tolerance, in simulations shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g003">Fig 3</xref> σ = 0.5 and σ = 2 corresponded to 86% and 13% decline in fitness if the individual’s phenotype mismatched the environment by 1°C. The existing data on the breadth of coral thermal tolerance are somewhat conflicting. One study shows that acroporid corals can successfully acclimatize to environments differing in maximum temperatures by as much as 2°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref037">37</xref>]; however, another study found that coral grew 52–80% more slowly when transplanted among locations differing by 1.5°C average temperature, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref038">38</xref>]. Although it is not possible to directly interpret these results in terms of breadth of thermal tolerance function, the former study likely supports the broader tolerance setting while the latter study suggests narrower tolerance. It must also be noted that both these studies involved <italic>in situ</italic> transplantations and hence the effect of temperature remains confounded with colony history and other local fitness-affecting environmental parameters. Also, adult corals likely have narrower tolerance than larvae and recruits, which are expected to exhibit non-reversible developmental plasticity associated with metamorphosis and establishment within a novel environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref039">39</xref>]. One particularly important event during this developmental transition is establishment of association with local algal symbionts. Since symbionts also adapt to local thermal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref030">30</xref>] this would elevate the fitness of the coral host despite possible mismatch between its own genetically determined thermal optimum and local temperature, which we can model as broadening of the thermal tolerance. Future experiments that expose multiple genetically distinct coral individuals to a range of temperatures under controlled laboratory settings are required to rigorously quantify variation in thermal tolerance curves in natural populations.</p>
<p>It could be argued that our samples are genetically out of date, not capturing the effects of recent disturbances such as mass bleaching, large cyclones and a Crown-of-Thorns outbreak that have happened on the GBR since the time of their collection (2002–2009). However, very recent demographic events (in this case, 2–3 generations ago) are undetectable at the level of neutral genetic variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s005">S4 Fig</xref>) unless the study’s sample size is comparable to the number of disturbance-surviving individuals (i.e., either when the disturbance was truly catastrophic or the sample size is very large). Thus, our samples can still be considered representative of major patterns of genetic diversity of our study species.</p>
<p>Finally, our model assumed that recovery from high mortality events would happen without impediment, through reseeding by survivors and migrant influx from other coral populations. However, severe mortality across large spatial scales or ecological feedbacks such as shifts to an alternative ecological stable state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref040">40</xref>] might substantially decrease the rate of reseeding and recovery of affected reefs. In that case, the increase in severity of bleaching-related mortality might lead to much faster coral extinction than predicted by our model.</p>

<title>Implications for reef management</title>
<p>We found that genetic diversity of <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> was not yet strongly affected by climate change and that the migration patterns were well positioned to facilitate persistence of the GBR metapopulation for a century or more. Our results underscore the pivotal role of standing genetic variation and migrant exchange in the future metapopulation persistence, suggesting management interventions such as assisted gene flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref041">41</xref>] by moving adult reproductively active colonies or by outplanting lab-reared offspring produced by crossing corals from different populations. With the estimated natural migration rates on the order of 0.1–1% (10–100) migrants per generation, human-assisted genotype exchange could appreciably contribute to the genetic rescue without risking disruption of the natural local adaptation patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref042">42</xref>]. What might get in the way of assisted gene flow is adaptation of transplanted corals to other environmental parameters at home, for example, light levels or concentration of inorganic nutrients. The extent to which such adaptation can limit survival of transplanted corals and naturally dispersing larvae (the effect called “isolation by environment” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref043">43</xref>] or “phenotype-environment mismatch” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref044">44</xref>]) requires further study. Importantly, despite good prospects for short-term adaptation, coral populations are predicted to become increasingly more sensitive to random thermal anomalies, especially in the originally warm-adapted populations. The 10–85% mortality in the Northern GBR as a result of 2016 bleaching event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref045">45</xref>] could be a particularly sobering recent manifestation of this trend. Finally, to validate the model’s predictions and further fine-tune its parameters, long-term monitoring of genetic variation in natural coral populations must be initiated to track ongoing evolutionary changes.</p>

We took advantage of these clonal replicates to extract SNPs that were genotyped with 100% reproducibility across replicates and, in addition, appeared as heterozygotes in at least two replicate pairs (script replicatesMatch.pl with hetPairs = 2 option). These 7,904 SNPs were used as “true” SNP dataset to train the error model to recalibrate variant quality scores at the last stage of the GATK pipeline. During recalibration, we used the transition-transversion (Ts/Tv) ratio of 1.438 determined from the “true” SNPs to assess the number of false positives at each filtering threshold (as it is expected that an increase of false positive calls would decrease the Ts/Tv ratio towards unity). We chose the 95% tranche, with novel Ts/Tv = 1.451. After quality filtering that restricted the calls to only bi-allelic polymorphic sites, retained only loci genotyped in 95% or more of all individuals, and removed loci with the fraction of heterozygotes exceeding 0.6 (possible lumped paralogs), we ended up with 25,359 SNPs. In total, 2bRAD tags interrogated 0.18% of the genome. The genotyping accuracy was assessed based on the match between genotyped replicates using script repMatchStats.pl. Overall agreement between replicates was 98.7% or better with the heterozygote discovery rate (the fraction of matching heterozygote calls among replicates) exceeding 96%. All but one representative of each clonal group were excluded from all subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Genome-wide genetic divergence</title>
<p>To begin to characterize genome-wide divergence between populations we used pairwise genome-wide Weir and Cockerham’s <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> calculated by vcftools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref052">52</xref>], principal component analysis (PCA) using R package adegenet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref053">53</xref>], and ADMIXTURE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref054">54</xref>]. For PCA and ADMIXTURE, the data were thinned to keep SNPs separated by 5kb on average and by at least 2.5 kb, choosing SNPs with highest minor allele frequency (script thinner.pl with options ‘interval = 5000 criterion = maxAF’), resulting in 11,426 unlinked SNPs. The optimal K in ADMIXTURE analysis was determined based on the cross-validation procedure incorporated within ADMIXTURE software; the lowest standard error in cross-validation was observed at K = 1.</p>

<title>Demographic analysis and bootstrapping</title>
<p>Prior to demographic analysis, Bayescan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref055">55</xref>] was used to identify sites potentially under selection among populations, and 73 sites with q-value &lt;0.5 were removed. This aggressive removal of potential non-neutral sites resulted in better agreement between bootstrap replicates compared to an earlier analysis where only 13 sites with q-value &lt; 0.05 were removed. Demographic models were fitted to 120 bootstrapped datasets, which were generated in two stages. First, three alternatively thinned datasets were generated for which SNPs were randomly drawn to be on average 5 kb apart and not closer than 2.5 kb (10,042–10,074 SNPs in each). This time the SNPs were drawn at random to avoid distorting the allele frequency spectrum (unlike thinning for PCA and ADMIXTURE where the highest minor allele frequency SNPs were selected). Then, 40 bootstrapped replicates were generated for each thinned dataset by resampling contigs of the reference genome with replacement (script dadiBoot.pl). The fitted model parameters were summarized after excluding bootstrap replicates that fell into the lowest 15% likelihood quantile and the ones where model fitting failed to converge, leading to some parameters being undetermined or at infinity (less than 10% of total number of runs). Delta-AIC values were calculated for each bootstrap replicate that passed these criteria for both compared models, and summarized to obtain bootstrap support value, the percentage of replicates favoring the alternative model. While fitting <italic>∂a∂i</italic> models, the data for each population were projected to sample sizes maximizing the number of segregating sites in the analysis, resulting in 6143–7193 segregating sites per population. Initially, our models included a parameter designed to account for ancestral state misidentification rate when constructing the polarized AFS (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref056">56</xref>]), but since this parameter was consistently estimated to be on the order of 0.001 and had negligible effect on the models’ likelihood, we removed it from the final set of models.</p>

Assuming a genome size of 5e+8 bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref047">47</xref>] the number of new mutations per genome per generation is 10.

<title>Biophysical model</title>
<p>A spatially-explicit biophysical modeling framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref059">59</xref>] was used to quantify migration between coral reef habitats of the broader region surrounding the Great Barrier Reef, thereby revealing the location, strength, and structure of a species' potential population connectivity. The model’s spatial resolution of ca. 8 km coincides with hydrodynamic data for the broader region (1/12.5 degree; HYCOM+NCODA Reanalysis and Analysis product; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hycom.org" xlink:type="simple">hycom.org</ext-link>). Our biophysical dispersal model relies on geographic data describing the seascape environment and biological parameters capturing coral-specific life-histories. Coral reef habitat data are available from the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/1" xlink:type="simple">http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/1</ext-link>) representing a globally-consistent and up-to-date representation of coral reef habitat. To capture specific inter-annual variability, two decades of hydrodynamic data were used from 1992 to 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>Coral-specific biological parameters for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> included relative adult density (dependent on the habitat), reproductive output, larval spawning time and periodicity (e.g., the majority of colonies at Magnetic Island spawn a month earlier than the majority of colonies on other GBR sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref061">61</xref>]), maximum dispersal duration, pre-competency and competency periods, and larval mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref020">20</xref>]. The spatially explicit dispersal simulations model the dispersal kernel (2-D surface) as a ‘cloud’ of larvae, allowing it to be concentrated and/or dispersed as defined by the biophysical parameters. An advection transport algorithm is used for moving larvae within the flow fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref062">62</xref>].</p>
<p>Simulations were carried out by releasing a cloud of larvae into the model seascape at all individual coral reef habitat patches and allowing the larvae to be transported by the currents. Ocean current velocities, turbulent diffusion, and larval behavior move the larvae through the seascape at each time-step. Larval competency, behavior, density, and mortality determine when and what proportion of larvae settle in habitat cells at each time step. When larvae encounter habitat, the concentration of larvae settling with the habitat is recorded at that time-step. From the dispersal data, we derived the coral migration matrix representing the proportion of settlers to each destination patch that came from a source patch, which is analogous to the source distribution matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref063">63</xref>] and is equivalent to migration matrices derived from population genetic analysis. It is important to note that migration matrices extracted for the field sites represent the potential migration through all possible stepping-stones.</p>

<title>Metapopulation adaptation model</title>
<p>The model was implemented in SLiM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref024">24</xref>], the forward evolutionary simulator, by modifying the provided recipe “Quantitative genetics and phenotypically-based fitness”. The model simulated Wright-Fisher populations with discreet generations. At the start of the simulation, populations were established with specified pairwise migration rates. Mutations (at the rate of 1e-6 per locus per gamete) had the effect size drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and specified standard deviation. To rapidly generate and equilibrate the standing genetic variation, we used the fact that the allele frequency spectrum is the function of the product of population size and mutation rate. Since smaller populations equilibrate proportionally faster and are much faster to simulate, the first 5,000 generations were performed at 100-fold smaller population size than the final target value (12,500 for all populations except K, which was five times smaller) but 100-fold higher mutation rate, followed by 5,000 generations with 10-fold smaller population size and 10-fold higher mutation rate, followed by 10,000 generations with the target population size and mutation rate. This step-wise strategy resulted in rapid generation and equilibration of genetic diversity both within individual populations and in the whole metapopulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). The phenotype of each individual was calculated as breeding value (sum of all QTL effects) plus Gaussian-distributed noise (of the magnitude set by the <italic>Esd</italic> parameter) to simulate a non-heritable phenotypic component. Then, fitness of each individual was calculated based on the difference between the individual’s phenotype (thermal optimum), temperature of the environment, and the setting for the breadth of thermal tolerance curve (σ parameter, the standard deviation of the Gaussian slope of fitness decline away from the phenotypic optimum). Each generation parents were chosen to produce the next generation according to their fitness; parents for immigrant individuals were chosen from among individuals in the source population. New mutations at QTLs happened at the specified rate at the transition to the next generation and the effect of a new mutation was added to the previous QTL effect. To model fitness-dependent population demography, we implemented linear scaling of the population size and migration rates with the population’s mean fitness. In the model described here this scaling was applied during 500 generation preceding warming and during the warming period, so that populations declining in fitness relative to their historical level shrunk in size and stopped contributing migrants to other populations. Genetic variation shown on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007220.s006">S5 Fig</xref> was calculated as standard deviation of breeding values, representing the average difference between genetically-determined thermal tolerance of an individual and the population’s mean in °C (genetic variance is this value squared).</p>
<p>Adjustable model parameters and their settings in this study were:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Number of QTLs and the distribution of their effect sizes. To keep the model conservative, we modeled only ten QTLs with normal distribution of effect sizes with a standard deviation of 0.2°C. To model the effect of more dispersed genetic architecture while keeping the total genetic variation the same, we modeled 100 QTLs with mean effect size of 0.063 (since genetic variance is proportional to the square of QTL effect size). We have confirmed that these settings resulted in the same level of total genetic variation as ten QTLs with mean effect size of 0.2.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dominance of QTLs (set to 0.5 in our simulation).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breadth of thermal tolerance: standard deviation of the Gaussian curve describing decline in fitness away from phenotypic optimum. We modeled three tolerance settings, 0.5, 1 and 2, which corresponded to 86%, 40% and 13% fitness drop when the environment mismatched phenotypic optimum by 1°C.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-heritable phenotypic component: standard deviation of a normal distribution with mean zero from which a random value is drawn to be added to the sum of QTL effects when computing phenotype. Setting this parameter to zero corresponds to trait heritability of one. Higher values of this parameter imply heritability less than one; however, the exact value of heritability (the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by genetics) could vary depending on the amount of genetic variation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mutation rate. It was set to 1e-6 per locus per gamete for the majority of runs, with the exception of runs exploring lower (1e-7) or higher (1e-5) ends of theoretically realistic per-locus mutation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007220.ref032">32</xref>].</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The model’s code is designed for general modeling of polygenic adaptation in metapopulations. It can read user-supplied files of environmental conditions, population sizes and migration matrices for an arbitrary number of populations.</p>
<p>Here, we modeled our five populations with effective population sizes and pairwise migration rates inferred by <italic>∂a∂i</italic>. We modeled identical thermal trends across populations with population-specific offsets. During the pre-adaptation period lasting 20,000 generations, the temperature was constant on average but experienced random fluctuations across generations drawn from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.25°C (to approximate ENSO events). The temperature was offset by +1.6°C in Wilkie and Magnetic populations and by -1.8°C in the Keppel population, to model differences in midsummer monthly mean temperature among populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007220.g001">Fig 1</xref>). After 20,000 generations, a linear increase at 0.05°C per generation was added to simulate warming.</p>
<p>All combinations of parameter settings were run ten times to ensure consistency. We found that with population sizes in thousands, such as in our case, the results were very consistent among independent runs. We therefore did not aggregate results over many replicated runs but instead show one randomly chosen run for each tested parameter combination.</p>
