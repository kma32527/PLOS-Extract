<abstract>
<p>Several plant species require microbial associations for survival under different biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we show that <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187, a desert plant endophytic bacterium, enhances yield of the crop plant alfalfa under field conditions as well as growth of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana in vitro</italic>, revealing a high potential of SA187 as a biological solution for improving crop production. Studying the SA187 interaction with Arabidopsis, we uncovered a number of mechanisms related to the beneficial association of SA187 with plants. SA187 colonizes both the surface and inner tissues of Arabidopsis roots and shoots. SA187 induces salt stress tolerance by production of bacterial 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), known to be converted into ethylene. By transcriptomic, genetic and pharmacological analyses, we show that the ethylene signaling pathway, but not plant ethylene production, is required for KMBA-induced plant salt stress tolerance. These results reveal a novel molecular communication process during the beneficial microbe-induced plant stress tolerance.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Plants as sessile organisms are facing multiple stresses during their lifetime. Among them, abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, can cause severe crop yield reduction, leading to food security issues in many regions of the world. In order to respond to growing food demands, especially in the context of the global climate change and increasing world population, it then becomes urgent to develop new strategies to yield crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses. One way to overcome these challenges is to take advantage of plant beneficial microbes, defined as plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). In this study, we report the beneficial effect of <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187 on plant growth under salt stress conditions. SA187 increased the yield of the forage crop alfalfa when submitted to different saline irrigations in field trials. Moreover, using the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, we demonstrate that SA187 mediates its beneficial activity by producing 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), which modulates the plant ethylene signaling pathway. This study highlights a novel mechanism involved in plant-PGPB interaction, and proves that endophytic bacteria can be efficiently used to enhance yield of current crops under salt stress conditions.</p>

For example, salinity, known to affect almost one fourth of arable land globally, is a two-phase stress composed of a rapid osmotic and a slower toxic stress, resulting from Na<sup>+</sup> ion accumulation and loss of K<sup>+</sup> in photosynthetic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref003">3</xref>]. Salt stress reduces the rate of photosynthesis, leading to a decrease of plant growth and crop yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref004">4</xref>]. However, in the context of global climate change and an increasing world population, abiotic stress tolerant crops and sustainable solutions in agriculture are urgently needed to respond to growing food demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>One way to overcome these challenges is to take advantage of plant-interacting microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref008">8</xref>]. Indeed, plants and their rhizosphere host diverse microbial communities, selected from bulk soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref011">11</xref>], and beneficial bacteria, defined as plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), can establish symbiotic associations with plants and promote their growth under optimal growth conditions or in response to biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref018">18</xref>]. Direct plant growth-promotion mechanisms include the acquisition of nutrients by nitrogen fixation, phosphate and zinc solubilization, or siderophore production for sequestering iron. The modulation of phytohormone levels, such as auxin, ethylene, cytokinin or gibberellin, also largely contributes to the beneficial properties of PGPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref021">21</xref>]. Indirect mechanisms comprise the production of antimicrobial agents against plant pathogenic bacteria or fungi, or inducing systemic resistance against soil-borne pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Arid regions cover about one quarter of the Earth’s land surface and encompass many of the challenges for increasing agricultural productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast to better known dryland farming, desert agriculture can function only when crop plants are irrigated–usually with underground water with various levels of salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref024">24</xref>]. Those areas face extreme environmental conditions, characterized by high levels of radiation, low rainfall, extreme temperatures, coarse soil which retains very little moisture, as well as low nutrients and typically high natural salinity, which all strongly limit the yield of crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref025">25</xref>]. Although deserts appear to be hardly inhabitable, a wide diversity of organisms has adapted to these extreme conditions. Plants along with their interacting microbial partners have evolved sophisticated mechanisms such as the production of osmoprotectants, reactive oxygen species scavengers or late embryogenesis abundant proteins to monitor the environment and reprogram their metabolism and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, this particular environment is an ideal reservoir to isolate and identify beneficial bacteria enhancing plant tolerance towards environmental stresses such as drought, heat or salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>To identify and characterize stress tolerance-promoting bacteria that can increase plant tolerance to abiotic stresses and therefore could be used for improving desert agriculture, we previously isolated and sequenced a number of rhizosphere and endophytic bacterial strains from nodules of desert pioneer plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref030">30</xref>]. Here, we report that <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187, an endophytic bacterium isolated from root nodules of the indigenous desert plant <italic>Indigofera argentea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref031">31</xref>], significantly increased yield of the agronomically important crop alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>) in field trials under both normal and salt stress conditions, demonstrating that SA187 has a high potential to improve agriculture under desert conditions. To better understand the molecular mechanisms for conveying enhanced stress tolerance of plants, we studied its interaction with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. SA187 could enhance Arabidopsis tolerance to salt stress, and GFP-labeled SA187 colonized surface and inner tissues of Arabidopsis roots and shoots. Moreover, transcriptome analyses uncovered that SA187-induced plant tolerance to salt stress is due to maintenance of photosynthesis and primary metabolism and a reduction of ABA-mediated stress responses. Using different plant hormone related mutants, ethylene sensing was found to play a primary role in SA187-induced salt stress tolerance. Indeed, Arabidopsis mutants impaired in ethylene perception were compromised in their beneficial response to SA187, while mutants deficient in ethylene synthesis remained unaffected. Gene expression analysis of SA187 indicated an upregulation of the methionine salvage pathway upon plant colonization, increasing the production of 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), which is known to be converted into ethylene <italic>in planta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref032">32</xref>]. KMBA alone could mimic the beneficial effects of SA187 on plant salt stress tolerance and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), which specifically precipitates KMBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref033">33</xref>], could abrogate SA187-induced plant stress tolerance. These results unravel a novel communication process during beneficial plant-microbe interactions under stress conditions.</p>

<title><italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187 increases alfalfa yield in field trials under field conditions</title>
<p>Since SA187 was an outstandingly performing bacterial isolate in a previous screen using Arabidopsis as a model plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref031">31</xref>], we evaluated the potential agronomic use of SA187 as a biological solution for agriculture. Therefore, we tested the beneficial activity of SA187 on different growth parameters of the crop plant alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>), which is largely used as animal feed in different regions of the world. Alfalfa seeds were coated with SA187 and tested in parallel with mock-coated seeds at the experimental field station Hada Al-Sham near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A randomized complete block design with a split-split plot arrangement with different replicates was used over two subsequent growing seasons (2015–2016 and 2016–2017). Using low saline water (EC = 3.12 dS·m<sup>-1</sup>) for irrigation, SA187-inoculated alfalfa plants showed an increase of 16 and 12% of fresh weight and 14 and 17% of dry biomass in the two growing seasons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Using high saline water (EC = 7.81 dS·m<sup>-1</sup>) for irrigation, a similar beneficial impact on plant growth was observed over the two growing seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, the growth parameters in the second season were statistically not significant, most likely due to exceptional rainfall in that period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We concluded that SA187 can efficiently improve crop productivity under extreme agricultural conditions.</p>

<p>To better understand the molecular mechanism by which SA187 confers stress tolerance to plants, we used the genetic model plant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> and first assessed the capacity of SA187 to affect the early stages of Arabidopsis development under normal conditions (½ MS agar medium, 22°C, 16 h of light). When compared to mock-inoculated plants, SA187 had no influence on the germination rate of Arabidopsis seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and apart from considerably longer root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), 5-day-old seedlings showed no morphological changes. Similarly, after transfer onto new ½ MS plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), no differences between 17-day-old mock- and SA187-inoculated seedlings were recorded, when measuring root length, lateral root density, shoot morphology, or root and shoot fresh and dry weight of seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>) indicating that SA187 has no significant effect on Arabidopsis development under normal growth conditions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the stress tolerance and growth promoting capacity of SA187 on Arabidopsis was highlighted under salt stress. Five days after germination, SA187- and mock-inoculated seedlings were transferred onto ½ MS agar plates supplemented with 100 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), and the same growth parameters as abobe were evaluated up to 12 days after the transfer to salt plates. SA187-inoculated plants showed stress tolerance promoting activity on salt stress: the shoot and root systems of SA187-inoculated plants were significantly more developed than those of mock-inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). While primary root length was similar between SA187- and mock-inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), lateral root density was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Similarly to 5-day-old seedlings, SA187-inoculated plants at this stage had more than twice longer root hairs compared to the mock-inoculated ones under both normal and salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, we proved that the beneficial activity of SA187 was largely linked to living bacterial cells as heat-inactivated SA187 cells did not induce any beneficial activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Overall, SA187 strongly enhanced Arabidopsis growth of both shoot and root under salt stress conditions, in contrast to normal conditions.</p>

<title><italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187 colonizes epidermis and inner tissues of both roots and shoots</title>
<p>After recognition of the beneficial impact of SA187 on plant physiology, we wanted to characterize the interaction of SA187 with plants in more detail, and find whether SA187 is able to efficiently colonize Arabidopsis as its non-native host. SA187 cells were stably transformed to express GFP (SA187-GFP), which did not affect their beneficial effect on Arabidopsis seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Confocal microscopy revealed that SA187-GFP colonized both roots and shoots on ½ MS agar plates or in soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4</xref>). On vertical ½ MS agar plates, the first colonies (formed by a small number of cells) were observed on the root epidermis in the elongation zone, preferentially in grooves between epidermal cell files (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In the differentiation zone and older root parts, colonies were larger and proportional with the age of the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). A similar colonization pattern was observed in soil-grown seedlings, however, with a more random distribution of colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). SA187-GFP colonies were also often found in cavities around the base of lateral roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). While it was rare to detect SA187-GFP cells inside root tissues in 5–7 days old seedlings, the apoplast of the root cortex and even of the central cylinder was regularly occupied by small scattered colonies in 3 weeks old seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Indeed, in our initial plant assays, SA187 could be re-isolated from surface sterilized Arabidopsis roots, indicating that SA187 was proliferating inside root tissues. Inspecting shoots, SA187-GFP colonies were found deep inside the apoplast of hypocotyls, cotyledons and the first true leaves, and in several cases, bacterial cells were directly observed to penetrate through stomata of these organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we evaluated colonization of root systems by SA187 (wild type strain) under normal and salt conditions. Plants were germinated on ½ MS agar plates containing SA187 wild type strains, transferred to new ½ MS plates with or without 100 mM NaCl after 5 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), and parts of their root systems grown after the transfer were used for bacterial extraction after 5 more days. Interestingly, quantification based on counting of colony forming units (CFU) revealed that roots from salt conditions were twice more colonized than those from normal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that in our experimental system plants can probably facilitate their accessibility to colonization by beneficial bacteria under stress conditions.</p>

<title>SA187 massively reprograms Arabidopsis gene expression upon colonization</title>
<p>To uncover how salt stress tolerance is achieved in SA187-inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings, we performed RNA-Seq analysis comparing the transcriptome of mock-inoculated to SA187-inoculated plants under non-saline (Mock, SA187), and salt stress conditions (Salt, SA187+Salt).

<p>Cluster 1 and 7 comprise the largest sets of differentially expressed genes with 1607 and 744 members, respectively, and consist of salt-stress regulated genes that were unaffected by the SA187 inoculation. Whereas Cluster 1 genes are strongly downregulated under salinity and are involved in water homeostasis, salicylic acid (SA) and defense response, those of Cluster 7 are highly upregulated and enriched in genes that are induced in response to water and salt stress or abscisic acid (ABA).</p>
<p>A specific effect of SA187 on the transcriptome of plants was found in Clusters 2, 3 and 4. Cluster 2 (354 genes) represents genes that are upregulated by SA187 independently of the growth conditions. This cluster is significantly enriched in plant defense genes such as chitin responsive genes but also in ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Importantly, Cluster 3 genes (246) are strongly downregulated in mock-inoculated plants under salt stress conditions but remain unaltered upon SA187-inoculation. These genes have a role in the primary metabolism, such as photosynthesis, carbon and energy metabolisms. On the contrary, Cluster 4 genes (464) are enriched in ABA and abiotic stress response and are upregulated in salt-treated plants, but not when the plants were inoculated with SA187.</p>
<p>In summary, these data indicate that SA187 colonization triggers in Arabidopsis the expression of genes involved in defense response as shown by the significant enrichment for chitin responsive genes and ethylene and JA signaling. Moreover, under saline conditions, SA187-inoculated plants release themselves from the impact of abiotic stress (ABA), maintain higher metabolic and photosynthetic activity, and can therefore grow better than mock-inoculated plants.</p>

<p>Altogether, these results indicate that the beneficial effect of SA187 may not be mediated by JA perception or the ABA pathway, but rather by the ethylene perception, as it was found to be necessary for SA187-induced salt stress tolerance on Arabidopsis plants.</p>

<title>Arabidopsis upregulates the methionine salvage pathway in SA187</title>
<p>The previous results suggested that ethylene most likely originates from SA187 cells rather than from the canonical plant ACC synthase (ACS) pathway. To support the hypothesis that SA187 provides ethylene to promote plant growth, we searched for bacterial genes encoding ACS or ethylene forming enzymes (EFE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref043">43</xref>] in the genome of SA187 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref031">31</xref>]. No ACS- or EFE-related genes were found in SA187, which on the other hand, contains a conserved methionine salvage pathway (also known as 5’-methyl-thioadenosine cycle), and one of its components, KMBA, is known to be an ethylene precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref044">44</xref>]. While SA187 alone did not produce ethylene when grown on synthetic media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), the expression level of most of the genes encoding proteins involved in the methionine salvage pathway were upregulated in SA187 upon plant colonization compared with bacteria incubated for 4h in liquid ½ MS with or without 100 mM NaCl in the absence of plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that KMBA could function as an ethylene precursor during the beneficial plant-microbe interaction, we tested the effect of KMBA on Arabidopsis in comparison to SA187 inoculation. Under salt stress conditions, application of 100 nM KMBA induced a similar beneficial activity on Arabidopsis as SA187 resulting in a similar increase in both root and shoot fresh weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we took the advantage of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), a known interactor of KMBA <italic>in vitro</italic> that was previously shown to precipitate KMBA produced by <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and consequently impairs the production of ethylene by photo-oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref033">33</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187 was previously isolated from the desert pioneer plant <italic>Indigofera argentea</italic> Burm.f. (Fabaceae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref031">31</xref>]. In this work, we show that this bacterium promotes plant tolerance to salt stress, describing this strain as a stress tolerance-promoting bacterium. Indeed, under field conditions, using SA187 as an inoculum for alfalfa seeds and by monitoring growth parameters and yield over two different agriculture seasons, the inoculated plants showed a clear improvement in yield independently of the water regime applied (high or low salt stress). The data show similar effectiveness of the SA187 inoculations in both years. However, the differences for high and low-saline conditions were reduced during the second year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which could be explained by the increased rainfall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) during the 2<sup>nd</sup> growing season that may have diluted the salinity effects. We conclude that SA187 can efficiently improve crop productivity under extreme agricultural conditions and could be a simple biological solution to grow plants under extreme adverse conditions.</p>
<p>In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the beneficial plant interaction with SA187, Arabidopsis was used as a model system. SA187 colonizes both surface and inner tissues of Arabidopsis roots and shoots, supporting a functional plant-bacterial interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Colonization of both above- and under-ground organs is in agreement with the observation that leaf and root microbial communities share an important portion of their bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref011">11</xref>]. While the mechanism of entry of SA187 into roots occurs most probably via cracks and/or by active penetration between epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref045">45</xref>], we observed that shoots were colonized through stomata, indicating that these apertures represent a major route of entry into plants not only by pathogenic but also by beneficial bacteria.</p>
<p>The capacity of SA187 to enhance salt stress tolerance of Arabidopsis was analyzed in detail. While SA187 induced only negligible morphological and physiological changes in plants under non-stress conditions (with the exception of longer root hairs), SA187 significantly enhanced root and shoot growth with increased fresh and dry weight under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). In addition, SA187 increased lateral root density, and thus the overall root surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) under salt stress. Changes in the root architecture have been considered to be beneficial for adaptation to various abiotic stress conditions including salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref046">46</xref>], and very likely contribute to the SA187-induced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>The effect of salinity on plants includes two components: an osmotic component, being the consequence of an altered osmotic pressure due to an increased salt concentration, and a toxic ion effect as a result of the high Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in shoots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref048">48</xref>]. The toxic effects of the Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation result in premature senescence, leading to a decrease in photosynthesis efficiency and impaired metabolic processes. Na<sup>+</sup> also competes with K<sup>+</sup> in membrane transport and enzymatic functions, reducing plant growth. Most plant cells possess mechanisms to counteract the harmful effects of Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation by retaining K<sup>+</sup> and actively excluding Na<sup>+</sup> in roots and/or sequestering Na<sup>+</sup> in vacuoles in shoots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref050">50</xref>]. Several studies have shown that an inoculation of commercial crops, such as maize, strawberry and wheat by PGPBs under salt stress results in a decrease of Na<sup>+</sup> and an increase of K<sup>+</sup> in their shoots and leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref053">53</xref>]. The inoculation of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> (white clover) by <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> GB03 induced a decrease in the Na<sup>+</sup> content in shoots in both species accompanied by an increase or no change in the K<sup>+</sup> content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref055">55</xref>]. In our study, we found no differences in Na<sup>+</sup> contents in shoots or roots between SA187-inoculated and mock-inoculated plants in response to salt stress. However, K<sup>+</sup> ion levels in both roots and, to a lesser extent, shoots increased upon the SA187 inoculation, resulting in reduced Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g003">Fig 3C and 3F</xref>), which might contribute to the higher salt tolerance of SA187-inoculated plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>To analyze the interaction of SA187 with Arabidopsis at the molecular level, the transcriptome of Arabidopsis grown under salt and non-stress conditions in the absence or presence of SA187 was compared. The inoculation with SA187 dramatically reprogrammed the gene expression of plants grown either on ½ MS or on ½ MS with 100 mM NaCl. This was highlighted in Clusters 2, 3, and 4 of the RNA-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Cluster 3 genes, mostly related to photosynthesis and primary metabolism, were strongly downregulated under salt stress in mock-inoculated plants, confirming previously published reports which correlated such a downregulation with the inhibition of growth and development under salt stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref057">57</xref>]. These results could therefore explain why SA187-inoculated plants grow better under stress conditions: SA187-inoculated plants only mildly reduce their photosynthetic capacity and maintain a functional metabolism allowing further growth in comparison to mock-inoculated plants. Cluster 4 genes are enriched in ABA-related stress genes and were induced upon salt stress in mock-inoculated plants, but not in SA187-inoculated plants. These results indicate that some salt stress-induced responses, including the enhancement of ABA levels, are dampened by SA187. However, they do not explain why plants are more salt stress tolerant. Indeed, the ABA biosynthesis <italic>aba2-1</italic> mutant or the ABA receptor quadruple mutant <italic>pyr1-1 pyl1-1 pyl2-1 pyl4-1</italic> still exhibited a similar growth improvement by SA187 as wild-type plants when exposed to salt stress, indicating that ABA production and signaling are dispensable in the presence of these beneficial bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>
<p>Induced salt stress tolerance by SA187 could be elucidated by Cluster 2, comprising genes specifically induced upon SA187-inoculation. This cluster is significantly enriched for genes involved in defense response to bacterium, and for chitin response. This latter GO term is not surprising in a plant-bacterial system, since pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as fungal chitin and bacterial flagellin are inducing a large set of common genes in plants, with more than 60% of overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref058">58</xref>]. But the most interesting feature lies in the enrichment of the ethylene response pathway. Indeed, SA187 activates the ethylene perception pathway as shown by the qPCR analysis of ethylene-induced genes and by the ethylene reporter <italic>pEBF2</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g006">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g007">7B</xref>). Moreover, ACC and KMBA as ethylene precursors largely mimicked the beneficial effect of SA187 on plants under salt stress (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g007">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g008">8B</xref>). Finally, the involvement of ethylene was also supported by the observation of much longer root hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), as ethylene plays an important role in root hair elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref060">60</xref>]. Although the role of ethylene in plant abiotic stress tolerance is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref061">61</xref>], several pieces of evidence indicate that this phytohormone is important for plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. For example, the pre-treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with ACC, or the use of the constitutive ethylene response (<italic>CTR1</italic>) or the <italic>EIN3</italic> gain-of-function mutants were shown to enhance salt stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref063">63</xref>]. Furthermore, an ethylene overproduction in the <italic>eto1</italic> mutant lead to salinity tolerance due to improved Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis through an RBOHF-dependent regulation of Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>Importantly, ethylene-related Arabidopsis mutants revealed that the beneficial activity of SA187 is to a major extent mediated via the perception of externally produced ethylene. Although the <italic>ein2-1</italic> and <italic>ein3-1</italic> mutants were compromised in their beneficial response to SA187, the disruption of the plant ethylene production in the heptuple <italic>acs</italic> mutant showed the same growth enhancement under salt stress when comparing SA187-inoculated plants to mock-inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This was supported by a parallel pharmacological approach, demonstrating that inhibition of the ACS activity using AVG did not block the stress tolerance promoting activity of SA187, while blocking the ethylene receptors by AgNO<sub>3</sub> compromised the beneficial activity of SA187 on plants under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>As plants were shown to perceive ethylene even without functional plant ethylene production, we suspect that SA187 could provide plants with ethylene or its precursor. Three main pathways for ethylene biosynthesis have been described in bacteria and other microbes. The mold <italic>Dictyostelium mucoroides</italic> and fungi <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic> produce ethylene from methionine via S-adenosyl-methionine, through the sequential action of ACC synthases and ACC oxidases. S-adenosyl-methionine is first converted to ACC by ACC synthases, which is then oxidized by ACC oxidases to release ethylene and cyanide. The same pathway is well known to be responsible for ethylene biosynthesis in plants, where cyanide is converted to β-cyanoalanine to avoid toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref065">65</xref>]. Microbes can also produce ethylene from α-ketoglutarate and arginine by the action of the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE), which has been found in several microbial species such as <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> and <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref066">66</xref>]. A third pathway has been identified in a variety of bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus albidus</italic>, or in fungi like truffle or pathogenic <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, where ethylene is produced via oxidation of KMBA, an intermediate of the methionine salvage pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref067">67</xref>]. KMBA can be spontaneously converted to ethylene by photo-oxidation or through the action of peroxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref033">33</xref>], which are abundantly present in the plant apoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref069">69</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on P-BLAST homology searches, genome analysis of SA187 revealed that neither ACC synthase nor EFE genes are present in SA187. Instead, SA187 contains the entire methionine salvage pathway, suggesting that KMBA is most likely the precursor of ethylene in SA187. Interestingly, most of the methionine salvage pathway genes in SA187 are only actively expressed upon colonization of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Moreover, the application of KMBA could mimic the beneficial effect of SA187 on plants when subjected to salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007273.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Importantly, the SA187 beneficial activity towards plant was highly reduced when treated with DNPH, known to provoke KMBA precipitation and prevent thus its oxidation and ethylene release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, the KMBA involvement in abiotic stress tolerance constitutes a novel mechanism in the field of plant-beneficial bacteria interaction. While the induction of the ethylene signaling pathway by PGPB has been reported in several studies to play an important role in the induced systemic resistance in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref071">71</xref>], PGPB activity in the context of abiotic stress has been commonly attributed rather to a reduction of the plant ethylene level through the activity of bacterial ACC deaminases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref072">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref074">74</xref>], or shown to be independent of the ethylene signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref076">76</xref>]. Several reports hypothesized the involvement of ethylene signaling in abiotic stress tolerance induced by rhizosphere bacteria, with evidences that were largely based on emissions of unidentified volatiles or by comparison with plant-fungal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref078">78</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that the beneficial bacterium <italic>Burkholderia phytofirmans</italic> PsJN enhanced plant growth through an auxin/ethylene-dependent signaling pathway under optimal conditions, but in contrast to the present study, the authors hypothesized that the plant intrinsic ethylene production was fundamental in that interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref079">79</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, we provide evidence that the endophytic bacterium <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SA187 induces salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis via production of KMBA to activate the ethylene pathway. SA187 enhances plant salt stress tolerance under controlled conditions in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and under field conditions in the crop plant alfalfa. These results show the potential use of SA187 for bringing saline agriculture of current crops a step closer to reality.</p>

Field trial was conducted at the experimental station in Hada Al-Sham (N 21°47'47.1" E 39°43'48.8"), Saudi Arabia, in winter seasons 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with a split-split plot arrangement of four replicates in the for season 2015–2016 season and three replicates in the 2016–2017 season, plots (2 × 1.5 m) with seed spacing 20 cm row-to-row. The field was irrigated using groundwater with two different salinity levels: low salinity (EC = 3.12 dS·m<sup>-1</sup>), and high salinity (EC = 7.81 dS·m<sup>-1</sup>). The soil had an average pH 7.74 and salinity EC = 1.95 dS·m<sup>-1</sup>. Agronomical data (plant height, fresh biomass, and dry biomass) were recorded every 25–30 days from each harvest; three harvests were done in the first season, four harvests in the second season. Field trials data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design using a Factorial ANOVA Model, followed by least significant difference (LSD) test for pairwise comparisons. Results with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analysis was carried out using SAS/STAT software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sas.com/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.sas.com/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Prior to every experiment, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> seeds were surface sterilized 10 min in 70% ethanol + 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate on a shaker, washed 2 times in 96% ethanol and let to dry. To ensure SA187-inoculation, sterilized seeds were sown on ½ MS plates (Murashige and Skoog basal salts, Sigma) containing SA187 (2·10<sup>5</sup> cfu·ml<sup>-1</sup>), stratified for 2 days at 4°C in the dark and then placed vertically to growth conditions for 5 days as shown as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007273.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. The ½ MS plates with SA187 were prepared by addition of 10<sup>7</sup> bacteria to 50 ml pre-cooled agar medium during plate preparation.</p>
<p>Average length of root hairs was determined based on images of 5-day-old roots (1 image per root at constant distance from the root tip, 25 seedlings per condition) or 16-day-old roots (along the whole primary root length grown after transfer) captured by a Nikon AZ100M microscope equipped with an AZ Plan Apo 2x objective and a DS-Ri1 camera (Nikon). All root hairs in focus were measured using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Average values and standard deviations were calculated from 10% longest root hairs to eliminate non-developed root hairs and describe the maximal elongation capacity of root hairs.</p>
<p>For salt stress tolerance assays, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred onto ½ MS plates with or without 100 mM NaCl (Sigma). Primary root length was measured every 2 days using ImageJ software after scanning the plates. Lateral root density was evaluated as detectable number of lateral roots under a stereo microscope divided by the primary root length. Fresh weight of shoots and roots was measured 12 days after transfer of seedlings. Dry weight was measured after drying shoot and shoots for 2 days at 70°C. Following Koch’s postulate, SA187 was re-isolated from Arabidopsis root system at the end of an initial experiment to confirm the genotype of the inoculated strain. To address the ethylene involvement in Arabidopsis adaptation to salt stress, ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, Sigma), KMBA (2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid, Sigma), AVG (aminoethoxyvinylglycine, Sigma), AgNO<sub>3</sub> (silver nitrate, Sigma) were added into pre-cooled ½ MS agar medium together with 100 mM NaCl. For DNPH (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, Sigma), 5 mM solution was prepared by solubilizing DNPH into 2M HCl (hydrochloric acid, Sigma) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref081">81</xref>], then the solution was diluted until reaching 1 mM, and equilibrated to the same pH as MS medium (pH 5.8) using 2M KOH (potassium hydroxide, Sigma). DNPH was used at final concentration 3 μM.</p>
<p>All plants were grown in long day conditions in growth chambers (Percival; 16 h light / 8 h dark, 22°C). Each experiment was performed at least in three biological replicates.</p>

<title>Generation of GFP-labelled bacteria</title>
<p>SA187 was genetically labeled with the <italic>GFP</italic> expressing cassette by taking advantage of the mini-Tn7 transposon system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref082">82</xref>]. In order to specifically select for a bacterium carrying the <italic>GFP</italic> integration in the genome, a spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutant of the strain was obtained first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref083">83</xref>]: an overnight-grown culture of SA187 was plated on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> of rifampicin, and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 28°C. At least 10 colonies, representing spontaneous rifampicin resistant (Rif<sup>R</sup>) mutants of the strain were streaked twice on LB plates containing 100 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> of rifampicin and thereafter twice on LB plates supplemented with 200 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> of rifampicin. The GFP expressing cassette was introduced in the SA187 Rif<sup>R</sup> strain by conjugation as described in Lambertsen et al. (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007273.ref084">84</xref>]. Briefly, 10<sup>10</sup> cells of SA187 Rif<sup>R</sup> strain were mixed with 10<sup>9</sup> cells of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> SM10λpir harboring the helper plasmid pUX-BF13, the GFP donor (a mini-Tn7) plasmid and mobilizer pRK600 plasmid. The mixed culture was incubated on sterile nitrocellulose filter for 16hrs. The conjugation culture of bacterial cells was resuspended in saline buffer (9 g/L NaCl) and spread on selective media with a propitiate antibiotics to select transformed SA187. The selected colonies were screened by fluorescence microscopy for GFP fluorescence and positive colonies were further subjected to genotype confirmation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.</p>

<title>Confocal microscopy</title>
<p>GFP-labeled SA187 on Arabidopsis roots was imaged using an inverted Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.45, Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8, and Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 Oil objectives. Seedlings grown for 3–21 days on vertical ½ MS agar plates or in soil inoculated with SA187-GFP were washed gently in sterile distilled water and transferred on a sterile agar plate. A block of agar with several seedlings was immediately cut out and placed upside-down to a chambered cover glass (Lab-Tek II) with 30 μM propidium iodide (PI) in water as mounting medium. The GFP and PI fluorescence was excited using the 488nm laser line, and captured as a single track (emission of 493–537 nm for the GFP channel, 579–628 nm for the PI channel, 645–708 nm for chloroplast autofluorescence). For 3D reconstructions, 1 μm-step Z-stacks were taken, and images were generated in the integral 3D view of the Zen software (Zeiss).</p>

<p>Col-0 seedlings were germinated on SA187-inoculated ½ MS agar plates and transferred to new ½ MS plates with or without 100 mM NaCl 5 days after germination (10 seedlings per plate). Parts of their root systems grown after the transfer were cut, gently washed by dipping in distilled water to remove non-attached bacterial cells, and then ground in Eppendorf tubes using Teflon sticks. Each sample was resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Silwet L-77), sonicated for 1 min and subsequently vortexed for 10 min. Samples were diluted 10-fold, and then spread on LB agar plates, and colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after overnight incubation at 28°C. Calculated number of CFUs was normalized per centimeter of root length (total root length was determined based on images of root systems before their harvest).

Measurements based on 3 biological replicates per time point. Experiment was repeated three times with similar results; a representative experiment is shown. Error bars represent SD. For (A) no significant differences were found between each time point versus the control based on the Mann-Whitney U test (P &lt; 0.05).</p>
