<abstract>
<p>Two-component systems constitute phosphotransfer signaling pathways and enable adaptation to environmental changes, an essential feature for bacterial survival. The general stress response (GSR) in the plant-protecting alphaproteobacterium <italic>Sphingomonas melonis</italic> Fr1 involves a two-component system consisting of multiple stress-sensing histidine kinases (Paks) and the response regulator PhyR; PhyR in turn regulates the alternative sigma factor EcfG, which controls expression of the GSR regulon. While Paks had been shown to phosphorylate PhyR <italic>in vitro</italic>, it remained unclear if and under which conditions direct phosphorylation happens in the cell, as Paks also phosphorylate the single domain response regulator SdrG, an essential yet enigmatic component of the GSR signaling pathway. Here, we analyze the role of SdrG and investigate an alternative function of the membrane-bound PhyP (here re-designated PhyT), previously assumed to act as a PhyR phosphatase. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays show that PhyT transfers a phosphoryl group from SdrG to PhyR via phosphoryl transfer on a conserved His residue. This finding, as well as complementary GSR reporter assays, indicate the participation of SdrG and PhyT in a Pak-SdrG-PhyT-PhyR phosphorelay. Furthermore, we demonstrate complex formation between PhyT and PhyR. This finding is substantiated by PhyT-dependent membrane association of PhyR in unstressed cells, while the response regulator is released from the membrane upon stress induction. Our data support a model in which PhyT sequesters PhyR, thereby favoring Pak-dependent phosphorylation of SdrG. In addition, PhyT assumes the role of the SdrG-phosphotransferase to activate PhyR. Our results place SdrG into the GSR signaling cascade and uncover a dual role of PhyT in the GSR.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The general stress response (GSR) in alphaproteobacteria represents an essential feature for survival in stressful, constantly changing habitats. A variety of stresses are sensed by GSR-activating histidine kinases and lead to multiple stress resistance via the response regulator PhyR. Here, we describe the essential bifunctional regulator PhyT, which tunes GSR activation in the plant-protecting strain <italic>Sphingomonas melonis</italic>. It prevents lethal over activation of the GSR by impeding inappropriate phosphorylation of the response regulator PhyR via protein-protein interaction. In addition, PhyT acts as a phosphotransferase in a GSR activating phosphorelay. Our data suggest a model according to which histidine kinases are induced by environmental cues, which results in phosphorylation of the single domain response regulator SdrG. The phosphoryl group of SdrG is then transferred by the phosphotransferase PhyT to the master regulator of the general stress response PhyR. Histidine kinase derived PhyT-type regulators are found also in other alphaproteobacteria, implying that the identified regulatory strategy might be conserved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two-component regulatory pathways enable bacteria to react to changing environmental conditions. Classical two-component systems consist of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator; the histidine kinase autophosphorylates upon sensing appropriate environmental signals and subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to the response regulator, which in turn triggers an adaptation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref004">4</xref>]. Multicomponent phosphorelays represent more complex two-component systems involving either a so-called hybrid histidine kinase or, alternatively, a single domain response regulator (SDRR) which can be phosphorylated by multiple histidine kinases. Either way, a phosphotransferase subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to an output response regulator. Therefore, by increasing the number of checkpoints in a phosphorylation pathway, phosphorelays allow for more precise regulation, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The general stress response (GSR) is pivotal for alphaproteobacteria for environmental adaption and host microbe interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref010">10</xref>]. Notably, it connects a two-component system to alternative sigma-factor regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref012">12</xref>]. The GSR can be induced by a variety of different stresses and results in multiple stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref010">10</xref>]. Studied systems involve for example plant-associated bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref013">13</xref>] such as <italic>Sphingomonas melonis</italic> Fr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>], <italic>Methylobacterium extorquens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref015">15</xref>], <italic>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref016">16</xref>], <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref017">17</xref>], intracellular pathogens like <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref011">11</xref>], or free-living species like <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref018">18</xref>]. The anti-sigma factor antagonist PhyR is phosphorylated under stressful conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>] and acts via a mechanism termed "sigma factor mimicry" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref021">21</xref>]. A phosphorylation-induced conformational change of PhyR results in the release of its sigma-factor like domain that subsequently binds to the anti-sigma factor NepR. Thereby, NepR liberates the alternative sigma-factor EcfG, which can then bind to RNA polymerase and re-direct transcription towards the GSR regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref021">21</xref>]. In the plant-protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref023">23</xref>], seven cytoplasmic histidine kinases (Paks) are involved in the GSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. They belong to the HWE/HisKA_2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref024">24</xref>], encoding the HRxxN motif in their DHp domain. Paks integrate multiple stress signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. Individual stresses are sensed by one or more Paks, and some of the Paks are able to sense more than one stress. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the Paks do not only phosphorylate PhyR (in the presence of NepR), but also the SDRR SdrG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The dual specificity of the Paks for PhyR and SdrG is supported at the structural level; in fact, the receiver domain of PhyR is the best structural homolog of SdrG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref025">25</xref>]. Like Sma0144 from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>meliloti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref026">26</xref>], SdrG belongs to the FAT GUY family of response regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref025">25</xref>]. The SDRR is a key regulator of the GSR in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>] and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>extorquens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref027">27</xref>]; however, its function can be bypassed by overexpression of either PhyR or the Paks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. The exact role of SdrG in GSR remains enigmatic. Potential mechanisms of SdrG activity might involve protein-protein interaction, comparable e.g. to CheY from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which is involved in chemotaxis regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref029">29</xref>] or to DivK from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic>, in which the regulator is involved in cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref030">30</xref>]. Alternatively, it is conceivable that SdrG participates in phosphotransfer, e.g. as the SDRR Spo0F, which is involved in sporulation initiation in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref005">5</xref>]; however, no phosphotransferase corresponding to Spo0B of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> has been identified for SdrG.</p>
<p>While in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 the genes encoding SdrG and the Paks are scattered throughout the genome, PhyP, an additional regulator of the GSR, is encoded at the <italic>phyR</italic> locus. The gene encodes a predicted membrane-anchored histidine kinase with a putative periplasmic sensor domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. Closer inspection revealed that PhyP contains the HRxxN motif in its DHp domain, but harbors a degenerated ATPase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. Due to its observed ability to disrupt the PhyR/NepR complex <italic>in vitro</italic> in a phosphorylatable His-341-dependent fashion, it has been proposed that PhyP acts as a PhyR phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. A <italic>phyP</italic> knockout was only obtained in GSR impaired strains, that is, in <italic>phyR</italic>, <italic>ecfG</italic>, or multiple <italic>pak</italic> knockout mutants, confirming PhyP as an essential negative regulator of the GSR in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The identification of PhyP-type proteins in other alphaproteobacteria, e.g. Bab1_1673 in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>abortus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref011">11</xref>], RpaI_4707 in <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> TIE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref031">31</xref>], RsiC in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>meliloti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref017">17</xref>], and LovK in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref018">18</xref>] suggests a conserved key role of the protein in the GSR.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the role of PhyP (re-designated PhyT in this study, see below) in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 and identify a direct molecular link to SdrG. Our results support a GSR regulatory model in which PhyT acts as a phosphotransferase mediating phosphotransfer between Pak-phosphorylated SdrG and PhyR. Furthermore, our results suggest that PhyT simultaneously prevents lethal over activation of the GSR by inhibiting direct PhyR phosphorylation by Paks via complex formation.

<title>Identification of an SdrG-phosphotransferase as part of a phosphorelay to activate the GSR</title>
<p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1, the <italic>phyR</italic> locus encodes the membrane-anchored protein PhyP, previously proposed to be a PhyR phosphatase, which is essential in strains with a functional GSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. Here, we studied the function of this central regulator further. First, we set out to test <italic>in vitro</italic> PhyR dephosphorylation by PhyP using PhyR <sup>32</sup>P-labeled at the Asp-194 residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref021">21</xref>], which was generated in presence of NepR using one of the PhyR-activating kinases (here PakF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. For dephosphorylation, we used <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> membrane particles containing heterologously produced PhyP or the PhyP (H341A) derivative as a control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. However, no phosphatase activity was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007294.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested an alternative hypothesis regarding the function of PhyP that integrates the central, but not yet understood, role of the positive GSR regulator SdrG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. We speculated that PhyP could participate in the GSR-activating phosphotransfer and would assume the role of a PhyR-activating phosphotransferase rather than that of a PhyR phosphatase. According to our working model, Paks act as the primary phosphoryl group sources for SdrG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. The phosphoryl group could then be shuttled to PhyP and subsequently transferred to PhyR. To test such a putative phosphorelay, we performed time course <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphotransfer assays. To guarantee SdrG~P as the sole phosphodonor in the reaction mixture, we used an on-column phosphorylation approach, in which SdrG was phosphorylated by Ni-NTA-bound <sup>32</sup>P-labeled PakF. The addition of SdrG~P to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> membrane particles harboring heterologously produced PhyP resulted in increasing PhyP phosphorylation and a concomitant decrease of SdrG~P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g001">Fig 1</xref>). When SdrG~P was added to a mixture of PhyR and PhyP, SdrG~P dephosphorylation could be observed over time, while the level of PhyR~P increased. This transfer was enhanced in presence of the anti-sigma factor NepR, which is required for efficient direct phosphotransfer from Paks to PhyR <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. No phosphotransfer from SdrG to PhyR was detectable in the absence of PhyP. Moreover, no decrease in SdrG~P and thus no phosphotransfer was observed for the inactive PhyP (H341A) derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data thus indicate that PhyP acts as a phosphotransferase that shuttles phosphoryl groups from SdrG~P to PhyR. Therefore, we have chosen to rename PhyP as PhyT and refer to it accordingly from now on.</p>

<p>Next, we aimed to confirm that SdrG takes part in PhyR phosphorylation in presence of PhyT <italic>in vivo</italic> by testing whether the phosphorylatable Asp residue of SdrG is required to fulfill its role as a positive GSR regulator. Therefore, we performed EcfG-dependent β-galactosidase assays and compared <italic>sdrG</italic> knockout strains producing either wild-type SdrG or the SdrG (D56E) derivative encoding a Glu substitution of the phosphorylatable Asp-56 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref025">25</xref>], a substitution that renders many response regulators active by mimicking the phosphorylated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref034">34</xref>].

<title>Role of the Pak-SdrG-PhyT-PhyR phosphorelay for stress-induced GSR activation <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>The PhyT- and SdrG-dependent PhyR phosphorylation shown above implies that the Paks' main function <italic>in vivo</italic> is to phosphorylate SdrG rather than PhyR, although Paks phosphorylate PhyR <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of NepR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. To further investigate PhyT- and SdrG-dependent PhyR phosphorylation in stress-induced GSR activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we determined EcfG activity using β-galactosidase reporter assays. We analyzed a <italic>pakB-G</italic> deletion mutant (thus leaving <italic>pakA</italic> intact), with and without an additional <italic>sdrG</italic> knockout pre- and post-induction with a chemical stress mixture. Although we observed residual GSR in the absence of SdrG, no increased GSR activation could be observed upon addition of the chemical stress mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Next, we tested GSR induction upon overexpression of <italic>pakA</italic> in an <italic>sdrG</italic> knockout background and a <italic>pakA</italic>-<italic>G</italic> deletion mutant with and without an additional <italic>sdrG</italic> knockout. We observed that overexpression of <italic>pakA</italic> bypasses the <italic>sdrG</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g003">Fig 3</xref>), which is congruent with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>]. This implies that PhyT- and SdrG-independent PhyR phosphorylation by the Paks is possible <italic>in vivo</italic>, but plays only a minor role under physiological expression levels of the <italic>paks</italic>. Additionally, considering that an <italic>sdrG</italic> knockout may lead to an artificial increase of direct PhyR phosphorylation by Paks, the observed residual GSR activation is likely to be even lower in wild-type cells.</p>

<p>We also tested stress-dependent GSR induction in a <italic>pakA-G</italic> deletion mutant. In this strain, the GSR was still inducible upon stress application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g003">Fig 3</xref>), which points to an additional kinase present in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 leading to PhyR phosphorylation. In the light of this finding, we performed EcfG-dependent β-galactosidase assays emphasizing the dependency of GSR induction on both SdrG and PhyT. In a <italic>pakA-G</italic> deletion mutant, an additional <italic>phyT</italic> knockout abolished GSR induction under stress conditions, indicating that the so far unidentified kinase strictly depends on the phosphorelay involving PhyT and SdrG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007294.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

<title>The phosphotransferase PhyT forms a complex with PhyR at the onset of GSR activation</title>
<p>Because PhyT functions as a phosphotransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g001">Fig 1</xref>), one would predict that it plays a role as a positive regulator of the GSR, which is puzzling in light of its described function as a negative regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. The latter function was deduced from the ability of PhyT to disrupt the NepR/PhyR complex <italic>in vitro</italic>—interpreted as phosphatase activity—and on the finding that its knockout is only possible in a GSR-impaired background, implying a lethal over activation of GSR in the absence of PhyT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>].

<p>We speculated that PhyT controls the amount of phosphorylated PhyR by binding the response regulator and thereby preventing its direct phosphorylation by Paks. To test this working model, we first performed a bacterial two-hybrid (BACTH) assay. We used wild-type PhyR and a derivative in which the phosphorylatable Asp-194 residue of the receiver domain was mutated. In addition, we also examined a PhyR Glu-235 mutant, which contains a mutation located at the interface of the sigma factor-like and the receiver domain and results in a constitutively active PhyR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref020">20</xref>]. Binding of the response regulator derivatives to the anti-sigma factor NepR was validated as controls. We showed that, indeed, PhyR and PhyT interact in the BACTH assay and that PhyT forms a dimer using plate assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007294.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) as well as β-galactosidase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007294.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the D194A mutation in PhyR seems to weaken its interaction with PhyT, while no effect on PhyT interaction could be observed for the E235A derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

<title>PhyR sequestration to the membrane by PhyT and its release upon stress induction</title>
<p>The protein-protein interaction of PhyR and PhyT predicts that PhyR is bound to the membrane under unstressed conditions. To test this, we studied the interaction between PhyR and PhyT by observing the association of sfGFP-tagged PhyR to the cell membrane depending on the stress condition and the presence/absence of PhyT using fluorescence microscopy. In a first set of experiments, we found that PhyR localized to the membrane under unstressed conditions, which supports binding of PhyR to the membrane-anchored PhyT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), while a homogeneous distribution was observed for sfGFP alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007294.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). PhyR dissociated from the membrane under stress conditions, presumably due to PhyR phosphorylation and subsequent binding to NepR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>In this study, we uncovered essential functions in the regulation of the GSR in the alphaproteobacterium <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1, which resulted in an extended model of the core pathway involved in the activation of the crucial regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Based on our data, we defined the function of membrane-anchored PhyT, formerly described as the PhyR phosphatase PhyP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>] and placed the SDRR SdrG in the core mechanism of GSR. We present <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that the negative regulatory function of PhyT, which prevents the lethal over activation of the GSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>], relies on complex formation with unphosphorylated PhyR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g006">6</xref>).

<p>Upon stress induction, the Paks autophosphorylate and transfer the phosphoryl group to the SDRR SdrG. Direct phosphorylation of PhyR by the Paks is inhibited due to PhyT-PhyR complex formation. PhyT transfers the phosphoryl group from SdrG~P to PhyR. PhyR~P dissociates from PhyT to bind the anti-sigma factor NepR and thereby releases the alternative sigma-factor EcfG, which initiates transcription of the GSR regulon by binding to RNA polymerase. For further details on the PhyR-NepR-EcfG cascade and Paks see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<p>Altogether, we suggest a model for GSR activation according to which Paks phosphorylate SdrG upon stress induction. When the concentration of SdrG~P reaches a threshold level, it induces the phosphotransferase activity of PhyT in a competitive way, thereby temporarily replacing PhyR to transfer its phosphoryl group to PhyT. EcfG-bound NepR could then eventually prime PhyR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref035">35</xref>] via direct interaction for facilitated phosphorylation by PhyT. Overall, our data suggest a mechanism by which a precise interplay between the bifunctional regulator PhyT, SdrG, PhyR and the seven stress-sensing Paks is essential to ensure appropriate GSR induction via "sigma factor mimicry" and thus via NepR and the general stress sigma factor EcfG.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that the phosphotransferase PhyT irreversibly transfers the phosphoryl group from SdrG~P to PhyR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007294.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007294.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This is in contrast to other described bacterial phosphotransferases such as Spo0B of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilits</italic> that catalyze reversible phosphotransfer reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref036">36</xref>]; however, note that unidirectional phosphotransfer has been observed for the histidine phosphotransferase YPD-1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic> to the response regulator SSK1-R2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref037">37</xref>]. Currently, we cannot rule out that PhyT switches its activity to PhyR dephosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> either by turning into a phosphatase or by catalyzing the reverse phosphotransfer reaction in response to external signals e.g. via its so far uncharacterized periplasmic domain or via protein-protein interaction with so far unknown interaction partners. It thus remains to be investigated how the GSR is shut down and whether an additional phosphatase exists. Additionally, it is unknown whether the system relies on the instability of the phosphoryl-Asp of PhyR, basal PhyR protein turnover or if stress-dependent PhyR degradation plays a role, as it has been observed in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>abortus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 inhabits the phyllosphere, a stressful environment characterized by constantly changing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref013">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that a strict regulatory system such as the GSR is under constant pressure to evolve in terms of sensitivity and specificity. PhyT and SdrG might have co-evolved in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 in order to ensure appropriate GSR induction while simultaneously counteracting the danger of lethal over activation.</p>
<p>We suspect that PhyT evolved from a histidine kinase, e.g. via degeneration of its catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref014">14</xref>]. Precedence exists in other two-component systems that involve degenerated histidine kinases. These include the dimeric histidine phosphotransferases Spo0B from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> involved in the initiation of sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref005">5</xref>] and ChpT from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic>, which is involved in cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref040">40</xref>]. Notably, the evolution of PhyT-type regulators is not limited to the model strain <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1, but rather conserved among alphaproteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref009">9</xref>]. Various studies have been conducted on PhyT-type negative GSR regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref031">31</xref>], albeit the mechanism by which they act at the molecular level remains to be elucidated. It is conceivable that this protein functions as a phosphotransferase in other alphaproteobacteria as well. Nonetheless, features and regulatory strategies of the regulators mediating the GSR seem to have diversified to different extents in the phylogenetic class, likely as a result of gene duplication events and divergent evolutionary pressures in the various linages of alphaproteobacteria. Regardless, GSR regulation must be precisely coordinated with the requirements of the corresponding bacterium, i.e. depending on the properties of the present stress-sensing kinases in terms of specificity and efficiency regarding PhyR phosphorylation. Thereby, an increasing number of partially redundant kinases as in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref019">19</xref>] and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>extorquens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007294.ref027">27</xref>] might bring the need to build in tunable negative regulators and a phosphorelay. Altogether, the characterization of PhyT together with SdrG as essential players in GSR regulation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>melonis</italic> Fr1 shades light on an evolutionary pattern of histidine kinase derived regulators, which is conserved within and beyond the boundaries of the GSR.</p>

<title>PhyR does not interact with the Paks in BACTH assays.</title>
<p>(A) BACTH assay with bacteria spotted onto LB plates containing X-Gal (40 μg/mL), IPTG (0.5 mM), and antibiotics for selection. Interactions of the C-terminal T18-PhyR wild-type with N-terminal T25-Pak fusions were tested. Stable interaction between N-terminal T18-NepR fusion and C-terminal T25-EcfG fusion was confirmed as a control. PhyT dimerization was shown with C-terminal fusion proteins. SdrG-PhyT interaction was tested with C-terminal T18-SdrG and C-terminal T25-PhyT fusion proteins. Pictures were taken after 24 h of incubation at 30°C. Blue colonies indicate protein interaction. (B) β-galactosidase assays were performed for quantification in three biological replicates. Overnight cultures containing 0.5 mM IPTG and antibiotics for selection, were inoculated from single colonies of the co-transformed bacteria and incubated at 30°C.</p>
