<abstract>
<p>Most active DNA replication origins are found within euchromatin, while origins within heterochromatin are often inactive or inhibited. In yeast, origin activity within heterochromatin is negatively controlled by the histone H4K16 deacetylase, Sir2, and at some heterochromatic loci also by the nucleosome binding protein, Sir3. The prevailing view has been that direct functions of Sir2 and Sir3 are confined to heterochromatin. However, growth defects in yeast mutants compromised for loading the MCM helicase, such as <italic>cdc6-4</italic>, are suppressed by deletion of either <italic>SIR2</italic> or <italic>SIR3</italic>. While these and other observations indicate that <italic>SIR2</italic>,<italic>3</italic> can have a negative impact on at least some euchromatic origins, the genomic scale of this effect was unknown. It was also unknown whether this suppression resulted from direct functions of Sir2,3 within euchromatin, or was an indirect effect of their previously established roles within heterochromatin. Using MCM ChIP-Seq, we show that a <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion rescued MCM complex loading at ~80% of euchromatic origins in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells. Therefore, Sir2 exhibited a pervasive effect at the majority of euchromatic origins. Using MNase-H4K16ac ChIP-Seq, we show that origin-adjacent nucleosomes were depleted for H4K16 acetylation in a <italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent manner in wild type (i.e. <italic>CDC6</italic>) cells. In addition, we present evidence that both Sir2 and Sir3 bound to nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins. The relative levels of each of these molecular hallmarks of yeast heterochromatin–<italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent H4K16 hypoacetylation, Sir2, and Sir3 –correlated with how strongly a <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion suppressed the MCM loading defect in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells. Finally, a screen for histone H3 and H4 mutants that could suppress the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> growth defect identified amino acids that map to a surface of the nucleosome important for Sir3 binding. We conclude that heterochromatin proteins directly modify the local chromatin environment of euchromatic DNA replication origins.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>When a cell divides, it must copy or “replicate” its DNA. DNA replication starts at chromosomal regions called origins when a collection of replication proteins gains local access to unwind the two DNA strands. Chromosomal DNA is packaged into a protein-DNA complex called chromatin and there are two major structurally and functionally distinct types. Euchromatin allows DNA replication proteins to access origin DNA, while heterochromatin inhibits their access. The prevalent view has been that the heterochromatin proteins required to inhibit origins are confined to heterochromatin. In this study, the conserved heterochromatin proteins, Sir2 and Sir3, were shown to both physically and functionally associate with the majority of origins in euchromatin. This observation raises important questions about the chromosomal targets of heterochromatin proteins, and how and why the majority of origins exist within a potentially repressive chromatin structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, efficient genome duplication requires the function of multiple DNA replication origins distributed over the length of each chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref005">5</xref>]. Origins are selected by a series of steps in late M- to G1-phase during which the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds directly to DNA and recruits the Cdc6 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref008">8</xref>]. The ORC-Cdc6-DNA complex recruits Cdt1-MCM to form an MCM double hexamer (dhMCM) encircling double-stranded DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref010">10</xref>]. Several kinases and loading factors then remodel the dhMCM into two active CMG helicases (<underline>C</underline>dc45-<underline>M</underline>CM-<underline>G</underline>INS) that unwind the DNA bidirectionally from each origin to allow the initiation of DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref011">11</xref>]. Thus, dhMCM loading is the event that ‘licenses’ the DNA to function as an origin of replication in S-phase (for recent comprehensive review of yeast replication see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref012">12</xref>]). All replication origins exist in the context of chromatin, and origin function is significantly affected by local chromatin structure (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref014">14</xref>]). Typically, the most efficient origins (i.e. the origins that are used in most cell cycles) are found in euchromatin, while less efficient origins are associated with heterochromatin. While there is intense interest in the impact of chromatin structure on origin function, the relevant molecular features of origin-adjacent chromatin and the steps in origin function that they control remain incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Yeast heterochromatin is characterized by hypoacetylated nucleosomes and associated heterochromatin regulatory proteins that promote a compact chromatin structure that makes the underlying DNA inaccessible to protein-DNA interactions and processes such as transcription and DNA replication initiation (recently reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref015">15</xref>]). The Sir2 (<bold>S</bold>ilent <bold>i</bold>nformation <bold>r</bold>egulator) protein, the founding member of a family of conserved NAD-dependent protein deacetylases, removes an acetyl group from lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16) and is required for heterochromatin formation in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref019">19</xref>]. Heterochromatin domains form at only a few discrete regions in the yeast genome, rDNA, telomeres, and the <italic>HM</italic>-mating type loci, and at each of these loci, Sir2 both deacetylates H4K16ac and stably binds to nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref015">15</xref>]. Heterochromatin formation at the <italic>HM</italic> loci and telomeres also requires nucleosome binding by the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins.</p>
<p>While it is recognized that the function of normally efficient origins can be suppressed when they are engineered within heterochromatic regions of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref021">21</xref>], several more recent studies reveal that <italic>SIR2</italic> can also affect the function of euchromatic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>]. However, depending on experimental context, <italic>SIR2</italic> can be interpreted to exert either positive or negative effects on euchromatic origins. In particular, recent studies reveal that <italic>SIR2</italic> acts indirectly as a positive regulator of euchromatic origins by suppressing the function of rDNA origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref025">25</xref>]. The tandemly repeated rDNA gene locus on chromosome XII contains ~200 replication origins, but ~80% of these origins are suppressed by Sir2-dependent heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref024">24</xref>]. Because the rDNA origins account for &gt;30% of all yeast genomic origins, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> results in activation of many rDNA origins, which then sequester limiting S-phase origin activation factors from euchromatic origins, delaying their activation time in S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, the positive role for <italic>SIR2</italic> in regulating euchromatic origin function in these reports is explained as a byproduct of a direct inhibition of rDNA origins by Sir2.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other studies establish that <italic>SIR2</italic> can also exert a negative effect at euchromatic origins. This negative role was revealed by a classic genetic screen that isolated <italic>sir2</italic> mutants as suppressors of the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc6-4</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>]. Cdc6, a member of the AAA+ protein family, must bind ATP to load dhMCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref031">31</xref>]. The <italic>cdc6-4</italic> allele encodes a mutant Cdc6 with a lysine to alanine substitution in the conserved ATP binding motif. Cells with the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> allele are viable but have S-phase associated growth defects at the permissive temperature and arrest growth at the non-permissive temperature with a failure to load dhMCM, as assessed by origin-specific ChIPs. Like <italic>sir2Δ</italic>, <italic>sir3Δ</italic> is also a robust suppressor of the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> growth defect, whereas a <italic>sir4Δ</italic> mutant is only a very weak suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus the suppression by <italic>sir2Δ</italic> or <italic>sir3Δ</italic> is not easily explained by defects in classic Sir-heterochromatic gene silencing of known loci because Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4 are each equally essential for <italic>HM</italic>- and telomere silencing and only Sir2 is required for rDNA silencing. In addition, multiple <italic>sir2</italic> alleles specifically defective in rDNA silencing do not suppress <italic>cdc6-4</italic> ts lethality, indicating that a loss of rDNA silencing is not sufficient to explain <italic>SIR2’s</italic> negative effect on euchromatic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>]. These findings support a distinct, rDNA- and classic heterochromatin-independent function of <italic>SIR2</italic> on euchromatic origins. Importantly, a <italic>sir2</italic> catalytic mutant or a histone mutant that converts H4K16 into a residue that mimics acetylated H4K16 (H4K16Q) suppresses <italic>cdc6-4</italic>, indicating that the Sir2 deacetylase function is critical for its negative impact on euchromatic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>]. However, these data do not address whether the negative role exerted by <italic>SIR2</italic> is due to direct roles for Sir2 within euchromatic regions of the genome, or whether <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>SIR3</italic> affect euchromatic origins through a shared mechanism.</p>
<p>In this report we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>SIR2</italic> affected euchromatic origins by performing MCM ChIP-Seq and MNase-H4K16ac ChIP-Seq experiments and also by analyzing several published high-resolution ChIP-Seq experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref034">34</xref>]. Our results provide evidence for a direct role for Sir2 and Sir3 in forming a repressive local chromatin environment around most origins that exist within euchromatin. A <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutation was sufficient to restore MCM binding at the majority of euchromatic origins in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells even at the non-permissive growth temperature for this allele. In wild type cells, nucleosomes immediately adjacent to the majority of euchromatic origins were relatively hypoacetylated on H4K16 compared to non-origin control loci, a behavior unique to this histone acetylation mark. Moreover, this origin-specific H4K16 hypoacetylation was completely dependent on <italic>SIR2</italic>. In addition, Sir2 and Sir3 were physically associated with euchromatic origins but not non-origin control loci. The levels of these three distinct molecular features of yeast heterochromatin—hypoacetylation of H4K16, Sir2 and Sir3 binding—correlated with how strongly a <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion suppressed the MCM loading defect in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells. Based on these results we propose that the dhMCM loading reaction has evolved to work within a potentially repressive Sir2,3-chromatin environment that forms around most euchromatic origins. Consistent with this model, a screen for suppressors of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> temperature-sensitive lethality identified several histone mutants known to disrupt the Sir3-nucleosome binding interface.</p>

<p>To examine the extent to which a <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion (<italic>sir2Δ</italic>) suppresses defects in MCM loading caused by the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> allele, we assessed MCM binding by ChIP-Seq in four congenic yeast strains: wild type (<italic>SIR2 CDC6</italic>); <italic>sir2Δ</italic>; <italic>cdc6-4</italic>; and <italic>sir2Δ cdc6-4</italic>. Because <italic>sir2Δ</italic> rescues the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>], the experiment was performed using chromatin from cells incubated at 37°C, the non-permissive growth temperature for <italic>cdc6-4</italic>. Cells were arrested in M-phase at the permissive growth temperature (25°C), shifted to 37°C, and then released into G1-phase to allow time for MCM loading ((<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). MCM ChIP-Seq was performed for each strain using a monoclonal antibody against Mcm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>]. Examination of MCM ChIP-Seq signals across the genome, as illustrated for chromosomes III and VI, revealed that MCM distribution in wild type and <italic>sir2Δ</italic> cells was similar (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). <italic>Cdc6-4</italic> cells failed to produce MCM ChIP-Seq signals above background levels, consistent with the essential role of Cdc6 in MCM loading <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref></bold>).

<p>A previous study screened for origins on chromosomes III and VI (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>, gray boxes) that, when cloned onto a plasmid, were functional in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells growing at the non-permissive temperature for <italic>cdc6-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>]. Five origins were identified as <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive in this screen: <italic>ARS317</italic> (the <italic>HMR</italic>-E silencer origin), <italic>ARS305</italic>, <italic>ARS315</italic>, <italic>ARS603</italic> and <italic>ARS606</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1B, 1C and 1D</xref>,</bold> black boxes). <italic>ARS317</italic> was not used in subsequent analyses here because it did not produce a robust MCM ChIP-Seq signal in wild type cells, and because we eliminated all origins that exist within heterochromatic domains for deeper analyses of euchromatic origins, as described below. The plasmid-based study suggested that at least 20% of yeast origins were likely to be <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast, the MCM-ChIP-Seq revealed that ~80% of origins showed MCM binding in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1B, 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). We note that the plasmid-based assay demanded that origin function was rescued to a level in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells that allowed for colonies to form at 37°C, a selection that might have been more stringent than the screen for an MCM ChIP-Seq signal as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1</xref>. In this regard, it is notable that the origins identified as <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive in the plasmid screen were indeed among those that showed the most robust rescue of MCM ChIP-Seq signals in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1D</xref>,</bold> black boxes). In addition, the plasmid-based screen assessed only small origin fragments that might not have recapitulated a nucleosome organization required to show <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsiveness. Indeed, plasmid-born <italic>ARS1005</italic> (a top origin identified by MCM ChIP-Seq) exhibited <italic>SIR2</italic>-regulation only when a larger chromosomal region surrounding <italic>ARS1005</italic> was present that could accommodate the adjacent chromosomally directed nucleosomes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Reduction in rDNA copy number did not explain suppression of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> by <italic>sir</italic> mutants</title>
<p>In yeast, each rDNA repeat contains a single rDNA origin, and these repeats are present in hundreds of tandem copies per cell on chromosome XII (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). Some mutants that affect origin function, such as <italic>orc2-1</italic>, can be suppressed by reducing the rDNA origin-load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref036">36</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether reduced rDNA copy number might account for suppression of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> by <italic>sir2Δ</italic> by analyzing the rDNA locus in the strains used for the MCM ChIP-Seq experiment by qPCR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). While rDNA copy number varied from colony to colony even within a single strain, on average, wild type, <italic>sir2Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells had similar levels of rDNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). However, <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells showed a 2-fold reduction in rDNA levels relative to <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells (P = 0.02), raising the possibility that suppression of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> by <italic>sir2Δ</italic> was mediated, at least in part, by reductions in rDNA copy number (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). To further address this issue, we performed two additional experiments. First, we exploited the previous observation that <italic>sir3Δ</italic> also suppresses <italic>cdc6-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>SIR2</italic>, <italic>SIR3</italic> has no role in rDNA silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref038">38</xref>]. <italic>Cdc6-4 sir3Δ</italic> cells grew at the non-permissive temperature for <italic>cdc6-4</italic>, as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>). However, the rDNA copy number of <italic>cdc6-4 sir3Δ</italic> yeast was slightly higher compared to <italic>cdc6-4</italic> yeast, indicating that reduced rDNA copy number could not explain this suppression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>). Second, we asked whether a reduction in rDNA copy number was sufficient to suppress <italic>cdc6-4</italic> by generating <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells with ~35 copies of the rDNA locus (rDNA-35) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). These cells also contained a <italic>FOB1</italic> deletion to help maintain rDNA copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref040">40</xref>]. The <italic>cdc6-4 rDNA-35 fob1Δ</italic> cells failed to grow at the non-permissive temperature and grew no better than the <italic>cdc6-4 rDNA-180 fob1Δ</italic> cells, which harbor ~180 copies of the rDNA locus (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Thus, reducing rDNA copy number was neither necessary nor sufficient to explain <italic>SIR</italic>-mediated suppression of <italic>cdc6-4</italic>. Cells harboring a reduction in rDNA copy number in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> populations likely arose because loss of Sir2 increases recombination frequency within the rDNA array, and reduced rDNA copy number is selected for over passaging in many mutants compromised for replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref042">42</xref>].</p>

<title>Origin-specific depletion of acetylated H4K16-containing nucleosomes</title>
<p>The pervasive yet origin-specific rescue of the MCM loading defect in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells by <italic>sir2Δ</italic> prompted us to consider the possibility that Sir2 might function directly on origin-adjacent nucleosomes within euchromatin. Sir2 is a deacetylase with specificity for acetylated lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16ac) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, we used a comprehensive genome-wide histone modification atlas generated by high resolution MNase-ChIP-Seq of yeast nucleosomes to examine the acetylation status of nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref032">32</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). To perform this analyses, we focused on two distinct groups of euchromatic loci: (i) experimentally-confirmed origins and (ii) non-origin intergenic regions that contain a match to the ORC binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref043">43</xref>]. At confirmed origins, ORC and MCM binding, as well as origin activity are experimentally documented, while at non-origin intergenic regions with ORC site matches, ORC and MCM binding are not detectable in vivo, and no origin function has been detected (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold> non-origins n = 179; origins; n = 259). These non-origin intergenic regions with ORC site matches serve as controls for origin-specific as opposed to primarily sequence-directed chromatin signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref043">43</xref>]. 1201 bp fragments from these two distinct groups were aligned with the T-rich strand of the ORC site on the top strand in the 5’ to 3’ orientation, so that three nucleosomes positioned on either site of the origin could be examined (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). Previous genome-scale studies have not identified Sir binding or function at euchromatic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref045">45</xref>]. Thus, we expected that if <italic>SIR2</italic> was acting on nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins, its effect would be weak compared to its effect on nucleosomes within known <italic>SIR2</italic>-heterochromatic regions. Therefore, to avoid H4K16ac depletion within known silent chromatin regions masking signals from weaker but potentially physiologically relevant Sir effects on euchromatin, the <italic>HM</italic> silencer, telomeric (as defined by origins within 15 kb of chromosome ends) and rDNA origins were excluded from these analyses. We then used the average nucleosome occupancy data from this recent nucleosome modification study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref032">32</xref>] to confirm that we could recapitulate previously published results about nucleosome occupancy and positioning differences between origin and non-origin loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref046">46</xref>]. The results confirmed the conclusion that origin-adjacent nucleosomes show high occupancy at more defined positions around the nucleosome-depleted origins compared to the control non-origin ORC-site containing control loci (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Next, the relative H4K16ac status of nucleosomes surrounding the ORC site for both groups was determined and normalized to the average H4K16ac status from a collection of nucleosomes present in a distinct collection of euchromatin intergenic regions that contained neither origins nor matches to the ORC site (n = 239). This analysis revealed that nucleosomes adjacent to origins were relatively depleted for H4K16ac but that nucleosomes adjacent to the control non-origin nucleosomes were not (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>).

<title>Acetylated H4K16 is depleted from origin-adjacent nucleosomes.</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> Two groups of loci were analyzed, origins, defined as experimentally-confirmed origins with a confirmed or high-confidence ORC site, n = 259, and intergenic non-origin loci with ORC site matches but for which no origin activity has been observed, n = 179 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref043">43</xref>]. These two different groups of loci were compared to determine whether chromatin-states at origins were specific for origin function as opposed to being the result of underlying AT-rich sequence elements present in origins. “ORC in vitro” refers to loci that were bound by purified ORC in a genomic electrophoretic mobility assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref073">73</xref>]; “ORC in vivo” and “MCM in vivo” refer to the fraction of sites in these two groups that were detected by ORC- or MCM-ChIP, respectively. <bold>B.</bold> The WebLogo consensus for the ORC sites (or matches) in origins and non-origins, respectively, are shown above the diagram of the fragments used in the analyses of adjacent nucleosomes. Each fragment analyzed was oriented with the T-rich strand of the ORC site 5’ to 3’ on the top strand, and the first nucleotide of the ORC site was designated as position “0”. The fragments were 1201 bp such that six proximal nucleosomes, shown as black ovals, three on each side of the ORC site, were assessed. <bold>C.</bold> Nucleosome occupancy surrounding the origin and non-origin nucleosome depleted regions are shown using the MNase-ChIP-Seq nucleosome occupancy data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref032">32</xref>]. <bold>D.</bold> Normalized H4K16ac and H3K9ac for each of the six nucleosomes for the two different groups of loci examined.

<p>If depletion of H4K16ac on origin-adjacent nucleosomes was relevant to <italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent inhibition of MCM loading in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells, then the origins most responsive to deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> might be expected to show the greatest depletion of H4K16ac. We defined origin <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsiveness as the ratio of the MCM ChIP-Seq signal in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells to that in <italic>sir2Δ</italic> cells; the most <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive origins generated ratios near 1.0, suggesting that deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> substantially rescued the MCM loading defect of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>). Comparison of H4K16ac status of nucleosomes surrounding the low, medium, and high-<italic>SIR2</italic> responsive origin quintiles revealed that as a group the most <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive origins exhibited the greatest depletion of H416ac (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold>). Thus the varying degrees of <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsiveness to MCM association generally correlated well with the degree of H4K16 hypoacetylation, with the exception of the -1 nucleosome for the low and medium <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive origins.</p>
<p>In a separate analysis, H4K16ac status of nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins was also examined relative to the genome-wide average level of H4K16ac so that a comparison to origins within established <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin domains could be made (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). This analysis, presented as box-and-whiskers plots to show the variation in H4K16ac at the relevant nucleosomes in each group, also indicated that the most prominent depletion of H4K16ac occurred on the -1 and +1 nucleosome positions for euchromatic origins, and weakened considerably by the -3 and +3 nucleosomes, as also seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold>. As expected, the -1 and +1 nucleosomes of euchromatic origins were less depleted for H4K16ac than the analogous nucleosomes for origins within <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin, with the median values for the two types of origins differing ~3-fold. The differences between H4K16ac status were more striking between the two types of origins (i.e. euchromatic versus <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatic) at nucleosomes more distal from the origin, consistent with the H4K16ac status at euchromatic origins being more localized than the H4K16ac status within <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin. Analyses of H4K16ac status at a few individual origins also indicated that the -1 and/or +1 nucleosomes were the most likely to show the greatest depletion of H4K16ac, particularly for the most <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsive origins.

<title>The depletion of acetylated H4K16-containing nucleosomes around euchromatic origins required <italic>SIR2</italic></title>
<p>The data described above raised the possibility that Sir2 was deacetylating H4K16ac nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins. To test this possibility, we performed H4K16ac MNase ChIP-Seq experiments on the exact same wild type (<italic>SIR2</italic>) and <italic>sir2Δ</italic> cells used for the MCM ChIP-Seq experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g001">Fig 1</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Analyses of wild type cells recapitulated the published H4K16ac MNase ChIP-Seq results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. We note that the relative level of origin-specific H4K16ac depletion was slightly greater in these new experiments, possibly due to differences in strain backgrounds or growth conditions. Regardless, the key result was that, in contrast to wild type cells, depletion of H4K16ac was lost from origin-adjacent nucleosomes in the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> cells, while the behavior of non-origin ORC site control nucleosomes was unchanged. Importantly, these effects also correlated with <italic>SIR2</italic> responsiveness (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>).

<title>Sir2 and Sir3 were detected at origins</title>
<p>Sir2 and Sir3 are physical components of yeast heterochromatin that have been detected at rDNA (Sir2), telomeres and <italic>HM</italic> loci (Sir2 and Sir3) by ChIP experiments in multiple studies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref015">15</xref>]). However, neither protein has been reported to associate with euchromatic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref047">47</xref>]. Depletion of H4K16ac at euchromatic origins was estimated to be between 25–35% of that detected at heterochromatic origins for the +1 nucleosome (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). This observation is consistent with a proteomic analysis of nucleosome modifications on a plasmid based origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref048">48</xref>]. However, given that Sir2 is an enzyme, stable binding by Sir2, or even Sir3 if it is required only transiently, might not be required to establish or maintain this modification state. To test this possibility, we used more recently published high-resolution ChIP-Seq Sir2 and Sir3 data sets and excluded all origins from known heterochromatin origins, as described above for Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g004">4</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref044">44</xref>]. This analysis detected Sir2 and Sir3 ChIP-Seq signals on nucleosomes adjacent to origins but not on nucleosomes adjacent to non-origin controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref></bold>). Because the Sir3 data was generated from a high-resolution MNase ChIP-Seq experiment, we also examined these data at nucleotide resolution across the 1201 bp origin and non-origin fragments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. To generate the baseline for these analyses, the number of reads that contained a given nucleotide in the ChIP sample was divided by the number of reads that contained that nucleotide in the starting material, for every single nucleotide within the euchromatic genome (i.e. nucleotides from known heterochromatin regions were excluded to form the “0” binding baseline for Sir3), following the method in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref049">49</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). These analyses revealed the strongest Sir3 ChIP-Seq signal at the most proximal origin-adjacent nucleosomes (-1 and +1), but signals above baseline were also detectable at the -3, -2, +2 and +3 nucleosomes. As was true for the depletion of H4K16ac, the Sir3 signals correlated with the degree of <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsiveness as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g003">Fig 3E</xref> (except in the opposite direction) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref></bold>).

<p>A separate analyses of Sir3-3xHA ChIP-Seq data from the same study indicated that excluding nucleotides from <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin when establishing the baseline was required for the Sir3 ChIP-Seq signals at euchromatic origins to rise above the “0” baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref050">50</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>), in contrast to what was observed for H4K16ac (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, in this independent analysis, Sir3-3xHA (detected with anti-HA) signals at euchromatic origins were clearly greater at the -1 and +1 nucleosomes of origins relative to the comparable nucleosomes at the non-origin ORC-site containing loci that have been used as controls for origin specificity throughout this study, and Sir3-3xHA signals also correlated with <italic>SIR2</italic>-responsiveness (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>)</bold>.We interpret these results to mean that strong Sir3 association with heterochromatic regions reduced the “0” baseline and obscured comparatively weak Sir3 signals at euchromatic origins. Thus, we conclude that Sir3 associated with euchromatic origins but more transiently and at levels less than Sir3’s association with <italic>SIR-</italic>heterochromatin regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, several molecular hallmarks of <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin–Sir2, Sir3 and Sir2-dependent H4K16 hypoacetylation–could be detected at euchromatin origins but not at euchromatic non-origin controls. In addition, the relative levels of each of these molecular hallmarks correlated with how strongly a <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion restored an MCM ChIP signal to origins in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells grown at temperatures that otherwise abolished MCM loading.</p>

<title>A <italic>cdc6-4</italic> suppressor screen targeting core modifiable histone H3 and H4 residues identified a nucleosome surface important for Sir3 binding</title>
<p>Histones H3 and H4 form a tetramer that binds both to dsDNA and to two dimers of histones H2A and H2B to form the nucleosome. Many conserved residues on the histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails as well as within the globular core region (“core-modifiable” residues) can be post-translationally modified, and, as discussed above, an H4K16Q substitution that should mimic the acetylated form of this residue (i.e. the form predicted to phenocopy the effect of a <italic>sir2Δ</italic>), suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>]. To test whether we could identify additional alleles with similar suppressive behavior, we assessed a library of 43 histone H3 and H4 mutations affecting 15 distinct residues for suppression of the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> growth defect (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</bold> Mutant plasmids harboring a single copy of the <italic>HHT2-HHF2</italic> locus marked with <italic>TRP1</italic> were transformed into wild type and <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells lacking both chromosomal copies of histone H3 and H4 genes, maintained by a <italic>HHT2-HHF2 URA3 ARS CEN</italic> plasmid, and colonies were subsequently plated on 5-FOA containing media to select against the wild type <italic>HHT2-HHF2</italic> plasmid. Recovered cells were then examined for growth on YPD medium at 25°C and higher temperatures. In agreement with previous studies, none of the histone mutants, with the exception of H4-S47E, caused growth defects in wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref051">51</xref>], and several mutants were identified that inhibited growth of cells harboring the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> allele even at the permissive growth temperature (25°C). However, relevant to this study, specific substitutions at only two residues, H3K79 (H3K79A and H3K79Q) and H4K79 (H4K79A and H4K79R) suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). Notably, these residues are important for Sir3 binding to the nucleosome and for Sir3-mediated transcriptional silencing at the <italic>HM</italic> and telomeric loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref054">54</xref>]. H3K79 is a substrate for methylation by Dot1 and Sir3 binds preferentially to unmethylated H3K79 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref056">56</xref>]. Based on these results, additional substitutions were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis at H3K79 and at four adjacent residues (H3K79E, H3E73A, H3E73K, H374A, H3T80A, H3D81A) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>). In addition to revealing that H3K79E was a stronger suppressor of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> than H3K79Q, analyses of these mutants also revealed that substitutions of H3E73 and H3T80 also suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007418.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). H3E73 and H3T80 are important for <italic>HM</italic> and telomeric silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref052">52</xref>], and H3T80 directly contacts the LRS domain of Sir3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref054">54</xref>]. In summary, suppression of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> temperature-sensitivity was achieved by single substitutions within only four residues (H3E73, H3K79, H3T80, and H4K79) of H3/H4. Each of these residues clustered within a small patch on the nucleosome surface important for binding Sir3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007418.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, highlighted in red</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref053">53</xref>], strongly suggesting that disruption of Sir3 binding to nucleosomes suppressed the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> growth defect. Together with the ChIP-Seq data, these genetic data supported the conclusion that both Sir2 and Sir3 alter the molecular features of nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins, thus generating a local chromatin environment that can negatively impact the MCM loading reaction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sir2 and Sir3 are non-essential proteins known best for their direct functions in heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional gene silencing in budding yeast (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref015">15</xref>]). This report described a new, pervasive and direct heterochromatin-independent role for these regulators at euchromatic DNA replication origins. The role was pervasive in that Sir2 exerted a negative effect on the MCM loading reaction at most origins in the genome. The evidence in support of this conclusion came from a comparison of MCM loading at origins by ChIP-Seq in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> mutant cells and <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells. Cdc6 is essential for the MCM complex loading reaction, and the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> allele weakens Cdc6 function such that, under non-permissive growth temperatures, detectable MCM association was abolished from all origins. However, under the same conditions, <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells exhibited MCM association at most euchromatic origins (~80%). Thus, the ability of <italic>sir2</italic> inactivating mutations to robustly suppress the temperature-sensitive lethality of <italic>cdc6-4</italic>, as well as growth defects caused by other replication alleles that reduce or abolish MCM loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>], is due to genome-scale enhancement of MCM loading at most euchromatic origins.</p>
<p>The ability of <italic>sir2Δ</italic> to enhance MCM complex loading at most euchromatic origins in <italic>cdc6-4</italic> cells was striking, but it did not indicate whether this effect was due to Sir2 acting directly within euchromatin in general or at euchromatic origins in particular. In particular, recent reports establish that <italic>SIR2</italic> can alter origin function within euchromatin in yeast indirectly because of its function in rDNA heterochromatin formation that suppresses many of the rDNA repeat origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref025">25</xref>]. However, analyses of the rDNA locus presented here suggested that a similar rDNA-mediated mechanism could not explain why <italic>sir2Δ</italic> or <italic>sir3Δ</italic> suppressed <italic>cdc6-4</italic>. Instead, the data provided evidence that Sir2 functioned directly at euchromatic origins, and that it was this direct function of Sir2 that made yeast so vulnerable to defects in the MCM complex loading reaction caused by <italic>cdc6-4</italic>. First, relative hypoacetylation of H4K16 was observed for nucleosomes immediately adjacent to euchromatic origins but not for the analogous nucleosomes at non-origin ORC-site containing control loci. Thus, in an asynchronous population of wild type cells, nucleosomes flanking euchromatic origins were relatively hypoacteylated on H4K16. Of the twelve histone acetylation marks examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref032">32</xref>], H4K16ac was the only one that showed this origin-specific depletion. Second, origin-adjacent nucleosomal H4K16 hypoacetylation required <italic>SIR2</italic>; a <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutant completely lost the nucleosomal H4K16 hypoacetylation pattern at euchromatic origins, without having any obvious effect on nucleosomes adjacent to the non-origin control loci. Third, analyses of previously published high-resolution ChIP-Seq experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref050">50</xref>] provided evidence that Sir2 and Sir3 physically associated with nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins but not non-origin control loci. Sir2 and Sir3 exhibited the same pattern but in the exact opposite direction of H4K16ac, which is what is observed for these proteins and this histone mark at <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatic domains. Lastly, each of these defining molecular features of classic <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin correlated with <italic>SIR2-</italic>responsiveness–defined as the relative extent of MCM association rescue at origins in <italic>cdc6-4 sir2Δ</italic> cells. Because of these observations, and in particular the clear depletion of ChIP-Seq signals around origins generated by multiple histone antibodies, we think it is unlikely that these outcomes result from the non-specific “hyper-ChIPability” that affects certain highly transcribed regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref057">57</xref>]. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, these data provide the first evidence that the heterochromatin proteins Sir2 and Sir3 act directly on the local chromatin environment of euchromatic origins.</p>
<p>Despite the common molecular hallmarks shared between the Sir2-3-chromatin at euchromatic origins described in this study and classic <italic>SIR</italic>-mediated heterochromatin, these two types of chromatin domains are different. For example, unlike <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin that functions in gene silencing at the <italic>HM</italic> loci, telomeres or rDNA, there is no evidence that origin-adjacent chromatin functions as a robust transcriptionally silenced domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref058">58</xref>], although we cannot rule out the possibility that Sir2,3-chromatin is having small effects on the transcription of annotated genes near origins or on the expression of non-coding RNAs in these regions. In addition, <italic>SIR</italic>-heterochromatin affects multiple nucleosomes, defining domains that encompass ~4–10 kb of contiguous chromosomal DNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref015">15</xref>]), whereas the Sir2-3-chromatin at origins encompassed &lt;1 kb of chromosomal DNA adjacent to the origin and affected only four to six nucleosomes at most. While it remains to be determined whether the specific molecular interactions that recruit Sir2 and Sir3 to euchromatic origins are also used to recruit these proteins to heterochromatic regions, their functional and structural impact on nucleosomes at euchromatic origins was substantially attenuated relative to their impact within heterochromatin. Therefore, we suggest that the Sir2-3 chromatin at origins defines a role for these proteins that differs from their roles in canonical Sir-heterochromatin.</p>

<title>A specific G1-phase role for H4K16 acetylation at origins</title>
<p>Acetylation of histone H3 and H4 N-termini at origin proximal-nucleosomes generally enhances origin function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref060">60</xref>]. However, it has been difficult to assign specific roles of this acetylation to individual histone H3 or H4 lysines. Indeed, in terms of origin activation, while acetylation of histone H3 and H4 tail lysines is clearly important for origin activation during S-phase, no single lysine acetylation event is sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref048">48</xref>]. In addition, several different combinations of multiple lysine to arginine substitutions on the histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails can substantially reduce origin activation, suggesting that some threshold level of nucleosome acetylation, or the concomitant charge neutralization, is what is important for origin activation. In contrast, the initial identification of a <italic>sir2</italic> mutation, and subsequently a H4K16Q substitution, as robust suppressors of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> temperature-sensitivity and origin-specific MCM loading, indicated that H4K16 might be unique among histone tail lysines in being particularly relevant to origin licensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>]. This study revealed that H4K16 was also unique among histone H3 and H4 tail lysines because H4K16 exhibited <italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent, origin-specific hypoacetylation on nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins. Consistent with these observations, proteomic analysis of nucleosomes adjacent to a plasmid-origin reveals that H4K16 behaves uniquely among histone H3 and H4 tail acetylation marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref048">48</xref>]. Specifically, in G1-phase, nucleosomes adjacent to a plasmid-based origin were relatively hypoacetylated at H4K16 compared to bulk nucleosomes, whereas the other histone tail lysines analyzed (H3-K9, -K14, K-23; H4-K5, -K8, -K12) showed similar levels of hypoacetylation on bulk and plasmid-based origin adjacent nucleosomes. Because Sir2 and Sir3 also showed origin-specific association with nucleosomes, the distinctive role for H4K16 acetylation in control of the G1-phase MCM loading reaction can now be explained by formation of a Sir2,3 chromatin structure directly at many euchromatic origins, suggesting that origins, perhaps via ORC, can specifically recruit Sir2,3.</p>

<title>MCM loading challenges in a native chromatin context</title>
<p>The data presented here provided evidence that the MCM loading reaction has evolved to work within a naturally repressive chromatin environment established by Sir2,3. Indeed, an otherwise severely crippled licensing reaction caused by the <italic>cdc6-4</italic> defect can quite effectively license most origins if the native repressive chromatin environment is abolished by inactivation of Sir2. While the precise mechanistic step(s) of the MCM complex loading reaction that are affected by the Sir2,3-repressive chromatin environment remain to be examined, recent successes in reconstituting DNA replication in chromatin contexts in vitro offer an ideal pathway forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref063">63</xref>]. For example, while reconstituted chromatin does not block MCM complex loading in vitro, it would be interesting to learn whether the addition of Sir3 to these biochemical reactions is sufficient for inhibition and, if so, requires Sir3’s ability to bind to nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>However, in terms of yeast physiology, the major challenge moving forward is to understand why such a chromatin-structure capable of inhibiting MCM complex loading may have evolved to exist at so many euchromatic origins in the first place. While a <italic>sir2Δ</italic> or a <italic>sir3Δ</italic> have no obvious genome-scale effect on yeast cell division, MCM complex loading or origin activation in cells with wild type MCM complex loading reaction components, the Sir2,3-chromatin structure discussed here does indeed exist in wild type cells, and, based on the strong genetic suppression of <italic>cdc6-4</italic> and other alleles that weaken MCM complex loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref029">29</xref>], is clearly capable of exerting a substantial inhibitory effect on this reaction. Indeed, the results presented here suggest that the levels and or activities of the MCM complex loading proteins have evolved to contend with a particularly inhibitory local chromatin structure around euchromatic origins; a temperature-sensitive allele that weakened MCM complex loading, such as <italic>cdc6-4</italic>, would never have been isolated in yeast cells lacking Sir2 or Sir3 as the mutant Cdc6-4 protein provides for robust function in such contexts. It is possible that the Sir2,3- chromatin at euchromatic origins is simply a byproduct of yeast cells evolving transcriptionally silenced heterochromatic domains, and, as a result of strong evolutionary selection for these regions’ existence, combined with fundamental protein dynamics, Sir2 and Sir3 simply fall off of heterochromatin at some frequency and, when they do, end up concentrating at origins as they stochastically bounce around the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref067">67</xref>]. Sir2 and Sir3 may concentrate at origins over other euchromatic elements because of the intrinsic ability of origins to act as silencers, as suggested by some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref069">69</xref>]. Regardless, the outcome is that the MCM complex loading reaction had to evolve more robustly than it would have otherwise. Additionally, and/or alternatively, the Sir2,3-chromatin at euchromatic origins may play an important role in normal yeast physiology, offering a fine-tuning of the MCM complex loading reaction at many individual origins that, while at the first-level of cell growth and origin function in bulk laboratory assays may be hard to measure, nevertheless has important repercussions at the population and/or evolutionary scale for yeast and other eukaryotic organisms. Interestingly, over two decades ago a study reported how over-expression of Sir2 and Sir3 promoted severe chromosome instability and yeast cell lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref070">70</xref>]. Perhaps these effects were related, at least in part, to Sir2,3 effects on origins. Finally, a role for Sir2 in origin control may indeed be conserved as human SIRT1, the ortholog of yeast Sir2, suppresses the function of dormant origins under conditions of replication stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007418.ref071">71</xref>].</p>

Mcm2 ChIP was performed using a monoclonal antibody raised against yeast Mcm2 (gift of Bruce Stillman, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Three independent biological replicates and two technical replicates for each biological replicate were performed for each strain.

In contrast, those plasmids that contained larger inserts of DNA that would contain one (pFJ188 and pMW564) or both (pFJ199) positioned nucleosomes were significantly rescued.</p>
