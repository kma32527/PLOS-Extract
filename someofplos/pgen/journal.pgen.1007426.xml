<abstract>
<p>Initiation of chromosome replication in bacteria is precisely timed in the cell cycle. Bacteria that harbor multiple chromosomes face the additional challenge of orchestrating replication initiation of different chromosomes. In <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, the smaller of its two chromosomes, Chr2, initiates replication after Chr1 such that both chromosomes terminate replication synchronously. The delay is due to the dependence of Chr2 initiation on the replication of a site, <italic>crtS</italic>, on Chr1. The mechanism by which replication of <italic>crtS</italic> allows Chr2 replication remains unclear. Here, we show that blocking Chr1 replication indeed blocks Chr2 replication, but providing an extra <italic>crtS</italic> copy in replication-blocked Chr1 permitted Chr2 replication. This demonstrates that unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> copies have significant activity, and suggests that a role of replication is to double the copy number of the site that sufficiently increases its activity for licensing Chr2 replication. We further show that <italic>crtS</italic> activity promotes the Chr2-specific initiator function and that this activity is required in every cell cycle, as would be expected of a cell-cycle regulator. This study reveals how increase of gene dosage through replication can be utilized in a critical regulatory switch.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The timing of DNA replication initiation is controlled in all growing cells. The conventional wisdom is that in bacteria such as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, initiation occurs when sufficient active form of the initiator protein accumulates. The same scenario possibly applies to <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> Chr1, whose replication in turn determines the timing of replication of its second chromosome, Chr2. This is because Chr2 replication initiation depends on the replication of a site, <italic>crtS</italic>, in Chr1. Here we show that the <italic>crtS</italic> site has significant activity towards triggering Chr2 replication without itself being replicated. We propose that the doubling of <italic>crtS</italic> copy number, normally afforded by replication, allows accumulation of enough active Chr2-specific initiator to trigger initiation. The study provides a novel example of how the timing of a gene function can be controlled by the timing of its duplication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nearly 10% of bacteria from diverse phyla distribute their genetic information into more than one chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref001">1</xref>]. The presence of multipartite genomes in bacteria provides a challenge to understand the mechanisms that determine timely replication and segregation of all chromosomes of a genome prior to cell division. Failures in these processes can cause genome instability, slowed cell growth and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Chromosome dynamics in bacteria with multipartite genomes is well studied in the human pathogen <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. All members of the <italic>Vibrio</italic> genus possess two circular, unequal-sized chromosomes, Chr1 and Chr2. The size of Chr1 is fairly conserved (3.0 to 3.4 Mb) whereas there is greater diversity in the size of Chr2 (0.8 to 2.4 Mb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref003">3</xref>]. The replication of the two chromosomes is regulated differently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref004">4</xref>]. The regulation of Chr1 is similar to that of the well-studied <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chromosome and is mediated through the universal initiator of bacterial replication, DnaA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref005">5</xref>]. Chr2 replication is regulated by its specific initiator RctB, which is highly conserved in the <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The regulation of Chr2 replication is reminiscent of the copy number control of some plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref008">8</xref>]. The salient feature of Chr2 replication origin is the presence of an array of tandem repeats of 12-mers where the initiator RctB binds. This feature of the origin is common in members of the iteron family of plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref005">5</xref>]. Additionally, the central region of RctB is structurally homologous to plasmid initiators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref010">10</xref>]. The Chr2 replicon, however, has many additional features that distinguish it from its presumed plasmid progenitor. For example, in addition to 12-mers, RctB binds to a second kind of site, 39-mers, which inhibits initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref011">11</xref>]. Another mechanism to inhibit initiation is built-in to the 12-mers in the form of adenine methylation sequences (GATC), which become hemi-methylated following replication initiation and allow binding of the SeqA protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref012">12</xref>]. Inhibition of replication initiation upon SeqA binding also occurs in the origins of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chromosome and Chr1. Thus, although seemingly plasmid-derived, the complexity of Chr2 replication control is comparable to those of other well-studied bacterial chromosomes, which is apparently required to maintain once-per-cell-cycle replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Replication of Chr2 initiates after Chr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref013">13</xref>]. The lag in initiation time is such that both chromosomes terminate replication at approximately the same time. The basis of the termination synchrony is due to a novel replication timing mechanism. A unique RctB-binding site, <italic>crtS</italic> (<underline>C</underline>hr2 <underline>r</underline>eplication <underline>t</underline>riggering <underline>s</underline>ite), was discovered in Chr1 within a 153-bp locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>]. Chr2 replication initiation occurs after the Chr1 replication fork moves past the <italic>crtS</italic> site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. This appears to be a conserved feature in most <italic>Vibrio</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref016">16</xref>]. The genomic location of <italic>crtS</italic> is such that it appropriately defers Chr2 replication for termination synchrony. Moving <italic>crtS</italic> to ectopic sites changes the timing of Chr2 replication in accordance with the time at which the site is duplicated, which indicates that <italic>crtS</italic> locus needs to be replicated for Chr2 replication initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus far, this is the only genetic scheme known for coordinating replication timing of individual chromosomes in bacteria with multipartite genomes.</p>
<p>Supplying <italic>crtS</italic> on a multicopy plasmid increases replication of mini-Chr2 (plasmids with Chr2 replication origin, <italic>ori2</italic>) in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> when RctB is provided, although some mini-Chr2 replication is seen in the absence of <italic>crtS</italic> as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>]. Increasing <italic>crtS</italic> copy number in Chr1 also increases Chr2 replication in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. These results indicate that <italic>crtS</italic> function is limiting for Chr2 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. This is further supported by the fact that deletion of <italic>crtS</italic> leads to chromosomal fusion or selection of suppressor mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. The role of <italic>crtS</italic> thus appears crucial for Chr2 replication in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>.</p>
<p>The only clue as to how <italic>crtS</italic> might function comes from the <italic>in vivo</italic> finding that in its presence, RctB binding to 12-mers increases and to 39-mers decreases, both of which are favorable for initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>]. These results suggest that <italic>crtS</italic> might remodel RctB into a more proficient initiator, which is further supported by the ability of <italic>crtS</italic> to partially substitute the DnaK and DnaJ chaperones required for RctB function. Overall, these results indicate that <italic>crtS</italic> replication is required to trigger Chr2 replication and the mechanism of triggering is through remodeling of RctB. However, how replication helps <italic>crtS</italic> function remains an open question. Replication can serve by doubling the site dosage and the cumulative activity of two sites could suffice to remodel enough RctB to trigger Chr2 replication initiation. It is also possible that the passage of the replication fork across <italic>crtS</italic> changes the topology of the site to make it more active. Replication could cause <italic>crtS</italic> to be transiently hemi-methylated or single-stranded, or could clear out possible bound inhibitory factors such that the site can interact with RctB appropriately. To address some of these possible roles of replication in <italic>crtS</italic> function, here we devised an approach to conditionally block Chr1 replication in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> and investigated the consequences towards triggering Chr2 replication initiation.</p>
<p>We conclude that the <italic>crtS</italic> locus has significant activity without replication, and doubling the <italic>crtS</italic> gene dosage, which is normally accomplished by Chr1 replication, suffices to activate Chr2 replication. The product but not the process of replication thus appears obligatory for <italic>crtS</italic> function. The unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> locus appears to promote the initiator function of RctB, as in replication-permissive conditions. Our finding that <italic>crtS</italic> has activity without replication is expected to simplify mechanistic studies on how <italic>crtS</italic> triggers Chr2 replication initiation.</p>

<title>Blocking Chr1 replication blocks Chr2 replication</title>
<p>In <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, blocking of Chr2 replication initiation does not prevent Chr1 replication or cell division, indicating that there is no checkpoint to ensure completion of genome duplication before cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref017">17</xref>]. Here, we blocked Chr1 replication and tested its effect on the replication of Chr2. In the earlier study, Chr2 replication was blocked by adding an excess of 39-mer sites that specifically inhibited Chr2 replication initiation. Because there is no known Chr1-specific inhibitor of initiation, we utilized the Tus-<italic>ter</italic> replication fork barrier system of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to conditionally block Chr1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref018">18</xref>]. Two <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli ter</italic> sites were inserted on each flank of the Chr1 origin of replication, <italic>ori1</italic>, and the <italic>ter</italic>-binding Tus protein of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was supplied under control of the arabinose-inducible promoter, <italic>pbad</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

<title>Blocking replication of Chr1 blocks Chr2 replication.</title>
<p>(A) Scheme for blocking Chr1 replication by induction of <italic>ter</italic>-binding Tus protein from <italic>pbad</italic> promoter. (B) Time-lapse microscopy of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> (CVC3022) showing <italic>ori1</italic> (green) and <italic>ori2</italic> (red) foci when cells were grown either without inducer (panels 1–4) or with 0.2% inducer (arabinose) to induce Tus for blocking Chr1 replication (panels 5–12). Without inducer, cells were born with two <italic>ori1</italic> foci and one <italic>ori2</italic> focus (panel 1). Upon cell growth, the <italic>ori2</italic> focus duplicates (panel 2), followed by duplication of <italic>ori1</italic> before cell division (panels 3,4). With Tus induction, many cells show one <italic>ori1</italic> focus, indicating a block of Chr1 replication (panel 5). In most of these cells<strike>,</strike> the <italic>ori2</italic> focus remains single, indicating that Chr2 replication is blocked (panels 6–8). In a few cells, the <italic>ori2</italic> focus was seen to divide even as the <italic>ori1</italic> focus remained single, (panels 9–12). Scale bars, 2 μm. (C) Marker frequency analysis by qPCR.

The induction reduced the <italic>ori1/ter1</italic> and <italic>ori2/ter2</italic> values.

<p>Time-lapse microscopy showed that under our growth conditions, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> cells were born with two <italic>ori1</italic> foci, one near each cell pole, and a single <italic>ori2</italic> focus near the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, panel 1). Subsequently, the <italic>ori2</italic> focus duplicated and occupied quarter-cell positions, while the two <italic>ori1</italic> foci duplicated prior to completion of cell division (panels 2–4). This scenario is indicative of multi-fork replication of Chr1 that results when the time to complete duplication of the chromosome exceeds the cell generation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref020">20</xref>]. Following Tus induction to block Chr1 replication, cells contained only 1 <italic>ori1</italic> focus (panels 5–8). The focus did not duplicate as the cells lengthened for the duration of the time-lapse experiment (equivalent to at least two generations in liquid medium under replication-permissive conditions). Although the cells continued to lengthen, they failed to divide, indicative of blockage of Chr1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref021">21</xref>]. The localization of <italic>ori1</italic> was also not polar, unlike under normal growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The block in Chr1 replication was confirmed by qPCR where the <italic>ori1/ter1</italic> ratio was seen to reduce from 2.8 to 1.4 at 150 min after Tus induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In sum, the appearance of cells with one <italic>ori1</italic> focus instead of two, elongation of cells without division for more than two generations, reduction in <italic>ori1/ter1</italic> ratio and loss of polar localization of <italic>ori1</italic> are all consistent with a block to elongation of Chr1 replication forks.</p>
<p>In newborn cells that showed the continued presence of a single <italic>ori1</italic> focus, the <italic>ori2</italic> focus also remained single during the time lapse experiment, indicating that Chr2 replication initiation depends on the prior replication of Chr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, panels 5–8). We were able to reverse the Chr1-replication block by removing the inducer of Tus expression (arabinose) using a microfluidic chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s013">S1 Movie</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Upon removal of the inducer, <italic>ori1</italic> foci duplicated within ~30 min, followed by duplication of the <italic>ori2</italic> focus and resumption of cell division. The removal of arabinose also caused a significant decrease in Tus protein level, explaining the resumption of <italic>ori1</italic> duplication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). These results demonstrate that our approach to block Chr1 replication arrests the progression of the cell cycle (Chr2 replication and cell division) in a reversible fashion. Although it is possible that the cell division block could be responsible for blocking Chr2 replication, our results discussed later argue against this possibility.</p>
<p>We restricted our analysis of <italic>ori2</italic> foci only to cells that showed a single <italic>ori1</italic> focus, which accounted for ~50% of all cells. While majority of these cells had one <italic>ori2</italic> focus, some cells exhibited duplication of <italic>ori2</italic> foci within the duration of the time-lapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, panels 9–12). On a population basis, by counting foci in cells 150 min after the induction of Chr1 block, 13% of one <italic>ori1</italic> cells were seen to have two or more <italic>ori2</italic> foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), indicating that Chr2 has some propensity to initiate replication independent of Chr1 replication. Cells with one <italic>ori1</italic> and two <italic>ori2</italic> foci were longer than cells with one <italic>ori1</italic> and one <italic>ori2</italic> foci: 4.0 ± 0.3 μm as compared to 3.0 ± 0.2 μm (mean ± standard error, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), suggesting that given enough accumulation of mass, Chr2 can replicate in the absence of Chr1 replication. This is unlikely to be due to increase of RctB concentration over time, which remains essentially unchanged in Chr1 replication-blocked cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Importantly, the results provide the initial indication that unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> has activity, as we show later.</p>

<title>A plasmid clone of <italic>crtS</italic> suffices for Chr2 initiation in Chr1 replication-blocked cells</title>
<p>An earlier study established that replication of the <italic>crtS</italic> locus on Chr1 is required for Chr2 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. We also find that the 153-bp <italic>crtS</italic> in a plasmid (p<italic>crtS</italic>) increases Chr2 replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>]. To test whether the <italic>crtS</italic> is the only locus of Chr1 whose replication was required for licensing Chr2 replication, we supplied p<italic>crtS</italic>, in cells where Chr1 replication was blocked by the Tus-<italic>ter</italic> complex. In Chr1-replication blocked cells with p<italic>crtS</italic>, the number of cells with single <italic>ori1</italic> focus and two or more <italic>ori2</italic> foci increased 3-fold as compared to the empty vector (from 8% to 28%, counted after 150 min of Tus induction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Under the growth condition used for microscopy, relative to <italic>ori1</italic> the copy number of p<italic>crtS</italic> was approximated by qPCR to be 2.5 ± 1.3 under Chr1-replication permissive growth and 4.5 ± 1.6 under Chr1-replication blocked growth. The presence of p<italic>crtS</italic> had no effect on Chr1 replication under Tus-<italic>ter</italic> block, as the distribution of <italic>ori1</italic> focus was similar whether the cells had p<italic>crtS</italic> or the empty vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The 153 bp <italic>crtS</italic> locus thus appears sufficient to license Chr2 replication without requiring replication of any other Chr1 locus.</p>

<title>Two unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> sites can license Chr2 replication</title>
<p>Our results so far are consistent with the view that <italic>crtS</italic> needs to be newly replicated for timely licensing of Chr2 replication. How does replication help? To test whether simply doubling the <italic>crtS</italic> copy number, that normally occurs as the replication fork crosses the site, could suffice for initiating Chr2 replication, an extra copy of <italic>crtS</italic> was inserted in Chr1 either 10 kb upstream of the native locus at 0.80 Mb or 900 kb downstream of the native locus at 1.84 Mb (hereafter called two-<italic>crtS</italic> cells). We also constructed a strain containing three copies of <italic>crtS</italic> that included both the ectopic copies in addition to the native copy. The strains with extra <italic>crtS</italic> copies were constructed with or without the Tus-<italic>ter</italic> block in Chr1. The cells without the Tus-<italic>ter</italic> block grew normally, as seen by their growth curves and average cell length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). We also deleted the native <italic>crtS</italic> locus from the strain where the added <italic>crtS</italic> copy was 10 kb upstream. Its growth rate, average cell length and number of <italic>ori2</italic> foci were similar to those of isogenic cells containing <italic>crtS</italic> at the native locus only, indicating that the added <italic>crtS</italic> functions normally at the new location.</p>
<p>In two-<italic>crtS</italic> cells without the Tus-<italic>ter</italic> block, a larger percentage of cells contained two or more <italic>ori2</italic> foci (~60% in two-<italic>crtS</italic> cells vs. ~30% in one-<italic>crtS</italic> cells), indicating that Chr2 initiated earlier in the cell cycle than it did in one-<italic>crtS</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This was true whether the second <italic>crtS</italic> copy was close or far from the native site. The average length of cells with two <italic>ori2</italic> foci was also shorter in the presence of extra copies of <italic>crtS</italic>, indicating earlier initiation of Chr2 replication in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). The presence of three <italic>crtS</italic> copies further increased Chr2 replication such that nearly 80% of cells contained two or more <italic>ori2</italic> foci. These results are consistent with findings in an earlier study that showed that <italic>crtS</italic> activity is limiting for Chr2 replication under normal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>].</p>

<p>We next blocked replication of Chr1 by inducing Tus expression. Cells with one <italic>ori1</italic> focus showed two <italic>ori2</italic> foci in nearly 40% of two-<italic>crtS</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), which is a 3-fold higher frequency than that was seen in one-<italic>crtS</italic> cells. Since Chr2 replication initiated more efficiently with two unreplicated copies of <italic>crtS</italic>, it would suggest that a role of replication is to double the <italic>crtS</italic> gene dosage and the act of replication may not be required for <italic>crtS</italic> function. In other words, an unreplicated copy of <italic>crtS</italic> has activity towards initiating Chr2 replication. The initiation was also similarly efficient whether the two <italic>crtS</italic> sites were near or far apart, suggesting that the sites probably do not interact with each other for function.</p>
<p>Since when Chr1 replication is not blocked, cells with more than one <italic>crtS</italic> copy also have more <italic>ori2</italic> foci, a concern can be that the increased number of cells with two <italic>ori2</italic> foci when Chr1 replication is blocked is a mere reflection of the <italic>ori2</italic> copy number in the replication-permissive mother cell rather than the consequence of new Chr2 initiation events in the absence of Chr1 replication. To address this concern, individual cells were followed by time-lapse microscopy at 20 min intervals beginning at 30 min after the addition of the inducer to block Chr1 replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Cells had either one, two or three <italic>crtS</italic> copies, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3C</xref>. Cells were followed from the time a mother cell with two <italic>ori1</italic> foci divided into daughters with one <italic>ori1</italic> focus. Most of these cells were born with one <italic>ori2</italic> focus. During the course of time-lapse spanning ~ 150 min, the <italic>ori2</italic> focus duplicated earlier and in more cells when they had more than one copy of <italic>crtS</italic>. Only in about 4–9% of the newborn cells with multiple <italic>crtS</italic> copies, there were two <italic>ori2</italic> foci and one <italic>ori1</italic> focus. These <italic>ori2</italic> foci could have been inherited from the mother cell or be the product of duplication within the first 20 min interval of the time-lapse. These results indicate that in cells with two or more <italic>ori2</italic> foci scored at the end of time-lapse, the foci were mostly products of new duplication rather than inheritance from the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasing the number of <italic>crtS</italic> copies from two to three did not significantly enhance the number of cells with two or more <italic>ori2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In the absence of Chr1 replication, other factors necessary for replication probably become limiting for Chr2 initiation. We note that RctB levels tend to increase with the number of <italic>crtS</italic> copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). This is possibly due to increased Chr2 replication and consequently higher dosage of Chr2-encoded <italic>rctB</italic> gene.</p>
<p>A block of Chr1 replication in two-<italic>crtS</italic> cells also blocked cell division as it did in one-<italic>crtS</italic> cells. Since in replication-blocked two-<italic>crtS</italic> cells Chr2 initiated efficiently, it is unlikely that the cell division block could be preventing Chr2 initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, panels 5–8).</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Increasing RctB supply obviates the need for Chr1 replication</title>
<p>The replication licensing activity of <italic>crtS</italic> is most probably mediated through RctB, so far the only factor known to bind <italic>crtS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>]. Moreover, increasing the supply of RctB increases Chr2 replication, suggesting that the initiator is normally limiting for replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref006">6</xref>]. These considerations led us to ask whether increasing RctB can overcome the requirement of Chr1 replication for Chr2 replication.</p>
<p>RctB was supplied using plasmids that expressed the initiator constitutively. One plasmid produced RctB at near physiological level (p<italic>rctB</italic>LOW) and another at nearly a 9-fold higher level (p<italic>rctB</italic>HIGH), as quantified by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). As expected, increasing <italic>rctB</italic> expression increased Chr2 replication in cells with p<italic>rctB</italic>HIGH when under Chr1 replication-permissive condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). When Chr1 replication was blocked, a roughly 2-fold increase was observed in the number of cells with one <italic>ori1</italic> and two <italic>ori2</italic> foci in the presence of p<italic>rctB</italic>LOW as compared to the empty vector (from 8% to 22%, 150 min after Tus induction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In the presence of p<italic>rctB</italic>HIGH, the increase in the number of such cells was about 6-fold, accounting for roughly 50% of cells with one <italic>ori1</italic> focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, increasing the supply of RctB can overcome the dependence on Chr1 replication. We believe that although normally two <italic>crtS</italic> copies are required, one <italic>crtS</italic> copy becomes adequate when the concentration of its interacting partner (RctB) is increased—a mass action effect. This rescue, we show later, depends on the presence of the solo unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> copy, consistent with RctB being the target of <italic>crtS</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>crtS</italic> remodels RctB</title>
<p>RctB binding to <italic>crtS</italic> has been detected by DNase I footprinting and in cross-linking experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>].

Cells dependent on mini-Chr2 replication grew when RctBL156R was the initiator, provided p<italic>crtS</italic> was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In comparison to the previous study using a host bearing a <italic>dnaK</italic> mutation, which can have pleiotropic effects, the present results obtained in the WT (<italic>dnaK</italic><sup>+</sup>) background using a RctB mutant that is specifically defective in interactions with DnaK provide stronger support for the remodeling activity of <italic>crtS</italic>. Since RctBL156R retains some capacity to interact with DnaK, <italic>crtS</italic> could be helping RctB-DNA interaction, rather than substituting for the DnaK function. In either case, the results are consistent with a remodeling function of <italic>crtS</italic>. This is further supported by the observation that p<italic>crtS</italic> enhanced the growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> dependent on mini-Chr2 replication when the mini-Chr2 origin, rather than the initiator RctB, was defective due to insertion of 5 bp within it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>crtS</italic> is required for Chr2 replication in each cell cycle</title>
<p>Deletion of <italic>crtS</italic> is detrimental for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. Survivors are found where either Chr1 and Chr2 have fused or mutations are present. The suppressor mutations so far have been found only in <italic>rctB</italic> or in its promoter. In view of this finding, we sequenced the whole genome of an apparently viable Δ<italic>crtS</italic> strain constructed in our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>]. The sequencing indeed revealed a mutation in <italic>rctB</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s011">S11A Fig</xref>). Thus, the presence of a compensatory mutation or genomic rearrangements seems necessary for viability of Δ<italic>crtS</italic> strains. The RctB mutant was still responsive to <italic>crtS</italic>, since the initiator activity of the mutant increased in the presence of <italic>crtS</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s011">S11B Fig</xref>). This implies that the mutant is gained in functions not controlled by <italic>crtS</italic>.</p>
<p>To study the consequences of <italic>crtS</italic> deletion on a shorter time scale, we developed a method to excise <italic>crtS</italic> and study its effect on Chr2 replication in real-time. Native <italic>crtS</italic> was flanked with the <italic>attB</italic> and <italic>attP</italic> attachment sites of ΦC31 phage and the cognate integrase gene was placed under the control of the <italic>ptet</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref024">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Upon induction of the integrase by anhydrotetracycline (aTc), cells continued to divide but duplication of the <italic>ori2</italic> foci ceased, giving rise to daughter cells that lacked any <italic>ori2</italic> focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s012">S12 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s014">S2 Movie</xref>). The continuation of cell division confirms a prior observation that the cell cycle is insensitive to block in Chr2 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref017">17</xref>]. On a population basis, after about two generations of adding aTc, ~50% of cells did not show an <italic>ori2</italic> focus.

<title><italic>crtS</italic> is required to promote Chr2 replication in the presence of excess RctB</title>
<p>The ability to follow the consequences of <italic>crtS</italic> excision in real-time allowed us to test whether a single unreplicated copy of <italic>crtS</italic> has activity towards RctB. Since <italic>crtS</italic> is crucial for Chr2 replication under normal conditions, an unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> copy might still be required for Chr2 replication that is promoted by supplying excess RctB in Chr1 replication-blocked cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<p>To test for the <italic>crtS</italic> dependence, we excised the site using the ΦC31 system as before. One hour after inducing <italic>crtS</italic> excision, we induced Tus expression to block Chr1 replication. When <italic>crtS</italic> was not excised, cells containing duplicated <italic>ori2</italic> were 2-fold more in the presence of p<italic>rctB</italic>LOW and 5-fold more in the presence of p<italic>rctB</italic>HIGH compared to cells containing the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In contrast, when <italic>crtS</italic> was excised, the percentage of cells with duplicated <italic>ori2</italic> was similar in cells containing the empty vector or p<italic>rctB</italic>LOW (9% vs. 12%) and only 2-fold more in cells containing p<italic>rctB</italic>HIGH (9% vs. 17%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The residual replication of Chr2 upon <italic>crtS</italic> deletion could be due to some spontaneous remodeling. These results are consistent with the view that unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> possesses significant activity towards promoting RctB function, which becomes particularly crucial near the physiological concentrations of the initiator.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, the norm is to have more than one chromosome. That this can be true in some bacteria elicited interest in studying mechanisms of chromosome maintenance that evolved in bacteria and their relation to those operating in eukaryotes. With only two chromosomes, Chr1 and Chr2, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> has proven to be the most tractable organism to address these questions. Replication timing of the two chromosomes, however, is found to be coordinated by an unprecedented mechanism. The timing of Chr2 replication initiation depends on prior duplication of a site, <italic>crtS</italic>, in Chr1. Chr2 initiation depends not only on the timing of Chr1 initiation but also on the time taken by the Chr1 replication fork to travel to the <italic>crtS</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref015">15</xref>]. The position of <italic>crtS</italic> in Chr1 thus dictates the timing of its function, exemplifying the importance of chromosomal location of a gene for its function, a topic that is receiving increasing attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we have addressed the role of replication in <italic>crtS</italic> function and find that doubling of <italic>crtS</italic> site dosage (without requiring the act of replication) suffices for function. The finding that <italic>crtS</italic> need not be newly duplicated to be active should facilitate determining the mechanistic underpinnings of its function in purified systems.</p>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Role of replication in <italic>crtS</italic> function</title>
<p>There are several ways the passage of a replication fork can influence the activity of a site. Simply doubling the copy number of a site can increase the cumulative activity that may suffice for function. Indeed, our present data are consistent with this possibility since two unreplicated copies of <italic>crtS</italic> promoted Chr2 replication more effectively than one unreplicated copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Our finding that the act of replication is not essential also makes the following models less likely, though not mutually exclusive. 1. Replication changes <italic>crtS</italic> topology: The passage of a replication fork can drastically change DNA topology in its wake. An approaching fork introduces positive supercoils, whereas after passage of the fork, the DNA gets relaxed or negatively supercoiled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref026">26</xref>]. The template strand, copied by lagging strand synthesis, also briefly remains single-stranded at the growing fork. DNA topology-sensitive DNA-protein interactions thus can be profoundly altered during and immediately after the passage of the fork. Our results indicate that the above DNA topology changes are not obligatory for <italic>crtS</italic> function. 2. Replication allows sandwiching of the target: It is conceivable that <italic>crtS</italic> function may require at least two copies of the site, e.g., if the function involves sandwiching the target. If interactions between sisters were a requirement, it occurred in our replication-blocked experiments without hemi-catenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref026">26</xref>], and without hemi-methylation and SeqA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref027">27</xref>], common in newly replicated sister chromosomes, and with nearly equal facility when two unreplicated copies were near or far from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3</xref>). 3. Replication clears <italic>crtS</italic> of bound factors: It is possible that the passage of the fork dissociates factors that may bind and inhibit <italic>crtS</italic> function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>We note that Chr2 does not replicate in all cells in the absence of Chr1 replication, even when provided with two <italic>crtS</italic> copies. A likely reason could be blocking of Chr1-replication. Since most, if not all, required factors for replication are synthesized from Chr1, they may have been inadequately produced when cells had a single copy of Chr1. This is indicated when <italic>crtS</italic> copies were increased from two to three. Cells with 2 or more <italic>ori2</italic> increased from 61% to 81% under replication permissive condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), but remain unchanged at ~40% under replication blocked condition, despite the extra <italic>crtS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Unless the cause for Chr2 not replicating in all cells is better understood, whether replication does more than just double the <italic>crtS</italic> copy number, such as change DNA topology as discussed earlier, cannot be ruled out from the present results.</p>

<title><italic>crtS</italic> serves only a positive role in Chr2 replication</title>
<p>It is possible that unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> could be an inhibitor of Chr2 replication, for example, by titrating an activator of Chr2 replication or by coupling with <italic>ori2</italic>, as in plasmid handcuffing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref029">29</xref>]. In these scenarios, inhibitory activity is expected to increase in the presence of additional unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> copies. Our finding that unreplicated <italic>crtS</italic> copies instead increase Chr2 replication makes these scenarios unlikely. Moreover, should <italic>crtS</italic> be functioning only as an inhibitor in the absence of replication, deletion of the site should suffice to activate Chr2 replication, but it does not. In sum, <italic>crtS</italic> appears to serve only a positive role in <italic>ori2</italic> firing. A single copy of <italic>crtS</italic> has significant but insufficient activity. Doubling its copy number, normally afforded by replication, appears to raise the activity above the threshold required for initiating replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for Chr2 replication licensing by remodeled RctB.</title>
<p>The triggering of Chr2 replication initiation requires two copies of <italic>crtS</italic>. The two copies are normally produced by passage of the Chr1 replication fork across the <italic>crtS</italic> site (left diagram) or, can also be provided in the absence of Chr1 replication by inserting an extra copy of <italic>crtS</italic> (right diagram). This suggests that the product of replication but not the passage of the fork <italic>per se</italic> is obligatory for <italic>crtS</italic> function. In our experiments, the requirement for a second copy of <italic>crtS</italic> could be obviated by increasing RctB supply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This, together with the findings that to date all revertants of Δ<italic>crtS</italic> map in <italic>rctB</italic> and that <italic>crtS</italic> alters the DNA binding activities of RctB, lead us to propose that <italic>crtS</italic> activates RctB.

<p>We showed earlier that RctB binding characteristics change in the presence of <italic>crtS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref014">14</xref>] and provide new evidence here that the site relieves the chaperone requirement of RctB activity to some extent and allows the initiator to function with a defective origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007426.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).

<title>Once per cell-cycle control of Chr2 replication</title>
<p>How does a cell ensure once per cell cycle replication of Chr2? By linking the replication of Chr2 to that of Chr1 via <italic>crtS</italic> the cell ensures that a trigger is received by Chr2 every time Chr1 is replicated. Given that Chr1 initiation is tightly regulated, this is a fail proof mechanism for licensing Chr2 replication. Our results suggest that doubling the <italic>crtS</italic> copy number could serve as the sensor for Chr2 initiation, by affecting the binding preference of RctB. However, the nature of the block that prevents Chr2 replication in the absence of <italic>crtS</italic> duplication is not known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g001">Fig 1</xref>), making it difficult to speculate how the block is overcome efficiently upon <italic>crtS</italic> duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007426.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The Chr2 initiator RctB is limiting for Chr2 replication and indications are strong that <italic>crtS</italic> helps to overcome this rate-limiting component. The negative regulatory forces then prevent further replication in the same cell cycle to ensure only one round of replication per cell cycle.</p>

<title>Origin licensing in eukaryotes and other bacteria</title>
<p>Origin licensing is a key mechanism for limiting initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication to once per cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref038">38</xref>]. Although initiation occurs in S-phase, the helicases are loaded in the G1-phase and they cannot be loaded later in S-phase. A helicase-loaded origin in G1-phase is considered licensed to initiate replication, although the actual initiation awaits activation of the helicases in S-phase by kinases CDK and DDK.</p>
<p>It is clear that <italic>crtS</italic> participation is critical for origin firing of Chr2, but the exact step(s) of the initiation reaction in which <italic>crtS</italic> participation is required remains unclear. The initiators of the iteron family of plasmids believed to be the progenitor of Chr2 are known to facilitate helicase loading in addition to DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref040">40</xref>]. A <italic>crtS</italic>-remodeled initiator could also be more proficient in helicase loading, in which case it would have a role beyond formation of the initial initiator-origin complex. In phage λ, loading and activation of the helicase occur at separate stages, the latter requiring molecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref041">41</xref>]. A role of the chaperone-mimic <italic>crtS</italic> in loading/activation of the helicase therefore cannot be ruled out. In that case, the <italic>crtS</italic>-mediated licensing could be likened to the eukaryotic licensing of replication.</p>
<p>Among the members of the <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> family, the sequences of <italic>crtS</italic> and <italic>rctB</italic> are conserved, making it likely that the origin-licensing system described in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> will apply to the entire <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> family. Bacteria with multiple chromosomes are present in different classes of proteobacteria and probably evolved independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007426.ref042">42</xref>].

The <italic>ter</italic> sites were inserted by amplifying the <italic>ori1</italic> region of plasmid pGD101 with primers (RP017 and RP018) that added the 23 bp <italic>ter</italic> sites. In pGD101, <italic>ori1</italic> is linked to a <italic>zeo</italic> cassette that allows selection of transformants. A 1 kb region from each flank of <italic>ori1</italic> was amplified from <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mioC</italic> genes to provide homology for recombination in natural transformation experiments. The three fragments, <italic>gidA-terB</italic>, <italic>terB-ori1-zeo-terB</italic> and <italic>terB-mioC</italic> were joined in order by overlap extension PCR and the product was transferred to the chromosome by natural transformation. The resulting strain, CVC1157, proved to be inefficient in blocking replication forks of Chr1, necessitating addition of a second <italic>ter</italic> site in tandem to either flanks of <italic>ori1</italic>. The <italic>terB</italic>-flanked <italic>ori1</italic> region of CVC1157 was amplified in three ~1 kb segments as before using primers that added the 23 bp <italic>terC</italic> sites: RR66 and RR72 for <italic>gidA-terC</italic>, RR78 and RR79 for <italic>terC-terB-ori1-terB-terC</italic>, and RR80 and RR71 for <italic>terC-mioC</italic>.

The assembled region (~ 3.3 kb) of the resulting plasmid, pRR16, was isolated by Not1 digestion and the fragment was used in natural transformation of CVC3022 and CVC3058 to generate strains CVC3056 and CVC3061, respectively, upon selection on nourseothricin plates. A copy of <italic>crtS</italic> was also inserted 900 kb downstream of the native <italic>crtS</italic> locus in the intergenic region of VC1710 and VC1711 at 1.84 Mb in Chr1.

Strains used are CVC3171 (vector) and CVC3115 (p<italic>crtS</italic>). Data represents mean ± SEM, averaged from three trials. (B) Presence of p<italic>crtS</italic> also causes reduction colony size (top panel) and change in colony morphology (when in a <italic>hapR</italic><sup>WT</sup> unmodified background, bottom panel), giving rise to a rugose appearance. Strains used here are CVC3171 (vector) and CVC3115 (p<italic>crtS</italic>) in the top panel and CVC3210 (vector) and CVC3208 (p<italic>crtS</italic>) in the bottom panel.</p>

Cells were imaged every 20 min after addition of the inducer for 30 min to block Chr1 replication and followed from the time a mother cell with two <italic>ori1</italic> foci divided into daughters with one <italic>ori1</italic> focus. Most of these cells were born with one <italic>ori2</italic> focus that either did not duplicate (row 1) or duplicated (row 2) during the course of time-lapse, spanning ~ 150 min. Chr2 replicated in more cells and earlier (row 4) when multiple <italic>crtS</italic> copies were present. Note that a minority (4–9%) of cells were born already with two <italic>ori2</italic> (row 3) when multiple <italic>crtS</italic> copies were present. These <italic>ori2</italic> foci were either inherited from the mother cell or were products of duplication during the initial 20 min interval after the division of the mother cell.</p>
