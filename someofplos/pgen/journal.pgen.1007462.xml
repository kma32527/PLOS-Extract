<abstract>
<p>Hsp70 is a well-conserved molecular chaperone involved in the folding, stabilization, and eventual degradation of many “client” proteins. Hsp70 is regulated by a suite of co-chaperone molecules that assist in Hsp70-client interaction and stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70. While previous studies have shown the anticancer target ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a client of Hsp70, the regulatory co-chaperones involved remain to be determined. To identify co-chaperone(s) involved in RNR activity, 28 yeast co-chaperone knockout mutants were screened for sensitivity to the RNR-perturbing agent Hydroxyurea. Ydj1, an important cytoplasmic Hsp70 co-chaperone was identified to be required for growth on HU. Ydj1 bound the RNR subunit Rnr2 and cells lacking Ydj1 showed a destabilized RNR complex. Suggesting broad conservation from yeast to human, HDJ2 binds R2B and regulates RNR stability in human cells. Perturbation of the Ssa1-Ydj1 interaction through mutation or Hsp70-HDJ2 via the small molecule 116-9e compromised RNR function, suggesting chaperone dependence of this novel role. Mammalian cells lacking HDJ2 were significantly more sensitive to RNR inhibiting drugs such as hydroxyurea, gemcitabine and triapine. Taken together, this work suggests a novel anticancer strategy-inhibition of RNR by targeting Hsp70 co-chaperone function.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of DNA and inhibition of RNR leads to cellular sensitivity to radiation. As such, RNR is a well-validated therapeutic target for a variety of diseases including cancer. Anti-RNR drugs are effective but are associated with a range of side effects in patients. Our previous work had identified that the Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperone proteins regulate RNR. The specificity and activity of Hsp70 and Hsp90 are regulated by “co-chaperone” proteins. We examined RNR activity in cells lacking individual co-chaperones and identified the Ydj1/HDJ2 protein as a novel regulator of RNR in yeast and human cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibiting HDJ2 sensitizes cells to currently used anticancer drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) is a well-conserved, highly expressed molecular chaperone protein. While Hsp70 assists both in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and denatured proteins (“clients”), it also targets damaged proteins for degradation by the proteasomal system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref003">3</xref>]. Many housekeeping proteins require Hsp70 for stability, making Hsp70 essential for cell viability (2). Cancer cells require Hsp70 to maintain the function of unstable oncoproteins and as such are “addicted” to chaperone function and Hsp70 is often found to be overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref006">6</xref>]. Small molecule inhibitors of chaperones have been developed and assessed for their ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Despite promising data <italic>in vitro</italic>, chaperone inhibitors have met with limited success in clinical trials due to inherent toxicity of a drug that targets an essential cellular protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The activity of Hsp70 is regulated by a suite of co-chaperone proteins comprising mainly of Hsp40s and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) that assist in the stimulation of ATPase activity and the transfer of clients to Hsp70 for folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref009">9</xref>]. They are a heterogeneous group that can be characterized by the presence of a remarkably conserved 70 amino acid J-Domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref009">9</xref>]. In yeast the major Hsp70 isoform Ssa1 is activated by two related Hsp40s, Ydj1 and Sis1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref011">11</xref>]. Although these two proteins are somewhat functionally redundant, Sis1 is essential for cell viability whereas Ydj1 is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref011">11</xref>]. The study of the behavior of chimeric Ydj1-Sis1 constructs has revealed that the C-terminus of these proteins is the determining factor in client binding and functional distinctiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref012">12</xref>]. Interestingly, the C-terminus of Ydj1 contains a CAAX farnesylation motif that targets a small population of Ydj1 to the outer surface of the Endoplasmic Reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref013">13</xref>]. While both the regulation and function of this targeting remains ill defined, it appears that it is required for interaction with Hsp90 and select client proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref014">14</xref>]. Ydj1 controls the maturation and stability of a number of Ssa1 client proteins, particularly kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref015">15</xref>]. Interestingly, Ydj1 also stabilizes several proteins involved in transcription and thus indirectly controls the expression of proteins at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>There are 47 Hsp40s expressed in humans, distributed across the cytoplasm, nucleus, ER and mitochondria and many of these are well conserved with their yeast counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref009">9</xref>]. The human homologue of Ydj1 is HDJ2 (also known as DNAJA1), a protein implicated in regulating HIV replication as well as cancer cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref018">18</xref>]. Each Hsp40 binds to a specific set of client proteins, thus offering the potential for selective inhibition of tumorigenic vs WT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref020">20</xref>]. There are no specific Hsp40 inhibitors in clinical trials and it is only recently that Hsp40s have been considered as possible drug targets, possibly due to the lack of characterization of many Hsp40 isoforms. Several dihhydropyrimidines are able to inhibit Hsp40-stimulation of Hsp70 including MAL3-39, MAL3-101 and 116-9e [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref021">21</xref>]. Recently a novel Hsp40 inhibitor, C86 was identified that promotes androgen receptor degradation offering a novel way to inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Upon DNA damage stress, there is a large remodeling of Hsp70 and Hsp90 complexes and tight association with the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref024">24</xref>]. The RNR complex catalyzes the production of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) required for DNA repair and S-phase progression. RNR is well conserved between yeast and humans and are comprised of a large (R1) subunit and a small subunit (R2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref028">28</xref>]. R1 (R1 in vertebrates, Rnr1/Rnr3 in yeast) forms the catalytic domain while R2 (R2B/R2 in vertebrates, Rnr2/Rnr4 in yeast) acts as regulatory subunits. Although Rnr2 and Rnr4 share sequence homology, only Rnr2 contains the key ligands for tyrosyl radical cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref027">27</xref>]. As a result, Rnr2 is essential for cell viability whereas Rnr4 is not. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated a role for Rnr4 in assisting with Rnr2 folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref029">29</xref>]. The fully active RNR complex comprises of a Rnr1 homodimer and Rnr2-Rnr4 heterodimer, with each subunit tightly controlled at the level of expression and cellular localization in response to both cell cycle stage and DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref025">25</xref>]. One of the most highly induced genes in response to DNA damage is a low activity Rnr1 isoform Rnr3. <italic>RNR3</italic> expression is controlled in a Mec1 kinase checkpoint-dependent manner via Crt1 derepression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref031">31</xref>]. Because of its high inducibility in response to DNA damage, <italic>RNR3</italic> expression can be used as a measure of DNA damage response pathway activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>RNR is a well-validated anticancer target. Since RNR is required for DNA repair and DNA replication, inhibition of RNR slows cell proliferation and eventually results in S-phase arrest. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide, HU) was the first small-molecule RNR inhibitor characterized and was approved for clinical use in 1967 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref034">34</xref>]. RNR inhibitors are particularly effective when used in conjunction with radiation or other DNA damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref037">37</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that pretreatment of cancer cells with either Hsp70 or Hsp90 inhibitors causes destabilization of the RNR complex, sensitizing cells to RNR inhibitors such as HU or gemcitabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref038">38</xref>]. Little is known about the composition of RNR-Chaperone complex, particularly the co-chaperones involved in this process. In this study, we identify Ydj1 and Hdj2 as regulators of RNR activity in yeast and humans, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of sensitizing cancer cells to RNR inhibitors such as HU by suppressing HDJ2 function.</p>

<title>A subset of Hsp70 co-chaperones mediate cellular resistance to hydroxyurea</title>
<p>Hsp90 and Hsp70 mediate the cellular response to DNA damage by regulating RNR activity. Given that co-chaperones mediate many of the client binding functions in Hsp70 and Hsp90, we sought to uncover candidate co-chaperones that may regulate RNR function. We screened 28 yeast co-chaperone knockout strains (BY4742 background) for cellular sensitivity to Hydroxyurea (HU). While the majority of knockouts showed no significant difference to WT, cells lacking Ydj1, Erj5, Scj1 and to a lesser degree Zuo1 showed increased sensitivity to HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007462.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Erj5, Scj1 and Zuo1 are highly specialized co-chaperones that function in the ER and Ribosome respectively. Given that the RNR subunits are not present in either the ER or ribosome under standard conditions, we decided to focus our efforts of understanding the role of Ydj1 on RNR activity.</p>

<p>(A) Yeast lacking selected Hsp70 co-chaperones are sensitive to HU. WT BY4742 or BY4742 cells lacking Rnr4, Ydj1, Erjd5, Scj1 and Zuo1 were grown overnight to saturation and serial 10-fold dilutions were plated by pin plating from 96-well plates onto YPD alone or YPD containing 200 mM HU. Plates were imaged after 3 days. (B) Cells lacking Ydj1 are compromised for DNA damage response pathway transcription. An <italic>RNR3-LacZ</italic> reporter plasmid was transformed into the indicated yeast strains. Transformants were grown and subjected to 0, 150mM or 200mM HU for 3 hours. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in crude extracts. β-Galactosidase specific activity (in units) [-Gal Sp. Act. (U)] is shown on the y axis. Each value represents the mean and standard deviation (error bar) from three independent transformants; **, P≤0.01; ***, P≤0.001 as compared to WT cell controls.</p>

<title>Ydj1 regulates the DNA damage response</title>
<p>HU is a potent activator of the DNA damage response pathway, triggering transcription of DNA repair enzymes. In an effort to determine whether Ydj1 controls transcriptional output of the DNA damage response, we compared expression of β-galactosidase driven by a DNA-damage responsive promoter <italic>(RNR3 promoter-lacZ)</italic> in HU-treated WT and <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells. Consistent with the increased HU sensitivity of <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ, cells lacking Ydj1 were severely compromised for <italic>RNR3</italic> transcription, suggesting a role for Ydj1 in activation of the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>The C-terminus of Ydj1 is required for HU resistance</title>
<p>The Ydj1 protein comprises of four functional domains, the N-terminus consisting of the conserved helical J-domain responsible for binding to Hsp70 and stimulating its ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref039">39</xref>]. In contrast, the C-terminus of Ydj1 consists of two distinct regions, a Zinc-finger like domain and substrate binding domain. These N and C-terminal sections of Ydj1 are tethered together via a flexible linker region rich in glycine and phenylalanine (known as the G/F region). To query the structural requirement for Ydj1-mediated HU resistance, we analyzed an array of Ydj1 C-terminal truncations their ability to suppress the HU growth defect of <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ yeast cells. For these experiments, we utilized JJ160, a <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ strain originating from the stress-sensitive W303 background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007462.s003">S2 Fig</xref>. and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref016">16</xref>]). The Ydj1 C-terminal truncations displayed a gradual loss of functionality with regard to mediating HU resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). While cells expressing Ydj1 lacking the complete or part of the CTDII domain are somewhat sensitive to HU (Ydj1 (1–206) and Ydj1 (1–363)), additional depletion of CTDI as shown for Ydj1(1–134) completely abolished growth at 150mM HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Several Ydj1 mutants have been characterized affecting specific facets of Ydj1 function. Two such mutants, G153R and G315D are able to promote GR and ER activity in the absence of hormone when expressed in yeast and are unable to properly fold client proteins such as v-SRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref040">40</xref>]. We examined G153R and G315D for their specific functionality with regard to HU resistance. While cells expressing G315D were moderately sensitive to HU, G153R cells were unable to grow even at 150mM HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that both CTDI and CTDII domains play an important role in Ydj1-mediated HU resistance.</p>

<title>The N-terminus of Sis1 can substitute for Ydj1 in the cellular response to HU</title>
<p>Ydj1 has high homology to another J-protein Sis1. Both possess an N-terminal J domain that binds and regulates Ssa1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref012">12</xref>]. Although highly related, Sis1 and Ydj1 have overlapping yet distinct functions in the cell. Cells lacking Ydj1 are viable, whereas those lacking Sis1 are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref041">41</xref>].

To complement the truncation data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, we asked whether a selection of Ydj1-Sis1 fusions could provide the same function as Ydj1 in mediating the cellular response to HU in yeast. While replacement of either the Ydj1 J-domain or G/F domain with the equivalent Sis1 region alone had little impact, replacement of both resulted in HU sensitivity. This suggests that while the C-terminus of Ydj1 is critical for the response to HU, the N-terminus is also required and that Sis1 and Ydj1 are functionally distinct for this role.</p>

<title>Farnesylation of Ydj1 is required for the cellular response to HU</title>
<p>While the majority of Ydj1 is localized to the cytoplasm, a fraction exists bound to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref045">45</xref>].

Disruption of Ydj1 farnesylation prevents the interaction of Ydj1 with Hsp90 and client proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref014">14</xref>].

<title>RNR subunit stability is compromised in cells lacking Ydj1</title>
<p>Given that RNR stability is supported by Hsp90 and Hsp70 in yeast and mammalian cells, we wondered whether Ydj1 may be performing a similar role. We integrated GFP-epitope tags onto RNR subunits queried the total levels of Rnr1, Rnr2 and Rnr4 protein in WT and <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells. While Rnr1 levels were unchanged, Rnr2 levels were significantly compromised in cells lacking Ydj1 under both unstressed and hydroxyurea treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007462.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Rnr4 levels were affected in a less dramatic manner; loss of Ydj1 decreased Rnr4 only in HU-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Protein levels in cells are balanced by both rate of transcription and protein degradation. Ydj1 has been shown to bind to transcriptional machinery and thus indirectly regulates the transcription of an undetermined number of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref017">17</xref>]. To determine whether the decreased RNR subunit expression observed in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells was a result of altered transcription, we quantified <italic>RNR1</italic>, <italic>RNR2</italic> and <italic>RNR4</italic> mRNA expression in WT and <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells using RT-qPCR. Both <italic>RNR2</italic> and <italic>RNR4</italic> transcription were partially decreased in cells lacking Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This does not appear to be a global effect as the expression of RNR1 remained unchanged in the absence of Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To determine whether the protein stability of Rnr1, Rnr2 and Rn4 had also been compromised <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells, we examined the half-life of these proteins by transcriptional shut-off experiments. While Rnr1 and Rnr4 stability were unchanged in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells, Rnr2 stability was substantially lowered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To corroborate this result, we examined rate of Rnr2 loss in WT and <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells treated with cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor. In agreement with the previous result, Rnr2 loss was accelerated in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ, suggesting increased instability of Rnr2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We reasoned that if the sole reason for the HU-sensitive phenotype of <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells was destabilization of Rnr2, then massive overexpression of Rnr2 may allow <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells to grow on HU-containing media. We examined the effect of substantially overexpressing Rnr2 in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells using a multicopy <italic>MET25</italic> promoter driven plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007462.s005">S4A Fig</xref>.). Interestingly, cells remained sensitive to HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

Taken together, these results imply that the HU sensitivity seen in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ is a result of decreased Rnr2 and Rnr4 levels, controlled at both the level of transcription and protein degradation.</p>

<title>Ydj1 interacts with Rnr2 in yeast and humans</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Hsp90 and Hsp70 bind RNR components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref023">23</xref>]. Given that Ydj1 binds both Hsp70 and Hsp90 and plays a role in RNR activity, we sought to determine whether Ydj1 interacted with Rnr2 in yeast. We immunoprecipitated Rnr2 from cells and probed for the presence of Ydj1. Ydj1 was detected as an interactor of Rnr2 in both unstressed and HU-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Ribonucleotide reductase is an important chemotherapeutic target in cancer. We considered the possibility that R2B, the human homologue of Rnr2, might similarly interact with HDJ2 (human Ydj1). To examine this, we transfected HEK293 cells with HIS-epitope tagged R2B, purified the R2B complex and probed for associated HDJ2. Interaction of the RNR subunit with HDJ2 was observed, consistent with a conserved role for the co-chaperone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<title>Hsp70-co-chaperone interaction is important for RNR activity</title>
<p>Hsp40-related co-chaperones bind to Hsp70 via conserved J-domains. The J-domain is a 70-amino acid sequence consisting of four helices and a loop region between helices II and III that contains a highly conserved tripeptide of histidine, proline, and aspartic acid (the HPD motif). This region while not required for client protein binding, is absolutely essential for Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction, stimulation of the Hsp70 ATPase and release of substrates post-folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref047">47</xref>]. While several co-chaperones have chaperone-independent activities, Hsp40s typically function through activation of Hsp70. We reasoned that Ydj1’s role in supporting RNR function would occur through its ability to bind Ssa1. We queried whether Ydj1 unable to bind Ssa1 (HPD motif mutant, Ydj1-D36N) could suppress the HU sensitive phenotype of <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells.

To examine the possibility that the HU sensitivity of Ydj1-D36N cells was caused by lowered Rnr2 abundance, we compared Rnr2 levels in WT Ydj1 and Ydj1-D36N cells.

<title>Inhibition of HDJ2 sensitizes cells to RNR inhibitors</title>
<p>Having established that either loss of Ydj1/HDJ2 compromises RNR activity in both yeast and mammalian cells, we considered whether this regulation might be used to sensitize cancer cells to HU. We examined the difference in drug sensitivity of WT HAP1 cells compared to HAP1 HDJ2 knockout cells created via CRISPR disruption. HDJ2 KO cells were markedly more sensitive than WT cells, with a 60% decrease in IC<sub>50</sub>, from 180μM to 80μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). These results suggested that 116-9e (an inhibitor of HDJ2) may be synergistic with HU. We queried the difference in drug sensitivity of cells exposed to HU and DMSO compared to cells exposed to a combination of 116-9e and HU. The combination treatment was highly synergistic, promoting a decrease in apparent IC<sub>50 of</sub> HU from 140μM to 89μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). While HU has been widely utilized as an anticancer drug it has a short half-life in the body, relatively low affinity for RNR and cells tend to resistance over time. Triapine is a next generation RNR inhibitor, possessing high potency in cell and enzyme-based assays. We examined the difference in drug sensitivity of cells exposed to triapine and DMSO compared to cells exposed to a combination of 116-9e and triapine. The combination treatment was also synergistic, promoting a decrease in apparent IC<sub>50 of</sub> HU from 27nM to 19nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). To determine synergy in a more quantitative manner, we calculated drug synergy (CI values) between 116-9e and either HU or triapine across a broad range of concentrations.

Given that co-chaperones direct the activity and specificity of Hsp70 and Hsp90 it is logical that a subset of co-chaperones are responsible for supporting RNR activity. In this study, we identified 4 co-chaperones as being important for HU resistance; Ydj1, Scj1, Erj5 and Zuo1. Scj1 and Erj5 are ER-localized Hsp70 co-chaperones that bind to the ER-specific Hsp70 isoform Kar2. Kar2 and its co-chaperones are responsible for ER-folding and degradation of proteins (ERAD). Given their spatial separation from RNR components, these co-chaperones may support RNR activity indirectly or may have totally separate roles in DNA damage signaling. Zuo1 is a ribosome-associated chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of Ssb1 and Ssb2, making it likely that Zuo1 influences the transcription of RNR subunits or regulators. We hope to shed light on the role of these proteins in the DNA damage response in future studies.</p>

<title>Ydj1 is required for both RNR subunit expression and stability</title>
<p>Ydj1 is a well-characterized Hsp40 responsible for mediating a large proportion of Hsp70 and Hsp90 effects in yeast. We show here that loss of Ydj1 results in lowered RNR expression via both transcription and protein stability. <italic>RNR2</italic> and <italic>RNR</italic>4 mRNA expression is decreased in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells, although this effect seems to be relatively specific given that <italic>RNR1</italic> expression remains unchanged. It will be interesting to unravel the role of Ydj1 in global transcription in greater detail in future studies. In conjunction with decreased RNR expression, loss of Ydj1 significantly destabilizes Rnr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Again, although Ydj1 assists in the maturation and stability of numerous proteins in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref015">15</xref>], the effects here were specific. While Rnr2 half-life was lowered by loss of Ydj1, the half-lives of Rnr1 and Rnr4 remained unchanged. Rnr2 and Rnr4 hetero-dimerize <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and they each support the others folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref027">27</xref>].

<title>Ydj1/HDJ2 support RNR activity in yeast and mammalian cells.</title>
<p>(A) In yeast, Ssa1, Hsp82 and Ydj1 bind and stabilize the RNR complex allowing dNTP synthesis required cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Loss of Ydj1 in yeast results in lowered Rnr2 levels (increased Rnr2 degradation) and Rnr4 (decreased <italic>RNR4</italic> transcription). (B) In mammalian cells, HSP70, HSP90 and HDJ2 bind and stabilize the RNR complex allowing dNTP synthesis required cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Loss of HDJ2 activity (through either CRISPR-mediated deletion or 116-9e) promotes lowering of R2B levels, sensitizing cells to RNR-inhibiting agents such as HU and triapine.</p>

<p>While the majority of co-chaperone function is mediated by interaction with chaperones such as Hsp90 and Hsp70, it is not unknown for co-chaperones to have chaperone-independent activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref055">55</xref>]. Ydj1 binds to Ssa1 via the conserved HPD region, and here we demonstrate that this interaction is required for Ydj1-mediated HU resistance. This is consistent with our previous studies identifying a role for Hsp90 and Hsp70 in regulating Rnr2 and Rnr4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref023">23</xref>]. These data suggest that either Ydj1 transports and transfers RNR components to Ssa1 or exists in a complex with RNR and Ssa1 to maintain RNR activity.</p>

<title>Structural elements of Ydj1 required for HU resistance</title>
<p>Ydj1 is a well-characterized Hsp40 responsible for mediating a large proportion of Hsp70 and Hsp90 effects in yeast. Ydj1 exists as a dimer in yeast and contains several functional elements such as the J-domain, G/F domain, Zinc-finger-like domains and C-terminal domain (CTDII). It is interesting to note that the same C-terminal Ydj1 truncations that result in HU-sensitivity correspond with a previously observed loss of ability of cells to sustain high-temperature growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref016">16</xref>]. To tease apart the role of the Ydj1 N-terminus in HU resistance, we utilized chimeras of Ydj1 and its paralog Sis1. Although Sis1 and Ydj1 possess the ability to bind Ssa1, loss of Sis1 is lethal for yeast, whereas loss of Ydj1 is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref041">41</xref>]. Although individual replacement of either the N-terminal domain or G/F domain with the equivalent Sis1 domain had minimal impact on HU resistance, replacement of both domains simultaneously (SSY chimera) increased the cells sensitivity to HU to a level almost equivalent to <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells. In addition, while <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells are HU sensitive, they are not as sensitive as <italic>rnr4</italic>Δ cells and are viable (unlike <italic>rnr2</italic>Δ cells), suggesting that loss of Ydj1 does not result in total loss of RNR function. This is in agreement with our data that shows partial but not complete destabilization of RNR levels in <italic>ydj1</italic>Δ cells. One potential explanation for this is that the related Sis1 co-chaperone is partially functionally redundant with Ydj1 and can contribute to some degree in RNR activity, particularly given the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g002">Fig 2B</xref>.</p>
<p>It is compelling that Ydj1 farnesylation is required for HU resistance, as it is not required to bind all client proteins and only a small proportion of Ydj1 is farnesylated at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref014">14</xref>]. Farnesylation anchors Ydj1 to the exterior face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it functions to prevent the passage of aggregated proteins from mother to daughter cells during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref045">45</xref>]. While no previous connection between ER function and RNR activity has been identified, it is interesting to note in this study cells lacking of either of two ER specific co-chaperones Erdj5 and Scj1 are also HU sensitive. Although beyond the scope of this study, the interplay between ER co-chaperones and the DNA damage will be interesting to explore further.</p>

<title>HDJ2 regulates RNR in cancer cells</title>
<p>Suggesting broad conservation of the yeast mechanism, we demonstrate here that human Ydj1 (HDJ2) and human RNR2 (R2B) physically interact and that this interaction is independent of HU treatment. This is interesting given our previous findings that RNR subunit interaction with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 increase under replicative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref024">24</xref>]. Our data suggest that both the Ydj1 (yeast) and HDJ2 (human) co-chaperones may recruit and transfer Rnr2/R2B to their respective chaperones (Ssa1/Hsp70) for folding, as loss of co-chaperone function or inability to form a productive chaperone-co-chaperone complex promotes Rnr2/R2B degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007462.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Inhibition of HDJ2 as a viable strategy to sensitize cancer cells to RNR inhibitors</title>
<p>Yeast lacking Ydj1 display a destabilized RNR complex and corresponding sensitivity to HU. In turn, we demonstrate that we can sensitize a cancer cells to HU and the more potent RNR inhibitor triapine by either CRISPR-mediated gene knockout of HDJ2 or by inhibiting HDJ2 with 116-9e. HU was the first small-molecule RNR approved in 1967. HU and other agents, including the nucleoside analog gemcitabine (Gemzar) and triapine, remain important agents in cancer chemotherapy. These agents are commonly combined with radiotherapy and/or genotoxic chemotherapy, which potentiate RNR inhibitors via exposing the requirement for dNTPs in DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref033">33</xref>]. It would be highly desirable to identify agents that can enhance the therapeutic benefit of RNR inhibitors without incurring additional toxicity.</p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated the antitumor potential of small molecule inhibitors of chaperones, particularly Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref056">56</xref>]. Despite promising <italic>in vitro</italic> results several potent Hsp90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG have failed clinical trials due to solubility and toxicity issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref007">7</xref>]. Creating clinically-relevant Hsp70 inhibitors is also challenging, given that Hsp70 is responsible for both the stabilization and degradation of client proteins, many of which are required for cell viability in healthy cells. The ‘holy grail’ of chaperone-based translational research is how to modulate chaperone function in cells such that cancer cells are selectively targeted over healthy tissue.</p>
<p>An alternative strategy may be the targeting of specific co-chaperones, particularly Hsp40s. By replacing the dichlorobenzyl functionality of 115-7c (an Hsp70 activator) with a bulkier diphenyl group, Wisen et al. were able to create 116-9e, an inhibitor capable of specifically inhibiting the Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction in both yeast and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref048">48</xref>]. We demonstrate for the first time that 116-9e has the ability to sensitize cancer cells to anticancer agents such as triapine and HU through destabilization of R2B. Interestingly, a recent study identified a novel Hsp40-binding molecule C86 as being capable of destabilizing the androgen receptor, a driver of metastasis in castration-resistant prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref022">22</xref>]. While we anticipate future studies to examine the dosing and timing required to optimize cancer cell inhibition, the results of both this study and that of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007462.ref022">22</xref>] demonstrates the validity of destabilizing select client proteins in cancer through Hsp70 co-chaperone inhibition.</p>
