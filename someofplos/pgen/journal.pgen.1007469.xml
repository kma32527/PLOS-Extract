<abstract>
<p>The contribution of epigenetic variation to phenotypic variation is unclear. Imprinted genes, because of their strong association with epigenetic modifications, represent an opportunity for the discovery of such phenomena. In mammals and flowering plants, a subset of genes are expressed from only one parental allele in a process called gene imprinting. Imprinting is associated with differential DNA methylation and chromatin modifications between parental alleles. In flowering plants imprinting occurs in a seed tissue - endosperm. Proper endosperm development is essential for the production of viable seeds. We previously showed that in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> intraspecific imprinting variation is correlated with naturally occurring DNA methylation polymorphisms. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and function of allele-specific imprinting of the class IV homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factor <italic>HDG3</italic>. In imprinted strains, <italic>HDG3</italic> is expressed primarily from the methylated paternally inherited allele. We manipulated the methylation state of endogenous <italic>HDG3</italic> in a non-imprinted strain and demonstrated that methylation of a proximal transposable element is sufficient to promote <italic>HDG3</italic> expression and imprinting. Gain of <italic>HDG3</italic> imprinting was associated with earlier endosperm cellularization and changes in seed weight. These results indicate that epigenetic variation alone is sufficient to explain imprinting variation and demonstrate that epialleles can underlie variation in seed development phenotypes.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic variation is well-established. By contrast, it is unknown how frequently epigenetic variation causes differences in organismal phenotypes. Epigenetic information is closely associated with but not encoded in the DNA sequence. In practice, it is challenging to disentangle genetic variation from epigenetic variation, as what appears to be epigenetic variation might have an underlying genetic basis. DNA methylation is one form of epigenetic information. <italic>HDG3</italic> encodes an endosperm specific transcription factor that exists in two states in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> natural populations: methylated and expressed and hypomethylated and repressed. We show that pure epigenetic variation is sufficient to explain expression variation of <italic>HDG3</italic> - a naturally lowly expressed allele can be switched to a higher expressed state by adding DNA methylation. We also show that expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> in strains where it is normally hypomethylated and relatively repressed causes a seed development phenotype. These data indicate that naturally circulating epialleles have consequences for seed phenotypic variation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark that can, on occasion, effect gene transcription and influence development. DNA methylation is a particularly influential regulator of gene expression in endosperm, a triploid extraembryonic seed tissue that supports embryo development. In endosperm, developmentally programmed DNA demethylation causes maternally inherited endosperm genomes to be hypomethylated compared to the paternally inherited endosperm genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref003">3</xref>]. Methylation differences between maternal and paternal alleles identify their parent-of-origin and establish imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which a gene is expressed primarily from one parental allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref004">4</xref>]. Imprinting is theorized to have evolved over conflict between maternally and paternally inherited alleles in offspring over the extent of maternal investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref006">6</xref>]. Under the kinship theory, over evolutionary time silencing of the maternally inherited allele and expression of the paternally inherited allele is predicted to result for genes where the paternally inherited allele’s optimum expression level in offspring is higher than the maternally inherited allele’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref007">7</xref>]. Comparison of imprinting between species in the Arabidopsis genus has provided empirical support for this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent genomic approaches have revealed extensive natural DNA methylation variation within <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref011">11</xref>]. Whereas the contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic diversity is well-established, the impact of epigenetic variation, or epialleles, on phenotype is only beginning to be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref013">13</xref>]. Processes affected by epialleles include patterns of floral development, sex determination, fruit ripening, fruit nutritional content, and senescence, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref019">19</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that natural variation in DNA methylation is associated with imprinting variation, with as many as 10% of imprinted genes estimated to be variably imprinted within <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref021">21</xref>]. Seed development varies extensively among Arabidopsis accessions and has previously been shown to be influenced by parent-of-origin effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref022">22</xref>], thus raising the possibility that variation in imprinting could influence seed phenotypes. One of these variably imprinted genes, <italic>HOMEDOMAIN GLABROUS3</italic> (<italic>HDG3</italic>), is a member of the class IV homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor (HD-ZIP) family, which regulates diverse aspects of plant patterning and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref024">24</xref>]. Studies on the function of class IV HD-ZIP genes in trichome differentiation, sepal giant cell formation, and suppression of somatic embryogenesis, among others, have led to the conclusion that class IV HD-ZIP family genes promote endoreduplication and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref027">27</xref>]. Several members of the class IV HD-ZIPs are primarily expressed in endosperm and exhibit imprinted expression patterns, including <italic>FWA/HDG6</italic>, <italic>HDG8</italic>, <italic>HDG9</italic> and <italic>HDG3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref028">28</xref>]. <italic>FWA</italic>, <italic>HDG8</italic>, and <italic>HDG9</italic> are maternally expressed imprinted genes (MEGs), whereas <italic>HDG3</italic> is a paternally expressed imprinted gene (PEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref028">28</xref>]. The function of the imprinted class IV HD-ZIP genes during seed development, if any, is unknown.</p>
<p>The activity of <italic>HDG3</italic> alleles is correlated with DNA methylation. In endosperm of imprinted strains, the highly expressed paternal <italic>HDG3</italic> allele is methylated and the lowly expressed maternal allele is hypomethylated over a Helitron TE sequence 5’ of the transcriptional start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref002">2</xref>]. Maternally inherited endosperm alleles are demethylated by the 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase gene <italic>DME</italic>; in <italic>dme</italic> mutants, maternal alleles retain their methylation and are also expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref029">29</xref>]. Of 927 Arabidopsis accessions with sufficient methylation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref011">11</xref>], 32 (3.5%) have no methylation in the <italic>HDG3</italic> 5’ region and 871 (94%) have greater than 50% methylation. When strains where <italic>HDG3</italic> methylation is low, such as Cvi or Kz_9, are the paternal parent in crosses with Col, where the maternal allele is demethylated, there is no methylation difference between maternal and paternal alleles in endosperm and <italic>HDG3</italic> is biallelically expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. Together, these data suggest that (1) DNA demethylation promotes repression of the maternally-inherited <italic>HDG3</italic> allele whereas DNA methylation promotes expression (or inhibits repression) of the paternal <italic>HDG3</italic> allele and that (2) imprinting variation is due to <italic>cis</italic> epigenetic variation at <italic>HDG3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. However, a <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> genetic contribution to imprinting variation cannot be excluded because of DNA sequence polymorphisms between the strains and alleles that do and do not exhibit imprinting.</p>
<p>Here, we show that a naturally occurring epiallele can contribute to variation in seed phenotypes in Arabidopsis. We tested whether <italic>cis</italic> epigenetic variation is sufficient to explain imprinting variation by generating a methylated <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele that mimicked a methylated <italic>HDG3</italic> Col allele. We found that the <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele switched from a hypomethylated, non-imprinted, repressed state to an imprinted, paternally biased, expressed state. Additionally, gain of <italic>HDG3</italic> imprinting altered endosperm development and final seed size. These data indicate that naturally occurring epialleles can have phenotypic consequences in endosperm, a tissue where methylation is dynamic as a programmed part of development.</p>

<title>Natural variation in <italic>HDG3</italic> imprinting is associated with gene expression differences</title>
<p>We previously showed that several genes that are imprinted in endosperm when Col is the paternal parent are not imprinted when Cvi is the paternal parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. To further examine naturally occurring endosperm gene expression variation, we sequenced the transcriptomes of endosperm from Col x Col and Col x Cvi F<sub>1</sub> seeds. Comparison of these transcriptomes identified 957 genes that were expressed two-fold or higher in Col x Col and 1187 that were expressed two-fold or higher in Col x Cvi endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s007">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>We previously reported that <italic>HDG3</italic> is a PEG in Cvi x Col crosses but is biallelically expressed in Col x Cvi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. To further explore the expression variation of <italic>HDG3</italic>, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on developing seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1B–1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In Col x Col seeds, <italic>HDG3</italic> is expressed specifically in the micropylar, peripheral, and chalazal endosperm, with the highest expression at the heart stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The same pattern was observed in Cvi x Col (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Whereas <italic>HDG3</italic> expression was detected by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in F<sub>1</sub> endosperm when Col was the paternal parent, it was not detected in endosperm when Cvi was the paternal parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Additionally, we performed RT-qPCR on biological triplicates of Col, Cvi, and Col-Cvi F<sub>1</sub> endosperm. Expression in Col x Col and Cvi x Col was approximately 10-fold higher than in Cvi x Cvi or Col x Cvi, indicating that <italic>HDG3</italic> expression is higher when it is imprinted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), consistent with the mRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and <italic>in situ</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Thus, although expression is from both maternally and paternally inherited alleles in Col x Cvi crosses (and presumably Cvi x Cvi crosses) as detected by mRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>], the total expression in those crosses is lower than when <italic>HDG3</italic> is imprinted. As we previously showed that the Cvi allele is naturally hypomethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>], together these results suggest that DNA methylation of the <italic>HDG3</italic> 5’ region promotes <italic>HDG3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also evidence for imprinting variation of <italic>HDG3</italic> in other species. In <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> is specific to the endosperm but levels differ between two accessions, MN47 and Kar, and their reciprocal crosses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In endosperm with high <italic>HDG3</italic> expression (Kar x MN47), expression is strongly paternally biased (76% paternal instead of the expected 33%), whereas in the reciprocal cross expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> is much lower and more reflective of the 2:1 maternal:paternal ratio in the endosperm (79% maternal) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) (8). The correlation between high expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> and paternal allele bias in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lyrata</italic> thus mirrors <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>.</p>

<title>Reduced <italic>HDG3</italic> expression affects seed development</title>
<p>To examine if <italic>HDG3</italic> influenced endosperm development, we compared seeds from <italic>hdg3</italic> mutant plants and segregating wild-type siblings in the Col background. We confirmed predominantly paternal expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>] by reciprocal crosses between wild type and <italic>hdg3-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). When <italic>hdg3</italic> was crossed as a female to a wild-type sibling male, expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> was detected in endosperm in a similar manner as in Col x Col (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, when wild-type females were crossed to <italic>hdg3</italic> mutant males, the accumulation of <italic>HDG3</italic> transcript in endosperm was dramatically affected, with no transcript detected in most cases, despite the presence of a wild-type maternally inherited allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We assessed embryo stage and the extent of endosperm cellularization for sectioned wild-type and <italic>hdg3</italic> seeds at 5 days after pollination. Embryo development was more variable in <italic>hdg3</italic>, although this difference was not statistically significant, and endosperm cellularization was significantly delayed compared to wild-type seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s008">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Reciprocal crosses between wild-type and <italic>hdg3</italic> mutant plants indicated that the endosperm cellularization phenotype was dependent on paternal genotype, consistent with <italic>HDG3</italic> function being primarily supplied from the paternally-inherited allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s008">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s009">S3</xref> Table). Additionally, the weight and area of <italic>hdg3</italic> seeds was slightly reduced compared to Col, suggesting that in the Col background <italic>HDG3</italic> promotes seed growth or filling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Several PEGs have been shown to influence seed abortion phenotypes in interploidy crosses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref031">31</xref>], but we found no effect of <italic>hdg3</italic> on this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To understand the potential molecular consequences of the loss of <italic>hdg3</italic>, we profiled endosperm gene expression in wild-type Col and <italic>hdg3-1</italic> by RNA-seq at 7 days after pollination (DAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">Fig 3</xref>). 150 genes had at least two-fold higher expression upon loss of <italic>hdg3</italic>, while 238 genes had at least two-fold lower expression in <italic>hdg3</italic> mutant endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s010">S4 Table</xref>). Differentially expressed genes included developmental regulators such as <italic>HOMEOBOX 3</italic> (<italic>WOX9</italic>) and gibberellin oxidases, which effect the level of a key phytohormone necessary for typical seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The loss of <italic>hdg3</italic> also impacted the expression of ten imprinted genes, including the MEG <italic>HDG9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We hypothesized that the endosperm gene expression phenotypes associated with low expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> from Cvi paternal alleles might in some respects mimic <italic>hdg3</italic> mutants. Indeed, of the 238 genes that are down-regulated in <italic>hdg3</italic> mutants, 100 are also down regulated in Col x Cvi crosses, where <italic>HDG3</italic> expression is also low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This is a highly significant overlap (hypergeometric test in R, p = 6.079e-69) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These data suggest that the Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> allele, in its hypomethylated and relatively transcriptionally repressed state, could be important for some of the accession-specific developmental traits imparted by Cvi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, to test both the imprinting mechanism and function of <italic>HDG3</italic> further, we introduced methylation at the <italic>HDG3</italic> locus in Cvi.</p>

<title>An inverted repeat induces methylation in the region 5’ of <italic>HDG3</italic> in Cvi</title>
<p>To distinguish the importance of genetic variation from epigenetic variation for <italic>HDG3</italic> expression and imprinting, we generated transgenic lines in which the endogenous <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele gained methylation in the same region that is methylated in Col. Cvi was transformed with a transgene consisting of an inverted repeat (<italic>HDG3</italic> IR) of the 450 bp <italic>HDG3</italic> 5’ region from Cvi under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. Processing of the expressed hairpin RNA into small RNAs is expected to direct methylation to the endogenous <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi locus. We identified multiple independent transgenic lines in which the <italic>HDG3</italic> 5’ region gained methylation in leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). DNA methylation was present in the same region as in Col, although non-CG methylation was considerably higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the Cvi allele remained methylated when paternally inherited in endosperm, Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR plants from three independent transgenic lines were crossed as males to wild type Col females and DNA methylation was evaluated in F<sub>1</sub> endosperm by locus-specific bisulfite-PCR. Although the 35S promoter has been reported to have no activity in syncytial endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref034">34</xref>], we detected transcripts from the hairpin RNA in endosperm at 7 DAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Bisulfite sequencing showed that the paternally inherited <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele from the IR line was hypermethylated relative to the paternally inherited <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele in Col x Cvi endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g004">Fig 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele from Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR endosperm was methylated in both CG and non-CG contexts, indicative of RNA-directed DNA methylation, although at a lower level than in leaves or in F<sub>1</sub> embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Examination of the bisulfite clones indicated some variation in paternal allele methylation, with clones with 0% methylation detected, unlike naturally methylated paternal alleles from Cvi x Col crosses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). This could be due to stochastic silencing of the IR transgene in individual siliques/seeds or ineffective RNA-directed DNA methylation. The maternally inherited Col allele was unaffected in Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR endosperm, remaining hypomethylated like in Col x Cvi endosperm. Thus, we successfully established an alternate epigenetic state specifically for the Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> allele in endosperm.</p>

<title>Methylation of the <italic>HDG3</italic> 5’ region is sufficient to promote expression and imprinting</title>
<p>Having established a methylated Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> allele, we tested whether paternal allele methylation was sufficient to switch <italic>HDG3</italic> from a non-imprinted, repressed state to an imprinted, more active state. In two independent lines, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of F<sub>1</sub> seeds from Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR crosses indicated the presence of <italic>HDG3</italic> transcript in endosperm, in contrast to Col x Cvi endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Hybridization signal was primarily detected in uncellularized endosperm on the chalazal side of the peripheral endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). However, the penetrance of Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> expression was variable, with about half of the seeds exhibiting <italic>HDG3</italic> expression detectable by <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). This might be related to the variation in methylation of the <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi allele in Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR seeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Analysis of total <italic>HDG3</italic> transcript abundance by RT-qPCR at 6–7 days after pollination showed that <italic>HDG3</italic> expression was 2-3-fold higher in Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR endosperm compared to Col x Cvi endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Higher expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> in Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR endosperm is consistent with <italic>HDG3</italic> being more highly expressed when imprinted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Thus, to measure allele-specific expression of <italic>HDG3</italic>, Col and Cvi alleles were distinguished using TaqMan probes in an RT-qPCR assay. In crosses between Col females and three independent Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR lines, the fraction of transcript derived from the Cvi allele increased compared to control crosses between Col females and Cvi males. In Col x Cvi, the Cvi allele accounts for 23% of the transcripts by this assay, in good agreement with prior allele-specific mRNA-seq results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. In Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR lines, the Cvi fraction was between 50–60%, indicating paternal allele bias (the expectation for non-imprinted genes is 33% paternal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This is slightly less than the fraction of paternal allele expression in Cvi x Col crosses by mRNA-seq (79%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. Together, these data indicate that the naturally occurring methylation variation at <italic>HDG3</italic> is sufficient to explain imprinting variation. We conclude that the methylated Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> allele in Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR plants is active and the gene is imprinted.</p>

<p>Does the change of <italic>HDG3</italic> expression and imprinting in Cvi affect seed development?

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The establishment, maintenance, and inheritance of DNA methylation are fairly well understood processes. Disruption of methylation patterns by mutations in DNA methyltransferase enzymes have clear gene expression consequences. However, whether or not methylation is regulatory during development–meaning that dynamic loss or gain of methylation is a normal aspect of gene regulation–is less well understood. An exception to this is in the endosperm, where active DNA demethylation in the female gamete before fertilization establishes differential DNA methylation after fertilization, a step that is essential for normal seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref038">38</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that the phenotypic impact of naturally occurring epialleles might be particularly evident in the endosperm, because the differential methylation between maternal and paternal alleles that is required for gene imprinting could be variable across accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>]. We have shown that <italic>HDG3</italic> represents a case study of this proposed phenomenon. By placing a methylation trigger in Cvi (the <italic>HDG3</italic> IR transgene), we were able to convert the Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> allele from a hypomethylated to a methylated state. This switch in methylation was sufficient to promote expression of the paternally inherited Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> allele in endosperm to 3-fold higher levels. Because we altered methylation at the endogenous <italic>HDG3</italic> Cvi locus, which retains all DNA sequence polymorphisms, we have shown that methylation variation alone is sufficient to cause expression, and thus imprinting, variation. However, our results also show that it is unlikely that methylation of the proximal TE accounts for all of the expression differences between paternal Col and Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> alleles in endosperm. The paternally inherited methylated Cvi allele, while more highly expressed than paternally inherited naturally hypomethylated Cvi allele, was not as highly expressed as paternally inherited methylated Col alleles in endosperm (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g005">5</xref>). Additional <italic>cis</italic> genetic or <italic>trans</italic> genetic or epigenetic variation likely also affects <italic>HDG3</italic> expression levels. Finally, it is not possible to determine from the experiments presented here whether the original difference in methylation between naturally methylated and non-methylated alleles lacks any genetic basis. Cvi lacks the small RNAs associated with the 5’ TE that are found in many other accessions, but the ultimate cause of this difference remains unknown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Our experiments also shed light on the relative receptiveness of maternal and paternal endosperm genomes to <italic>de novo</italic> methylation. The <italic>HDG3</italic> inverted repeat transgene should create endosperm small RNAs that are homologous to both Col and Cvi alleles (there are only 4 SNPs and a 3 bp indel between Col and Cvi in the IR target region). Yet, in endosperm from Col x Cvi <italic>HDG3</italic> IR crosses, the paternally inherited Cvi allele had high levels of non-CG methylation, whereas the maternally inherited Col alleles remained hypomethylated despite the presence of the IR transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In contrast, F<sub>1</sub> embryos from the same crosses were indeed more highly methylated in the non-CG context on maternal Col alleles compared to maternal Col alleles from Col x Cvi crosses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Thus, maternally inherited <italic>HDG3</italic> alleles in endosperm are refractory to <italic>de novo</italic> methylation even when a methylation trigger is present, in contrast to maternally inherited <italic>HDG3</italic> alleles in embryos. These results further support findings that once a region is actively demethylated on the maternally inherited endosperm genome, it is “protected” from <italic>de novo</italic> methylation even when triggering small RNAs are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, although the direct targets of the <italic>HDG3</italic> transcription factor are still unknown, we have shown that natural variation in <italic>HDG3</italic> expression (expressed in Col, low expression in Cvi) has consequences for seed gene expression programs and development (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g007">7</xref>). Expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> in seeds fathered by Cvi caused dramatically earlier endosperm cellularization and the seeds were smaller and lighter at maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These findings are consistent with class IV HD-ZIP genes inhibiting the cell cycle and promoting cellular differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref027">27</xref>]. However, mutation of <italic>hdg3</italic> in Col, while displaying the predicted opposite effect on endosperm cellularization timing, also resulted in smaller seeds weighing slightly less than wild-type (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g007">7</xref>). Although the effects on final seed size are seemingly contradictory and the physiological basis remains incompletely understood, these results are predicted under the aegis of the kinship theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref007">7</xref>]. The theory predicts that PEGs promote maternal investment in offspring, which is consistent with the effects of the <italic>hdg3</italic> mutation in Col (i.e. less maternal investment results in smaller seeds). Our results suggest that this effect is specific to a Col seed developmental program. In Cvi endosperm, expression of <italic>HDG3</italic> is seemingly maladaptive, leading to the production of smaller seeds. Cvi naturally produces much larger seeds than Col or L<italic>er</italic>, although fewer in number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref033">33</xref>] (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007469.g006">6</xref>). Our results suggest that the loss of <italic>HDG3</italic> expression in Cvi was an important part of the evolutionary process that resulted in these phenotypic differences.</p>

<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that seed phenotypic differences can be caused by methylation differences at single genes. This study provides further evidence that epigenetic differences underlie developmental adaptations in plants. We have previously shown that the imprinting status of many genes varies between accessions; our current study argues that intraspecific variation in imprinting is an important determinant of seed developmental variation.</p>

<p>The SALK insertion mutant was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref039">39</xref>]. <italic>hdg3-1</italic> (SALK_033462) was backcrossed to Col-0 three times before experimentation. For experiments comparing or crossing wild-type and <italic>hdg3</italic> mutant plants, plants were F<sub>3</sub> segregants from selfed progeny of <italic>HDG3/hdg3-1</italic>. Plants were grown in a growth chamber or greenhouse with 16-hour days at 22° C. For crosses, flowers were emasculated and then pollinated after 2 days.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>Controlled floral pollinations were performed for each specified cross. At least two independent <italic>in situ</italic> experiments were performed for each genotype. Siliques were harvested 5 or 6 days after pollination (DAP) and fixed in FAA overnight at 4°C. Following dehydration and clearing (HistoClear, National Diagnostics), samples were embedded in Paraplast Plus (McCormick Scientific), and sectioned at 9 μM (Leica RM 2065 rotary microtome). Ribbons were mounted with DEPC water on ProbeOn Plus slides (Fisher) at 42°C and dried overnight at 37°C. For probes, a 278 bp region of <italic>HDG3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s011">S5 Table</xref>) and previously published 602 bp probe for <italic>PDF1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref040">40</xref>] were amplified from endosperm cDNA and cloned into P-GEM T vectors (Promega). Plasmids containing sense and antisense oriented fragments were identified and linear templates were amplified using M13 forward and reverse primers for probe synthesis. Antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized in vitro with digoxigenin-UTPs using T7 or SP6 polymerase (DIG RNA labeling kit, Roche/Sigma Aldrich). Probes were subsequently hydrolyzed and dot blots were performed to estimate probe concentration. Pre-hybridization steps were preformed according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref041">41</xref>] except Pronase digestion occurred for 15 minutes at 37°C. Hybridization and post-hybridizations were performed according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref042">42</xref>], with minor modifications. For higher confidence in directly comparing expression patterns, slides corresponding to the cross and its reciprocal were processed face to face in the same pairs for hybridization, antibody, and detection steps. Negative controls consisted of hybridizing sense probes to wild-type tissue and antisense probes to <italic>hdg3</italic> tissue. The sense probe lacked signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A probe to <italic>PDF1</italic>, which is expressed in the L1 embryo layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref043">43</xref>], served as a positive control for successful <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Hybridization was performed overnight at 55°C, slides were then washed twice in 0.2X SSC for 60 mins each at 55°C, then twice in NTE for 5 min at 37°C and RNaseA treated for 20 min at 37°C, followed by two more 5 min NTE washes. Slides were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with Anti-DIG antibody (Roche/Sigma Aldrich) diluted 1:1250 in buffer A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref042">42</xref>]. Slides were then washed four times for 20 min each at room temperature with buffer A and once for 5 min with detection buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref042">42</xref>]. Colorimetric detections were performed using NBT/BCIP Ready-To-Use Tablets (Roche/Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in water. Slides were allowed to develop 16–24 hours before stopping. Slides were dehydrated, mounted in Permount (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and imaged using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2. Minor level adjustments and smart sharpen were applied to images to compensate for image transfer from live to digital (Adobe Photoshop).</p>

<title>Seed phenotypic analysis</title>
<p>Previously processed slides from double staining and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments were re-examined and used for embryo and endosperm developmental analyses. Using previously published endosperm cellularization and embryogenesis stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref044">44</xref>], individual seeds at 5 DAP were scored first for embryo stage and then for respective endosperm stage. Endosperm stage was given a numerical score (-3 to +5) depending on the relative stage of endosperm cellularization compared to the expected endosperm cellularization stage given the embryo stage. Individual seeds with matching embryogenesis and endosperm cellularization stages were scored “normal” and ranged from 0–1; seeds that were scored “early” were defined as being +1.5 to +5 stages further along in the cellularization process compared to normal. Seeds that were scored “delayed” were defined as being -1 to -3 stages behind in the cellularization process compared to normal. To determine whether any developmental differences in endosperm cellularization or embryogenesis were statistically significant, we implemented the asymptotic generalized Pearson chi-squared test from the coin package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007469.ref045">45</xref>] in R with default scoring weights (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007469.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Developmental stage was treated as an ordinal variable, while cross genotype was treated as a non-ordinal, nominal variable. Pairwise comparisons were carried out with the R function pairwiseOrdinalIndependence from the rcompanion package. For all tests, embryo development data was collapsed into three categories young (pre-globular to globular), middle (late globular to early heart), and older (heart to torpedo) and detailed endosperm cellularization data was collapsed into the categories delayed, normal, and early.</p>
