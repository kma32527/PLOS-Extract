<abstract>
<p>Histidine kinase QseE and response regulator QseF compose a two-component system in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 QseF activates transcription of <italic>glmY</italic> and of <italic>rpoE</italic> from Sigma 54-dependent promoters by binding to upstream activating sequences. Small RNA GlmY and RpoE (Sigma 24) are important regulators of cell envelope homeostasis. In pathogenic <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> QseE/QseF are required for virulence. In enterohemorrhagic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> QseE was reported to sense the host hormone epinephrine and to regulate virulence genes post-transcriptionally through employment of GlmY. The <italic>qseEGF</italic> operon contains a third gene, <italic>qseG</italic>, which encodes a lipoprotein attached to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. Here, we show that QseG is essential and limiting for activity of QseE/QseF in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12. Metabolic <sup>32</sup>P-labelling followed by pull-down demonstrates that phosphorylation of the receiver domain of QseF <italic>in vivo</italic> requires QseE as well as QseG. Accordingly, QseG acts upstream and through QseE/QseF by stimulating activity of kinase QseE. <sup>32</sup>P-labelling also reveals an additional phosphorylation in the QseF C-terminus of unknown origin, presumably at threonine/serine residue(s). Pulldown and two-hybrid assays demonstrate interaction of QseG with the periplasmic loop of QseE. A mutational screen identifies the Ser58Asn exchange in the periplasmic loop of QseE, which decreases interaction with QseG and concomitantly lowers QseE/QseF activity, indicating that QseG activates QseE by interaction. Finally, epinephrine is shown to have a moderate impact on QseE activity in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12. Epinephrine slightly stimulates QseF phosphorylation and thereby <italic>glmY</italic> transcription, but exclusively during stationary growth and this requires both, QseE and QseG. Our data reveal a three-component signaling system, in which the phosphorylation state of QseE/QseF is governed by interaction with lipoprotein QseG in response to a signal likely derived from the cell envelope.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Bacteria use two-component systems, composed of a membrane-bound histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator, to sense environmental cues and adapt gene expression accordingly. The enterobacterial two-component system QseE/QseF controls functions related to the cell envelope. In pathogens, QseE/QseF were suggested to regulate virulence in response to the host hormone epinephrine, a process known as interkingdom signaling. Here, we analyzed the role of <italic>qseG</italic>, which co-localizes with <italic>qseE/qseF</italic> and encodes a periplasmic lipoprotein. We show that QseG is a prerequisite for QseE/QseF activity in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12. Without QseG, kinase QseE is unable to phosphorylate and activate response regulator QseF. Furthermore, QseG and QseE interact in the periplasm and a mutation in QseE impairing interaction concomitantly decreases activity. Our data reveal a regulatory cascade likely conserved in other <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, in which membrane-bound QseE is stimulated through interaction with periplasmic QseG to phosphorylate cytoplasmic QseF. Finally, we show that epinephrine is a minor stimulus for QseE/QseF in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 and that its sensing strictly depends on QseG. Therefore, QseG is not only required for activity of QseE/QseF, but also for signal perception.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two-component systems (TCSs) allow bacteria to perceive information from the environment and to adapt gene expression and behavior in a meaningful way. Typically, a membrane-bound histidine kinase senses a stimulus via its N-terminal input domain leading to auto-phosphorylation at a histidine residue in the C-terminal transmitter domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref001">1</xref>]. Subsequently, the phosphoryl-group is transferred to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the cognate response regulator, thereby activating the associated output domain, which is often a transcription factor. While the downstream functions of many TCSs are well characterized, the stimuli sensed by the kinases and the underlying mechanisms often remain elusive. Histidine kinases may perceive their cognate stimuli directly or through employment of accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref005">5</xref>]. The model organism <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 encodes 29 TCSs, each dedicated to a specific function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref007">7</xref>]. Albeit intensively investigated, the roles of some TCSs still remain weakly defined including the TCS QseE/QseF (a.k.a. GlrK/GlrR, a.k.a. YfhK/YfhA), which is conserved in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Response regulator QseF comprises an N-terminal receiver domain, a σ<sup>54</sup> interaction domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (H-T-H) motif. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12, QseF activates σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters located upstream of genes <italic>glmY</italic> and <italic>rpoE</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref010">10</xref>]. GlmY is a small RNA (sRNA) controlling cell envelope biosynthesis (see below) and <italic>rpoE</italic> encodes σ<sup>24</sup>, a master regulator of the cell envelope stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref012">12</xref>]. The <italic>glmY</italic> gene is located immediately upstream of the <italic>qseEGF</italic> operon encoding the QseE/QseF TCS and this synteny is conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref013">13</xref>]. Assisted by the integration host factor, QseF binds three upstream activating sequences (UAS) with the consensus TGTN<sub>12</sub>ACA thereby triggering transcription of <italic>glmY</italic> from its σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]. An overlapping weak σ<sup>70</sup>-promoter contributes to low basal expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1C</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>]). UAS similar to those present upstream of <italic>glmY</italic> are also observed upstream of the recently identified σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent <italic>rpoE</italic> P2 promoter shown to be activated by QseF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref010">10</xref>]. QseF requires phosphorylation by kinase QseE for activity. Phosphorylation of QseF increases its DNA-binding affinity and activity of the <italic>glmY</italic> σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter is abolished in mutants lacking QseE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]. QseE/QseF is one of few TCSs residing in the “on” state, at least partially, which is in contrast to many other TCSs, which require a specific signal for activation that is usually absent from standard laboratory conditions.</p>

<p>GlmY has a crucial role for the bacterial cell: Together with the homologous sRNA GlmZ and the RNA-binding adaptor protein RapZ, it controls the levels of enzyme GlmS, which synthesizes glucosamine-6-phosphate, an essential precursor for peptidoglycan and the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref011">11</xref>]. GlmZ is an Hfq-dependent sRNA and base-pairs with the <italic>glmS</italic> transcript, thereby stimulating translation and stabilizing the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref015">15</xref>]. When not required, GlmZ is recruited by RapZ to degradation by RNase E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref018">18</xref>]. The latter process is counteracted by sRNA GlmY, which accumulates when the intracellular glucosamine-6-phosphate concentration decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref019">19</xref>]. GlmY is not an Hfq-binding sRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref017">17</xref>]. It acts as decoy RNA and serves to sequester RapZ, thereby inhibiting decay of GlmZ, which then stimulates GlmS production to replenish glucosamine-6-phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref016">16</xref>]. This feedback mechanism also operates in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and perhaps in all <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> ensuring homeostasis of cell envelope precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref020">20</xref>]. Accumulation of GlmY in response to glucosamine-6-phosphate depletion occurs post-transcriptionally indicating that QseE/QseF are not sensing this metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus, the stimulus for the QseE/QseF TCS in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 remains unknown so far.</p>
<p>In addition to its crucial function in governing expression of cell envelope regulators, the QseE/QseF TCS is required for virulence of pathogenic <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. As a common theme, deletion mutants of the <italic>qseEGF</italic> operon are attenuated in virulence, as demonstrated for <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, the fish pathogen <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic>, enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC), <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref025">25</xref>]. This phenomenon has been studied most thoroughly in EHEC, in which QseE/QseF together with the QseB/QseC TCS complexly regulate virulence genes encoded within and outside of the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island organized in 5 operons (for recent reviews, see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref028">28</xref>]). Regulation by QseE/QseF is indirect and occurs through GlmY/GlmZ, which promote translation of virulence gene <italic>espFU</italic> and selectively destabilize transcripts of the LEE4 and 5 operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref029">29</xref>]. Kinase QseC is a sensor of epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine in EHEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref030">30</xref>] and the QseE/QseF TCS has been described to participate in Epi sensing and signal transduction involving extensive cross-talk between both TCSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. EHEC and also other bacteria including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> sense these host hormones to activate virulence gene expression and colonize the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref026">26</xref>]. Epi was shown to stimulate autophosphorylation of QseC as well as QseE <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. In addition, QseF can also be cross-phosphorylated by the non-cognate kinase QseC <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref032">32</xref>]. By integration of these phosphorylation signals QseF is proposed to modulate expression of virulence genes in response to Epi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref033">33</xref>]. Whether Epi also plays a role for activity of QseE/QseF in commensal bacteria is unknown.</p>
<p>The operon encoding the QseE/QseF TCS contains a third gene, <italic>qseG</italic>. QseG carries an N-terminal signal sequence recognized by the general Sec secretory pathway or the Tat twin arginine translocation system. Consistently, in EHEC QseG was shown to reside in the outer membrane facing the periplasmic leaflet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. In pathogenic bacteria including EHEC, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>qseG</italic> is required for virulence and host colonization, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref024">24</xref>]. In the current work, we investigated the role of QseG in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12. We show that QseG is essential for activity of the QseE/QseF TCS and thereby for <italic>glmY</italic> transcription. <italic>In vivo</italic> phosphorylation assays demonstrate that QseG is mandatory for kinase QseE activity and thereby for QseF phosphorylation. We show that QseG interacts with the periplasmic domain of kinase QseE and mutational analysis indicates that this interaction is required for QseE activity. Finally, we show that Epi slightly increases QseF phosphorylation and thereby <italic>glmY</italic> expression in a QseE- and QseG-dependent manner in the stationary growth phase. Taken together, our data show that QseG operates together with QseE/QseF constituting a three-component system. QseG is likely involved in sensing of the cognate stimulus.</p>

<title>The cell envelope protein QseG is indispensable for activity of the σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter directing expression of <italic>glmY</italic></title>
<p>First, we confirmed that QseG is present in the periplasmic space in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12. To this end, we isolated the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cell envelope containing periplasmic and outer membrane proteins using an extraction method, which was shown to produce clean envelope extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref034">34</xref>]. To allow for its detection, QseG was provided with a C-terminal Strep-tag epitope. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells carrying a plasmid encoding <italic>qseG-strep</italic> or the empty expression vector were grown to the exponential as well as to the stationary growth phase. Western blot analysis of total protein extracts confirmed proper synthesis of QseG-Strep (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, top panel, lanes 1–4). Envelope extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Comparison of the protein bands revealed a distinctive pattern of the periplasmic extracts as compared to the total extracts, indicating successful fractionation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, bottom panel). Indeed, the periplasmic maltose binding protein (MBP; MW = 43.39 kDa) could be readily detected in the envelope extracts, whereas the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein S1 (MW = 61.16 KDa) was absent, confirming successful isolation of cell envelope proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, panels 2 and 3). Western analysis detected QseG-Strep in the envelope extracts and this localization was unaffected by the growth stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, top panel, lanes 7 and 8). In conclusion, QseG is present in the cell envelope of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12, in agreement with previous results in EHEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>To address the role of QseG for activity of the QseE/QseF TCS, we first studied the impact of a <italic>qseG</italic> deletion on GlmY steady state levels. Total RNA was extracted from bacteria harvested at various times during growth and analyzed by Northern blotting. In the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain GlmY accumulated over time showing highest levels during transition to the stationary growth phase, recapitulating previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref016">16</xref>]). In the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> strain, GlmY levels were drastically decreased albeit weak hybridization signals remained detectable. GlmY levels were perfectly restored upon introduction of a plasmid expressing <italic>qseG</italic> from a heterologous promoter, excluding negative interference of the <italic>qseG</italic> deletion with synthesis of the downstream encoded response regulator QseF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine whether QseG affects GlmY levels at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, we measured expression of an ectopic <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> reporter fusion integrated into the chromosomes of the respective strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Expression of the <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> fusion increased over time in the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain, whereas only low activities were detectable in the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutant. Complementation of the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutant with a multi-copy plasmid expressing <italic>qseG</italic> from a heterologous promoter restored <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> expression to levels that exceeded the activities measured in the <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The requirement of <italic>qseG</italic> for <italic>glmY</italic> transcription was not only detectable in strain CSH50 derivatives, which were used here, but also in MG1655, indicating that this is a general phenomenon affecting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In conclusion, QseG is required for efficient transcription of <italic>glmY</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we dissected whether QseG controls the σ<sup>54</sup>- or the σ<sup>70</sup>- or both promoters upstream of <italic>glmY</italic>. To this end, we used mutated reporter gene fusions carrying nucleotide exchanges in the <italic>glmY</italic> transcriptional control region, which abolish activity of one promoter while leaving the respective second promoter unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1C</xref> top). We determined the activities of these reporter constructs in exponentially growing <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>ΔqseG</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1C</xref> bottom). Expression of the fusion solely driven by the σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter was abolished in the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutant and perfectly restored upon complementation with a plasmid carrying <italic>qseG</italic>. Complementation was observed regardless whether <italic>qseG</italic> was expressed from an IPTG-inducible or an arabinose-inducible expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In contrast, activity of the σ<sup>70</sup>-promoter was unaffected by <italic>qseG</italic> deletion or overexpression (Note that basal expression levels are elevated in this case, because the σ<sup>70</sup>-promoter is usually repressed by binding of σ<sup>54</sup> to the overlapping σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]). Hence, <italic>qseG</italic> is essential for activity of the σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter of <italic>glmY</italic>, but has no role for the σ<sup>70</sup>-promoter, explaining the low residual expression of <italic>glmY</italic> that remained detectable in the <italic>qseG</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). These results strongly resemble previous data obtained in a mutant lacking kinase QseE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>], i.e. the Δ<italic>qseG</italic> allele phenocopies a Δ<italic>qseE</italic> mutation. As the σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter of <italic>glmY</italic> is controlled by QseE/QseF, one likely explanation for these results is that QseG has a role for activity of this TCS.</p>

<title>QseG triggers <italic>glmY</italic> expression through the QseE/QseF TCS</title>
<p>To determine whether QseG acts up- or downstream of QseE/QseF on <italic>glmY</italic>, we performed epistasis experiments. To this end, we tested the effects of plasmid-driven <italic>qseF</italic>, <italic>qseG</italic> and <italic>qseE</italic> overexpression in <italic>qse</italic> deletion mutants. In absence of <italic>qseF</italic>, transcription of <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> is solely driven by the σ<sup>70</sup>-promoter and therefore significantly decreased as compared to the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, compare columns 1 and 2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]).

Complementation of the various deletion mutants with corresponding genes on plasmids restored high <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> expression levels, ruling out impaired expression of the remaining <italic>qse</italic> genes in the individual deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, columns 3, 8, 13). Notably, plasmid-driven overexpression of <italic>qseG</italic> in the <italic>ΔqseF</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutants had no effect on the weak <italic>glmY</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, columns 4 and 12). Likewise, overexpression of <italic>qseE</italic> was without any effect when tested in the <italic>ΔqseF</italic> and <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, columns 5 and 9). These data show that QseG requires both QseF as well as QseE to stimulate <italic>glmY</italic> expression. Moreover, QseE is apparently unable to stimulate QseF activity when QseG is absent. Interestingly, when the <italic>qseG</italic> expression plasmid was used to complement the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutant strain, a very high <italic>glmY</italic> expression level was observed, suggesting that QseG is limiting for QseF activity in the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, columns 1 and 8). This conclusion is further supported by an experiment in which <italic>qseG</italic> was transcribed from the arabinose-inducible <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>Ara</italic></sub> promoter on a low copy plasmid and expression was gradually increased using incremental arabinose concentrations.

<p>To learn whether QseG has a role for QseF phosphorylation, we studied the effect of QseG on QseF variants carrying mutations in the D56 phosphorylation site, i.e. QseF-D56A and QseF-D56E variants mimicking non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated QseF, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>]. Plasmids encoding <italic>wild-type</italic> QseF and the mutant QseF variants were used to complement strains deleted for chromosomal <italic>qseF</italic>, <italic>qseG</italic> or both genes, respectively. Introduction of the plasmid encoding <italic>wild-type</italic> QseF into the <italic>ΔqseF</italic> mutant restored <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> levels above the levels observed in the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, compare columns 1–3). Complementation of the <italic>ΔqseF</italic> mutant with the plasmid encoding the phospho-ablative QseF-D56A variant resulted in activities, which were 2-fold lower but clearly above background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, compare columns 2–4). It is well-known that upon overproduction even non-phosphorylated response regulators are able to activate their target genes to some extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref036">36</xref>] and this also applies to QseF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>]. In contrast, introduction of the plasmid coding for the phospho-mimetic QseF-D56E variant generated a much higher <italic>glmY</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, column 5), confirming that phosphorylated QseF is active and strongly stimulates <italic>glmY</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>]. We observed very similar <italic>glmY</italic> expression patterns when the various <italic>qseF</italic> expression plasmids were tested in <italic>ΔqseG</italic>, <italic>ΔqseGF</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutant strains, but there was one striking exception: In the latter mutants, comparable activities were produced by wild-type QseF and the non-phosphorylatable QseF-D56A variant, respectively. In contrast, when tested in the <italic>ΔqseF</italic> mutant two-fold higher activities were generated by plasmid-borne wild-type QseF as compared to QseF-D56A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, compare columns 3–4 with 7–8, 11–12 and 15–16). These observations suggest that QseG, just as QseE, can stimulate the activity of <italic>wild-type</italic> QseF, but not of QseF variants bearing exchanges in the D56 phosphorylation site.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of QseG for QseF activity in more detail, we compared the activities of the various plasmid-encoded QseF variants in isogenic <italic>ΔqseF</italic> and <italic>ΔqseGF</italic> strains during growth. In this case, we used a <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> fusion solely driven from the σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter and monitored β-galactosidase activities at regular time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Expression of the phospho-mimetic <italic>qseF</italic>-D56E variant resulted in very high <italic>glmY</italic> expression levels, whereas much lower activities were measured when the phospho-ablative <italic>qseF</italic>-D56A mutant was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, compare blue and green columns). Of note, presence or absence of <italic>qseG</italic> had no role for the activities generated by these <italic>qseF</italic> alleles. In contrast, <italic>glmY</italic> expression levels triggered by <italic>wild-type</italic> QseF always decreased in the absence of <italic>qseG</italic> to the levels observed for the phospho-ablative QseF-D56A variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, compare dark red with light red and blue columns). Taken together, these data suggest that QseG stimulates activity of response regulator QseF in a dosage-dependent manner, most likely by triggering its phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Absence of transcriptional autoregulation of the <italic>qseEGF</italic> operon</title>
<p>Several two-component systems are known, which are subject to autoregulation at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref005">5</xref>]. A putative autoregulation could potentially interfere with our genetic analysis addressing the role of QseG for QseE/QseF activity. To investigate a possible feedback regulation, we measured expression of ectopic transcriptional <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions to the <italic>qseEGF</italic> promoter. The <italic>qseEGF</italic> operon is transcribed from a σ<sup>70</sup>-promoter, which is located immediately downstream of the <italic>glmY</italic> gene, and starts transcription 25 bp upstream of the <italic>qseE</italic> start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g003">Fig 3A</xref> top; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]). A fusion of <italic>lacZ</italic> to a DNA fragment comprising this promoter (position -70 to +107 relative to the <italic>qseE</italic> start), generated only low β-galactosidase activities that were not affected by <italic>qseF</italic> and <italic>qseG</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, fusion I). To account for potential <italic>glmY</italic>-<italic>qseE</italic> read-through transcripts, a fusion of <italic>lacZ</italic> to a fragment comprising positions -480 to +107 relative to <italic>qseE</italic> was additionally tested. The latter fusion carried the complete <italic>glmY</italic> locus including its transcriptional control region upstream of the <italic>qseE</italic> promoter and <italic>qseE’</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, fusion II). However, the activities generated by this construct were virtually indistinguishable from the activities observed for the shorter fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, compare fusions I and II). To account for a possible intrinsic instability of the <italic>qseE’</italic> (+107)-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion mRNAs, we additionally tested isogenic constructs, in which the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene was fused further downstream at position +266 to <italic>qseE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, fusions III and IV). Indeed, these fusions generated somewhat higher activities as compared to fusions I and II, but once again activities were not affected by deletion of <italic>qseF</italic> or <italic>qseG</italic> or presence of the <italic>glmY</italic> locus upstream of <italic>qseE’</italic> (+266)-<italic>lacZ</italic>. Similar expression patterns were observed in the exponential and stationary growth phases (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These results argue against an autoregulation of <italic>qseEGF</italic> expression.

Low expression of <italic>qseE</italic> is also reflected by weak signals obtained for FLAG-tagged QseE in Western blot analyses of total protein extracts as shown later in this study.

<p>To corroborate these data and to account for a hypothetical internal promoter that could be present in the <italic>qseE</italic>-<italic>qseG</italic> intergenic region, we additionally monitored the levels of endogenously encoded QseG protein. To allow for detection, the 3×FLAG epitope sequence was fused to the 3’ end of the chromosomal <italic>qseG</italic> gene. Reporter gene measurements confirmed that the QseG-3×FLAG protein retained full functionality in respect to activation of <italic>glmY</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). To test for autoregulation, we refrained from analysis of deletions within the <italic>qseEGF</italic> operon as this procedure would generate shorter <italic>qse</italic> transcripts with likely altered stabilities, thereby leading to ambiguous results. In lieu thereof, we tested the effects of plasmid-driven over-expression of <italic>qseF</italic>-D56E, <italic>qseG</italic> and <italic>qseE</italic> on synthesis of the chromosomally encoded QseG-3×FLAG protein, respectively. The same plasmids trigger a strong expression of the <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> reporter fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2</xref>), reflecting the properties of a fully activated QseE/QseF TCS. Since downstream effectors are sometimes involved in feedback regulation of two-component systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref005">5</xref>], a plasmid overexpressing <italic>glmY</italic> was included in this analysis.

<title>Response regulator QseF is phosphorylated at multiple sites <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>The genetic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2</xref>) point to a mechanism in which QseG stimulates phosphorylation of response regulator QseF through modulation of activity of kinase QseE. To address this possibility, we studied phosphorylation of QseF <italic>in vivo</italic> by metabolic labeling of cells using [<sup>32</sup>P] phosphorus. To this end, <italic>qseF</italic> was expressed under control of the IPTG-inducible <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>tac</italic></sub> promoter from a plasmid in <italic>wild-type</italic> as well as <italic>ΔqseE</italic> cells. The QseF variant carrying the D56A exchange of the phosphorylation site in the receiver domain served as negative control. The bacteria were grown in absence and presence of IPTG and subsequently labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P] phosphoric acid. Total protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Among various bands representing abundant phosphoproteins, a single phosphorylation signal became visible exclusively in the presence of IPTG and its position on the gel roughly matched the molecular weight of QseF (MW = 49.15 kDa). To our surprise, this phosphorylation signal was also detectable in the <italic>ΔqseE</italic> strain and when the QseF-D56A variant was employed. To confirm that the IPTG-inducible phosphorylation signal indeed corresponds to QseF, we used QseF variants carrying Strep-tags at their C-termini allowing for their pull-down following [<sup>32</sup>P] labeling. In this case, the QseF variants were produced from plasmids in <italic>ΔqseF</italic> (<italic>qseG</italic><sup>+</sup>) as well as in <italic>ΔqseFG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, top panel), metabolically labeled and subsequently isolated by pull-down using StrepTactin coated magnetic beads. The obtained fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Strep antiserum as well as by autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, middle and bottom panels). The Western blot confirmed successful isolation of the QseF proteins from the cultures induced by IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">Fig 4B</xref> middle panel, lanes 5–8), whereas QseF could not be recovered from non-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">Fig 4B</xref> middle panel, lanes 1–4). Autoradiography once again detected phosphorylation of QseF under all conditions, regardless of the D56A substitution and also not affected by QseG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">Fig 4B</xref> bottom panel, lanes 5–8).</p>

<p>To explain the surprising results of the <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation assays, we reasoned that QseF is phosphorylated at a second site, masking its phosphorylation at Asp56. We speculated that the additional phosphorylation(s) may take place in the QseF C-terminus comprising the σ<sup>54</sup> interaction domain and the DNA-binding domain (subsequently designated as QseF-CTD). Phosphorylation of response regulators outside their receiver domains has been observed in several cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref038">38</xref>]. Therefore, we split the protein and expressed the QseF N-terminus comprising the receiver domain (subsequently designated as QseF-NTD) and the QseF-CTD separately, both provided with C-terminal Strep-tags for subsequent pull-down and detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition, a QseF-NTD variant was generated carrying the D56A exchange of the phosphorylation site. Bacteria producing the various QseF-Strep variants from plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, left panel) were labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P] followed by pull-down of the QseF variants, which was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, middle panel). Indeed, autoradiography detected phosphorylation signals for both, the QseF-NTD and the QseF-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, right panel). Importantly, no phosphorylation of the QseF-NTD carrying the D56A substitution was observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, right panel). These data show that D56 is the single site phosphorylated in the QseF receiver domain, whereas the additional phosphorylation signal localizes in the QseF-CTD. Western blot analysis of purified proteins using an antiserum specific for phospho-tyrosine residues generated no signals. However, a phospho-threonine specific antiserum detected full-length QseF and the QseF-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, top and middle panel). In contrast, the QseF-NTD and the response regulator PhoB, which was included as a control, were not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, middle panel, lanes 1 and 4). Treatment of the PVDF membrane with alkaline phosphatase prior to application of the antiserum erased the signals for full-length QseF and the QseF-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, bottom panel). Thus, QseF is phosphorylated at D56 in the receiver domain and presumably at unknown threonine or serine residue(s) in the CTD.</p>

<title>QseG triggers phosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain by kinase QseE</title>
<p>Next, we used the QseF-NTD construct to clarify the question whether QseE and QseG are required for phosphorylation of QseF at the D56 residue in the receiver domain. To this end, the plasmid encoding the C-terminally Strep-tagged QseF-NTD was introduced in isogenic <italic>wild-type</italic>, <italic>ΔqseG</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> strains. Once again, the bacteria were grown in LB supplemented with IPTG to induce synthesis of recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, left panel) and subsequently labelled with [<sup>32</sup>P] phosphoric acid. Finally, the QseF-NTD was isolated by pull-down and eluates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Strep antiserum and by autoradiography. Western blotting proved successful isolation of the QseF-NTD from all three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, middle panel). The autoradiograph revealed a strong phosphorylation signal for the QseF-NTD isolated from the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain. In contrast, 7- and 8-fold reduced phosphorylation signal intensities were obtained, when the QseF-NTD was isolated from the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, right panel). These data show that both QseE and QseG are required for efficient phosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain. As QseG is unable to increase phosphorylation of QseF in the <italic>qseE</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), it can be concluded that QseG acts through QseE to stimulate phosphorylation of QseF and thereby <italic>glmY</italic> expression.</p>

<p>Some histidine kinases are bi-functional and exhibit in addition to phosphotransferase also phosphatase activity towards the cognate response regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref001">1</xref>]. Kinase activity of QseE towards QseF was demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref039">39</xref>], but whether QseE has also phosphatase activity is unknown. In principle, QseG could increase phosphorylation of QseF either by stimulating phosphotransferase activity or by inhibiting phosphatase activity of QseE. To gain initial insight into how QseG governs phosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain, we carried out [<sup>32</sup>P] pulse-chase experiments to follow the fate of the QseF-D56 phosphorylation signal in a time course. Therefore, we once again labelled the <italic>wild-type</italic>, <italic>ΔqseG</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> strains producing the Strep-tagged QseF-NTD (pulse), but subsequently stopped further incorporation of the [<sup>32</sup>P] label by addition of “cold” phosphorus (chase). Samples were harvested at 0, 5 and 15 min following chase and the QseF-NTD was subsequently isolated by StrepTactin pull-down and analyzed as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The phosphorylation signal for the QseF-NTD rapidly diminished within 15 min in the wild-type strain, whereas such a decrease was not observable in the <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, compare lanes 1–3 with 7–9). This result indicates that QseE possesses phosphatase activity and is responsible for dephosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain in the wild-type strain. In case QseG would act by inhibition of QseE phosphatase activity, an accelerated dephosphorylation of the QseF-NTD is expected in the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutant as compared to the wild-type. However, this was not the case: The QseF-NTD phosphorylation signal also decreased over time in the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> mutant, but not faster than in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lanes 4–6). In conclusion, QseG appears not to act by inhibition of phosphatase activity, suggesting that it increases phosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain through stimulation of QseE phosphotransferase activity.</p>

<title>Outer membrane lipoprotein QseG and kinase QseE physically interact in the periplasm</title>
<p>QseG faces the periplasmic leaflet of the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. On the other hand, kinase QseE contains a helical periplasmic domain of 140 amino acids between its two transmembrane domains (TMs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref040">40</xref>]). This topological arrangement makes a physical interaction of QseG with the periplasmic domain of QseE feasible. Physical interaction of outer membrane lipoproteins with the periplasmic domains of cytoplasmic membrane proteins has been demonstrated in several cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref043">43</xref>]. To investigate whether QseG and QseE interact, we used a ligand fishing approach based on StrepTactin affinity chromatography, which allows for pull-down of membrane proteins by cytoplasmic or periplasmic interaction partners as demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref044">44</xref>]. For detection of the prey protein QseE, the sequence encoding the 3×FLAG epitope was fused in frame to the 3’ end of <italic>qseE</italic> encoded at its natural chromosomal locus. An isogenic strain carrying the 3×FLAG epitope sequence fused to the 3’ end of <italic>phoQ</italic> served as negative control. Similar to QseE, PhoQ is a histidine kinase that possesses two N-terminal TMs encompassing a large domain extruding into the periplasm. QseG carrying a C-terminal Strep-tag was used as bait and produced from a plasmid in the latter two strains. A complementation assay confirmed functionality of the QseG-Strep protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The same strains, but producing solely the Strep-peptide rather than QseG-Strep served as negative controls. Analysis of total cell extracts by Western blotting revealed a clear signal for the PhoQ-3×FLAG protein (MW = 58.12 kDa) in addition to several non-specific bands, whereas only a faint band for QseE-3×FLAG (MW = 56.15 kDa) was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, “input”), reflecting the notoriously weak expression level of <italic>qseE</italic> (see above and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]). The various strains were subjected to the StrepTactin affinity purification protocol and inspection of the eluates proved successful purification of QseG-Strep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, “output” bottom panel). Western blotting analysis of the eluates revealed a strong enrichment of QseE-3×FLAG when QseG-Strep was used as bait, whereas no signals were obtained when the Strep-peptide was produced or when PhoQ-3×FLAG was assessed as potential prey, providing proof of specificity of the QseE-QseG interaction detected by this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>To further characterize interaction of QseG and QseE, we used the bacterial adenylate-cyclase based two-hybrid system (BACTH), which relies on interaction-mediated reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref045">45</xref>]. In BACTH, the complementary T18- and T25-fragments of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> adenylate cyclase are assembled to a functional enzyme through interaction of candidate proteins that are fused to these fragments. The classical BACTH is restricted to interactions within the cytoplasm or the cytoplasmic membrane, but more recently modified BACTH vectors have been developed, which allow to assess extra-cytoplasmic protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref046">46</xref>]. In this case, a membrane domain of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OppB protein is inserted in the fusion protein between the CyaA-fragment and the candidate protein, resulting in extrusion of the latter into the periplasm, while the N-terminal CyaA fragment stays in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we fused the sequence encoding QseG (but lacking the first 25 codons encoding the N-terminal export signal) to the 3’ end of the <italic>T18-TM</italic><sub><italic>oppB</italic></sub> fusion gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Of note, deletion of the export signal in the context of the <italic>wild-type</italic> QseG protein rendered the protein inactive, supporting the idea that QseG must leave the cytoplasm to stimulate <italic>glmY</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s009">S9 Fig</xref>, columns 1–4). The T18-TM<sub>oppB</sub>-QseG BACTH fusion construct was then tested for interaction with QseE, which was fused to the C-terminus of the T25 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Indeed, β-galactosidase assays reflecting cAMP synthesis detected activity fairly above the level of the negative control, in which the unfused CyaA fragments were addressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, columns 2 and 8). Activity even exceeded the positive control, which detects homodimerization of the leucine zipper of the yeast transcription factor Gcn4 in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, compare columns 2 and 7). No interaction was detectable when QseG [Δ aa 1–25] was directly fused to the T18 fragment omitting the TM<sub>oppB</sub> domain in the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, column 1), confirming that QseG must leave the cytoplasm to interact with QseE. To provide further proof of specificity of the detected QseG-QseE interaction, we also tested interaction of the T18-TM<sub>oppB</sub>-QseG fusion with membrane-bound histidine kinases CpxA and PhoQ, which exhibit similar membrane-topologies as QseE, i.e. they possess large periplasmic domains encompassed by two N-terminally located TMs. However, only back-ground activities could be measured in these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, columns 5 and 6). BACTH assays addressing homodimerization of the kinases proved functionality of the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, columns 1, 4, 5).</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to confirm that QseG interacts with the N-terminus of QseE comprising the periplasmic loop. Therefore, we tested interaction of the QseG fusion protein with the N-terminus of QseE (residues 1–250; subsequently designated QseE<sub>NTD</sub>) lacking the C-terminal transmitter domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). However, in this case only background activities were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, columns 3 and 8). Dimerization of histidine kinases is usually mediated through the transmitter domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref001">1</xref>] and accordingly homodimerization of the QseE<sub>NTD</sub> was greatly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, columns 1 and 2). To test, whether the loss of interaction with QseG resulted from the inability of QseE<sub>NTD</sub> to form dimers, we fused the leucine zipper homodimerization domain of Gcn4 to the C-terminus of QseE<sub>NTD</sub>. Indeed, this procedure rescued dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, column 3) and also partially restored interaction with QseG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, column 4). Taken together, the data indicate that QseG binds the N-terminus of QseE in the periplasm and that dimerization of QseE is a prerequisite for this interaction.</p>

<title>A mutation in the QseE periplasmic domain impairs interaction with QseG and concomitantly decreases kinase activity</title>
<p>Our data suggested that activation of QseE by QseG may require their physical interaction in the periplasm. To obtain insight, we searched for mutations in the QseE N-terminus decreasing interaction with QseG. To this end, we randomly mutagenized the sequence encoding the QseE N-terminus (aa 1–258) within the full-length <italic>T25-qseE</italic> construct by error prone PCR and screened the resulting library of QseE mutants in context of BACTH for variants showing decreased interaction with QseG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In addition to mutants carrying stop- or frameshift mutations, which were not further analyzed, two mutants carrying exclusively amino acid exchanges were isolated. One mutant (subsequently designated “QseG-M5) carried five exchanges (i.e. F19L, L21H, I22R, L23P, L24P) in TM1, while the other mutant received a single amino acid exchange (S58N) in the periplasmic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Quantitative assays revealed that interaction of QseE with QseG is abrogated by the M5 mutation and significantly decreased when the S58N exchange was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, columns 1–3). A pull-down assay using QseG-Strep as bait confirmed the decreased interaction potential of the QseE-S58N variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). In this case, presence of the S58N mutation reduced the amount of co-purifying QseE-3×FLAG protein ~3-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s011">S11 Fig</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 9). Thus, interaction of QseE with QseG is impaired by the S58N mutation but not completely abolished. To test for kinase activity, the various QseE variants were placed on plasmids under <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>tac</italic></sub>-promoter control and used to complement a <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutant strain carrying the <italic>glmY’-lac</italic>Z reporter fusion on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Indeed, the M5 mutation abolished QseE activity as judged from comparison with the empty vector control and an inactive QseE-H259A mutant carrying a substitution in the QseE autophosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, compare columns 1–6). However, as indicated by BACTH, the QseE-M5 mutant was also strongly impaired in homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, columns 4 and 5). Therefore, the mutations in TM1 might interfere with proper membrane insertion of QseE rather than to specifically abrogate interaction with QseG. In contrast, the QseE-S58N mutant was not significantly impaired in homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, columns 4 and 6). Strikingly, the QseE-S58N mutant showed a 3-fold decreased potential to activate transcription of <italic>glmY</italic> as compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> QseE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, compare columns 4 and 7). The residual activation potential of QseE-S58N is still dependent on QseG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). Thus, the S58N exchange diminishes interaction with QseG and concomitantly lowers activity of QseE. This result supports a model in which QseG activates QseE kinase activity through interaction.</p>

<title>Epinephrine stimulates QseE phosphorylation and thereby <italic>glmY</italic> transcription in a QseG-dependent manner in the stationary growth phase</title>
<p>A previous study reported that QseE of EHEC responds to epinephrine <italic>in vitro</italic> by increased autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>].

Epinephrine did not change <italic>glmY</italic> transcription during the exponential and early stationary growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). However, after 10 h growth in presence of epinephrine a somewhat higher <italic>glmY</italic> transcription level became evident in the epinephrine treated culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). To confirm this result, we determined <italic>glmY</italic> transcription levels in overnight cultures incubated for ~16h in epinephrine containing LB medium. Once again, higher <italic>glmY’-lacZ</italic> levels were observable in the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain in presence of epinephrine and Northern blot analysis confirmed that GlmY accumulated to higher amounts in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutant strains showed only low <italic>glmY</italic> transcription levels and failed to respond to epinephrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). These results suggested that epinephrine might stimulate QseE autophosphorylation in a QseG-dependent manner. To address this possibility, we studied phosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain by metabolic [<sup>32</sup>P] labelling followed by pull-down <italic>in vivo</italic>. The Strep-tagged QseF-NTD was overproduced from a plasmid in <italic>wild-type</italic>, <italic>ΔqseG</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, left) and subsequently cells grown to stationary phase were labelled in the absence and presence of epinephrine and the QseF-NTD was isolated by pull-down using StrepTactin coated magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, middle panel). Indeed, epinephrine moderately stimulated phosphorylation of the QseF-NTD in the <italic>wild-type</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, right panel and diagram). In the <italic>ΔqseG</italic> and <italic>ΔqseE</italic> mutants, however, phosphorylation of the QseF-NTD was strongly decreased as observed before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6</xref>) and epinephrine had no effect on the remaining phosphorylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, right panel and diagram).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we show that the outer membrane lipoprotein QseG is an indispensable component of the QseE/QseF TCS, reflecting the conserved co-localization of the <italic>qseEGF</italic> genes in one operon. Genetic and <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation studies indicate that QseG triggers phosphorylation of QseE/QseF <italic>in vivo</italic>, constituting a “three-component system” (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">6</xref>). QseG binds the large periplasmic domain of kinase QseE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and this interaction likely triggers QseE autophosphorylation activity or stimulates QseE/QseF phosphoryl-group transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Such a model is supported by identification of the S58N exchange located in a conserved region in the periplasmic domain of QseE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), which impairs interaction with QseG and concomitantly decreases activity of QseE/QseF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">Fig 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). The data are consistent with a model, in which the outer membrane protein QseG activates kinase QseE by interaction thereby increasing the level of phosphorylated QseF, which in turn activates the σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters upstream of <italic>glmY</italic> and <italic>rpoE</italic>, both encoding central regulators of cell envelope homoeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for control of sRNA <italic>glmY</italic> transcription by the QseE/QseG/QseF three-component system in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12.</title>
<p>The model summarizes data obtained in the current and in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref016">16</xref>]. In the absence of QseG, kinase QseE is inactive and unable to activate response regulator QseF. QseG is a lipoprotein attached to the outer membrane and binds the periplasmic loop of kinase QseE. Interaction with QseG may activate kinase QseE to phosphorylate response regulator QseF at residue Asp56 in the receiver domain. Whether this interaction occurs with membrane-attached or soluble QseG remains unclear. The host hormone epinephrine moderately stimulates phosphorylation of QseF by QseE in a QseG-dependent manner when cells reside in the stationary growth phase. In addition, QseF is phosphorylated by an unknown activity in the C-terminus, presumably at Thr or Ser residue(s). Assisted by the integration host factor IHF, phosphorylated QseF binds to conserved sites upstream of <italic>glmY</italic> and activates <italic>glmY</italic> transcription from a σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoter. The sRNA GlmY in turn counteracts degradation of the homologous sRNA GlmZ through sequestration of protein RapZ, which is required for GlmZ decay. Through a base-pairing mechanism GlmZ activates synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, which generates glucosamine-6-phosphate—the first dedicated metabolite for synthesis of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides.</p>

<p>In agreement with our results, QseG was shown also to be required for activation of the σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent <italic>rpoE</italic> promoter by response regulator QseF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref010">10</xref>]. In this case, QseG was identified in a screen as a multi-copy activator of the <italic>rpoE</italic> σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter. QseG carries a 25 aa long export sequence at the N-terminus, including a so-called “lipobox”, and does not contain a Lol avoidance motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). Therefore, it is exported to the periplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and predicted to attach to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane via lipidation of residue Cys26, which should become the new N-terminal amino acid following cleavage of the signal peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref047">47</xref>]. Consistently, EHEC QseG, which is identical with QseG from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s013">S13 Fig</xref>), was shown to localize to the outer membrane, but being inaccessible to proteinase K digestion from the exterior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. This extracytoplasmic localization is in perfect agreement with our observation that QseG must leave the cytoplasm in order to interact with QseE and to activate <italic>glmY</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). However, it should be stressed that the exact localization of QseG within the periplasmic compartment is apparently not crucial for its activity. Mutation of the presumably lipidated Cys26 residue has only a moderate effect on QseG activity and QseG even retains significant activity when carrying a V27D Lol avoidance motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) leading to its retention in the cytoplasmic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref047">47</xref>]. Obviously, QseG can reach and bind QseE regardless of its specific localization within the periplasmic space. In any case, the 237 amino acids long QseG protein is sufficiently large to form a trans-envelope complex with QseE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>The architecture of the QseE/QseG/QseF three-component system is remarkably reminiscent of the Cpx and Rcs envelope stress response systems, which are also built around two-component systems that employ outer membrane lipoproteins for signal perception and activation of the phosphorylation cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref048">48</xref>]. Under normal conditions, the lipoprotein RcsF is threaded into β-barrel Omp proteins and thereby sequestered at the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref049">49</xref>]. Stress prevents incorporation of RcsF into these complexes leading to accumulation of RcsF remaining exposed in the periplasm. This enables the outer-membrane attached RcsF to interact with the inner membrane protein IgaA, thereby releasing the Rcs phospho-relay system from IgaA-mediated inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref042">42</xref>]. In the Cpx system, the outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE activates the CpxA/CpxR TCS, presumably through direct interaction with kinase CpxA or its periplasmic inhibitor CpxP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref050">50</xref>]. As a common principle, phosphorylation of the Rcs and Cpx systems is triggered by availability of the cognate lipoproteins for interaction in the periplasm. Accordingly, both systems can be activated by artificially increasing the levels of these lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref052">52</xref>]. A similar scenario is observed here, as activity of the QseE/QseF TCS directly correlates with <italic>qseG</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Apparently, QseE/QseF phosphorylation activity is limited by availability of QseG in the periplasm. It is tempting to speculate that cells control the levels of “free” QseG available for interaction with QseE, to adjust QseE/QseF activity accordingly. Interestingly, in EHEC QseG was recently found to interact with the LEE-encoded protein SepL, which serves as gate-protein for the type III secretion system used to translocate effector proteins into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref024">24</xref>]. Albeit the role of this interaction remained unclear, it could serve to sequester QseG making it unavailable for interaction with QseE. Such a mechanism could fine-tune synthesis of type III secretion system components, as their expression is controlled by QseE/QseF through GlmY/GlmZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref029">29</xref>]. However, SepL is absent in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 indicating that interaction of QseG with QseE must be differently controlled, which will be the subject of future studies.</p>
<p>Moreover, we show that QseF also responds to Epi in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12, but moderately and exclusively in the stationary growth phase. Under these conditions Epi increases QseF phosphorylation and concomitantly <italic>glmY</italic> transcription 1.5-fold and this effect requires both, kinase QseE and QseG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9</xref>). In respect to its limited impact, it appears that Epi is not a major stimulus for the QseE/QseF TCS in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12, which apparently is, at least partially, already in the “on-state” under standard laboratory conditions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">6</xref>). As QseE requires QseG to respond to Epi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9</xref>), it appears debatable whether QseE is able to sense Epi on its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. Interaction of Epi with the QseE periplasmic domain could also not be observed by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref040">40</xref>]. Therefore, interaction of QseG with epinephrine appears to be a possible mechanism. However, we cannot exclude that the weak stimulatory effect of Epi on QseE/QseF phosphorylation is indirect, and may perhaps involve a putative interaction partner of QseG or even epinephrine degradation products. EHEC QseE was also reported to sense phosphate and sulfate ions as it responds with increased autophosphorylation to these signals <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref031">31</xref>]. However, when tested in a minimal medium, phosphate and sulfate had no impact on <italic>glmY</italic> transcription in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). Apparently, through employment of QseG, QseE senses different cues in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12, most likely signal(s) derived from the cell envelope. In agreement, activity of QseF was observed to increase in a <italic>waaC</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref010">10</xref>]. Gene <italic>waaC</italic> encodes LPS heptosyltransferase I and its absence causes defects in LPS biosynthesis.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also no Epi-dependent cross-phosphorylation of QseF by histidine kinase QseC in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12, as Epi is unable to increase phosphorylation of QseF in the absence of QseE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). This is in contrast to EHEC, in which QseC was reported to contribute to QseF phosphorylation as it is able to cross-phosphorylate QseF <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref032">32</xref>]. In EHEC, the QseB/QseC TCS was also described to cross-talk with the QseE/QseF TCS at the level of <italic>glmY</italic> transcription: In addition to QseF, also response regulator QseB was shown to bind to the EHEC <italic>glmY</italic> promoter region, thereby stimulating <italic>glmY</italic> expression two-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref029">29</xref>]. However, in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 deletion of <italic>qseB</italic> or <italic>qseC</italic> has no effect on <italic>glmY</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s015">S15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s016">S16</xref> Figs), which might be explained by differences in the sequences of the predicted QseB binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref029">29</xref>]. Therefore, the activities of the QseB/QseC and QseE/QseF TCSs appear to be well separated in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12. It even appears unlikely that QseF can receive phosphoryl-groups from any other histidine kinase than QseE <italic>in vivo</italic>, as <italic>glmY</italic> transcription from the σ<sup>54</sup>-promoter is abolished in a mutant lacking kinase QseE (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g008">8C</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref009">9</xref>]). The weak phosphorylation of the QseF receiver domain remaining detectable in the absence of QseE or QseG (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g009">9C</xref>) might result from non-physiological cross-talk as we had to overproduce the QseF-NTD in these experiments, potentially providing a sink for non-cognate phosphorylations. Alternatively, these cross-phosphorylations may not be robust as they could be removed through QseE phosphatase activity in <italic>wild-type</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Phosphatase activities of histidine kinases were shown to be crucial to prevent aberrant phosphorylations of response regulators by non-cognate kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we studied phosphorylation of QseF <italic>in vivo</italic> using metabolic [<sup>32</sup>P] labelling, which is a method usually not considered in TCS research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref054">54</xref>], albeit it allows to snapshot protein phosphorylation states in the living cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref055">55</xref>]. Using this approach, we also detected an additional phosphorylation signal for the QseF-CTD, suggesting that QseF is at least doubly phosphorylated (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">5</xref>). The C-terminal phosphorylation was also detectable by an antiserum recognizing phosphorylated Thr- and Ser-residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007547.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Meanwhile several response regulators are known to become additionally phosphorylated by Ser/Thr kinases interfering with their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref056">56</xref>]. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, two serine/threonine kinases, SrkA (a.k.a YihE) and YeaG, have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007547.ref058">58</xref>], but they are not required for phosphorylation of the QseF-CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007547.s017">S17 Fig</xref>). The source and role of this additional phosphorylation signal must be addressed in future research.</p>

<title>QseG localizes to the cell envelope in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12.</title>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain Z197 harboring either plasmid pYG191 coding for QseG-Strep (lanes 3, 4, 7, 8) or the isogenic plasmid pBGG237 encoding solely the Strep-peptide (lanes 1, 2, 5, 6) was grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with maltose to allow for synthesis of maltose binding protein (MBP a.k.a. MalE). Cells were harvested in exponential (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) and stationary growth phase (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8) and aliquots were used for preparation of total protein extracts, analyzed in lanes 1–4. The remaining cells were subjected to the TSE fractionation protocol and 6.25 μg of the resulting periplasmic extracts (lanes 5–8) were separated alongside the whole cell extracts (lanes 1–4) by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using α-Strep antiserum (top panel), α-S1 antiserum (second panel from top), α-MBP antibody (third panel from top) and by Coomassie blue staining (bottom panel).</p>

<title>Pull-down assay demonstrating that the S58N mutation in QseE decreases interaction with QseG.</title>
<p>Strain Z970 was used, which carried two compatible plasmids encoding the proteins as follows: pYG318 (QseE-3×FLAG; lanes 2, 3, 6, 7), pYG318-S58N (QseE-S58N-3×FLAG; lanes 4, 5, 8, 9), pMM10 (Strep-tag only; lanes 2, 4, 6, 8), pYG319 (QseG-Strep; lanes 3, 5, 7, 9). The various transformants were grown in 50 ml LB and expression of plasmid-borne alleles was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and 0.2% arabinose, respectively. Following 3 h growth, cultures were harvested by centrifugation and re-suspended in 3 ml lysis buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 20% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme). Cells were disrupted by one passage through a French pressure cell and the resulting lysates were cleared by centrifugation (60 min, 4°C, 20.000×g). The cleared lysates were incubated with 10 μl (5% solution) pre-equilibrated MagStrep “type3” XT beads (IBA Lifescience) for 60 min at 4°C in an end-over-end shaker. Magnetic beads were collected using a magnet and washed 4× using 500 μl buffer W each and finally re-suspended in 50 μl 1×Laemmli loading dye. 4 μl of the cleared lysates (total extracts) and 20 μl of each eluate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In lane 1, strain Z197 carrying plasmid pBGG237 was employed as negative control.</p>
