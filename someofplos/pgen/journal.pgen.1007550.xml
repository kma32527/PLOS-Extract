<abstract>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous human neurodegenerative diseases. Amongst the identified genetic causes, mutations in genes encoding motor proteins such as kinesins have been involved in various HSP clinical isoforms. Mutations in <italic>KIF1C</italic> are responsible for autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 58 (SPG58) and spastic ataxia 2 (SPAX2). Bovines also develop neurodegenerative diseases, some of them having a genetic aetiology. Bovine progressive ataxia was first described in the Charolais breed in the early 1970s in England and further cases in this breed were subsequently reported worldwide. We can now report that progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle results from a homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region of the <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene. In this study, we show that the mutation at the heterozygous state is associated with a better score for muscular development, explaining its balancing selection for several decades, and the resulting high frequency (13%) of the allele in the French Charolais breed. We demonstrate that the <italic>KIF1C</italic> bovine mutation leads to a functional knock-out, therefore mimicking mutations in humans affected by SPG58/SPAX2. The functional consequences of <italic>KIF1C</italic> loss of function in cattle were also histologically reevaluated. We showed by an immunochemistry approach that demyelinating plaques were due to altered oligodendrocyte membrane protrusion, and we highlight an abnormal accumulation of actin in the core of demyelinating plaques, which is normally concentrated at the leading edge of oligodendrocytes during axon wrapping. We also observed that the lesions were associated with abnormal extension of paranodal sections. Moreover, this model highlights the role of KIF1C protein in preserving the structural integrity and function of myelin, since the clinical signs and lesions arise in young-adult Charolais cattle. Finally, this model provides useful information for SPG58/SPAX2 disease and other demyelinating lesions.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are human neurodegenerative diseases mainly associated with lower extremity weakness and spasticity. Motor-sensory axons degeneration, implying heterogeneous cellular and molecular mechanisms and various genetic causes, is the neuropathological hallmark of this disease. Recently, mutations in <italic>KIF1C</italic> were associated with human spastic paraplegia type 58 (SPG58) and spastic ataxia 2 (SPAX2), where the radiological brain examination showed demyelination features. We report herein that progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle, a neurodegenerative disease with autosomal recessive inheritance, is caused by a substitution in the <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene, which leads to a functional knock-out. Interestingly this mutation is associated, in a heterozygous state, with a better muscular development, and thus a zootechnic advantage. Identification of the mutation will therefore be helpful to eradicate this disease. Further study of the lesions in ataxic bovine central nervous system highlighted a peculiar link to oligodendrocytes which were hypertrophied and harbored many membrane protrusions. The demyelinating plaques were enriched by these membranes and actin accumulation indicating close relationship between KIF1C, actin transport and axonal wrapping by oligodendrocyte tongues. Since <italic>kif1c</italic> knock-out mouse do not display any neurological symptoms, progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle thus provides a useful model for studying SPG58/SPAX2 and other demyelinating diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Clinically, the disease can be classified into pure or complicated forms. In the pure form of HSP, pyramidal tract signs are the clinical consequence of corticospinal axons degeneration. The complicated form of HSP is associated with neurological and extraneurological signs such as extrapyramidal manifestations, muscle weakness, sensory deficit, retinal degeneration, cognitive decline and cerebellar ataxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref001">1</xref>]. The pathological hallmark of HSP is thought to be the integrity breakdown of long axons of the upper motor neurons and of other brain structures in complex cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref003">3</xref>]. This failure is likely the result of the disruption of critical cellular mechanisms highlighted by functions of the identified causative genes and functional studies: vesicular trafficking and organelle shaping, axonal and cellular transport, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, brain development and myelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Mutations of genes encoding motor proteins, such as kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs), have been implicated in various HSP clinical isoforms. <italic>KIF5A</italic> mutations account for autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia (SPG) 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref007">7</xref>], mutations in <italic>KIF1A</italic> lead to autosomal recessive SPG30 or to autosomal dominant cases of complex HSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref009">9</xref>] and mutations in <italic>KIF1C</italic> have been found in autosomal recessive SPG58/SPAX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref013">13</xref>]. Seven unrelated HSP families from the Middle East, Turkey, North Africa and Germany have been shown to segregate with either non-sense mutations, missense mutations or deletions in <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene. Most patients share cerebellar ataxia with pyramidal signs, and, when available, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination reveals widespread T2 white matter hyperintensities, interpreted as demyelinating lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref010">10</xref>]. Pyramidal tracts and cerebellar peduncles are the most affected brain regions and this may explain the association of spastic paraplegia and cerebellar ataxia in most patients. The precise histological changes underlying these white matter lesions remain undefined since no neuropathological report of human cases is available. In addition, the <italic>kif1c</italic> knock-out mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref014">14</xref>] did not show any neurological or non-neurological manifestation, presumably because of the redundant expression of other kinesins in brain.</p>
<p>Livestock animals are also prone to develop hereditary diseases, and can provide good models for human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref015">15</xref>]. In bovines for example, due to repetitive linebreeding and the genetic bottlenecks in each breed, more than 500 traits or disorders have been described (OMIA <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://omia.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://omia.org</ext-link>). Amongst them, around 1/10 directly affect the nervous system. Causal mutations have been found for 15 of them, offering a parallel with comparable human diseases. For example, degenerative axonopathy in Tyrolean Grey cattle was found to result from a mutation in the <italic>MFN2</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref016">16</xref>], which is involved in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref017">17</xref>]. Another form of axonopathy in the Rouge-des-Prés cattle is a consequence of a mutation in <italic>SLC25A46</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref018">18</xref>], reminiscent of mutations of the homologous genes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref019">19</xref>]. Bovine spinal dysmyelination, originally present in American Brown Swiss cattle, is due to a mutation in the <italic>SPAST</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref020">20</xref>], a mutation that causes SPG4 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>However, the genetic basis for most of these hereditary diseases in livestock animals remains unclear, as was the case for progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle.</p>
<p>Progressive ataxia was first described in Charolais cattle in England in the early 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref022">22</xref>], and in the following years cases were reported in this breed worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref025">25</xref>]. Ataxia and paresis mostly involve the hind limbs. Limb incoordination progresses during the following few months, from early clinical signs, leading to permanent recumbency and ultimately to the animals having to be euthanized, as no effective treatment has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Neuropathological changes are only microscopic and are confined to the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>]. There is no peripheral nervous system alteration. Lesions consist of spread eosinophilic and acellular plaques about 20–80 μm in diameter, located within specific regions of the brain and the spinal cord, such as the cerebellar white matter and peduncles, the corpus callosum, the internal capsule and the ventral and lateral funiculi of the spinal cord. At the electron microscopy level, the lesions are composed of disordered myelin, hypertrophic and hyperplastic oligodendroglia tongues surrounded by many other cells, and are associated with nodes of Ranvier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Progressive ataxia affects purebred cattle, or crossbred animals (at least three-quarters Charolais) and affects males and females equally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref025">25</xref>]. Even if the genetic basis of this trait has been suspected for decades, its inheritance pattern was still unclear. A growing number of cases have been recorded by the French National Observatory of Genetic Diseases (ONAB <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.onab.fr/" xlink:type="simple">www.onab.fr</ext-link>) since the early 2000s, in animals sired by artificial insemination or by natural service. Identification of the genetic basis of this disease was thus needed in order to eradicate the disease in the Charolais breed.</p>
<p>Here, we report that progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle results from a homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region of the <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene, leading to a functional knock-out of this gene and therefore mimicking some of the mutations in humans. We took advantage of the existence of this natural model, firstly to determine the cytological process of the demyelination lesions associated with <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation and, secondly, to provide an animal model to study spastic ataxia failure. Furthermore, our findings highlight the role of KIF1C protein in preserving the structural integrity and function of myelin and this model will provide useful information for other demyelinating diseases.</p>

<title>Clinical summary</title>
<p>Seventy-one Charolais animals of both sexes presenting progressive ataxia symptoms as described in the literature: i.e. unsteady gait and stiff hind limbs, with a gradual worsening of the symptoms ultimately resulting in permanent decubitus, and irregular and “spastic” micturition in most of the females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref026">26</xref>], were recorded over a period of 10 years by the French National Observatory of Genetic Diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The first symptoms appeared around age 18–24 months, but younger (as early as 6 months of age) as well as older cases (up to 5 years of age) were also observed. Evolution was highly variable, from a few weeks to more than 18 months. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological study for 10 cases for which nervous tissues were available. Pedigree analysis was undertaken using available data; unfortunately, some information was missing for cases bred by natural service or for some of the earliest recorded cases. This analysis was consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance and involved a predominant founder ancestor, a bull born in 1964 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This bull was a high contributor to the Charolais breed.</p>

<title>A missense variant in the <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene is associated with progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle</title>
<p>Genotyping of 46 suspected cases was done using the Illumina bovine 50K SNP chip (including 8 cases confirmed by histopathological analysis) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s008">S1 Table</xref>), followed by homozygosity mapping and haplotype analysis identified a single homozygous interval on bovine chromosome 19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) shared by 41 animals. The minimal common interval was 681 kb long (chr19: 26848700–27529700), and contained more than 40 genes as predicted in the Ensembl database. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on two affected animals (aged 31 and 36 months), and one wild type (WT) animal. Sequence analysis focused on this interval on chromosome 19. The detected polymorphisms (SNP and small indels) were then filtered in several steps. First, affected cattle had to be homozygous for the causative variant, while the phenotypically WT cattle had to bear at least one WT allele. Second, since this mutation is supposedly specific to the Charolais breed, polymorphisms were discarded if they were already present in the dbSNP database and/or in the Illumina SNP chip. Finally, polymorphisms were filtered according to their predicted effects on transcript and/or protein, based on the hypothesis that this mutation is deleterious (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007550.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The only remaining putative causal SNP was a single substitution in exon 5 of <italic>KIF1C</italic> (chr19:27041449 C/T). For easier comprehension and since <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene in cattle is on the reverse strand, the substitution will be referred as <italic>KIF1C</italic> G&gt;A in order to match with the transcription sense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The G&gt;A substitution was further tested (Sanger sequencing) on 143 Charolais animals, including 70 of the 71 cases suspected of progressive ataxia for which DNA was available. All 41 genotyped cases bearing the 681-kb homozygous interval and 19 non-genotyped cases were homozygous for the G&gt;A variant, and all their parents were heterozygous. On the contrary, the 5 genotyped cases that did not bear the homozygous chromosome 19 haplotype and 5 non-genotyped cases were either heterozygous or homozygous for the WT allele. These cases were either very young (#32, #59, #60) or old (#22, #33, #34) with a very slow progression of the disease (#67) which differs from the “classical” ataxic phenotype, suggesting different genetic origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s008">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, most of the suspected ataxia cases (60/70) were homozygous for the <italic>KIF1C</italic> G&gt;A substitution, including the histopathologically confirmed cases.</p>
<p>The other 10 cases were either heterozygous for this mutation or WT, which indicates the possibility of other neurodegenerative syndromes in the Charolais breed, especially because the analysis of the genotypes in these cases was not concordant with the defined genetic interval.</p>
<p>The polymorphism was then inserted in a bovine custom SNP chip, and tested on animals from 7 French breeds, including the Charolais breed. The frequency of the <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation was estimated to be around 13% in the Charolais breed. The mutation was not found in other breeds, except 3 heterozygous cases in the Blonde d’Aquitaine breed, which has Charolais blood in its ancestry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007550.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>The missense variant in the <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene is associated with growth and morphology traits in the Charolais breed</title>
<p>Taking account of the relatively high frequency of the <italic>KIF1C</italic> substitution in the Charolais breed, we then sought to determine whether it was associated with production traits in this breed. In a sample of 3300 Charolais animals from the French commercial population, the number of homozygous mutated individuals represented about 1.1% of the samples for young animals at 7 months and slightly below 1% at 24 months, whereas no homozygous case was observed at 30 months of age. Accordingly, the mutated allele frequency was around 13% up to 24 months of age and decreased to 12% at 30 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007550.t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

The effects of the mutant allele represented 2 to 2.6% of the mean and 17–28% of the phenotypic standard deviation. Thus, the high frequency of the allele responsible for ataxia may be at least partially attributed to selection on beef traits.

<title>The <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation results in loss of function</title>
<p>The <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene, which is relatively conserved in mammals, encodes a microtubule-based motor protein belonging to the kinesin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref027">27</xref>] (respectively 1103 and 1105 amino acids long in human and bovine). This protein harbours an N-terminal kinesin motor domain, a central kinesin associated domain and a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref014">14</xref>]. The G&gt;A <italic>KIF1C</italic> substitution leads to the replacement of an arginine by a glutamine (p.Arg203Gln), within the kinesin motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This amino acid is highly conserved across evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Based on PROVEAN prediction software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref028">28</xref>], this substitution is expected to be deleterious and affects the function of KIF1C (score = -3.822). Moreover, the substitution affects the last nucleotide of exon 5, thus exon splicing is predicted to be impaired, inducing a reduction in the predicted splice score, which dropped from 7.8 to 4.8 when analysed with Splice Site Score Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rulai.cshl.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://rulai.cshl.edu</ext-link>). The result of analysis with ESE-finder software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref029">29</xref>] suggests that the mutation may also modify exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs at the junction between exons 5 and 6, which would alter the affinity with several serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>KIF1C</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in human and in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref027">27</xref>]. <italic>KIF1C</italic> mRNA expression was studied in affected and WT bovine brains, as this organ, together with lymph nodes, is known to present the main histological alterations in our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>]. Using primers spanning the mutation (i.e. amplifying exons 1 to 11), we showed that contrary to WT animals, affected ones could display two transcripts: a hardly detectable full-length transcript, visible in one affected case (same size as expected), and a shorter transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). After sequencing, the full-length transcript was shown to bear the G&gt;A substitution. The shorter transcript resulted from abnormal splicing and its exon 5 was skipped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), leading to a premature stop codon at position 204 (p.RT203-204QStop). Transcripts were less abundant in affected cases than in WT, probably also resulting from mRNA decay. The low mRNA quantity was confirmed with the amplification of exons 13 to 20, downstream of the mutation, with less abundant transcripts (&lt;50%) in affected animals than in WT.</p>

As expected based on the mRNA expression level, KIF1C protein was undetectable in affected animals, either at the expected size as in WT animals and HeLa cell extracts (145 kDa) or at a lower size, as the transcript resulting from exon 5 skipping encodes a 151 amino acids truncated protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

Immediately around the centre, there are many myelinic and amyelinic processes, some of which are degenerated. The last “ring” is composed of many surrounding cells (<italic>white arrows</italic>) and complete the white matter lesion.

<title>Cellular and subcellular component of the lesions</title>
<p>The core of lesions did not contain cellular nuclei, but was often surrounded by cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). At the EM level, the cytological characteristics of some of these cells suggested they were astrocytes, microglia or oligodendrocytes.

First, markers against lymphocytes T (CD3 marker) did not reveal their presence in the vicinity of lesions or in other brain regions.</p>

<p>The oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP) antibody, marker of oligodendroglial cells membrane, gave relevant immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Plasma membrane of oligodendrocytes as well as the core of the plaques were labelled, indicating that the membranous structures of the core of plaque, observed at the ultrastructural analysis, was mainly formed by oligodendrocyte cell membranes. The anti MBP (myelin basic protein) marker of myelinic membrane, also showed no normal myelinic fibre staining in plaques. However, much cellular MBP-positive debris was observed thus confirming the demyelinating nature of these plaques. Double immunostaining clearly revealed the presence of the two antigens (MBP [red], OSP [green]) in the plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the core of plaques is also composed of vesicles and fibrillary and amorphous material, we used antibodies directed against cytoskeleton proteins (neurofilament, microtubule, actin), but only antibody directed against actin, crossed with bovine protein and evidenced aggregates in cells surrounding the core of plaques. Some of the cells, according to their localization and the size of their nucleus, could be tentatively identified as oligodendrocytes. More interestingly, the centre of plaques was also uniformly immunostained.

<title>Abnormal extension of paranodal sections</title>
<p>Since oligodendroglial changes were also accompanied with an increased length of the paranodal section and nodes of Ranvier and accumulations of osmiophilic and membranous structures facing the node of Ranvier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref023">23</xref>], we characterized these structural modifications by using anti Caspr/paranodin as a marker of the paranodal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>).

Most of the nodes of Ranvier had normal structures, reminiscent of those in the brain of non-affected animals. However, in the plaque or in its vicinity, the length of paranodal immunostaining was greater (16+/-0.8 μm, range 8.3–38.7 μm n = 570 nodes) and up to four times the length in WT animals (3.9+/-0.6μm, range 1.5–6 μm, n = 155 nodes) or outside the plaques in affected animals (2.1+/-0.7 μm, range 0.6–6.1 μm, n = 194) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007550.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>KIF1C</italic> loss of function accounts for progressive ataxia in Charolais cattle</title>
<p>We gathered a series of cases of suspected progressive ataxia in animals of the Charolais breed.</p>
<p>Using a combination of next generation sequencing and whole genome SNP analysis, we determined that in the majority of cases with this phenotype, the disease is caused by a single substitution, c.608G&gt;A, in the <italic>KIF1C</italic> gene. This substitution has two effects: firstly, it modifies a conserved amino acid (p.R203Q). Secondly, it causes an alternative splicing event, resulting in exon 5 skipping in most of the transcripts (p.RT203-204QStop) associated with a drastic reduction of overall mRNA expression and leading to the absence of detectable KIF1C protein in brain extracts from affected cattle.</p>
<p><italic>KIF1C</italic> human gene mutations, including nonsense, missense, splicing or frame shift types, were mainly localized in the kinesin motor domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref032">32</xref>], but coiled-coil, PTDP1 and FHA domains were also affected by deletion or missense mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The majority of the known mutations, localized in the microtubule-based motor domain disturb adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis of the microtubule. It was clearly demonstrated that the Arg301Gly mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref032">32</xref>], for example, reduce microtubule binding affinity of KIF1C, and transports rates consequently. The mutation in Charolais cattle, also localized in the motor domain. It is leading, however, to the total absence of protein and contrary to KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref014">14</xref>], this absence was pathogenic.</p>
<p>Progressive ataxia in cattle was described in the 1970s in the Charolais breed, and the mutation now segregates with a high frequency in the present Charolais population (13%). Association studies in the studied cohort showed that this mutation is positively correlated with better scores in muscular development at weaning (p&lt;0.01), weaning weight at 7 months (p&lt;0.05), weight at 24 months (p&lt; 0.05) and skeletal development at 30 months (p&lt;0.05). These production traits have been positively selected in Charolais cattle for several decades and it is then tempting to postulate that the <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation may have been selected with a hitch-hiking effect concomitantly with a close beneficial mutation for the Charolais breed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may play a direct role in muscular development and lead to a positive effect–at least at the heterozygous state–on muscular growth. Charolais cattle, like other beef cattle, are selected for their potential for muscular growth, and in theory this selection could affect muscle characteristics themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref034">34</xref>]. This hypothesis was strengthened by a recent study showing that KIF1C, alongside other microtubule motors, is involved in muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref035">35</xref>]. The effect of the <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation in bovine muscle has yet to be assessed but <italic>kif1c</italic> knocking down by siRNA in C2C12 rodent muscle cells affects nucleus dynamics and number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref035">35</xref>]. Interestingly, other data show a higher expression level of KIF1C in bovine muscles compared to the other tissues (InnateDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.innatedb.com/" xlink:type="simple">www.innatedb.com</ext-link>). Our findings demonstrate that <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation lead to the absence of protein, thus the heterozygous state should conduct to the lower expression levels compared to the homozygous state. Such knock-down has been associated with higher muscle development for other genes preferentially expressed in this tissue, namely <italic>GDF8</italic> gene, encoding Myostatin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, genetically different ‘progressive ataxia-like diseases’ are expected to segregate in the Charolais breed as 10/70 of the cases were not explained by mutations in <italic>KIF1C</italic>. We cannot exclude the possibility that deep intronic mutations may be involved in these negative cases or that mutations in other genes are also responsible for this kind of phenotype.</p>

<title>Bovine progressive ataxia is the first animal model for SPG58/SPAX2</title>
<p>The first clinical signs observed in <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutated bovine were often an ataxic gait associated with weakness of the hind limbs, reminiscent of spasticity, which progressed slowly to the typical phenotype of spastic ataxia and ultimately led to recumbency. In humans, <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutations account for spastic ataxia SPAX2 or complex hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref013">13</xref>]. The phenotype in patients is heterogeneous, associating spasticity and in some instance ataxia, thus resembling to the phenotype observed in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>SPG58/SPAX2 patients present signs of widespread demyelination on neurophysiological examination and brain MRI (T2 hyperintensities), sometimes accompanied by a mild cerebellar atrophy. MRI signs of demyelination involved many tracts (e.g. corpus callosum, internal capsule, occipital white matter, cerebellum and the brainstem), as it is generally the case for HSPs, even if the corticospinal tract degeneration appears to be pivotal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref039">39</xref>]. However, up to now, no histopathological study has been reported for SPG58/SPAX2.</p>
<p>The histopathological study was performed in bovine spinal cord to precise the anatomical counterpart for spasticity. In affected cattle, the topographic distribution of white matter lesions in spinal cord is not restricted to the corticospinal tracts as it is the case for human spastic paraplegia. Indeed, other descending and even ascending tracts, except the medial part of ventral white matter, are affected. This could be due to the anatomical differences between the spinal cords of human and quadruped animals where the corticospinal tracts are not fully lateralized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref040">40</xref>]. Even so, this peculiar topographic distribution could explain the spasticity in cattle.</p>
<p>Contrarily, <italic>kif1c</italic> knock-out mice do not present any neurological symptom up to 18 months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref014">14</xref>]. This unexpected discrepancy could be explained by a functional redundancy with other proteins in this species.</p>
<p>Thus, ataxic bovine can be considered as the first and natural animal model for human SPG58/SPAX2.</p>

<title>Bovine progressive ataxia as a peculiar demyelinating disorder</title>
<p>The rare publications of HSP human cases have mainly dealt with the characterisation of neuronal death and proposed an axonal dying back mechanism as the pathological explanation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref030">30</xref>]. However, other mechanisms participating in the neuronal death may exist and demyelination might be one of them as it has been involved in HSP demyelinating or defective myelination entities such as SPG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref041">41</xref>] and SPG2/Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study provides further details of the unusual nature of the lesions in ataxic bovines: primary oligodendrocyte hypertrophy and tongue protrusion result in demyelination and the disease could tentatively be considered as a cell autonomous oligodendroglial disease. Hypertrophy of oligodendrocytes precedes demyelination in several conditions, such as the viral demyelinating disease progressive multifocal encephalopathy, where the nucleus and cytoplasm hypertrophy of oligodendrocytes is due to JC virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref043">43</xref>]. Compared to other demyelinating diseases, the ataxic lesions are also smaller in size and more diffuse, with a predominance in the spinal cord, internal capsule and cerebellum. Moreover, no associated inflammatory process was observed in ataxic bovines, which is unusual as it is central to the pathological process in other demyelinating disorders such as MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref044">44</xref>]. In addition, the demyelination process does not result from abnormal brain development, since the majority of affected animals developed the first clinical signs when aged around 18 months, with some rare cases at around 8 months, largely after the myelinating process had finished in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref045">45</xref>]. Consequently, demyelinating lesions in ataxic bovine differ largely from any other known demyelinating disease.</p>

<title>Nodal and paranodal sections involvment</title>
<p>Both myelin sheath attachment to axon and saltatory impulse conduction depend on nodal, paranodal and juxtaparanodal protein expression and proper subcellular targeting. The axonal glycoprotein contactin-associated protein (Caspr/paranodin) was used as a marker to explore the paranodal junction. Caspr is a protein highly enriched in paranodal sections of myelinated axons in central and peripheral nervous system, more particularly located in a region where the paranodal myelin loops adhere to the axonal plasma membrane and form a physical barrier between the nodal Na+ (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels and the juxtaparanodal K+ (K<sub>v</sub>) channels. We found a significant elongation of Caspr/paranodin-positive stretches in demyelinating plaques. Naked nerve fibres with stretches of Caspr were often found in the plaque and its vicinity, suggesting that Caspr persists for some time after demyelination. The increase in Caspr/paranodin-positive region length has variously been interpreted as evidence of remyelination in experimental animal models of demyelination/remyelination following nodal Na<sub>v</sub> channel protein and then after K<sub>v</sub> channel protein accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref047">47</xref>]. On the other hand, diffuse nodal and paranodal proteins Na<sub>v</sub>, K<sub>v</sub> channel, Caspr/paranodin and Caspr2 were reported to be distributed along denuded axons and this was considered to be an early event of the demyelinating plaques in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref048">48</xref>]. The absence of specific antibodies directed against juxtaparanodal Na<sub>v</sub> and K<sub>v</sub> channel proteins in cattle brain prevents us from exploring these hypotheses in this natural model of demyelinating disease. The significance of the difference in Caspr/paranodin-positive segment lengths in non-demyelinating regions between affected and control cattle brain remains obscure but alteration of this critical region is likely to have functional consequences on neurons.</p>

<title>Pathological mechanisms resulting from <italic>KIF1C</italic> loss of function</title>
<p>Kinesin superfamily include more than 45 members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref049">49</xref>], at least half of them being expressed in neuronal cells and most of them ubiquitously expressed. KIFs are major molecular motors of microtubule-based intracellular transport, and play a major role as stabilizers and depolymerizers of microtubules. These activities are important for cell division, cellular morphogenesis and mammalian development. Mutations in genes coding for several KIF proteins have already been associated with neurological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref050">50</xref>]. <italic>KIF1C</italic>, as a member of the kinesin-3 family which includes <italic>Unc104/KIF1A</italic>, <italic>KIF1B</italic>, <italic>KIF14</italic> and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref051">51</xref>], was initially reported to participate in transport of proteins from Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref027">27</xref>], even if mice deficient for KIF1C exhibit no apparent cellular abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref014">14</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that KIF1C transports Rab6 vesicles and can influence the Golgi complex structure, since its knock down slows the protein transfer to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>The accumulation of membranous structures we observed in oligodendrocytes and in the centre of plaques in affected cattle could be a consequence of the perturbation of myelin membrane dynamics and/or trafficking. Similarly, a function of KIF1C in membrane dynamics, in association with microtubules, was demonstrated in podosome turnover in human macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref054">54</xref>] and vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref055">55</xref>]. The absence of KIF1C led to podosome deficiency. Protein interaction studies have shown that KIF1C binds to non-muscle myosin IIA, providing an interface between the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton which facilitates podosome dynamics in a subcellular fine-tuned manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref053">53</xref>]. As the F-actin filament network is necessary for myelin wrapping of axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007550.ref056">56</xref>], it can be hypothesized that <italic>KIF1C</italic> loss of function alters membrane trafficking and membrane wrapping in oligodendrocytes along axons, as evidenced by the accumulation of actin in the plaques and in surrounding oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007550.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified the mutation causing progressive ataxia in cattle. This will be helpful for the Charolais breed in order to eradicate this disease, in France and worldwide, since this breed has been extensively exported. Loss of function of <italic>KIF1C</italic> is the source of a demyelination process that may explain the phenotype observed in animals that mimics spastic ataxia SPG58 in humans. As the mouse knock-out model does not develop a neurological phenotype, <italic>KIF1C</italic>-mutated cattle represent the unique natural model of SPG58 human pathology.</p>

The measurements were performed on images obtained by NanoZoomer 2.O-RS (Hamamatsu) apotome equipped with 20X and 40X objectives or a Leica DM400B optical microscope equipped with 40X, 63X and 100X objectives, according to the chromogen used, respectively fluoroscein, CY3 or DAB. Images acquired from epifluorescence or light microscope were superimposed using ImageJ. The length of paranodin immunostaining was measured inside and outside the plaque in affected and control tissues; the lengths were compared using a variance analysis with Anova.</p>

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Brain samples from affected case #55 including the cerebellum, internal capsule and spinal cord were further processed for 24-h fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde for conventional electron microscopy study. After post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide, blocks were embedded in Araldite. Semi-thin sections about 0.5 μm thick were stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a Hitachi HT 7700 electron microscope (Elexience, Verrières-le-Buisson, France).</p>

<p>(A) Kluver-Barrera (KB) staining of frontal section of cerebellar folia; WML, white matter; GCL, granule cell; PCL, Purkinje cells; ML, molecular layers. White matter in longitudinal section strewn with plaques of myelin pallor (<italic>red asterisks</italic>). The demyelinating plaques were often confluent (<italic>lined up red asterisks</italic>). The shape of the lesions is often ovoid and their size variable from 10 to 80 μm in diameter. These lesions were seen in all studied myelin tracts (cerebellum, corpus callosum, internal capsule, spinal cord and bulbar tracts). (B) Several plaques of various shapes and diameters in cerebellar white matter. Plaques are slightly eosinophilic; paraffin-embedded section and Hemalun-Eosin-Safran staining. (C) Cervical spinal cord on frontal section KB stained, some neuronal fibres seem to by-pass the myelin pallor plaques, the centre of some of which contains material stained by the lipophilic KB talc. (D) Sudan black staining of longitudinal section of demyelinating plaque in internal capsule showing lipidic granules and cellular debris in the centre (<italic>arrows</italic>) and also staining of axons on the periphery and crossing stack (<italic>arrow head</italic>). (E) Neural fibres of cerebellar white matter stained by calbindin antibody showed that stacks are by-passed by some of them (<italic>arrow</italic>). However, some nervous fibres could pass through the stack. Scale bar: (A) 200 μm, (B) and (C) 100 μm, (D) 30 μm, (E) 80 μm.</p>

<title>Hypothesis of pathological mechanism in bovine progressive ataxia cases, resulting from the <italic>KIF1C</italic> mutation.</title>
<p>Oligodendrocytes wrap their plasma membrane around axons and then generate multi-lamellar sheaths of myelin. The leading edge protrusion of oligodendrocytes and its repetitive rotational movement depends on the strength of F-actin turnover. This mechanism may explain early myelination processes. The molecular mechanism driving the maintenance of myelination in the adult is not well known but a similar mechanism could operate. In <italic>KIF1C</italic>-mutated Charolais cattle the absence of KIF1C, which transports G-actin along microtubules towards peripheral processes and the leading edge, the cellular distribution of actin was perturbed in oligodendrocytes, and the sick cell could not maintain the myelin sheaths surrounding axons.</p>
