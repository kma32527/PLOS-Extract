<abstract>
<p>The mTOR signaling pathways regulate cell growth and are involved in multiple human diseases. Here, we identify <italic>UBTOR</italic>, a previously unannotated gene as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. Reduction of UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth. UBTOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and promotes cell growth, whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Studies in cultured cells and zebrafish model show that UBTOR inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR complex component DEPTOR, and <italic>ubtor</italic> gene disruption result in higher mTOR activity and aggravate HRAS(G12V) induced neoplasia in the zebrafish. Lastly, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. Together, our results demonstrate how UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cell growth is a fundamental aspect of cell behavior in all organisms. The mTOR signaling pathways are essential for cell growth and clinically mis-regulation of the mTOR pathways are implicated in human diseases including tumor formation, obesity, epilepsy, autism and neurodegeneration. Here, we identify a novel gene, <italic>Ubtor</italic> as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. Inhibiting <italic>Ubtor</italic> function promotes cell growth in neurons and cancer cells. Increasing <italic>Ubtor</italic> function reduces cancer cell growth. Functional analyses in human cells and the zebrafish model indicate <italic>Ubtor</italic> inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR complex component DEPTOR, and <italic>ubtor</italic> gene disruption resulted in higher mTOR activity and aggravated cancer formation in the zebrafish. UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft-bearing mice. Thus our study provide evidence that <italic>Ubtor</italic> constitutes a novel negative feedback mechanism to control mTOR signaling and cell growth, and manipulations of Ubtor function may potentially be utilized to optimize mTOR signaling activities for treatments of cancers and other diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a central pathway that controls cell metabolism, growth, proliferation and survival. Clinically the mTOR pathway is implicated in human diseases including tumor formation, obesity, epilepsy, autism and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>mTOR signaling activity is regulated by various factors at multiple cellular organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref004">4</xref>]. The central catalytic protein mTOR forms two complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 through interactions with a number of proteins. These mTOR interacting proteins exert important regulatory roles on mTOR activity. A protein of interest is DEPTOR, a component of both mTOR complexes and an inhibitor of mTOR signaling found only in the vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref005">5</xref>]. DEPTOR is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated when mTORC1 signaling pathway is activated by serum stimulation, which subsequently results in its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we identify <italic>Ubtor</italic> as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. <italic>Ubtor</italic> is a vertebrate-specific, previously unannotated gene except being listed as a downregulated or mutated gene in tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref011">11</xref>]. <italic>Ubtor</italic> encodes a protein without any known functional domains. We first show reductions of Ubtor expression levels in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promote neurite outgrowth. In addition, UBTOR depletion promotes cell growth in HEK293T and U87MG cells, whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in HEK293T and T24 cells. We next show reduction of Ubtor promotes mTOR signaling. Mechanistic studies in cultured cells show UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes. Further studies show UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR and regulates DEPTOR’s ubiquitination. Lastly, <italic>ubtor</italic> gene disruption in zebrafish increases mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS(G12V) induced neoplasia in the intact animals. In parallel, Ubtor depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft-bearing mice. Together, our results demonstrate how Ubtor regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.</p>

<title>Ubtor depletion promotes neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells</title>
<p><italic>kiaa1024/ubtor</italic> was identified in a zebrafish enhancer-trap screen aimed to isolate genes with expression in the central nervous system (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). It was an unannotated gene and present in the vertebrate species only. In situ hybridization results showed <italic>ubtor</italic> was expressed in the brain and spinal cord in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). RT-PCR results showed <italic>ubtor</italic> was additionally expressed in other tissues including internal organs in the zebrafish. Based on expression data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref012">12</xref>] and the GENSAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref013">13</xref>], <italic>Ubtor</italic> gene expression patterns in the nervous system appeared conserved between the zebrafish and the mouse.</p>
<p>To investigate the function of <italic>Ubtor</italic>, we examined neurite outgrowth in rat primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Fluorescence dye Cy3 labeled small interference RNA (Cy3-siRNA) was transfected into the dissociated hippocampal neurons to knock down <italic>Ubtor</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and the outgrowth of the neurites were revealed by acetylated tubulin stain and measured at 36 hours post in vitro culture (HIV) and 56 HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). The results showed the neurite outgrowth length was almost twice long in <italic>Ubtor</italic> knock-down hippocampal neurons compared with neurons transfected with control siRNA at 36 HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Longer neurite outgrowth length was also observed in <italic>Ubtor</italic> knock-down hippocampal neurons at 56 HIV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Ubtor depletion promotes mTOR signaling</title>
<p>In PC12 cells, NGF mainly acts through TrkA receptor to promote neurite outgrowth. Activated TrkA receptor functions through two major downstream signaling pathways: Ras-MAPK and PI3K pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref018">18</xref>].

<p>One important downstream target of PI3K is the mTOR complex.

One or 3 hours after NGF was added, the p-S6 levels were increased in both the <italic>Ubtor</italic> knock-down and control cells, with higher levels in the <italic>Ubtor</italic> knock-down cells. With longer NGF treatment at 6 hours and 12 hours, the p-S6 level decreased in control cells, while in <italic>Ubtor</italic> knock-down cells the high p-S6 level was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>).

<p>We investigated whether UBTOR interacted with the mTOR complex. We first co-transfected HeLa cells with tagged UBTOR and mTOR components and examined their subcellular co-localization. Under basal growth condition, UBTOR co-localized with exogenously expressed DEPTOR, RPTOR, and MLST8 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We next validated an antibody that recognized endogenous mTOR protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). We found upon serum stimulation or treatment of phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a chemical activator of mTORC1 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref020">20</xref>], co-localization between UBTOR and endogenous mTOR was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We further examined UBTOR-mTOR complex interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. Under basal growth condition, FLAG-tagged UBTOR co-precipitated with endogenously expressed DEPTOR protein, but not other components of mTOR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Reciprocally, exogenously-expressed DEPTOR co-immunoprecipitated with endogenously expressed UBTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, when PAO was added to activate mTOR signaling, UBTOR co-immunopreciptations with endogenous DEPTOR, mTOR, RPTOR and MLST8 were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Finally, we found the N terminal region of UBTOR (UBTOR<sup>1-467</sup>) strongly immunoprecipitated with endogenous DEPTOR under basal growth condition, and PAO treatment enhanced interactions between UBTOR<sup>1-467</sup> and components of mTOR complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

<title>UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR by regulating its ubiquitination level</title>
<p>DEPTOR is an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref021">21</xref>]. DEPTOR is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated when mTOR signaling pathway is activated by serum stimulation, which results in its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref008">8</xref>]. In the PC12 cells, the expression level of DEPTOR was reduced by 40% after 6 hours treatment of NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), consistent with degradation of DEPTOR caused by mTOR activation. Compare with the 40% reduction in the control cells, when UBTOR level was knocked down, the expression level of DEPTOR was reduced more than five-fold before and throughout the NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Thus, these marked reductions in UBTOR knockdown cells could not solely be due to mTOR signaling activation and subsequent DEPTOR degradation. Alternatively, UBTOR might stabilize DEPTOR by its direct interaction with DEPTOR. In agreement with UBTOR’s stabilization effect on DEPTOR, knockdown of UBTOR in HEK293T cells caused significant reduction of DEPTOR under basal growth condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To further examine this issue, we transiently expressed DEPTOR in HEK293T cells and found when UBTOR was co-expressed with DEPTOR, DEPTOR’s expression level was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The transmembrane domain of UBTOR (Δ896–916) was dispensable for the stabilization effect on DEPTOR, whilst further deletion into the C terminal region of UBTOR protein (Δ852–916) abrogated this stabilization effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). As expected, the UBTOR<sup>1-467</sup> N terminal region was required for the full stabilization effects of DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), because UBTOR<sup>1-467</sup> interacted with DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

<title><italic>ubtor</italic> mutation elevates mTOR signaling and aggravates neoplasia in vivo</title>
<p>To investigate Ubtor’s functions in intact animals, <italic>ubtor</italic> gene was disrupted in zebrafish by TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). The targeted gene disruption resulted in frame-shift and multiple stop codons in the Ubtor coding sequence. Thus no functional Ubtor protein could be made in the homozygous mutant. The homozygous <italic>ubtor</italic> mutant had no gross developmental abnormalities. They were of similar sizes as their wild type siblings and were fertile under standard raising and maintaining conditions. Results from behavior tests showed <italic>ubtor</italic> mutant had enhanced fear-evoked freezing and compromised C-start responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), suggesting <italic>ubtor</italic> mutation had subtle but significant effects on neurodevelopment and animal physiology.</p>
<p>To determine if UBTOR’s regulation of mTOR signaling also occur in intact animals, we examined p-S6K levels in <italic>ubtor</italic> mutant and control larvae at 5 dpf, and found p-S6K was increased approximately 4-fold in the brains of <italic>ubtor</italic> mutant compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). To further examine the effects of <italic>ubtor</italic> mutation on the mTOR signaling, zebrafish of 13.5 dpf were fasted for 12 hours to down-regulate, then refed with ample food for 12 hours to activate the mTOR activities. The brain tissues of fasted and fed zebrafish were analyzed for the levels of p-S6K and p-S6. Similar to results in rodents, food-deprivation reduced the levels of p-S6K and p-S6, and feeding restored those phosphorylation levels. The <italic>ubtor</italic> mutation caused significantly higher levels of p-S6K and p-S6 in the fasted animals, and significantly higher p-S6 levels in the refed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007583.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Thus, <italic>ubtor</italic> mutation caused significant upregulation of the mTOR signaling in the intact animals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, UBTOR depletion promotes neurite and cellular growth, whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies in cultured cells revealed UBTOR stabilized DEPTOR, a component of the mTOR complexes, to inhibit the mTOR signaling. Investigations in the zebrafish model further showed disruption of <italic>ubtor</italic> gene upregulated the mTOR signaling and promoted HRAS(G12V) mediated tumor formation in intact animals. Similarly, UBTOR depletion promoted tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. These findings demonstrate how Ubtor regulates cellular growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.</p>
<p><italic>Ubtor</italic> is an unannotated gene and present in the vertebrate species only. It encodes a protein without any known functional domains despite of exhaustive sequence homology-based searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref025">25</xref>]. Ubtor protein is highly conserved in the vertebrates, with the shark protein shares 55% identities with the human protein. Searches of protein prediction servers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref027">27</xref>] and protein-protein interaction databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref028">28</xref>] provided no clues into the function of Ubtor protein. No previous studies have indicated the function of the <italic>Ubtor</italic> gene or protein product, except that <italic>UBTOR</italic> gene was listed as one of the top down-regulated genes in adrenocortical adenoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref010">10</xref>], and a top-ranked mutated gene in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref011">11</xref>]. Expression analyses of human tumor samples also indicated <italic>UBTOR</italic> was markedly downregulated in adrenocortical cancer, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, and glioma. The present study highlights Ubtor’s functions in the cellular growth and the mTOR signaling. Abnormal activation of the mTOR signaling may provide explanation why <italic>UBTOR</italic> is downregulated or mutated in tumor tissues. Consistent with this view, our results show <italic>UBTOR</italic> knock-down promote growth in HEK293T and U87MG cells, and overexpression of <italic>UBTOR</italic> reduced colony formation in both the HEK293T cells and the carcinoma T24 cells. Enhancement of HRASG12V mediated tumor formation in the homozygous <italic>ubtor</italic> zebrafish mutant and larger xenograft tumor growth of UBOTR-depleted U87MG cells in the nude mice further support involvement of <italic>Ubtor</italic> in neoplasia. Interestingly, we show that NGF treatment in PC12 cells upregulate <italic>Ubtor</italic> expression. The induction of higher <italic>Ubtor</italic> expressions levels upon mTOR signaling activation may keep the mTOR signaling activity in check. Thus, <italic>Ubtor</italic> constitutes a novel negative feedback mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref031">31</xref>] to control mTOR signaling.</p>
<p>mTOR signaling activity is tightly regulated by various interacting proteins of the catalytic mTOR protein. DEPTOR is an integral component of both mTOC complexes and it functions an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling. Previous studies show that DEPTOR is ubiquitylated when mTOR signaling pathway is activated, which results in its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref008">8</xref>]. Our results show that UBTOR reduces ubiquitination of DEPTOR and stabilizes DEPTOR expression levels. Because the N terminal UBTOR<sup>1-467</sup> binds to DEPTOR, a parsimonious model may indicate UBTOR is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). Standard sequence-based homology searches fail to reveal an existence of DUB domain or any other functional domains in the UBTOR protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref023">23</xref>], neither do other specialized methods meant to detect remote homologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref025">25</xref>]. However, the primary sequences of DUB are diverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref033">33</xref>]. Future studies will be required to determine if DUBTOR harbors deubiquitinating activity, or other mechanisms such as interference with the DEPTOR E3 ligase SCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref034">34</xref>] or trapping of mTOR complexes on the endoplasmic reticulum are involved.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides insights into how <italic>Ubtor</italic> regulate cellular growth and mTOR signaling. Manipulations of Ubtor function may potentially be utilized to optimize mTOR signaling activities for treatments of cancers and other diseases.</p>

Lines used in this study include AB, Tg(UAS:EGFP), Tg(<italic>ubtor</italic>:GAL4FF), and <italic>ubtor</italic> mutant.

A mixture of the enhancer-trap vector and Tol2 transposase mRNA was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos. Transgenic founder fish were identified and selected based on EGFP expression patterns after crossing the injected fish with a Tg(UAS:EGFP) reporter line. Transgenic founder fish were outcrossed with the AB line for three generations before high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref039">39</xref>] was used to map the genomic insertion site of the enhancer trap vector. In the Tg(<italic>ubtor</italic>:GAL4FF) line, the enhancer-trap vector was mapped to the second intron of an uncharacterized gene on chromosome 7, which was subsequently named <italic>ubtor</italic> as results showed its protein product regulated protein <underline>ub</underline>iquitination and m<underline>TOR</underline> signaling. The mammalian Kiaa1024/Ubtor gene has two orthologs in the zebrafish genome. The trapped ortholog on chromosome 7 has a higher sequence identity to the mammalian sequences and was named <italic>ubtora</italic> (59% identity to the human protein sequence). The other ortholog on chromosome 18 was named <italic>ubtorb</italic> (26% identity to the human protein sequence). In situ hybridization results showed the <italic>ubtorb</italic> gene was transiently expressed in the Rohn-Beard cells between 24 and 72 hpf, and in a few cells in the trigeminal region after 72 hpf. Thus, it was unlikely to play significant roles in experiments in this study. To simplify the descriptions, the zebrafish <italic>ubtora</italic> gene was referred to as <italic>ubtor</italic> throughout this manuscript. To disrupt the <italic>ubtor</italic> gene in the zebrafish, three lesions were introduced into the zebrafish genome via the TALEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007583.ref040">40</xref>] and CRSPR/Cas9 mediated targeted gene modifications (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s008">S1 Table</xref> for target site sequences and lesion information). This produced a 7-base deletion at position 22, a 10-base deletion at position 1319, and a 7-base insertion at position 1989 into the coding sequence of <italic>ubtor</italic>. These three frame-shift mutations introduced multiple stop codons to the Ubtor coding sequence. Thus, no functional protein product can be made in the homozygous mutant. This <italic>ubtor</italic> mutant line (<italic>ubtor</italic><sup><italic>d10</italic></sup>) was outcrossed with the AB line for 5 generations and then used in this study.</p>

Free-moving zebrafish received a 0.2 sec 0.8V/cm electric shock whenever it entered the visual conditioned side of the tank and lingered for more than 0.5 sec.

The conditioning period lasted for 15 min, and two conditioning session were given, with the visual cue switching to the other side in the second session. Then the visual cue was removed for 30 min.

Fixed cells were washed with PBS and then post-fixed with methanol at -20°C for 15 minutes. After permeabilization with 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS for 7 min, cells were blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 2% sheep serum, 2% goat serum 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with secondary antibodies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007583.s008">S1 Table</xref>) for 2 hours at room temperature. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were measured using ImageJ package Fiji.</p>
