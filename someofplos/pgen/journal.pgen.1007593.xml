<abstract>
<p>Female gamete production relies on coordinated molecular and cellular processes that occur in the ovary throughout oogenesis. In fish, as in other vertebrates, these processes have been extensively studied both in terms of endocrine/paracrine regulation and protein expression and activity. The role of small non-coding RNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction remains however largely unknown and poorly investigated, despite a growing interest for the importance of miRNAs in a wide variety of biological processes. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-202, a miRNA predominantly expressed in male and female gonads in several vertebrate species. We studied its expression in the medaka ovary and generated a mutant line (using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing) to determine its importance for reproductive success with special interest for egg production. Our results show that miR-202-5p is the most abundant mature form of the miRNA and that it is expressed in granulosa cells and in the unfertilized egg. The knock out (KO) of <italic>mir-202</italic> gene resulted in a strong phenotype both in terms of number and quality of eggs produced. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a dramatically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success. We quantified the size distribution of the oocytes in the ovary of KO females and performed a large-scale transcriptomic analysis approach to identified dysregulated molecular pathways. Together, cellular and molecular analyses indicate that the lack of miR-202 impairs the early steps of oogenesis/folliculogenesis and decreases the number of large (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. vitellogenic) follicles, ultimately leading to dramatically reduced female fecundity. This study sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development, including possible targets of miR-202-5p, and provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> functional evidence that a gonad-predominant microRNA may have a major role in female reproduction.</p>

<p>The role of small non-coding RNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction remains poorly investigated, despite a growing interest for the importance of miRNAs in a wide variety of biological processes. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-202, a miRNA predominantly expressed in gonads in vertebrate. We studied its expression in the medaka ovary and knocked out the <italic>mir-202</italic> gene to study its importance for reproductive success. We showed that the lack of miR-202 results in the sterility of both females and males. In particular, it led to a drastic reduction of both the number and the quality of eggs produced by females. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a drastically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success. Quantitative histological and molecular analyses indicated that <italic>mir-202</italic> KO impairs oocyte development and is also associated with the dysregulation of many genes that are critical for reproduction. This study sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control oogenesis, including possible targets of miR-202-5p, and provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> functional evidence that a gonad-predominant microRNA may have a major role in female reproduction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In fish, female fecundity is tightly linked to the proper completion of oogenesis in the ovary, whereby undifferentiated germinal stem cells undergo meiosis, dramatically increase their size and ultimately form the eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref001">1</xref>]. Such an important differentiation process requires interactions between the oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells (granulosa and theca cells), which together form the ovarian follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref002">2</xref>]. While the role of endocrine and intra-ovarian factors in this process has been extensively studied, the regulation by the small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs) has received far less attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref003">3</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) of approximately 22 nucleotides in length, play many different biological functions through the post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. The contribution of miRNAs to oogenesis was demonstrated in mice with the report of an infertility of Dicer1-deficient females and an arrest of zygotic development of the progeny after the loss of specific maternal miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref005">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref006">6</xref>]. Numerous studies have highlighted the role played by miRNAs in ovarian development and oogenesis, as shown for miR-224 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref007">7</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref008">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref009">9</xref>]. Other studies have reviewed the critical role played by miRNAs in controlling the expression of genes that are essential for folliculogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref013">13</xref>]. In contrast, data documenting the role played by miRNAs in the fish ovary remain scarce and mainly rely on expression studies. In zebrafish, the differential expression of several miRNAs has been associated with vitellogenesis and follicular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref014">14</xref>]. More specifically, expression and regulation of miR-17 and miR-430b in the ovary suggest a role in follicular development and oocyte maturation. To identify other miRNAs that potentially have an important role in gonads, large-scale differential analyses were performed during sex differentiation, gonadal development or vitellogenesis in various fish species, including rainbow trout (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>mykiss</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref015">15</xref>], zebrafish <italic>(D</italic>. <italic>rerio)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref016">16</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref017">17</xref>], Atlantic halibut (<italic>H</italic>. <italic>hippoglossus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref018">18</xref>], yellow catfish (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>fulvidraco</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref019">19</xref>], Nile tilapia (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>niloticus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref020">20</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref021">21</xref>] and medaka (<italic>O</italic>. <italic>latipes</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref022">22</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref023">23</xref>]. In addition, we previously performed a large-scale differential microarray analysis and identified a set of miRNAs that are predominantly expressed in medaka ovary compared to other tissues, which strongly supports a potential role for these miRNAs in fish reproduction.</p>
<p>Among the candidate miRNAs that potentially have an important role in gonads was miR-202 that is predominantly expressed in gonads in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref022">22</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref024">24</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref025">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref026">26</xref>], as well as in other vertebrates, including frog (<italic>X</italic>. <italic>tropicalis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref027">27</xref>], human (<italic>H</italic>. <italic>s</italic>apiens) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref028">28</xref>], mouse (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref029">29</xref>] and chicken (<italic>G</italic>. <italic>gallus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref030">30</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref031">31</xref>]. The role of miR-202 in gonads is not yet understood and most of what is known relies on expression data and some functional studies. In chicken, miR-202 has a sexually dimorphic expression, suggesting a role in sex differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref030">30</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref032">32</xref>]. In human, miR-202-5p is expressed in sertoli cells and might play a role in the interaction between somatic and germ cells during spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref033">33</xref>]. In frog, miR-202-5p expression is enriched in germ cells in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref027">27</xref>]. In mice, miR-202-5p is the predominant miRNA mature form expressed during testis differentiation and is expressed in somatic sertoli cells but not in germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref034">34</xref>]. In the adult mouse testis, miR-202-5p is enriched in sertoli cells, but both miR-202-5p and -3p mature forms are expressed in germ cells at similar levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref035">35</xref>]. Notably, knock-out (KO) of <italic>mir-202</italic> in the mouse induces premature differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells and reduces stem cells activity, indicating that miR-202 is a key regulator of spermatogenesis. In fish, miR-202 function in reproduction is much less documented. It has been reported that the miR-202-3p mature form is the predominant arm expressed during gonad development in zebrafish, while miR-202-5p is the predominant arm expressed in adult gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref036">36</xref>] and in mature oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref025">25</xref>]. It has been proposed that this arm-switch may be related to different arm preference between somatic and germ cells, and probably different function for miR-202-5p and miR-202-3p. In medaka, limited evidence suggests an expression of miR-202-5p in oocytes, but no expression in granulosa somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref022">22</xref>]. Despite the existence of significant data on miR-202 expression in gonads, there is still no functional evidence of its role in fish reproduction.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the role of miR-202 in fish with special attention for its role in the ovary. We thoroughly analyzed its expression in the ovary. We then characterized the reproductive phenotype of <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Egg production was thoroughly analyzed to determine the reproductive success of <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females. Quantitative image analysis and large-scale transcriptomic analysis were used to determine ovarian modifications in <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females. We showed that miR-202-5p is the predominant mature form expressed in granulosa cells. The KO of <italic>mir-202</italic> gene resulted in a dramatic decrease of egg number and quality. Furthermore, we showed that miR-202 is involved in the regulation of the early steps of oogenesis/folliculogenesis. Overall, this study sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development in the ovary and provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> functional evidence that a gonad-predominant microRNA has a major role in female reproduction.</p>

<title>MiR-202-5p is highly abundant in granulosa cells</title>
<p>The medaka <italic>mir-202</italic> gene harbors two mature miRNAs sequences, miR-202-5p and miR-202-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Expression levels of both forms were surveyed by quantitative reverse transcription using TaqMan miRNA PCR assay (TaqMan qRT-PCR) in eleven different tissues of adult fish as well as during embryonic development. The miR-202-5p mature form was highly expressed in both gonads (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. ovary and testis), in comparison to other tissues. The expression of miR-202-5p also tended to be higher in testis compared to ovary, although not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The miR-202-3p mature form exhibited a similar expression profile in adult tissues. The expression level was significantly higher in testis than in ovary and was below detection limits in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, expression levels were approximately 1500 times lower in comparison to miR-202-5p. During embryonic development, the highest expression level of miR-202-5p was detected in non-fertilized eggs at stage 0 (st.0), corresponding to maternal accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Lower levels of miR-202-5p were detected from one-cell stage (st.2) onwards. A slight increased expression was detected just before hatching (st.39), likely corresponding to zygotic transcription. MiR-202-3p exhibited a similar expression profile during embryonic development and could be detected in unfertilized eggs at levels 500 times lower, while it could not be detected above background levels in other developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Expression profiles of miRNA-5p and -3p were also analyzed using small RNA-Seq data sets obtained from the same adult tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>), from embryos at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1H and 1I</xref>), as well as from ovarian follicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007593.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Expression profiles were similar to those obtained by TaqMan qRT-PCR, which further strengthens our findings.</p>

<title>Knock-out of <italic>mir-202</italic> drastically reduces female fertility</title>
<p>To determine the role of miR-202 on female reproduction, we inactivated the <italic>mir-202</italic> gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Small insertion/deletion (INDEL) mutations were inserted in the genome in the miR-202-3p mature sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Fishes displaying the same INDEL (-7+3) were selected to establish a mutant line.

We analyzed the sex ratio for heterozygous and homozygous using 66 and 48 fishes, respectively. In both cases, we obtained equilibrated sex ratios as for wild-type fishes. To confirm this phenotype, another mutant line harboring another INDEL mutation (-8) was used. Similarly, we observed equilibrated sex ratios for both heterozygous and homozygous using 31 and 24 fishes, respectively.</p>

<p>We then thoroughly analyzed the reproductive phenotype of <italic>mir-202</italic> -/- adult females of the mutant fish line harboring the INDEL (-7+3). The frequency of spawning was analyzed during ten consecutive cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Two categories of mutant females were distinguishable by different reproductive phenotypes. The mildly affected females (subfertile females), which represented 85% of all mutant females analyzed, displayed an irregular frequency of spawning compared to wild-type females that spawned every day within one hour of the onset of light. The strongly affected females (sterile females), which represented 15% of all mutant females analyzed, spawned only once in ten days. Further analysis of the quantity of spawned eggs (female fecundity) revealed that subfertile females spawned a significantly reduced number of eggs (5.8 eggs per clutch on average) compared to wild-type females (18.8 eggs per clutch on average, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In addition, the viability of embryos (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. capability of eggs to be fertilized and to develop correctly) was dramatically reduced when subfertile females were outcrossed with wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Similar results were obtained when subfertile females were mated with mutant males. Conversely, when mutant males were outcrossed with wild-type females, the viability of embryos was also drastically reduced compared to wild-type siblings. Further analysis of siblings revealed that eggs originating from subfertile females mated with either a wild-type or a mutant male could not be fertilized, while eggs originating from wild-type females mated with a mutant male were fertilized but arrested during the first cleavage stages of embryonic development (st.4-5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). The overall reproductive success of mutant females was therefore reduced to 0.83 viable eggs per clutch for subfertile females (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. mutant females that exhibited irregular spawning, reduced fecundity and low embryonic survival) and to 0 viable egg for sterile females that exhibited the most severe phenotype, while wild-type female exhibited an average of 15.3 viable eggs per clutch. To maintain the mutant fish line (INDEL -7+3), heterozygous fishes were thus systematically outcrossed with wild-type fishes at each generation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">Material and Methods</xref>). The other mutant line harboring another INDEL mutation (-8) was used to confirm this reproductive phenotype, but this line was not used for further histological and molecular phenotyping analyses. Together, our results show that miR-202 is required for the formation of functional gametes in both female and male gonads.</p>

<p>We further analyzed the role of miR-202 during oogenesis in juvenile females (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. before the first spawning). To this aim, the follicular content of wild-type and mutant ovaries were analyzed and compared. For each ovary, the number and size of follicles were determined on the median ovarian section.

<p>The size distribution of follicles on sections was thoroughly analyzed in mutant and wild-type ovaries.

Comparison of the resulting profiles revealed different size distribution profiles in mutant and wild-type ovaries.

This clearly suggests an arrest of early follicular growth progression in juvenile <italic>mir-202</italic> -/- females, leading to an accumulation of small and medium oocytes (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. pre-vitellogenic and early-vitellogenic oocytes) to the detriment of larger late-vitellogenic and maturing follicles.</p>

Section areas, mean follicular diameters and numbers of follicles were measured on median sections. The follicular size distribution was also analyzed. Follicles were classified according to their diameter into three different size classes based on their diameter: small (&lt;100μm), medium (100–400μm) and large (400–1200μm). In sterile females, ovaries displayed a significant decrease of the mean follicular diameter (170μm) in comparison to wild-type ovaries (220μm), but similar numbers of follicles were found in both cases. Consistently, ovarian sections were significantly reduced in sterile females compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The analysis of the size distributions also revealed distinct profiles in wild-types and sterile females.

<p>In subfertile females, which exhibited a milder reproductive phenotype (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. occurrence of spawning but a reduced number of eggs and reduced egg survival), ovarian sections displayed a significantly reduced number of follicles. This was associated with a significant reduction of ovarian section areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). No modification of the mean follicular diameter was however observed, suggesting that although fewer follicles were engaged into growth, they were all able to reach their correct final size. This was supported by the follicular size distribution profiles, which showed a significant and important reduction of the number of medium-size follicles (100–400μm in diameter) in subfertile females compared to wild-type, and no accumulation of small-size follicles (&lt;100μm in diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These data likely reflect a milder effect of the miR-202 deficiency on follicular growth in subfertile adult females compared to sterile adult fishes, indicating a partial recovery of the phenotype at this stage.</p>

<title>Large-scale transcriptomic analysis of juvenile ovaries reveals major dysregulation of key ovarian genes</title>
<p>To get further insight into the molecular pathways that are affected in absence of miR-202, we performed a large-scale transcriptomic analysis on ovaries of wild-type and <italic>mir-202</italic> -/- females. This analysis was conducted on ovaries from juvenile females, before the first spawning, when ovaries are more homogeneous and display a small range of follicular sizes (from 30 to 350 μm in diameter), compared to ovaries from reproductively active adult fish that display a large range of follicular sizes (from 30 to 1100 μm in diameter, see Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g005">5</xref>).

<title>Down-regulation of marker genes expressed in the somatic germ-cell supporting cells during folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g006">Fig 6B</xref>)</title>
<p>Expression analysis revealed a marked expression decrease of two genes encoding key steroidogenic enzymes (<italic>cyp19a1a</italic> and <italic>cyp17</italic>). <italic>Cyp19a1a</italic> (also known as aromatase) is an ovarian-predominant steroidogenic enzyme that mediates estradiol (E2) production and therefore plays a major role in both sex differentiation and vitellogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref003">3</xref>]. An even more pronounced under-expression was observed for <italic>cyp17</italic> that acts upstream of <italic>cyp19a1a</italic>. Consistently, data obtained from microarray analysis also revealed the down-regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory gene (<italic>star</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007593.s004">S1 Table</xref>). <italic>Star</italic> is involved in the cholesterol shuttling across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is a rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref037">37</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref038">38</xref>]. A decrease in <italic>star</italic> expression indicates an overall decrease in steroid hormones production in the ovary. We also observed the down-regulation of <italic>gsdf</italic> and inhibin, two members of the TGFβ family, in the ovary of mutant females. <italic>Gsdf</italic> is known to be expressed in granulosa cells and to be involved in the maintenance and maturation of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref039">39</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref040">40</xref>]. Inhibin consists of a unique α subunit and an activin β subunit. In the zebrafish ovary, members of the activin-inhibin-follistatin system exhibit dynamic changes in expression during folliculogenesis and the α subunit (<italic>inha</italic>) is expressed during vitellogenesis, especially during final oocyte growth (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. prior to final oocyte maturation)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref041">41</xref>].

<title>Identification of novel molecular players of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g006">Fig 6E</xref>)</title>
<p>Finally, transcriptomic analysis revealed three other differentially expressed genes (<italic>setd4</italic>, <italic>npr1b</italic> and <italic>srgap3</italic>) that have, to our knowledge, never been previously described as molecular players of oogenesis. The set domain-containing protein 4 gene (<italic>setd4</italic>) displayed a significantly reduced expression in the ovary of mutant females. <italic>Setd4</italic> encodes for a recently characterized methyltransferase involved in breast cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref052">52</xref>].

The natriuretic peptide receptor 1b gene (<italic>npr1b</italic>) exhibited a marked over-expression in mutant juvenile females.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most of our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of oogenesis in fish is due to several decades of research on hormones, secreted factors or intrinsic signaling pathways. However, miRNAs are well known for their role in many physiological processes through post-transcriptional gene regulations. Here, we showed that this fundamental class of molecules, endowed with pleiotropic functions, is also necessary for oogenesis in the medaka ovary. In particular, we showed that miR-202 plays a key role in early follicular recruitment and growth, and ultimately in the female reproductive success, as shown by the severe phenotype of <italic>mir-202</italic> KO fishes.</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>MiR-202-5p is the predominant mature form and is expressed in granulosa cells</title>
<p>Quantitative expression analyses of miR-202-5p and -3p revealed that miR-202-5p is the predominant form expressed in medaka ovary, while the miR-202-3p form is detected at much lower levels. Generally, RNA duplexes of ∼22 nucleotides are transitorily accumulated during miRNA biogenesis and one strand of the duplex is degraded, while the other remains bound into the silencing complex for post-transcriptional regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref056">56</xref>]. It is therefore likely that miR-202-5p is the main biologically active mature form in granulosa cells, although we cannot totally exclude a role for miR-202-3p. Quantitative expression analyses also showed that miR-202-5p is predominantly expressed in medaka gonads and in unfertilized eggs, as compared to other tissues and embryonic stages. These results are similar to previous observations in medaka and zebrafish gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref025">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref022">22</xref>]. For protein-coding genes, such a predominant expression in gonads is usually associated with a major role in reproduction, as illustrated by many maternal-effect genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Further analysis of the cellular expression pattern in ovary revealed a restricted expression of miR-202-5p in ovarian somatic granulosa cells, as shown by ISH using both paraffin or frozen ovarian sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007593.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). By contrast, a previous study in medaka reported no expression of miR-202-5p in granulosa cells using ISH on frozen ovarian section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref022">22</xref>]. This discrepancy could be due to the use of different hybridization temperatures for ISH. Here, we used a hybridization temperature of 53°C (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. 30°C below the given RNA Tm as specifically recommended). In Qiu <italic>et al</italic>., a much higher hybridization temperature of 65°C was used, which could explain the absence of signal in granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref022">22</xref>]. These authors however reported a weak signal of miR-202-5p in oocytes at very early stages (st.I and st.II), but did not provide any negative control data to confirm the specificity of the staining. In the present study we used a scramble control probe to estimate the background and no specific signal could be detected in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007593.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007593.s003">S3</xref> Figs). Together, these observations show that miR-202-5p is highly expressed in granulosa cells in the medaka ovary. Although not detected by ISH, miR-202-5p could however be present at low levels in early oocytes and subsequently be accumulated in oocytes at later stages. This would be consistent with the significant expression level of miR-202-5p detected in unfertilized eggs using TaqMan qRT-PCR and small RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007593.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007593.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), and similar to what was previously reported in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref025">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref058">58</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>Mir-202</italic> gene is required for both male and female reproductive success, but not for sex determination</title>
<p>Here, we observed that the inactivation of <italic>mir-202</italic> gene in medaka does not lead to any modification of the sex ratio, since mutant siblings give rise to 50% of adult males and 50% of adult females. This rules out the possibility of a key role of miR-202 in sex-determination. It should however be stressed that the <italic>mir-202</italic> KO results in the sterility of both females and males. More particularly, when <italic>mir-202</italic> KO males were crossed with wild-type females, embryonic viability was dramatically reduced with most embryos arrested during the first cleavage stages (st.4-5). To our knowledge, this phenotypic defect of male reproduction has never been reported in fish, and it clearly indicates that miR-202 is also required for spermatogenesis. This is in agreement with results obtained after <italic>mir-202</italic> KO in cultured spermatogonial stem cell in mice, indicating a role in the control of the cellular proliferation/differentiation balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref059">59</xref>].

<title>Females lacking miR-202 produce eggs that cannot be fertilized</title>
<p>In this study, we thoroughly analyzed the severe phenotype displayed by <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females. The overall reproductive success of mutant females was reduced to 0.83 (for subfertile females) or, even more, to 0 viable eggs per clutch (for sterile females), compared to 15.3 viable eggs per clutch for wild-type females. This phenotype is the consequence of both a reduced fecundity (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. reduced number of spawned eggs) and reduced egg viability. Indeed, mutant females produced a large proportion of eggs that could not be fertilized, subsequently resulting in no embryonic development. During folliculogenesis, the somatic cells that surround the growing oocyte (granulosa and theca cells) contribute to the formation of the micropyle, which has a pivotal role in egg fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref060">60</xref>]. It is thus possible that <italic>mir-202</italic> gene, which is expressed in granulosa cells throughout folliculogenesis, contributes to the formation of the micropyle. However, we cannot exclude a role of miR-202 in oocytes during growth and maturation follicular steps, given the possible accumulation of miR-202 inside the oocyte, which could lead to the laying of abnormal and unfertilizable eggs.</p>

<title><italic>Mir-202</italic> knock-out severely affects early folliculogenesis and female fecundity</title>
<p>The very low fecundity of <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females strongly indicates that miR-202 plays an important role in oogenesis in the ovary. One of the most remarkable features observed in mutant ovaries was the increased number of pre-vitellogenic follicles. Along with this phenotype, we observed a reduced expression of <italic>gsdf</italic> (a member of the TGFβ family) and <italic>foxl2b</italic> (encoding the Foxl2b transcription factor). Both <italic>gsdf</italic> and <italic>foxl2b</italic> genes are expressed in granulosa and are well known for their role as key regulators of early oogenesis/folliculogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref042">42</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref061">61</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref062">62</xref>]. Consistently, we also observed the down-regulation of downstream key genes, including steroidogenic genes (<italic>star</italic>, <italic>cyp19a1a</italic>, and <italic>cyp17</italic>) and the TGFβ family member inhibin. The formers are involved in estrogen synthesis in ovarian follicles, while inhibin plays a critical role during follicular development in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref063">63</xref>]. Down-regulation of these factors thus strongly indicates that miR-202 likely controls the early development of granulosa cells (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. granulosa proliferation and/or differentiation) through the regulation of <italic>gsdf</italic> and <italic>foxl2b</italic>, and ultimately leads to an impaired folliculogenesis. Similarly, previous quantitative expression analysis study in zebrafish reported a differential expression of miR-202 during folliculogenesis, indicating a possible role in follicle activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref058">58</xref>]. Further analysis of the proliferation and differentiation states of granulosa cells are now needed to further understanding the role of miR-202 during folliculogenesis.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is also the down-regulation of <italic>gsdf</italic> in <italic>mir-202</italic> mutant ovaries. Along with its well-established key role in the male-determination in medaka, the Gsdf factor is also thought to be necessary for normal ovarian development in female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref064">64</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref039">39</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>gsdf</italic> inactivation not only impairs male differentiation, but also leads to a severely reduced female fecundity up to a total infertility for the most severe cases. In such mutants, the number of pre-vitellogenic follicles is abnormally high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref039">39</xref>]. Except the male-determination phenotypic defect, many features of the <italic>gsdf</italic> mutant are thus very similar to that observed for <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females, including the pre-vitellogenic follicles accumulation. We hypothesize that miR-202 promotes <italic>gsdf</italic> expression in the ovary and boosts its action on follicular development. In any case, such hypothesis remains to be confirmed and molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between miR-202-5p and <italic>gsdf</italic> remain to be identified.</p>

<title><italic>Mir-202</italic> knock-out impairs germ cells activity in the germinal cradle</title>
<p>In the medaka ovary, the germinal cradle is composed somatic <italic>sox9b</italic>-expressing cells surrounding mitotic and meiotic germ cells, as well as primordial oogonia barely engage into folliculogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref004">4</xref>]. Our results show that <italic>mir-202</italic> is expressed in the germinal cradle, in a subset of <italic>sox9b</italic>-expressing cells surrounding primordial oogonia, which together likely correspond to primordial follicles. Interestingly, no modification of <italic>sox9b</italic> expression was observed in <italic>mir-202</italic> KO ovaries. In mice, previous studies have shown that <italic>sox9</italic> acts upstream of <italic>mir-202</italic> and regulates its expression in granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref065">65</xref>]. It is thus possible that <italic>sox9b</italic> acts upstream of <italic>mir-202</italic> in medaka as well. However, molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of <italic>mir-202</italic> in follicles at later stages, in vitellogenic and post-vitellogenic follicles, remain to be determined since <italic>sox9b</italic> is no longer expressed at these stages.</p>
<p>We also observed, in juvenile ovaries, a down-regulation of <italic>foxl3</italic> that is expressed in germ cells undergoing cystic divisions prior entry into meiosis and, to a lesser extent, of <italic>sycp3</italic> that is expressed in germ cells undergoing meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref004">4</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref049">49</xref>]. These down-regulations indicate that miR-202 is necessary for cystic division and meiosis of germ cells within the germinal cradle, in addition to the correct follicular development (as discussed above). By contrast, miR-202 was shown to be essential for stem cells maintenance and to prevent spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) from premature differentiation in mouse testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref066">66</xref>]. It will thus be very informative in the future to determine the role of miR-202 in the maintenance and fate determination of stem cells in the testis of medaka. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that no expression of <italic>mir-202</italic> was detected in early oocytes, we however cannot exclude that <italic>mir-202</italic> is barely expressed in early oocytes and could thus be involved in the regulation of germ cells mitosis and meiosis. An other possibility is that miR-202-5p acts through cellular interactions between germinal and somatic cells that are thought to be important for meiosis progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref067">67</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref068">68</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref051">51</xref>]. Any early defect of oocytes may thus occur in the context of granulosa dysfunction, including the onset of meiosis. One possibility is that miR-202 depletion in the granulosa affects oocyte-somatic cells communications, as suggested by the down-regulation of one member of the <italic>KELCH</italic> family, which has an important role in oocyte-somatic cell communication in drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref051">51</xref>]. This hypothesis is also supported by the dysregulation of the <italic>npr1b</italic> receptor and the intracellular effector <italic>srgap3</italic> of the SLIT/ROBO signaling pathway, which could both also mediate cellular communications in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref054">54</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref055">55</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>Stat3</italic> and <italic>clockb</italic> are predicted target genes of miR-202-5p in the ovary</title>
<p>To understand the action mechanisms of miR-202, we searched for direct molecular targets of miR-202-5p <italic>in silico</italic>. Target prediction for miR-202-5p resulted in the identification of various putative targets mRNAs expressed in medaka ovary, including <italic>stat3</italic> and <italic>clockb</italic>. The co-expression of these genes and miR-202-5p supports a potential interaction between the miR-202-5p and these potential targets, although further validation of these molecular interactions is needed. However, the potential regulation of Stat3 and Clockb proteins would undoubtedly provide new insights into the comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms of fish fecundity.</p>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence place STAT3 at a central node in the development, progression and maintenance of many human tumors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref069">69</xref>]). STAT3 proteins relay signals from activated cytokine and growth factor receptors in the plasma membrane to the nucleus, where they regulate gene transcription. STAT3 modulates the transcription of responsive genes that block apoptosis, favor cell proliferation and survival, and promote angiogenesis and metastasis. Disruption of STAT3 signaling leads to the inhibition of growth and apoptosis in tumor cell lines and can impair tumor growth in the mouse. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that miR-202 is down-regulated in multiple types of cancer. These studies show that miR-202 is a novel tumor suppressor by targeting and inhibiting STAT3, as for example in non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref070">70</xref>]. Further investigation are now needed to validate the miR-202 and <italic>stat3</italic> interaction in medaka, and to better understand the role played by miR-202 and <italic>stat3</italic> on germ cell division and follicular growth in medaka ovary.</p>
<p>C<italic>lockb</italic> (clock circadian regulator b) is another noteworthy potential target of miR-202-5p. <italic>Clock</italic> genes are core components of the circadian peripheral clock machinery that plays critical role in the regulation of biological rhythms. <italic>Clock</italic> genes encode transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, which also contain intrinsic DNA binding histone acetyltransferase activity. Impaired fertility and fecundity have been observed in behaviorally arrhythmic clock mutant mice that are however still able to ovulate and produce fertilizable ova [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref071">71</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref072">72</xref>]. Further considerable evidences have been accumulated in mammals, linking the molecular circadian clock to ovarian physiology (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref073">73</xref>]). In granulosa cells, the clock machinery has been shown to regulate the timing and amplitude of several gene products associated with the ovulatory response to gonadotropins, including the LH receptor and prostaglandin synthase (COX2). <italic>Clock</italic> genes have also been shown to drive rhythms of enzymes critical for steroid hormone biosynthesis such as STAR, CYP11a, and aromatase (CYP19), which were down-regulated in the ovary of <italic>mir-202</italic> KO females. In the oocyte, it has been suggested that, rather than driving rhythms of gene expression, <italic>clock</italic> genes are part of the maternal program responsible for normal oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. Overall, existing data support a role for <italic>clock</italic> genes in the processes of follicular growth, steroid hormone synthesis and ovulation in mammals. Although the function of <italic>clock</italic> genes in fish ovary is still unknown, the role of miR-202 in the regulation of the early steps of follicular growth is consistent with a potential interaction with <italic>clock</italic> genes. It is clear that further studies on miR-202-5p and <italic>clockb</italic> interaction will be promising for the comprehension of the rhythmic follicle recruitment during the medaka reproductive cycles.</p>

<title>MiR-202, a major player rather than a fine modulator</title>
<p>MiR-202 is a gonad-predominant miRNA in vertebrates, as documented here and in the literature. For protein-coding genes, a predominant expression in gonads is usually associated with a major role in reproduction, as illustrated by many maternal-effect genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref057">57</xref>]. So far, it was unknown if such a critical feature would also be observed for miRNAs that are often seen as fine modulators of gene regulatory networks rather than major regulators of biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref074">74</xref>]. Although several miRNAs are known to be key players of physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref075">75</xref>], it is generally considered that the purview of miRNAs is more likely the maintenance of regulatory networks by fine-tuning gene expression, rather than the establishment of key regulatory networks for developmental decisions or core physiological processes. This concept is supported by the fact that KO of miRNAs are often associated with “modest” phenotypic effects at the level of the organism (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. low penetrance of the mutation), which are strongly exacerbated only under particular condition, as for example manipulations, stresses or disease conditions. In the present study, we observed a drastic reduction of the reproductive success for both male and female medaka lacking miR-202, including a reduced female fecundity and the production of poor quality eggs that cannot be fertilized. This phenotype was confirmed using two mutant lines bearing different INDELs obtained with the same guide RNA. Such high penetrance of the mutation is in contrast with the idea that miRNA KO generally induces “modest” phenotypes. It is however possible that miR-202 modulates a large network of targets, which would have a synergistic effect on key regulatory pathways for folliculogenesis. KO of <italic>mir-202</italic> gene would thus ultimately lead to subfertile or sterile females. Nevertheless, the phenotype observed in <italic>mir-202</italic> -/- fish is among the most severe observed after miRNA KO.</p>

<title>A new look at oogenesis</title>
<p>Surprisingly, the transcriptomic analysis performed in juvenile females, during the first reproductive cycle and before the occurrence of the first spawning, did not result in the identification of a large number of differentially expressed. It should however be stressed that among the differentially expressed genes were many genes that are crucial for steroidegenesis and reproduction, such as <italic>star</italic> and two members of the WNT family (as discussed above). In addition to these usual suspects, the transcriptome analysis also shed light on other genes such as one gene of the KELCH family (<italic>klhl23</italic>) that is less studied but believed to play an important role in oogenesis based on existing data in other animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007593.ref076">76</xref>]. Finally, the identification of genes that were previously not known to participate in oogenesis, such as <italic>setd4</italic>, <italic>npr1b</italic> and <italic>srgap3</italic>, could shed a new light on our understanding of this complex and coordinated biological process. This begs for further investigations that will greatly benefit from <italic>mir-202 -/-</italic> fishes as a novel biological model.</p>

<sec id="sec022">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, our results show that miR-202 is a key miRNA involved in the regulation of follicular recruitment and growth. This provides the first functional evidence that miRNAs are necessary for the female reproductive success and in particular the regulation of female fecundity. Furthermore, the present study shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development, which remain poorly understood to date. A further systematic <italic>in vivo</italic> functional analysis of other gonad-predominant miRNAs should greatly increase our knowledge on the overall role of miRNAs in oogenesis and female fecundity in fish.</p>

<title>Establishment of the <italic>mir-202</italic> mutant medaka line</title>
<p>For the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out analysis, the target genomic sequence was identified with the help of the ZiFiT online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zifit.partners.org/ZiFiT/" xlink:type="simple">http://zifit.partners.org/ZiFiT/</ext-link>) and using the medaka genome reference available on the Ensembl genome database (Ensembl gene: ENSORLG00000021212). A short sequence in the mature miR-202-3p was selected as followed: GG-(N)18-NN. Two inverse-complementary primers (Forward 5’-TAGGCATAAGGCATGGGAAAAT-3’ and Reverse 5’-AAACATTTTCCCATGCCTTATG-3’) were annealed and cloned into the pDR274 vector (Addgene plasmid 42250) in the BsaI cloning site. The modified pDR274 vector was digested with DraI and the miR-202 specific guide RNA (mir202-sgRNA) was transcribed using the T7 RNA polymerase (P207, Promega). For the Cas9-RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesis, the pCS2-nCas9n vector (Addgene plasmid 47929) was linearized with NotI and capped RNA encoding the Cas9 was transcribed with the mMessage mMachine SP6 Kit (AM1340, Life Technologies) following manufacturer's instructions. Cas9 and sgRNA were purified using phenol/chloroform and precipitated by Ammonium acetate. <italic>Cas9</italic>-RNA (100 ng μl<sup>-1</sup>) and <italic>mir-202</italic>-sgRNA (10 ng μl<sup>-1</sup>) were co-injected into one-cell stage embryos. Injected embryos were raised to sexual maturity and 10 fishes were genotyped to identified founder fishes (F0). F0 fishes harboring the same INDEL mutation were selected and outcrossed with wild-type fishes to obtain F1 heterozygous. Such outcrosses were performed at each generation in order to maintain the line. Heterozygous fishes were crossed together to produce homozygous fishes for histological and molecular phenotyping analyses. Two distinct family lines harboring different INDEL mutations (-7+3 and -8) were used to analyze the reproductive phenotype.</p>
