<abstract>
<p>Rer1 is a retrieval receptor for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of various ER membrane proteins and unassembled or immature components of membrane protein complexes. However, its physiological functions during mammalian development remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of Rer1-mediated quality control system in mammalian development. We show that Rer1 is required for the sufficient cell surface expression and activity of γ-secretase complex, which modulates Notch signaling during mouse cerebral cortex development. When Rer1 was depleted in the mouse cerebral cortex, the number of neural stem cells decreased significantly, and malformation of the cerebral cortex was observed. Rer1 loss reduced γ-secretase activity and downregulated Notch signaling in the developing cerebral cortex. In Rer1-deficient cells, a subpopulation of γ-secretase complexes and components was transported to and degraded in lysosomes, thereby significantly reducing the amount of γ-secretase complex on the cell surface. These results suggest that Rer1 maintains Notch signaling by maintaining sufficient expression of the γ-secretase complex on the cell surface and regulating neural stem cell maintenance during cerebral cortex development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Newly synthesized proteins are primarily assessed by the ER quality control system for correct folding, modification, and complex formation. Nevertheless, some immature or misfolded proteins escape from the ER to post-ER compartments. However, they are recognized by several retrieval receptors at the early-Golgi compartment and are hence returned to the ER. The latter mechanism is referred to as the “early-Golgi quality control system”.</p>
<p>Rer1 is a well-conserved early-Golgi membrane protein in eukaryotes, which plays important roles in the early-Golgi quality control system. Rer1p was originally identified in yeast as a receptor for the retrieval of ER membrane proteins from the early-Golgi to the ER via the COPI-mediated retrograde transport pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref004">4</xref>]. Recently, the roles of Rer1 have been extended to the ER retention of immature or misfolded mutant membrane proteins related to some ER misfolding diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref006">6</xref>]. Importantly, Rer1 also modulates the formation of multimeric membrane protein complexes by retaining unassembled components in the ER. In yeast, Rer1p recognizes an unassembled iron-transporter subunit Fet3p and retains it in the ER until Fet3p forms an appropriate complex with its partner, Ftr1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref007">7</xref>]. These observations suggest that Rer1 functions as a sorting chaperone to support the formation of multimeric membrane protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>γ-Secretase is a multimeric membrane protein complex, which comprises presenilin-1 (PS1), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-1 (APH-1), and presenilin enhancer γ-secretase subunit (also known as PEN2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref013">13</xref>]. Unassembled subunits of the γ-secretase complex are retained or degraded in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref014">14</xref>]. Only properly assembled γ-secretase is transported to post-Golgi compartments and functions as an intramembrane aspartyl protease, which cleaves type I transmembrane proteins such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref017">17</xref>]. In this process, Rer1 binds unassembled NCT and/or PEN2 and retains them in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref019">19</xref>]. Since siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rer1 enhances complex formation and the activity of the γ-secretase complex in cultured cells, Rer1 has been considered to negatively regulate γ-secretase function via competition with APH-1 for NCT binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The present study aimed to investigate the role of the Rer1-mediated quality control system in mammalian development. First, we generated Rer1 knockout mice and determined whether it is essential in early mouse development. Furthermore, we examined the role of Rer1 in mouse cerebral cortex development. Our study hence reveals the primary role of Rer1 in Notch signaling in the cerebral cortex development and in the regulation of the neural stem cell population.</p>

<title>Rer1 is required for mouse early development</title>
<p>To examine the physiological roles of Rer1 in mammalian development, we generated a knockout mouse using an embryonic stem (ES) cell line (EUCOMM), in which a reversible gene-trap cassette, FlipRosaβgeo, is inserted in the intron 1 of <italic>Rer1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007647.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). We first generated <italic>Rer1</italic> heterozygous gene-trap (<italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>+/trap</italic></sup>) mice, using this ES cell line. We confirmed a single gene-trap cassette insertion into the <italic>Rer1</italic> locus in <italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>+/trap</italic></sup> mice via Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007647.s001">S1A and S1C Fig</xref>).

Furthermore, we attempted to generate Rer1-homozygous gene-trap mice (hereafter <italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>trap/trap</italic></sup>) by intercrossing <italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>+/trap</italic></sup> mice.

<title>Rer1 is required for normal cerebral cortex development</title>
<p>Since Rer1 is involved in the formation of the γ-secretase complex, we focused on the roles of Rer1 in the mouse brain development.

<p>The brain weight and size of cortex from the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO brain appeared 20–30% smaller than that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). We stained sagittal sections of the brains from 5-month-old control and forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and found that forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice had a smaller cerebral size than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). The forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice had a thinner cerebral cortex with a lower cell density and a smaller hippocampus than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Since neurodegeneration is often accompanied by inflammatory responses such as gliosis, we analyzed the neuronal and astrocyte populations in control and forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice brains. We first prepared the lysates of the cerebral cortex from 5-week-old control and Rer1 cKO mice and examined the protein levels of a neuronal marker, NeuN, and an astrocyte marker, GFAP via western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g001">Fig 1J</xref>).

<title>Rer1 is important for the generation of layer (II–IV) neurons in the cerebral cortex</title>
<p>On postnatal day 0 (P0), brain size was comparable between forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice and controls (<italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>+/inv-trap</italic></sup>, <italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>inv-trap/inv-trap</italic></sup>, <italic>Rer1</italic><sup><italic>+/inv-trap</italic></sup>; <italic>Emx-Cre</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

We also evaluated cortical malformations via immunostaining, using antibodies against layer markers, Cux1 (layers II-IV), Ctip2 (layer V), and Tbr2 (intermediate progenitors in the subventricular zone, SVZ). The Cux1 signal decreased in the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, Ctip2- and Tbr2-positive neurons were observed to a similar extent in control and forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). We also examined GFAP expression in the cerebral cortex of these mice on E18.5 via immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) and found no significant difference between control and the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO brain on E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2G</xref>), suggesting that switching from neurogenesis to gliogenesis normally takes place during the brain development. We further conducted western blot analysis of neuronal markers and markers for gliosis, ER stress, and apoptosis in cerebral lysates on E18.5 and quantitated their levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).

The neuronal progenitor marker, Tbr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2K</xref>) and the astrocyte marker, GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g002">Fig 2L</xref>) levels were almost unchanged in the Rer1-deficient cerebral cortex.

<title>Rer1 is required for neural stem cell maintenance during cortical development</title>
<p>Since Rer1 is involved in the γ-secretase complex formation, we investigated whether γ-secretase activity was affected in the cerebrum of forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice on E18.5. We examined γ-secretase activity via an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide probe, which contains a C-terminal β-APP amino acid sequence cleaved by γ-secretase. We incubated membrane extracts from the cerebrum of control or forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice with this probe overnight at 37°C and then analyzed γ-secretase activity. In Rer1-deficient cerebrum lysates, γ-secretase activity was reduced to 80% of that in the control lysate (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We also assessed γ-secretase activity and Wnt signaling in the cerebrum by monitoring the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and the active form of β-catenin (dephosphorylated on Ser37 or Thr41), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Notch is one of the known substrates of γ-secretase and plays an essential role in Notch signaling, which determines the cell fate during the development of various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref025">25</xref>]. First, γ-secretase triggers Notch signaling by cleaving the intramembrane domain of Notch. The cleaved Notch intracellular domain is then translocated to the nucleus to suppress the expression of proneural genes, which regulate neural differentiation, thereby inhibiting neuronal differentiation. The level of NICD in the Rer1-deficient cerebrum was significantly decreased to 80% of that in the control lysates (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In contrast, β-catenin protein levels were comparable between E18.5 control and Rer1-deficient cerebral cortex, indicating that Wnt signaling is superficially unaffected by Rer1 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). These results suggest that Rer1 loss reduces γ-secretase activity and Notch signaling in the cerebrum. We further confirmed that Notch signaling is reduced during cerebral cortex development of Rer1-deficient mice by staining brain sections from control and forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice on E13.5, using an anti-NICD antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). A strong NICD signal was observed in the SVZ/intermediate zone (IZ), while a weak signal was observed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the control cerebrum; however, the NICD signal was apparently reduced in the Rer1 cKO cerebrum. We also examined the amount of NCT, NICD, and active-β-catenin in E13.5 mouse cerebral cortex lysates from control and Rer1 cKO mice to monitor the γ-secretase complex formation, Notch signaling, and Wnt signaling, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). NCT levels decreased in cerebral cortices of Rer1-deficient mice compared with that of control mice. Consistently, NICD levels decreased in the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO cerebrum, suggesting that γ-secretase activity and Notch signaling are downregulated in the absence of Rer1. In contrast, active-β-catenin protein levels were comparable in the E13.5 control and Rer1-deficient cerebral cortex, indicating that Wnt signaling is unaffected upon Rer1 loss. Furthermore, <italic>Hes1</italic>, one of the downstream transcription factors in Notch-signaling pathway, was significantly down-regulated in the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Rer1 loss decreases γ-secretase activity, thereby impairing Notch signaling, resulting in impaired cortical development in the mouse cerebrum.</p>

<p>Since Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in neurogenesis by regulating neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance, we investigated the population of NSCs in the Rer1-deficient cerebral cortex on E13.5, where neurogenesis occurs actively. We examined the proliferative potential of NSCs or progenitor cells via immunostaining, using an antibody against phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3), which is highly expressed during cell division of neural stem or progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). The number of pHH3-positive dividing cells significantly decreased in the Rer1-deficient cerebral cortex, especially in the apical region (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). We also performed EdU incorporation assay to determine the number of proliferating cells in control and forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO cerebral cortex on E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). The number of proliferating cells decreased significantly in the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO cerebral cortex relative to control mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). Thereafter, we performed IHC, using anti-Pax6 antibody to assess the effect of Rer1 deficiency on NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3K</xref>). The number of Pax6-positive cells was significantly reduced in the apical area of cerebral cortex of the forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO cerebral cortex compared to control mice, although the total number of Pax6-positive cells in the total cerebral cortex area was comparable between them (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3L</xref>), suggesting that Rer1 is necessary for the maintenance of normal pool of neural stem cells in the ventricular zone. We further investigated whether Rer1 is required for NSC maintenance. NSCs form colonies referred to as neurospheres, <italic>in vitro</italic>. We harvested NSCs from the brains of control and forebrain-specific Rer1 cKO mice on E14.5 to evaluate their colony (neurosphere) formation activity from a single NSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3M</xref>). NSCs harvested from E14.5 control mice efficiently formed neurospheres (average number of 16 colonies from 200 cells), indicating their normal self-renewal. In contrast, NSCs from Rer1-deficient mice hardly formed neurospheres (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">Fig 3N</xref>), thereby supporting the importance of Rer1 in maintaining the pool of NSCs.</p>

<title>Rer1 is required for proper cell surface expression of the γ-secretase complex</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of Rer1 depletion on γ-secretase complex formation and activity, we examined Rer1-deficient HAP1 cells generated using a CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing system. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Rer1 antibodies confirmed the absence of Rer1 protein in Rer1-deficient HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, NCT, PS1, and PEN2 protein levels in Rer1-deficient HAP1 cells decreased significantly to 60–70% of those in wild-type cells (NCT and PS1: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, PEN2: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In addition, a hypoglycosylated form of NCT was observed in Rer1-deficient HAP1 cells, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref019">19</xref>]. We also investigated the effects of Rer1 depletion on other plasma membrane proteins such as LRP6, integrin, pan-cadherin, and Slc3A2. The levels of these proteins were unaffected in Rer1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that the overall biosynthesis of plasma membrane proteins is not severely impaired in Rer1-deficient cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether Rer1 re-expression could recover protein levels of γ-secretase subunits in Rer1-deficient cells. We introduced GFP or GFP-Rer1 into Rer1-deficient cells, using a retroviral vector system and examined the effect of Rer1 re-expression on γ-secretase subunit levels via immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The expression of GFP-Rer1 in Rer1-deficient cells increased NCT and PS1 levels by 1.2 folds compared with that in control cells expressing GFP alone (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). We also examined the cell surface levels of NCT and PS1 in wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells via a cell surface biotinylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). We labeled cell surface proteins with biotin and pulled them down using avidin beads to detect γ-secretase levels at the plasma membrane. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the amount of NCT and PS1 on the cell surface of Rer1-deficient cells was reduced to approximately 60% of that in wild-type cells (NCT: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, PS1: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). However, the ratio of cell surface NCT and PS1 to total proteins was comparable in wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). To investigate whether NCT assembles with PS1 in Rer1-deficient cells, we immunoprecipitated γ-secretase complexes from wild-type and Rer1-deficient cell lysates, using an anti-NCT antibody and examined the immunoprecipitates upon immunoblotting with antibodies against PS1 and NCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). The association of NCT and PS1 was detected in Rer1-deficient cells, suggesting that γ-secretase subunits can form a complex even in the absence of Rer1. We also examined the gene expression of γ-secretase components via quantitative PCR analysis. The expression of PS1 and NCT in Rer1-KO HAP1 cells was comparable to that in control cells, suggesting that gene expression of γ-secretase components was not largely affected by the loss of Rer1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g004">Fig 4J</xref>).</p>

<title>Rer1 loss results in the degradation of γ-secretase subunits</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Rer1 in the stability of the γ-secretase complex, we examined the turnover rates of NCT and PS1 in wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells via treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX). The γ-secretase complex is known to be formed by sequential assembly of APH-1, NCT, PS1 and PEN2 in order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref026">26</xref>]. PS1 is then processed endoproteolytically to a 28-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 17-kDa C-terminal fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref027">27</xref>]. We used an anti-PS1 antibody, which can detect a C-terminal fragment of PS1 (PS1 CTF). Full-length PS1 is hardly detected at a steady state because it is quickly degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism or endoproteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref028">28</xref>], whereas PS1 CTF stably exists in a complex. NCT and PS1 CTF largely remained in wild-type cells at 24 h after CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). By contrast, levels of both proteins started to decrease at 5 h after CHX treatment in Rer1-deficient cells. Approximately 50% of NCT and PS1 were degraded within 24 h in Rer1-deficient cells compared with wild-type cells, in which most of both proteins remained at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we investigated whether γ-secretase subunits were degraded by the proteasome or lysosomes in Rer1-deficient cells. We treated wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells with a potent inhibitor of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), eeyarestatin I (EerI), or a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and investigated the involvement of the proteasome in the degradation of γ-secretase subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007647.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). ERAD inhibition significantly increased PS1 CTF levels in wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, respectively), as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). NCT levels also tended to increase slightly but not significantly in the presence of EerI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting that PS1 CTF and NCT are partially degraded by the proteasome in wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells. Since γ-secretase subunits began to decrease 5 h after CHX treatment in Rer1-deficient cells, we assumed that NCT and PS1 CTF might be partly transported to and degraded in lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, we treated Rer1-deficient cells with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which blocks lysosomal degradation by inhibiting V-ATPase. NCT and PS1 CTF protein levels significantly increased in BafA1-treated Rer1-deficient cells compared with that in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>). The effects of BafA1 on NCT and PS1 CTF accumulation were alleviated in GFP-Rer1-expressing Rer1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated whether some γ-secretase subunits are transported to lysosomes in Rer1-deficient cells. We incubated wild-type and Rer1-deficient cells with or without BafA1 and observed the subcellular localization of NCT via immunostaining with antibodies against NCT and a lysosomal marker Lamp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5J</xref>). Endogenous NCT mainly localized to the ER in a meshwork pattern and partly to punctate structures in wild-type cells treated with or without BafA1. Lamp1-positive lysosomes tended to aggregate in a cellular region in HAP1 cell lines in the presence of BafA1. NCT-positive puncta subtly increased in Rer1-deficient cells at a steady state and prominently increased in Rer1-deficient cells treated with BafA1. Approximately 50% of NCT-positive puncta localized close to the Lamp1-positive lysosomes or overlapped with them in BafA1-treated Rer1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5K</xref>), indicating that NCT is partly transported to lysosomes. These results suggest that immature γ-secretase subunits or complexes are no longer retained in the ER and are mislocalized to lysosomes for degradation in the absence of Rer1. We also examined γ-secretase complex formation via Blue Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5L</xref>). The amount of γ-secretase complex was drastically reduced in Rer1-KO cells compared to that in control cells; however, complex formation still occurred to some extent under this condition. Notably, the reduction in γ-secretase complex was recovered upon addition of BafA1, which inhibits lysosomal function, suggesting that γ-secretase subunits are largely targeted to and degraded in lysosomes in the absence of Rer1. Furthermore, NCT was underglycosylated in Rer1-deficient cells, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref019">19</xref>], in Rer1-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g005">Fig 5M</xref>), suggesting that Rer1 is required for the cell surface expression of fully matured γ-secretase complex.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study shows that Rer1 exerts positive effects in the maintenance of γ-secretase activity by mediating proper expression of γ-secretase complex on the cell surface. Additionally, Rer1 is involved in the proliferation of NSCs during cerebral cortex development by modulating the onset of Notch signaling, which regulates cortical development and higher brain function. These findings suggest that Rer1 functions as the early-Golgi quality control, which mediates normal expression and functioning of the γ-secretase complex during mammalian brain development.</p>
<p>Rer1 has been proposed as a limiting factor, which negatively regulates the assembly of γ-secretase subunits, since siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rer1 facilitates γ-secretase assembly and cell surface expression in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref019">19</xref>]. However, we observed that γ-secretase activity in the brain lysates was significantly decreased in Rer1-deficient mice. In addition, we found that a complete loss of Rer1 significantly reduced γ-secretase components on the cell surface probably because of their mistargeting to lysosomes for degradation. These results raise a question regarding the different effects of Rer1 knockdown and Rer1 deletion on expression of the γ-secretase complex. In both cases, some of the γ-secretase subunits or complexes are transported to post-Golgi compartments similarly both in Rer1-knockdown and knockout cells; however, their destinations are different. One possible explanation is that late-Golgi or post-Golgi quality control systems function more strictly in HAP1 cells and mice than in other cultured cell lines used in previous studies and deliver immature γ-secretase subunits or complexes to lysosomes. Alternatively, a small amount of Rer1 in Rer1-knockdown cells might be sufficient to support the maturation of γ-secretase subunits or complexes, allowing delivery to the cell surface. By contrast, a prolonged and profound lack of Rer1 may allow for leakage of γ-secretase subunits or complexes from the ER, resulting in their lysosomal targeting.</p>
<p>Our observations suggest that Rer1 exerts positive effects on the cell surface expression of γ-secretase. In yeast, Rer1p is required for accurate formation of an iron transporter complex consisting of Fet3p and Ftr1p by retaining unassembled Fet3p in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref007">7</xref>]. In the absence of Rer1p, unassembled Fet3p is mislocalized to vacuoles and degraded there. Ftr1p also becomes unstable and degraded probably by ER-associated degradation in Rer1-deficient cells, suggesting a positive role of Rer1p in the formation of the iron transporter complex. Furthermore, Rer1 loss leads to lysosomal degradation of unassembled components such as the γ-subunit of acetylcholine receptor and immature rhodopsin in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref022">22</xref>]. These observations support our hypothesis that Rer1 mediates the assembly or maturation of membrane protein complexes as the early-Golgi quality control system by retaining unassembled components until they form an appropriately matured complex. Interestingly, some of the γ-secretase components and/or complex were targeted to lysosomes for degradation in Rer1-deficient cells, suggesting the existence of late-Golgi or post-Golgi quality control system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref030">30</xref>]. Multiple quality control systems through the exocytosis pathway would allow for efficient formation of membrane protein complexes and their cell surface expression at a proper timing.</p>
<p>NSCs harvested from Rer1-deficient cerebral cortex hardly form neurospheres, indicating that self-renewal of NSCs is partly impaired by Rer1 loss. In addition, Rer1 deficiency in the developing mouse cerebrum decreased the number of mature neurons, including Cux1-positive upper layer neurons in the cortex, and reduced the size of the cerebral cortex (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g003">3</xref>). In such mice, the number of dividing NSCs decreased in the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that Rer1 loss impairs the proliferation of NSCs, which finally leads to the exhaustion of neuronal progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these phenotypes of Rer1-deficient mice are reminiscent of those of mice defective in γ-secretase and Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref033">33</xref>]. γ-Secretase triggers Notch signaling, which is known to regulate the expansion of the neuronal progenitor pool for appropriate regulation of brain size. In this study, we demonstrated that Notch signaling was significantly reduced in the Rer1-deficient cerebrum probably because of a reduced activity of γ-secretase complex. These findings suggest that Rer1 maintains Notch signaling by supporting proper γ-secretase complex expression to supply a sufficient progenitor pool for cortical development. Recently, it has been reported that Rer1 is also involved in the assembly and transport of voltage-gated sodium channels in Purkinje cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref034">34</xref>]. Thus, Rer1 could also affect other membrane protein complexes such as voltage-gated sodium channels or the activity of other γ-secretase substrates in addition to Notch1 to regulate brain development and behaviors.</p>
<p>In humans, <italic>Rer1</italic>, located in 1p36 region, is significantly associated with 1p36-deletion syndrome. 1p36-deletion syndrome is caused by a large deletion in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 1, and it occurs in 1 in 5000 people. Patients with this syndrome exhibit a brain disorder with mental retardation and behavioral disorder. In addition, they also have structural brain abnormalities, including a large anterior fontanelle and microcephaly. Notably, Rer1 loss in the cerebral cortex resulted in cerebral hypoplasia and behavioral disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007647.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which recapitulates the brain defects present in most patients with 1p36-deletion syndrome, suggesting that Rer1 mutations are one of the causative factors for this syndrome. However, the symptoms in patients result from haploinsufficiency due to 1p36 microdeletion. Since Rer1 heterozygous mice did not develop the striking phenotypic abnormalities observed in forebrain-specific Rer1-deficient mice, heterozygous deletion of the other genes would also contribute to brain anomalies observed in 1p36-deletion syndrome. Interestingly, the downstream targets of Notch signaling such as Hes4 and Hes5 are also present in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007647.ref035">35</xref>], although over 90 genes are contained in the 1p36 microdeletion. Reduced expression of such genes together with Rer1 in patients may cause abnormal brain development. Further investigation of γ-secretase activity and Notch signaling in patients with 1p36-deletion syndrome will be important for establishing the involvement of Rer1 and the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disease etiology.</p>
