<abstract>
<p>Plants have evolved diverse cell types with distinct sizes, shapes, and functions. For example, most flowering plants contain specialized petal conical epidermal cells that are thought to attract pollinators and influence light capture and reflectance, but the molecular mechanisms controlling conical cell shaping remain unclear. Here, through a genetic screen in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, we demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>ANGUSTIFOLIA</italic> (<italic>AN</italic>), which encodes for a homolog of mammalian CtBP/BARs, displayed conical cells phenotype with wider tip angles, correlating with increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We further showed that exogenously supplied ROS generated similar conical cell phenotypes as the <italic>an</italic> mutants. Moreover, reduced endogenous ROS levels resulted in deceased tip sharpening of conical cells. Furthermore, through enhancer screening, we demonstrated that mutations in <italic>katanin</italic> (<italic>KTN1</italic>) enhanced conical cell phenotypes of the <italic>an-t1</italic> mutants. Genetic analyses showed that AN acted in parallel with KTN1 to control conical cell shaping. Both increased or decreased ROS levels and mutations in <italic>AN</italic> suppressed microtubule organization into well-ordered circumferential arrays. We demonstrated that the AN-ROS pathway jointly functioned with KTN1 to modulate microtubule ordering, correlating with the tip sharpening of conical cells. Collectively, our findings revealed a mechanistic insight into ROS homeostasis regulation of microtubule organization and conical cell shaping.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants have evolved diverse epidermal cell types, that differ in size, morphology, and function, to adapt to life on land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref002">2</xref>]. The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>) epidermis contain several well-known cell types, including interlocking jigsaw puzzle-shaped leaf pavement cells, tubular root hairs, and elongated hair-like trichomes. Using these three cell types as models to study cell shape, considerable progress has been made over the past two decades toward understanding how plant cells achieve their final morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref004">4</xref>]. Although similar molecular mechanisms controlling cell shape are shared between these cell types, certain mechanisms are used in a cell-type specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite this progress, the molecular mechanisms underlying plant cell shape formation remain to be further explored in specialized cell types.</p>
<p>Conical-shaped cells are specialized epidermal cells decorated with radiate cuticular nanoridges and are usually found in the petal adaxial epidermis of most flowering plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref008">8</xref>]. Conical cells are thought to influence light capture and reflectance, temperature, and wettability, and are proposed to have a role in attracting bee pollinators by providing tactile cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref011">11</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying conical cell shaping have remained largely unknown. Most cell types in plants undergo anisotropic cell expansion that is driven by turgor pressure throughout the entire cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref012">12</xref>], whereas the direction of expansion and the final cell shape largely depend on the patterning of cell wall architecture through the deposition and the orientation of cellulose microfibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref013">13</xref>]. Cortical microtubules play an important role in plant cell shape determination by guiding cellulose microfibrils deposition in the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref018">18</xref>]. It has been proposed that the co-alignment of circumferential microtubule arrays and cellulose microfibrils restrict cell expansion in girth and promote anisotropic cell expansion perpendicular to the orientation of cellulose microfibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref019">19</xref>]. Genetic and live imaging studies have provided significant progress about the mechanisms underlying the organization of microtubule arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>We have recently established a confocal microscopy-based imaging approach to study the morphogenesis of conical cells and microtubule organization patterns in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>]. Adaxial epidermal cells in the petal blades from flower development stage 8 are flat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref022">22</xref>], and undergo tip sharpening after stage 9, which is correlated with the re-orientation of microtubules from disordered to well-ordered circumferential arrays at late developmental stages. Pharmacological evidence demonstrated that normal conical cell expansion requires an intact microtubule network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>]. Despite this progress, it remained elusive how cortical microtubule arrays are organized, and which upstream components are involved during conical cell development.</p>
<p>The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana ANGUSTIFOLIA</italic> (<italic>AN</italic>) gene, encoding the plant homolog of the C-terminal binding protein/brefeldin A-ADP ribosylated substrate (CtBP/BARS), has been shown to function in microtubule organization, vesicle budding from the Golgi, leaf pavement cell morphogenesis, and trichome branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref025">25</xref>], but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be explored. In this study, through a reverse genetic screen, we showed that the <italic>AN</italic> knockout mutants <italic>an-t1</italic> and <italic>an-t2</italic> suppressed the tip sharpening of conical cells, correlating with the accumulation of significantly higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are known for their function as signaling molecules in plant organ growth and development and normal cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, mutations in <italic>KTN1</italic>, encoding the p60 microtubule-severing protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref033">33</xref>], caused enhanced conical cell phenotypes of <italic>an-t1</italic>. AN acted in parallel with KTN1 to control conical cell tip sharpening. Together, our results suggest that the AN-ROS pathway jointly functions with KTN1 to modulate microtubule ordering and conical cell shaping.</p>

<title>Loss of AN function causes wide-angled tips of conical cells, correlating with increased accumulation of ROS</title>
<p>To identify regulatory components involved in controlling conical cell expansion in the petal blade epidermis, we screened more than 500 mutant homozygous lines from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) for mutants with abnormal conical cell phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>]. From this screen, we identified one mutant line, SALK_026489C, previously named <italic>an-t1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref034">34</xref>], with a T-DNA insertion causing a null allele of the gene <italic>AN</italic> (<italic>AT1G01510</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The <italic>an-t1</italic> mutant showed reduced tip sharpening of conical cells, exhibiting a phenotype of conical cells with wider tip angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g001">Fig 1A–1E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, we quantified cone parameters (cone angles and cone heights) of conical cells from wild type with normal conical tips and mutant with swollen conical tips. Quantification data showed that conical cells of the <italic>an-t1</italic> mutant had increased cone angles but no alternation in cone heights compared with those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g001">Fig 1A–1E</xref>). To further confirm the role of AN in conical cell shaping, one additional T-DNA insertion null mutant of the <italic>AN</italic> gene, <italic>an-t2</italic> (WiscDslox329F05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>), was obtained from the ABRC.

Taken together, these results demonstrated that AN plays a role in promoting the tip sharpening of conical cells at late developmental stages.</p>

<p>Given that a previous report has shown that loss of AN function causes accumulation of high ROS levels in leaves by an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref034">34</xref>], we investigated whether the wider-angled tips of conical cells of <italic>an</italic> mutants attributed to this abnormal ROS accumulation. Thus, we compared ROS levels between wild type and <italic>an</italic> mutants. ROS contain many molecules, with superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup>), the precursor for most other ROS, and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), being the two major components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref035">35</xref>]. We investigated O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> distribution using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref036">36</xref>] and 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref037">37</xref>], respectively. We found that both the <italic>an-t1</italic> and <italic>an-t2</italic> mutants accumulated higher levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in their petals compared with those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> distribution at the cellular resolution. Using the fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE) and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref039">39</xref>] to monitor O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by laser scanning confocal microscopy, respectively, we found that both the <italic>an-t1</italic> and <italic>an-t2</italic> mutants’ mature conical cells had significantly higher levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g001">Fig 1F–1I</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>an-t1 COM #1</italic> complementation line could fully rescue the ROS levels of <italic>an-t1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g001">Fig 1F–1I</xref>). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the <italic>AN</italic> expression was down-regulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Consistently, western blot analysis demonstrated that AN protein was also down-regulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s002">S2D–S2F Fig</xref>), implying that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> negatively regulates <italic>AN</italic> expression. Taken together, these results suggested that AN plays a role in conical cell shaping probably by negatively regulating ROS production.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned results raised the possibility that ROS levels play crucial roles in normal conical cell expansion of petal adaxial epidermal cells over the course of development. Thus, we quantitatively examined the O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> distribution in developing wild-type petals. Notably, we detected low levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> but not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the petals at stage 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), where petal adaxial epidermal cells display a flat shape. Remarkably, the levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> were slightly decreased in the petal adaxial epidermis at stages 9 and 10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), in which epidermal cells displayed roughly hemispherical morphologies, while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were almost not detected. At stage 10 and beyond, both the levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> became more and more apparent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) in the middle region of the petal blade’s adaxial epidermis, peaking at stage 14, as the petal grew and conical cells became increasingly sharpened. This may indicate that O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> plays crucial roles at both early and late stages during conical cell expansion and that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays roles at later development stages. Notably, adaxial epidermal cells in top region of the petal claws displaying relatively flat but not conical shape, did not show increased ROS levels in the late phases of petal development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Therefore, these results demonstrated that ROS show a developmentally regulated accumulation pattern during conical cell expansion.</p>
<p>We next compared ROS levels between wild type and <italic>an</italic> mutants at multiple developmental stages. Quantitative analysis showed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in the <italic>an-t1</italic> and <italic>an-t2</italic> mutants were significantly higher at stage 10 and beyond compared with those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), this being consistent with the observation that AN affected conical cell development at late stages. Furthermore, the <italic>an-t1 COM #1</italic> complementation line could fully rescue H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the AN-ROS pathway is a general mechanism important for cell shape in many different cell types, we next compared ROS levels in leaf pavement cells and trichomes between <italic>an</italic> mutants and the wild type. The <italic>an-t1</italic> mutant accumulated higher levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in their leaf pavement cells and trichomes compared with those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These findings suggested that AN plays a general role in regulating ROS levels in diverse cell types.</p>

<title>ROS homeostasis is required for normal conical cell expansion</title>
<p>The observations that mature petals of <italic>an</italic> mutants displayed reduced tip sharpening of conical cells and increased ROS levels raise the hypothesis that ROS act downstream of AN to modulate conical cell expansion in petal adaxial epidermis. To test this hypothesis, we next sought to determine whether exogenously supplied ROS was sufficient to generate conical cells with wider tip angles similar to those of <italic>an</italic> mutants. We then used 50 mM and 100 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to treat flower buds of stage 7 from wild-type inflorescences, respectively.

<p>To further investigate the biological functions of ROS in conical cell shape control, we next reduced endogenous levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Wild-type flower buds of stage 7 were treated with 5 mM n-propyl gallate (PG) or 1 mM KI, respectively. To generate long-term drug effects, we repeated the treatments four additional times, with 24 hours between each application. The flower buds developed into stage 14 mature petals were used for phenotypic analyses of conical cell. We found that removal of either O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could result in conical cells with wider tip angles (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g002">2D–2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s007">S7</xref>). Surprisingly, removal of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by KI treatment caused accumulation of high levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> in mature petal epidermis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). This result reflected that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> negatively regulates O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> biosynthesis during conical cell shaping through an unknown mechanism, consistent with a recent study showing that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> negatively regulates O<sub>2</sub><sup>• –</sup> levels in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref039">39</xref>]. However, the conical cell phenotypes induced by eliminating endogenous ROS levels were less severe than those by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> applications. Furthermore, consistently with the observation that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents were hardly detected at early stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), treating wild-type flower buds with KI at stage 7 for one-time treatment led to no alternation of conical cell shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In contrast, treating wild-type flower buds with KI at either stage 9 or stage 11 for one-time treatment resulted in wide-angled tips of conical cells compared with the mock treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Notably, treatment with PG at either stage 7, stage 9, or stage 11 for one-time treatment, respectively, could generate mature conical cells with wider tip angles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).

<title>Endogenously increased ROS levels by Rho GTPase ROP2 overexpression suppresses tip sharpening of conical cells</title>
<p>To further confirm the role of ROS in modulating conical cell shape, we investigated whether endogenously increased ROS levels could also lead to the phenotype of wide-angled tips of conical cells. The plant Rho GTPase, which functions as a central molecular switch to control diverse cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref040">40</xref>], has been shown to positively regulate endogenous ROS levels through directly binding to NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref041">41</xref>].

<title>Identification of potential AN interactors</title>
<p>Given that both <italic>an</italic> mutants and <italic>CA-ROP2</italic> plants exhibited a similar conical cell phenotype, correlating with accumulation of high ROS levels, we therefore explored the relationship between AN and ROP2. Thus, we tested whether AN functions to affect ROS production by either directly or indirectly activating ROP2. We then examined ROP2 activity in the inflorescences of wild type and <italic>an</italic> mutant lines. A comparison of the activation status of ROP2 in the wild type and the mutants <italic>an-t1</italic> and <italic>an-t2</italic> showed no significant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), whereas the <italic>spk1-4</italic> mutant with a mutation in <italic>SPIKE1</italic> as a control had reduced ROP2 activity as described previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref043">43</xref>]. This result suggested that AN may not act upstream of ROP2 in regulating ROS production.</p>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanism by which AN regulates ROS levels, we identified potential interacting proteins of GFP-AN using a GFP-trap-immunoprecipitation based approach coupled with mass spectrometry (MS)-based protein identification. Proteins were isolated from whole-inflorescence tissues, excluding mature flowers and developing siliques, of a transgenic line expressing AN-GFP under the 35S promoter to pull-down GFP-AN protein complexes using GFP-binding agarose beads. Protein samples pulled-down from a transgenic line expressing GFP alone under the 35S promoter were used as a control. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)-MS analyses were conducted from three independent harvests of inflorescence tissues from both <italic>p35S</italic>:: <italic>GFP-AN</italic> line and <italic>p35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> line to compose a biological triplicate. Gel analysis of the pull-down samples demonstrated a high specificity and efficiency for GFP-AN protein enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Pulled-down protein samples were analyzed by MS, and stringent data analyses identified proteins that are exclusive in all three GFP-AN replicates but not present in any of the control pull-downs. To identify proteins present in GFP-AN complexes that can be relevant to a role in ROS production, we chose targets already annotated with gene ontology (GO) biological processes related to oxidation-reduction process and oxidoreductase. Notably, among the identified AN-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s020">S1 Table</xref>), we obtained 49 proteins directly responsible for ROS homeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s020">S1 Table</xref>). These ROS-related proteins include CATALASE 2 (CAT2) and CATALASE 3 (CAT3), which can catalyzes the breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref044">44</xref>]. In addition, several NAD(P) superfamily proteins involved in the oxidation-reduction process were identified as putative AN interactors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s020">S1 Table</xref>). To confirm the role of CAT2 in regulating conical cell shape, we identified one mutant line <italic>cat2-1</italic> (SALK_076998) from the ABRC stock center, with a T-DNA insertion causing a null allele of the gene <italic>CAT2</italic> (<italic>AT4G35090</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s012">S12A and S12B Fig</xref>).

<title>The AN-ROS pathway cooperates with KTN1 to organize microtubule orientation during conical cell expansion</title>
<p>Recent reports have suggested that ROS influence cytoskeleton dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref046">46</xref>], and that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> directly activates the MAPK cascade to modulate the activities of MAP65 proteins, consequently affecting microtubule orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref049">49</xref>], although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be further explored. We next tested whether ROS are essential for cortical microtubule organization during conical cell shaping. Firstly, we investigated whether exogenously supplied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could lead to alterations in microtubule orientation using a microtubule reporter line expressing GFP-tagged α-tubulin 6 (GFP-TUA6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref050">50</xref>]. We used 100 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to treat flower buds of stage 7 from inflorescences of the <italic>GFP-TUA6</italic> reporter line, and the same treatment was repeated four additional times, with 24 hours between each application, to generate long-term H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effects. After treatments, we visualized microtubule arrays from the top view of the non-folded mature petals in confocal Z sections, allowing for the top view of conical cells. We quantified the microtubule alignment with "OrientationJ", a ImageJ plug-in, used for calculating the directional coherency coefficient of the fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref051">51</xref>]. A coherency coefficient close to "1" represents a strongly coherent orientation of the microtubules. We found that adaxial epidermal cells without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments had well-ordered circumferential microtubule arrays aligned perpendicular to the axis of conical outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), consistently with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>]. In contrast, adaxial epidermal cells of mature petals with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments displayed randomly oriented microtubules with reduced coherency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This result suggested that high levels of ROS accumulation inhibited microtubule ordering during conical cell shaping.

<p>To test whether ROS play a general role in regulating cell morphogenesis and microtubule organization in different cell types, we next investigated the effects on microtubule arrangements in both cotyledon pavement cells and leaf trichomes after exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application. Notably, analysis of cotyledon pavement cell phenotypes after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment showed that, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application induced a phenotype of reduced lobe length in pavement cells, showing severe defects of interdigitated growth in a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s016">S16A–S16D Fig</xref>). It has been reported that microtubule arrays play crucial roles in leaf pavement cell shaping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref053">53</xref>]. Consistently, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application induced increased alignment of microtubules in pavement cells in a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s016">S16E and S16F Fig</xref>). Exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment leaded to generate smaller leaves with shorter trichomes but no alternation of trichome branching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s017">S17A–S17E Fig</xref>). Furthermore, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in increased alignment of microtubules in trichomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s017">S17F and S17G Fig</xref>), which was similar to the result observed in leaf pavement cells. The observations that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in disordered microtubule arrays in petal conical cells and increased microtubule ordering in both pavement cells and trichomes, respectively, suggested that ROS may play diverse roles in modulating microtubule organizations in different cell types, although the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be further investigated.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned results showing that ROS played a role in mediating microtubule ordering, AN inhibited ROS production during conical cell development, and that AN and KTN1 acted in parallel pathways to modulate conical cell expansion, we hypothesized that AN acts through ROS to modulate microtubule orientation and that the AN-ROS and KTN1 pathways converge at a node to affect microtubule ordering during conical cell expansion. To test this hypothesis, we first compared microtubule organization patterns of the <italic>an-t1</italic> mutant with the wild type. Microtubule arrays in wild-type cells became increasingly ordered over the course of conical cell development and displayed well-ordered circumferential arrays at stage 14 of petal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g005">Fig 5C–5D</xref>), consistently with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>an-t1</italic> mutant conical cells that were shown to accumulate high ROS levels had randomly oriented microtubule arrays with reduced coherency throughout early and late developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g005">Fig 5C–5D</xref>), consistently with the observation that high levels of ROS accumulation caused wide-angled tips of conical cells with disordered microtubule arrays. Furthermore, in agreement with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref021">21</xref>], the <italic>ktn1-4</italic> mutant conical cells had randomly oriented microtubule arrays, similar to those observed in the <italic>an-t1</italic> conical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g005">Fig 5C–5D</xref>). Despite the conical cells of the <italic>an-t1 ktn1-4</italic> double mutant displayed more severe defects than the single mutants, the <italic>an-t1 ktn1-4</italic> double mutant conical cells displayed randomly oriented microtubule arrays, similar to those observed in the <italic>an-t1</italic> or the <italic>ktn1-4</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s018">S18 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that it is well established that KTN1 directly affects microtubule ordering through its severing activity at both microtubule nucleation and crossover sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref055">55</xref>], KTN1 may function in microtubule orientation independently of ROS. As predicted, analysis of ROS accumulation in mature petals of the <italic>ktn1-4</italic> mutant showed no significant differences as compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007705.s019">S19 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the AN-ROS pathway and KTN1 acted in parallel to modulate microtubule organization and conical cell shaping.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ROS function as signaling molecules for organ growth and normal cellular processes such as cell growth and cell division and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref029">29</xref>]. Our results provide definitive evidence for a role of ROS in modulating conical cell expansion of petal adaxial epidermal cells.</p>
<p>Previous reports showed that AN promotes pavement cell interdigitation in leaves, correlating with negatively regulating cortical microtubule ordering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref024">24</xref>], although the detailed molecular mechanism is unclear. Our findings in this study showed that AN promotes tip sharpening of conical cells in petals, correlating with positively regulating microtubule ordering, and that AN negatively regulates ROS levels, which in turn affects microtubule organization. Notably, we demonstrated that AN also plays a negative role in regulation of ROS levels in leaf pavement cells and trichomes. Therefore, we proposed that the AN-ROS-microtubule pathway is a general mechanism important for cell shaping in many different cell types.</p>
<p>In contrast to the role of AN in negatively regulating ROS production, ROP2 plays a role in positively regulating ROS production during conical cell shaping. AN and ROP2 may act antagonistically to regulate ROS homeostasis, although the molecular mechanisms by which AN suppresses and ROP2 promotes ROS production, respectively, remain to be further explored. Therefore, we propose that an endogenous balance between ROS accumulation and removal must be achieved and tightly regulated to generate microtubule reorientation and normal conical cell expansion of petal adaxial epidermal cells. Notably, loss of KTN1 function does not result in alternation in ROS levels in conical cells, suggesting that KTN1-mediated microtubule re-orientation may act in parallel with ROS signals during conical cell tip sharpening.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that ROS and redox cues have effects on microtubule behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref049">49</xref>]. Consistently with these reports, we demonstrated that both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and endogenously increased ROS levels induced by either loss of AN function or <italic>ROP2</italic> overexpression resulted in reduced microtubule ordering of the conical cell. Furthermore, the effects of diverse ROS types on cell wall properties have been well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref046">46</xref>]. ROS play critical roles in both cell-wall stiffening and loosening by promoting the formation of crosslinks between cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins, or by cleaving cell wall polysaccharides, respectively. Therefore, based on these findings, we cannot rule out the possibility that ROS also play a role in conical cell shaping by directly influencing cell wall properties. How ROS-mediated signaling regulates microtubule orientation remains unclear and will require extensive research in the future.</p>
<p>Given that previous reports have shown that KTN1-mediated microtubule severing plays critical roles in promoting microtubule rearrangements in response to mechanical stress in both the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> shoot apical meristem and cotyledon pavement cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref057">57</xref>], it is possible that mechanical forces could generate a signal to induce microtubule orientation in a KTN1-dependent manner during conical anisotropic expansion of petal adaxial epidermal cells. Interestingly, cells can respond to mechanical signals generated by cell geometry, providing a pervasive feedback on growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref058">58</xref>]. Future studies should aim to uncover the role of mechanical forces during conical cell shaping.</p>
<p>On the basis of our findings, we proposed a model to explain the molecular mechanism underlying ROS-dependent microtubule orientation in the regulation of conical cell shaping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007705.g006">Fig 6</xref>). According to this model, the AN-ROS pathway cooperates with KTN1 to jointly reorient microtubules from random to well-ordered transverse arrays, which is critical for the tip sharpening of conical cells. We hypothesized that the re-orientation of microtubules from random to well-ordered arrays may orient the deposition of cellulose microfilaments and generate the cell wall reinforcement throughout conical cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007705.ref019">19</xref>], consequently maintaining conical cell expansion and forming the final characteristic cell shape. Also, we hypothesized that mechanical forces could generate a signal to induce microtubule orientation. Conical cells could respond to mechanical cues generated by cell geometry, providing a feedback loop to define the final cell shape.</p>

<title>Enhancer mutant screening of conical cell phenotype of <italic>an-t1</italic></title>
<p>Approximately 10,000 seeds of <italic>an-t1</italic> were mutagenized using ethyl methane sulfonate. M<sub>2</sub> seeds were harvested from self-fertilized M<sub>1</sub> plants individually, and M<sub>2</sub> lines were screened for enhanced <italic>an-t1</italic> petal conical cells phenotypes. Among 2,000 independent EMS-mutagenized <italic>an-t1</italic> lines, two candidate enhancers were identified and described in this study. Candidate mutants were backcrossed to <italic>an-t1</italic> three times before further phenotypic analyses.</p>

<title>ROP2 activity assay</title>
<p>About 0.1 g of WT and mutant inflorescences were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen, respectively. Total proteins were extracted using extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM NaF,1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Twenty micrograms of MBP-RIC1-conjugated agarose beads were added to the protein extracts and incubated at 4°Cfor 2h on a rocker. The beads were washed four times in wash buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) at 4°C. GTP-bound ROP proteins associated with the MBP-RIC1 beads were boiled and used for analysis by western blot with a ROP2 antibody that was generated against the peptides QFFIDHPGAVPITTNQG (Abicode, China).</p>

After centrifuging at 14,000g for 15 min at 4°C, the supernatant was mixed with GFP-Trap agarose beads (gta-100, Chromotek) and rotated at 4°C for 4 hour. The immunoprecipitates were then separated in SDS-PAGE and digested with 0.025 mg/mL trypsin. The samples were put into a Thermo Scientific EASY trap column (100 μM × 2 cm, 5 μM, 100 Å, C18) for separation, and analyzed with Obitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Each sample was analyzed for 60 min with a resolution of 120,000, the scanning range of 375-1500m/z, AGC target of 4e5 and injection time of 50 ms. Simultaneously, the MS2 scanning was performed with the following parameter: resolution (50,000), activation type (HCD), injection time (105ms), AGC target (1e5). The raw data operated with Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific) were searched against with protein database (TAIR10_pep_20101214.fasta), and processed with FDR (false discovery rate)≤0.01 at both the peptide and protein level.</p>
