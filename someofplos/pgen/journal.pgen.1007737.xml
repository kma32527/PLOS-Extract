<abstract>
<p>Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and CTP synthase (CTPS) are two metabolic enzymes crucial for glutamine homeostasis. A genome-wide screening in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reveal that both ASNS and CTPS form filamentous structures termed cytoophidia. Although CTPS cytoophidia were well documented in recent years, the filamentation of ASNS is less studied. Using the budding yeast as a model system, here we confirm that two ASNS proteins, Asn1 and Asn2, are capable of forming cytoophidia in diauxic and stationary phases. We find that glucose deprivation induces ASNS filament formation. Although ASNS and CTPS form distinct cytoophidia with different lengths, both structures locate adjacently to each other in most cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Asn1 cytoophidia colocalize with the Asn2 cytoophidia, while Asn2 filament assembly is largely dependent on Asn1. In addition, we are able to alter Asn1 filamentation by mutagenizing key sites on the dimer interface. Finally, we show that <italic>ASN1</italic><sup><italic>D330V</italic></sup> promotes filamentation. The <italic>ASN1</italic><sup><italic>D330V</italic></sup> mutation impedes cell growth in an <italic>ASN2</italic> knockout background, while growing normally in an <italic>ASN2</italic> wild-type background. Together, this study reveals a connection between ASNS and CTPS cytoophidia and the differential filament-forming capability between two ASNS paralogs.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) is an essential enzyme for biosynthesis of asparagine. We have recently shown that ASNS, similar to CTP synthase (CTPS), can assemble into snake-shaped structures termed cytoophidia. In this study, we reveal that the ASNS cytoophidium stays close with the CTPS cytoophidium in most cells. Two ASNS proteins, Asn1 and Asn2, localize in the same structure. The Asn1 protein is important for the formation of the Asn2 filaments. Mutant cells with branching Asn1 cytoophidia grow slower than wild-type cells. Our findings provide a better understanding of the ASNS cytoophidium as well as its relationship with the CTPS cytoophidium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intracellular compartmentation is crucial for the function of a cell. In 2010, three studies reported that the metabolic enzyme CTP synthase (CTPS), forms filamentous compartments, termed cytoophidia, in fruit flies, bacteria and budding yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref003">3</xref>]. Subsequent studies revealed that the CTPS cytoophidium also exists in fission yeast, human and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref007">7</xref>]. CTPS can form cytoophidia not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>A genome-wide screening identified that at least 23 proteins, including CTPS and asparagine synthetase (ASNS), can form filaments in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref009">9</xref>]. Both CTPS and ASNS are glutamine-utilizing enzymes. While CTPS converts the nucleotide UTP into CTP, the enzyme ASNS catalyzes the conversion of L-aspartate into L-asparagine. Both enzymes have a significant impact on glutamine homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, there are two <italic>ASNS</italic> genes, <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ASN2</italic>, and two <italic>CTPS</italic> genes, <italic>URA7</italic> and <italic>URA8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref014">14</xref>]. Genetic studies have demonstrated that asparagine auxotrophy in yeast results from a combination of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ASN2</italic> mutations, while neither <italic>ASN1</italic> nor <italic>ASN2</italic> mutation can individually lead to total auxotrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref015">15</xref>]. Double <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ASN2</italic> mutants have no effect on cell cycle progression in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, while <italic>ASNS</italic> mutation lead to G1 phase arrest in hamster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref016">16</xref>]. <italic>ASNS</italic> knockdown significantly deregulated the expression of CDK4, CDK6 and Cyclin D1 and suppressed the growth of melanoma cells and epidermoid carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>To better understand filamentation of metabolic enzymes, here we use ASNS and CTPS in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> as examples. We are particularly interested in the following important questions: 1) Is ASNS filamentation sensitive to glucose deprivation? 2) Is ASNS present in the same cytoophidium as CTPS? 3) Does the Asn1 cytoophidium behave identically to the Asn2 cytoophidium? 4) What are the consequences when the ASNS filamentation is disturbed?</p>

<title>ASNS can form cytoophidia in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic></title>
<p>ASNS has been discovered to form cytoophidia in the cytoplasm and nucleus <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref009">9</xref>]. Using GFP-tagged strains, we confirmed that both Asn1 and Asn2 could form cytoophidia in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the GFP tagged Asn1 or Asn2 cells were cultured in different growth phases to test the cytoophidium abundance. Previous studies defined the different growth phases of budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref019">19</xref>]. We collected a population of cells cultured for 6 hours, 24 hours and 7 days. These three durations represent the exponential, diauxic and stationary phases, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). In the exponential phase, neither Asn1 nor Asn2 formed detectable cytoophidia under light microscopy. In contrast, we could detect Asn1 and Asn2 cytoophidia in the diauxic phase. The percentage of cells containing cytoophidia was 35.97% (Asn1) and 18.84% (Asn2), respectively. In the stationary phase, 80.69% of cells showed Asn1 cytoophidia and 90.82% cells contained Asn2 cytoophidia. After transitioning from the exponential phase to the stationary phase, it was clear that the abundances of both Asn1 and Asn2 cytoophidia were greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The alignment of the Asn1 and Asn2 proteins shows 88% identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These results imply that the formation of cytoophidia correlates with the growth phases and the cytoophidium responds to the change of culture condition. These data confirm our previous study in which we screened 4159 GFP-tagged proteins in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<title>Glucose deprivation induces ASNS cytoophidium formation</title>
<p>CTPS has been found to form filaments due to the deprivation of carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref003">3</xref>]. Among five filament-forming enzymes (Gcd2-GFP, Glt1-GFP, Psa1-GFP, Sui2-GFP and Ura7-GFP), only Ura7 reacted to carbon deprivation. To test whether carbon deprivation regulation is a CTP synthase-exclusive process or a more general process, we conducted the glucose deprivation experiment in Asn1-GFP and Asn2-GFP cells.</p>
<p>Results indicate that ASNS based filaments show similar behavior to CTP synthase-based filaments under carbon source starvation. Distilled water treatment induced filament formation in both Asn1-GFP and Asn2-GFP strains and YP media induced filaments in the Asn1-GFP strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). The add-in of glucose showed a severe inhibition effect to those starvation-induced filaments in both strains. Asn1 and Asn2 filament positive cells percentages were merely around 10%, far less than the percentage of Asn1 and Asn2 filaments when the strains reach the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). At the diauxic shift, when cells begin to utilize other carbon sources rather than glucose, the add-in of glucose pulls cells back to glucose metabolism. Results showed that the add-in of glucose severely reduced filaments in both Asn1-GFP and Asn2-GFP strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Spatial association of ASNS cytoophidia and CTPS cytoophidia</title>
<p>ASNS is responsible for the biosynthesis of aspargine, while CTPS catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction for the de novo synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotide CTP. In budding yeast, both ASNS and CTPS use glutamine as the substrate and both enzymes have the ability to form cytoophidia. To study the relationship between CTPS and ASNS, we co-expressed GFP-tagged Ura7 (CTPS) and mCherry-tagged Asn1 (ASNS) in the same strain. We classified the spatial relationship of the Ura7 cytoophidium and the Asn1 cytoophidium into the following four categories. 1) Adjacent (The Ura7 cytoophidium localizes adjacently to the Asn1 cytoophidium, either head-to-head or side-by-side). 2) Separated (The Ura7 cytoophidium and the Asn1 cytoophidium localize separately with each other). 3) Ura7 only (Only Ura7-GFP is detectable). 4) Asn1 only (Only Asn1-mCherry is detectable) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Among 791 fluorescence positive cells growing at the stationary phase, 84% fell into the “Adjacent” category, while only 9% cells showed separated distributions of Asn1 and Ura7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Moreover, very few cells showed only one type of cytoophidia (5% Ura7 only and 2% Asn1 only, respectively).</p>

<p>CTPS and ASNS can form cytoophidia both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Nuclear cytoophidia are much smaller and more difficult to be detected than cytoplasmic cytoophidia. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g003">Fig 3</xref> were mostly focusing on the cytoplasmic cytoophidia. To determine the relationship of nuclear cytoophidia between Ura7 and Asn1, we captured many cells under high resolution. In most cases, one nucleus contains one Ura7 positive cytoophidium and one Asn1 positive cytoophidium. The Asn1 nuclear cytoophidium seemed always localizing adjacently to the Ura7 nuclear cytoophidium, no matter whether the Asn1 cytoplasmic cytoophidium is adjacent to or separated from the Ura7 cytoplasmic cytoophidium in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The intimate spatial relationship both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus suggest a functional coordination between ASNS and CTPS cytoophidia. Further studies are required for understanding the coordinated filamentation between these two metabolic enzymes.</p>

<title>Asn1 is influential for the filamentation of Asn2</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to know whether filamentation of Asn1 and Asn2 is independent with each other. Our strategy was to knockout one <italic>ASNS</italic> and then tag the other ASNS protein with GFP. We generated the following four strains: 1) Asn1-GFP (A1G), 2) Asn2-GFP (A2G), 3) Asn1-GFP Asn2-knockout (A1G A2KO), and 4) Asn2-GFP Asn1-knockout (A2G A1KO). We checked the morphology and measured the abundance of the ASNS cytoophidia. ASNS cytoophidia were detectable in most A1G, A2G and A1G A2KO cells, but only very few A2G A1KO cells showed ASNS cytoophidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Whilst only 9.85% of the A2G A1KO cells showed the Asn2 cytoophidium, more than 80% of the A2G cells contain the Asn2 cytoophidium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007737.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These results make us believe that Asn1 has a great impact on the filamentation of Asn2.

<title>Dimerization interface of Asn1</title>
<p>The biosynthesis of asparagine from aspartic acid occurs in three steps: activation of aspartate, glutamine hydrolysis, and synthesis of a beta-aspartyl-AMP intermediate and its subsequent reaction with ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref020">20</xref>]. A study of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ASNS B (ASNB) showed that ASNS consists of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain that mediates the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and a C-terminal domain that is involved in the activation of aspartate by ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref020">20</xref>]. The dimeric interface of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ASNB is formed by both the N- and C-terminal region of each monomer, which includes an α-helix-turn-β-sheet structure (A13 –S40) of the N-terminal and an α-helix-turn-α-helix structure (V301 –M339) of the C-terminal domain, with both ligand-binding sites being distant from the dimer interface. Several salt-bridge pairs enhance the binding between two dimers, such as R17:D306, R25:D310, R28:D30, E48:R334 in ASNB. In addition, R25 and R334 could potentially form a cation-π interaction with Y313 and W34 respectively.</p>

<title>Disrupting dimerization of Asn1 affects its filamentation</title>
<p>We utilized a site-directed mutagenesis strategy to target the specific site on Asn1 dimerization interface. To avoid the complementary effect of Asn1 and Asn2, we knocked out Asn2 in order to study the Asn1 cytoophidium only. We first generated three GFP tagged Asn1 mutant strains (D330V, R354E and E48K). Then we knocked out <italic>ASN2</italic> in each of these three <italic>ASN1</italic> mutant strains.

<p>The two CTPS proteins, Ura7 and Ura8, colocalize with each other in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref003">3</xref>]. Like CTPS proteins, the two ASNS proteins, Asn1 and Asn2, are capable of assembling into cytoophidia in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Looking into the relationship between CTPS cytoophidia and ASNS cytoophidia, we find the following interesting features. 1) ASNS cytoophidia do not colocalize with CTPS cytoophidia, suggesting ASNS and CTPS form different structures. 2) Both CTPS and ASNS use glutamine as a substrate in budding yeast. 3) Both CTPS and ASNS form cytoophidia not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus. 4) The number of ASNS cytoophida, similar to that of CTPS cytoophidia, is one in the cytoplasm and one in the nucleus in many cells. 5) In most budding yeast cells that we analyzed, the ASNS cytoophidia localize adjacently to the CTPS cytoophidia. These two types of structures can touch with each other head-to-head or side-by-side. 6) The close spatial relationship between ASNS and CTPS does not limited to the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, we often observe that the ASNS filament sits next to the CTPS filament. 7) The length of the ASNS cytoplasmic cytoophidium is shorter than that of the CTPS cytoplasmic cytoophidium. 8) The length of the ASNS nuclear cytoophidium is shorter than that of the CTPS nuclear cytoophidium. 9) Nuclear cytoophidia are much smaller than cytoplasmic cytoophidia, whether the composition is CTPS or ASNS. 10) Both CTPS and ASNS cytoophidia are very sensitive to nutrient changes and growth phases. Further studies are required to understand the dynamic interaction and functional connection, if any, between ASNS and CTPS cytoophidia. Previous studies have shown that CTPS cytoophidia have interfilament interaction with inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) cytoophidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref022">22</xref>], suggesting that the interaction between two cytoophidia may be a phenomenon more general than we have appreciated.</p>
<p>Asn1 and Asn2 have identical distribution pattern, raising the possibility that Asn1 and Asn2 have the same filament-forming capability. To our surprise, our data indicate that Asn1 and Asn2 behave distinctly in the absence of its partner. Removing Asn2 does not prevent Asn1 to form cytoophidia in most cells. However, Asn2 alone can rarely form filaments in the absence of Asn1. The discrepancy between Asn1 and Asn2 provides an interesting angle to study the mechanism of the filamentation of metabolic enzymes in general. It would be interested to test if differences in transcription, translation, stability or half-life between Asn1 and Asn2 influence their filamentation outcomes.</p>
<p>Three mutations in the dimerization interface of Asn1 were designed aiming to disrupt the filament formation. We observe no obviously morphological changes of cytoophidia in ASN1<sup>R354E</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO and ASN1<sup>E48K</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO cells, although these two mutant strains show less cells containing cytoophidia than the wild-type strain. The third mutation, <italic>ASN1</italic><sup><italic>D330V</italic></sup>, results in branched cytoophidia, which are hardly seen in the wild-type strain. We also find that <italic>ASN1</italic><sup><italic>D330V</italic></sup> promotes cytoophidia formation, which reminds us the famous E6V mutation in beta hemoglobin leads to the polymerization of hemoglobin tetramers. Here the reason for Asn1 filamentation may be similar. A new protein-protein interface may be induced by the D330V mutation, either through a stacking or bridging and stacking mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref023">23</xref>]. The Asn1 protein level in ASN1<sup>D330V</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO cells is higher than that in ASN1<sup>WT</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO, ASN1<sup>R354E</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO and ASN1<sup>E48K</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO cells. However, the growth rate of ASN1<sup>D330V</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO cells are much slower than the other three strains. Currently we are unable to tell whether branched cytoophidia in ASN1<sup>D330V</sup>-GFP ASN2 KO cells contribute to high protein level and/or slow grow rate. Ultrastructural analysis of cytoophidia containing wild-type and mutant Asn1 proteins will help us gain insights into the molecular mechanism of ASNS cytoophidium assembly.</p>
<p>CTPS cytoophidia was first reported by three studies in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref003">3</xref>]. Eight years later, the physiological role of CTPS cytoophidia remains elusive. There were some lines of evidence support that forming filaments can sequester or promote the enzymatic activity of CTPS in various organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref028">28</xref>]. Does the ASNS cytoophidium have similar functions of the CTPS cytoophidium? Since there are quite a few metabolic enzymes showing the filament-forming capability, we speculate that cytoophidia have more general functions in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref022">22</xref>]. The close proximity between ASNS and CTPS cytoophidia raises the possibility that both enzymes function coordinately in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the cytoplasm and nucleus.</p>
<p>In summary, we use budding yeast as a model system to study the filamentation of two glutamine-utilizing enzymes CTPS and ASNS. We have detected the close relationship between CTPS and ASNS cytoophidia both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Moreover, we have demonstrated that two ASNS proteins exhibit differential filament-forming capability even their distribution seems identical in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Finally, we identify a mutation, <italic>ASN1</italic><sup><italic>D330V</italic></sup>, which leads to branched cytoophidia, increased protein level and delayed growth. Our results provide new opportunities to study how filamentation and compartmentation impact glutamine metabolism.</p>

<title>Genomic tagging</title>
<p>Fluorescent protein tagging in the genome was done by transforming yeast strains with a PCR product that encoded a selective marker gene and 5’ and 3’ 40-bp flanking sequences homologous to the target gene. pFA6a-mCherry(S65T)-kanMX6 plasmid was updated by pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007737.ref030">30</xref>]. pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-His3MX6 and pFA6a-mCherry(S65T)-KanMX6 were utilized in GFP tagging and mCherry tagging, respectively. The yeast strain BY4741 and plasmids were gifts from Jinqiu Zhou (SIBS, Shanghai, China). PCR products harboring the target gene sequence were used to transform the BY4741 haploid wild type strain.</p>
<p>After transformation and homologous recombination, transformants were selected based on the selective marker. Correct integration results in a C-terminal in-frame GFP fusion, whose expression is driven by the endogenous promoter.

<p>Yeast cells were spun down for 1 min at 4000 rpm/min. 100 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde were added to each tube to fix the cells for 10 min at room temperature, and then the cells were washed once with PBS.</p>
<p>A few microliters of cell suspension were mixed with agarose gel (1.2% low melting temperature agarose and 100 μM N-propyl gallate in YPD) to avoid movement of the cells during imaging. Images were acquired under 63x objectives on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted fluorescence confocal microscope. For the co-localization experiment, super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy was used. The abundance of filaments in cells was quantified by capturing images in at least four different areas containing a minimum of 100 cells each.</p>

<title>Mutagenesis</title>
<p>This method is applied to alter single nucleotides in DNA that has been previously cloned in a plasmid. The plasmid is then transferred back into yeast cells to generate a strain that carries the mutated version of the gene of interest on the plasmid but lacks the corresponding wild type locus in the genome in order to assess the function of the mutant allele. Insert fragments (including about 1 kb upstream of the promoter element and 0.5 kb downstream of the 3′-untranslated region of GFP-tagged target gene) were cloned into pRS315. Subsequently, this vector was transformed into an <italic>ASN1</italic> deletion strain. This strain was regarded as the control strain. The vector was also used as the template for point mutant vectors (E48K, D330V and R354E). DpnI was used to eliminate the template and then point mutant vectors were transformed into the <italic>ASN1</italic> deletion strain.
