<abstract>
<p>Many eukaryotic genes play essential roles in multiple biological processes in several different tissues. Conditional mutants are needed to analyze genes with such pleiotropic functions. In vertebrates, conditional gene inactivation has only been feasible in the mouse, leaving other model systems to rely on surrogate experimental approaches such as overexpression of dominant negative proteins and antisense-based tools. Here, we have developed a simple and straightforward method to integrate loxP sequences at specific sites in the zebrafish genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and oligonucleotide templates for homology directed repair. We engineered conditional (floxed) mutants of <italic>tbx20</italic> and <italic>fleer</italic>, and demonstrate excision of exons flanked by loxP sites using tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase. To demonstrate broad applicability of our method, we also integrated loxP sites into two additional genes, <italic>aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>tcf21</italic>. The ease of this approach will further expand the use of zebrafish to study various aspects of vertebrate biology, especially post-embryonic processes such as regeneration.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Some genes are expressed and function in a single tissue, and the effect of their loss on that tissue can be readily determined. Frequently, however, genes that are necessary for the development or maintenance of one tissue are also important for other tissues or cell types. Genes of the latter type are difficult to analyze because of the complications resulting from an organism having multiple defects in different tissues. The solution pioneered by mouse geneticists is to inactivate the gene of interest in only one tissue at a time. This elegant approach requires the ability to make specific edits to the genome, a technology that was not readily available to zebrafish researchers until recently. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, we have developed a simple, reliable, and efficient method to insert DNA sequences into the zebrafish genome that enable conditional gene inactivation. Our methodology will be useful not only for the study of genes that play important roles in multiple tissues, but also for the genetic analysis of biological processes which occur in adult animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Model system genetics is undergoing a major shift from forward to reverse genetics, driven by a combination of two key factors. The first is the increasing robustness of genomic and proteomic tools, which enable rapid identification of candidate genes with potential roles in biological processes of interest. The second factor is the proliferation of precise, efficient, and easy to use genome editing tools, from zinc finger nucleases to TALE-guided nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref001">1</xref>]). CRISPR/Cas9 in particular has made introduction of mutations into genomes of various organisms very straightforward and cost-effective.</p>
<p>Zebrafish first rose to prominence as a vertebrate model system that made development and organogenesis amenable to forward genetic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref003">3</xref>]. Over the past twenty years, use of the zebrafish has expanded to include biological processes which occur much later in ontogenesis. Examples of such biological processes include regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref004">4</xref>], various aspects of behavior from habituation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref005">5</xref>] to sleep-wake cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref006">6</xref>], and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Genetic analyses of post-embryonic processes in zebrafish have had to rely on overexpression of dominant negatives, knockdown using morpholino oligonucleotides, modulation using small molecules, and similar approaches. The inability to generate true conditional mutants has led scientists to try alternatives, such as mutant rescue using floxed Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref008">8</xref>], random gene trapping using conditional vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref011">11</xref>], or targeted integration of a Cre-inducible gene trap cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref012">12</xref>]. Only recently has generation of the first floxed zebrafish mutant been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref013">13</xref>]. In contrast, mouse geneticists have been refining conditional mutagenesis since the introduction of the term “floxed” in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>We have recently developed a method for integration of epitope-coding sequences into the zebrafish genome using oligonucleotide-directed repair of CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref015">15</xref>]. High germline transmission rates suggested that sequential integration of two loxP sites might be feasible. Single-stranded oligonucleotide templates have been successfully used to integrate loxP sites, either sequentially or two at a time, into the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref019">19</xref>]. However, since only non-palindromic mlox sites have so far been successfully integrated into the zebrafish genome using oligonucleotide templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref021">21</xref>], we were concerned that the palindromic nature of the loxP site may interfere with homology-directed repair in zebrafish embryos.</p>
<p>To test the feasibility of oligonucleotide-mediated integration of loxP sites, we selected four genes which play essential roles in development and may also be required for regeneration: <italic>tbx20</italic>, <italic>fleer</italic>, <italic>aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>tcf21</italic>. <italic>tbx20</italic> is required for heart development in mouse and zebrafish, but is also required for mouse cardiac homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref026">26</xref>]. <italic>tbx20</italic> is upregulated during zebrafish heart regeneration, and overexpression of Tbx20 improves the regenerative capacity of the mouse heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref028">28</xref>]. <italic>fleer</italic> is essential for ciliogenesis, and zebrafish embryos lacking <italic>fleer</italic> display pleiotropic phenotypes including laterality defects, kidney cysts, and failure to inflate brain ventricles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref029">29</xref>]. While it is not known if cilia are required for regeneration, their roles in mechanosensing as well as <italic>shh</italic> signal transduction suggest that they may be needed for regeneration to occur. <italic>aldh1a2</italic> mutants display pleiotropic phenotypes in neural, heart, and pectoral fin development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref031">31</xref>]. Upregulation of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> mRNA is the signature of endocardial and epicardial activation after cardiac injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref032">32</xref>]. Finally, <italic>tcf21</italic> mutants display defects in morphogenesis of branchial arch-derived structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref033">33</xref>]. <italic>tcf21</italic> is also constitutively expressed in the epicardium and epicardial-derived cells of adult zebrafish, and <italic>tcf21</italic> expressing cells are required for cardiac regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we found that single stranded oligonucleotide templates can efficiently direct integration of loxP sites into CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand breaks in the zebrafish genome. We performed sequential integration of two loxP sites to generate a conditional (floxed) allele of <italic>tbx20</italic>. We have used this conditional allele to demonstrate that early expression <italic>tbx20</italic> is essential for zebrafish heart development. Using <italic>fleer</italic> as a model, we demonstrate that Cre-revertible Gene Breaking Transposon (GBT) mutants can be readily converted into fully conditional alleles by the addition of a single loxP site. Using <italic>aldh1a2</italic>, we demonstrate that prior to -or in parallel with- generation of a floxed allele, the target exon can be readily removed to test if the deletion produces a phenotype. Finally, using <italic>tcf21</italic> as a model for small genes, we demonstrate that a loxP site can be integrated into the 5’ untranslated region without significantly impairing gene function.</p>

<title>Efficient oligonucleotide-mediated integration of loxP sites into the zebrafish genome</title>
<p>Conditional loss-of-function mutagenesis requires two loxP sites flanking an exon (or several exons) of a gene. We have recently developed a methodology for oligonucleotide-mediated integration of epitope-coding sequences into the zebrafish genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref015">15</xref>]. The relatively high efficiency of our method prompted us to speculate that conditional mutagenesis could be achieved by sequential integration of loxP sites. However, since oligonucleotide-mediated integration of wild type loxP sites into the zebrafish genome has not yet been demonstrated, we first needed to test if it was at all feasible. We selected <italic>tbx20</italic> for our initial experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and chose to flox its second exon because it encodes the first few amino acids of the T-box DNA binding domain, and because removal of the second exon would put exons 3–7 out of reading frame. Two highly active sgRNAs, <italic>tbx20</italic> sgRNA9 and <italic>tbx20</italic> sgRNA10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>), flanking the second exon, were identified by loss of a restriction enzyme site and/or T7 endonuclease assay (assessment of <italic>tbx20</italic>sgRNA9 activity is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To integrate a loxP site into intron 2 of <italic>tbx20</italic>, we designed an oligonucleotide template for homology directed repair of the double strand break induced by <italic>tbx20</italic> sgRNA10. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1c</xref>). Since we have frequently observed small indels at the homology arm junction in past experiments, we decided to flank the loxP sequence with three nucleotides of “spacer” sequence. We injected <italic>tbx20</italic> sgRNA10 along with nCas9n mRNA into embryos at the one cell stage, followed by injection of the HDR oligonucleotide with 21 nucleotide-long homology arms as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref015">15</xref>]. Indels were readily detected using the T7 endonuclease assay, and integration of the loxP site was detected by PCR in pooled injected embryos. Siblings of tested embryos were raised, incrossed, and screened for germline transmission of integration of the loxP site by nested PCR. One out of twelve incrosses produced embryos positive by both 5’ and 3’ nested PCR. Notably, nested PCR for the 3’ end worked poorly, with only one of three batches of embryos appearing barely positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1d</xref> top vs bottom panels). Poor amplification with loxP-specific primers turned out to be a recurring issue. Several different loxP primers were designed over the course of this work; for some loci, several loxP-specific primers were tested on injected embryos. Nevertheless, sequencing of the 5’ and 3’ PCR fragments indicated integration of the full-length loxP site, with a 10-nucleotide partial target site duplication at the 5’ end of the HDR oligonucleotide template. Integration of the loxP site was further confirmed by performing a short flanking PCR on individual embryos and sequencing the larger PCR fragment. Siblings were raised to adulthood and 16 were genotyped by tail clip. We identified four adults heterozygous for a loxP site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1e</xref>, red arrows, sequenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1f</xref>). Two additional fish had a single band corresponding to a loxP-containing allele, but no wild type band (yellow arrows). Since both parents were mutagenized, we interpreted this as the presence of a deletion removing at least one of the primer binding sites on the homologous chromosome.</p>
<p>In parallel, we performed experiments to integrate a loxP site into the first intron of <italic>tbx20</italic>. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a polymorphic poly-T stretch a few nucleotides downstream of <italic>tbx20</italic> sgRNA9 target site, with wild type AB fish having either 9 or 10 thymidines. The shorter stretch (9 thymidines) seemed more prevalent among the fish we were injecting. In this experiment, we tested an HDR oligonucleotide template with asymmetric-length homology arms, antisense to the PAM-containing strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref035">35</xref>]. We designed a 120 nt-long oligonucleotide template for HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1g</xref>), and injected it into 1-cell zebrafish embryos along with nCas9n mRNA and <italic>tbx20</italic>sgRNA9 RNA. Integration of the loxP site was detected in pools as well as in individual injected embryos as described in Materials and Methods. Siblings of tested embryos were raised to adulthood and screened for germline transmission of a loxP site by nested PCR as described in Materials and Methods. One out of three incrosses gave embryos that were positive for the loxP site both at the 5’ and 3’end by nested PCR. Integration of the loxP site was confirmed by sequencing individual embryos. Siblings of genotyped embryos were raised to adulthood and 16 fish were genotyped for presence of the loxP site by short flanking PCR. Three fish were found to be heterozygous for the loxP-containing allele, leading to establishment of the <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl136</italic></sup> loxP integration line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g001">Fig 1h</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of a conditional allele by sequential integration of loxP sites</title>
<p>To engineer a floxed allele, we incrossed F1 fish heterozygous for the intron 2 loxP site and injected the embryos with <italic>tbx20</italic> sgRNA9 and nCas9n mRNA, followed by injection of the HDR template oligonucleotide targeting intron 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). Injected embryos were raised to adulthood and genotyped for the presence of the intron 2 loxP site. Among 61 adults, 28 were heterozygous and 14 were homozygous for the loxP site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). All 42 were outcrossed and screened by nested PCR for integration of the loxP site into intron 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2c</xref>). Nine were positive by 5’ end PCR (3’ with regard to the HDR oligonucleotide), and 12 were positive by both 5’ and 3’ end PCRs. In many cases the 3’ end nested PCR fragment was larger than would be predicted, sometimes by a few hundred bases. For six germline transmitters (candidate founders), we extracted DNA from individual embryos and performed flanking PCR to assess germline mosaicism and to confirm complete loxP site integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The larger PCR bands observed in two candidate founders yielded poor quality sequences, and these founders were not followed up further. Sequencing the larger PCR bands from the four other founders revealed a high prevalence of insertions and deletions, most remarkably centered around the oligo-T stretch immediately 3’ to loxP integration (corresponding to the 5’ end of the HDR oligonucleotide). Subsequent re-sequencing of the locus revealed that the chromosome containing the loxP site in intron 2 had the longer 10-nucleotide oligo-T, while our HDR template oligonucleotide contained 9. Nonetheless, one of the candidate founders (NP#39) had transmitted integration of a full-length loxP site, albeit with an insertion of an additional 62 nucleotides immediately 3’ to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2d</xref>). Siblings of genotyped embryos from founder NP#39 were raised to adulthood.</p>

<title>Validation of the conditional (floxed) allele of <italic>tbx20</italic></title>
<p>Eight adult fish that were raised from an outcross of candidate founder NP#39 were tail clipped and screened by flanking PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2e</xref>). In four of the fish, a larger PCR band corresponding to a floxed allele was observed (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2e</xref>). Two of the four purified PCR bands were sequenced directly and found to contain identical full-size loxP integrations with a partial target site duplication. For further confirmation, these fragments were cloned into pJet PCR cloning vector and sequenced, and the resulting floxed allele was designated <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl145</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2d</xref>).</p>
<p>We then proceeded to incross these “F1” fish heterozygous for <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl145</italic></sup> and to inject some of the embryos with Cre mRNA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref036">36</xref>]. All uninjected embryos were phenotypically normal (n = 52). This observation, together with the fact that <italic>tbx20</italic> deficiency leads to severe cardiac defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref026">26</xref>], enabled us to conclude that the integration of two loxP sites does not significantly impair <italic>tbx20</italic> expression. Among embryos injected with Cre mRNA, approximately 25% displayed severe cardiac defects at 3 dpf in two independent experiments. We genotyped three embryos with severe cardiac defects and five siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2g</xref>), corresponding to images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2f</xref>, and found that the three abnormal embryos appeared to have undergone biallelic Cre-mediated excision of the second exon of <italic>tbx20</italic>. This observation was confirmed by sequence analysis of PCR bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2k</xref>). In contrast, phenotypically wild type embryos were either homozygous wild type or heterozygous for the (excised) floxed allele. Some Cre-injected embryos were raised to adulthood and genotyped. Adult fish heterozygous for the deletion were incrossed, and one quarter of embryos were found to display severe heart defects indistinguishable from that seen in Cre-injected embryos of the previous generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2j</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested if Cre-mediated deletion of the second exon of <italic>tbx20</italic> can be achieved in a temporally-regulated manner. We crossed fish heterozygous for the floxed <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl145</italic></sup> allele to fish expressing the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 under the control of the ubiquitin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref037">37</xref>]. Obtained embryos were selected for GFP fluorescence (the marker of Tg(<italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>)), incubated in 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 24 hours between 2 dpf and 3 dpf, and individual embryos were genotyped. Deletion of exon 2 of <italic>tbx20</italic> was readily observed in embryos incubated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, but not in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2h and 2i</xref>). As expected, all embryos were phenotypically normal because all had a wild type allele of <italic>tbx20</italic>. Together, these experiments led us to conclude that we have successfully engineered a fully conditional (floxed) allele of <italic>tbx20</italic>.</p>
<p>Many experimental approaches in genomics, proteomics and metabolomics require a large amount of starting tissue. Due to their small size, hundreds to thousands of zebrafish embryos or larvae may be needed for each experiment. Genotyping such large numbers of embryos is impractical, leaving two approaches: morpholino knockdown or germline replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref039">39</xref>]. We hypothesized that if embryos obtained from incross of parents homozygous for the floxed allele were injected with Cre mRNA, we would be able to obtain clutches of all-mutant embryos. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped adults obtained from <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl145</italic></sup> incross and identified homozygotes. Homozygous fish were incrossed, and embryos were injected with Cre mRNA at 1-cell stage. As expected, Cre-injected embryos displayed full <italic>tbx20</italic> mutant phenotype, while non-injected embryos were all phenotypically wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Thus, large clutches of all-mutant embryos, along with wild type controls, could be generated using this approach.</p>

<title>Temporally-regulated loss of <italic>tbx20</italic> function</title>
<p>In zebrafish, <italic>tbx20</italic> is expressed in bilateral cardiac precursors prior to their migration and coalescence. Expression appears to persist through larval development, and is upregulated in response to injury in adult hearts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref040">40</xref>]. In mouse, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Tbx20</italic> in adults leads to lethal cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, indicating that TBX20 is required not only for cardiac development, but also for homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref024">24</xref>]. To test when it is required for heart development in zebrafish, we sought to induce ubiquitous loss of <italic>tbx20</italic> function at different time points. While performing the experiments described in the paragraph above, we noted that the <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic> line is multi-copy, e.g. carries multiple unlinked integrations of the transgene. We established two lines, sub-designated <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>.<italic>C</italic> and <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>.<italic>F</italic> which were single-copy genetically (50% of progeny positive for the cardiac GFP (<italic>myl7</italic>:eGFP) transgenesis marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref037">37</xref>]), and crossed them a <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl122</italic></sup> partial deletion mutant obtained during epitope tagging experiments to be described elsewhere (Burg et al., unpublished, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We then crossed <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>.<italic>C</italic>, <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl122</italic></sup> double heterozygotes to <italic>tbx20</italic><sup><italic>tpl145</italic></sup> floxed homozygotes, and exposed embryos to 4-OHT at different time points. We found that exposure to 0.5 μM 4-OHT at 6 hpf reliably induced a full <italic>tbx20</italic> loss-of-function phenotype. In contrast, only a small subset of embryos exposed to 4-HT at 10 hpf displayed a milder cardiac phenotype, while all embryos exposed at 14 or 24 hpf were phenotypically normal. In order to eliminate the possibility that 4-HT was less effective at 10 hpf compared to 6 hpf, we performed qPCR to assess the completeness of Cre recombination at the DNA level. We found that excision was 99% complete in embryos exposed to 4-HT at 6 hpf, and 94% complete in embryos exposed at 10 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Thus, 4-HT is somewhat less efficient at inducing <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>-mediated recombination at 6 hpf compare to 10 hpf. Consequently, absence of phenotype in embryos exposed at 10 hpf may not be due to timing loss of Tbx20 function, but instead due to slightly lower efficiency of recombination.</p>
<p>To explore the possibility that 4-HT is taken up less well by older embryos, we next compared the toxicity of 4-HT at 6 vs 10 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s013">S2 Table</xref>). We treated pools of embryos from the same clutch with 4-HT ranging in concentration from 5 μM to 60 μM and found that embryos treated with 25 μM 4-HT at 6 hpf had a 73% survival rate, while embryos given the same dose given at 10 hpf had a 100% survival rate. Survival rate at higher doses dropped off significantly faster in embryos treated at 6 hpf compared to 10 hpf; however, even the 10 hpf embryos displayed toxicity effects at doses above 25 μM.</p>
<p>We then repeated our loss-of-function experiment by exposing 10 hpf embryos to 20 μM 4-HT, and 6 hpf embryos to either 5 μM or 0.3 μM 4-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2l</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s012">S1 Table</xref>), using two different single-copy <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic> drivers. We found the Cre-mediated loss of function was at least 95% efficient in embryos exposed to 20 μM 4-HT at 10 hpf, but the embryos displayed very mild, if any, cardiac abnormalities. Exposure to very low doses of 4-HT at 6 hpf induced near-complete excision of the second exon when <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>.<italic>C</italic> driver was used. In contrast, excision was significantly less efficient with <italic>ubb</italic>:<italic>CreERT2</italic>.<italic>F</italic> driver. However, we observed that 90%-efficient excision of the second exon was sufficient to induce a severe cardiac defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g002">Fig 2l and 2m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s012">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We also performed a semi-quantitative test for the time lag of CreERT2-mediated recombination after exposure to 4-HT. Pools of 20 embryos exposed to 5 μM 4-HT at 6 hpf and 10 hpf were collected 30 minutes, 1 hr, 2 hrs and 4 hours after exposure. The excision band was readily detectable after 2 hours in 6 hpf treated embryos, and 1 hour after 4-HT exposure in 10 hpf embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), indicating that a significant subset of cells may have lost <italic>tbx20</italic> function by then. Increased intensity of the excision band at 4 hours after exposure indicates that recombination is likely not complete yet at 2 hours after addition of 4-HT.</p>

<title>Conversion of Cre-revertible Gene Breaking Transposon allele to a floxed conditional allele</title>
<p>Gene Breaking Transposons (GBTs) have been used to generate a large collection of gene trap mutants in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref041">41</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref043">43</xref>] In a typical scenario, a GBT integrates into an intron of a gene and terminates the expression of the mutated gene, leading to complete loss of function. In most widely used GBT’s, the gene trap cassette is flanked by direct loxP sites. Expression of Cre recombinase leads to very efficient excision of the gene trap cassette, reverting the mutant phenotype and leaving a single loxP site flanked by terminal repeats of the Tol2 transposon. Thus, the addition of a single loxP site should convert such reverted gene traps to fully conditional (floxed) alleles.</p>
<p>In the <italic>fleer</italic><sup><italic>tpl19</italic></sup> mutants selected for these experiments, the gene breaking transposon was integrated into the first intron of <italic>fleer</italic>, eliminating expression of downstream exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g003">Fig 3b</xref>).

To engineer a conditional allele, we reviewed the exons of fleer for reading frame phase and the presence of conserved protein domains. Exons 2, 3, and 4 all begin and end in the same reading frame, and mRNAs lacking one or more of them may be translated into functional protein. Furthermore, the first 12 exons all begin and end in either phase 0 or phase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). We therefore decided to attempt to generate a deletion removing all three N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (likely important for protein-protein interactions) of <italic>fleer</italic> by engineering a loxP site into intron 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g003">Fig 3c and 3d</xref>). We sequenced the seventh intron from fish homozygous for the reverted gene trap, designed sgRNAs targeting it and identified <italic>flr</italic> sgRNA3 as being sufficiently active by Surveyor assay as described in (15). To integrate a loxP site, we designed a 110-base HDR template oligonucleotide with asymmetric homology arms, antisense to the PAM. Embryos were injected with <italic>flr</italic> sgRNA3, nCas9n mRNA, followed by injection of the HDR template oligonucleotide. Fish were raised to adulthood and screened for germline transmission of the loxP site by nested PCR. After screening 14 F0 fish, we identified one that transmitted a perfect integration of the loxP site. Siblings were raised to adulthood, and one out of twenty-one adult F1 fish was positive for the loxP integration (sequenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g003">Fig 3e</xref>) and was assigned allele name <italic>flr</italic><sup><italic>tpl141</italic></sup>.</p>

<title><italic>aldh1a2</italic> is the only retinal dehydrogenase highly expressed in regenerating zebrafish hearts</title>
<p>Pharmacological perturbation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling leads to severe defects in regeneration across various model systems and tissues (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref044">44</xref>]). Conditional mutants capable of inactivating RA signaling in specific cell types are needed to better understand the requirement of RA signaling for regeneration. Zebrafish have at least three genes coding for retinal dehydrogenases: <italic>aldh1a2</italic>, <italic>aldh1a3</italic> and <italic>aldh8a1</italic>. Upregulation of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> expression serves as the hallmark of endocardial and epicardial activation, making it an attractive target for conditional mutagenesis. In order to test which retinal dehydrogenases are likely to make an important contribution to retinoic acid production during regeneration, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from zebrafish hearts at 1, 3 and 5 days after cryoinjury and confirmed that <italic>aldh1a2</italic> is highly expressed and upregulated in response to cryoinjury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref045">45</xref>].

The observation that other RA-synthesizing enzymes are poorly, if at all, expressed in the regenerating heart suggests that loss of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> function is likely to lead to severe reduction in RA signaling in the regenerating heart.

<title>Deletion of exon 8 of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> results in a null mutant</title>

<p>To test if deletion of the eighth exon would lead to loss of function phenotypes comparable to those of previously published <italic>aldh1a2</italic> mutants, we co-injected both <italic>aldh1a2</italic> sgRNA1 and <italic>aldh1a2</italic> sgRNA4 along with nCas9n mRNA, and observed the appearance of a PCR band corresponding to the expected deletion product.

Approximately 25 percent of 3 dpf embryos lacked pectoral fins and had moderate to severe pericardial edema.

Integration of the loxP site was readily detected in pooled DNA of injected embryos as described in Materials and Methods. Embryos were raised to adulthood and seven incrosses (14 F0 fish) were screened for germline transmission of integration of the loxP site by nested PCR. Five pairs were positive by nested 5’ and 3’ PCR. In three cases, loxP integrations transmitted through the germline also contained an insertion of additional sequences within the 5’ homology arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).

<title>Integration of loxP site into the 5’ UTR of <italic>tcf21</italic></title>
<p>In contrast to the first four large, multiple exon genes that we targeted, <italic>tcf21</italic> is a small, two-exon gene, making it impossible to integrate both loxP sites into introns. We speculated that the 5’ UTR might be a suitable target for loxP integration. First, the loxP site does not contain ATG codons that would cause premature translation initiation. Second, most regulatory transcription factor binding sites are expected to be upstream of the transcription initiation site (not immediately downstream), making it less likely that the integration of a loxP site would disrupt a transcription factor binding site. Finally, 3’ UTRs may contain regulatory elements such as microRNA binding sites which are rather difficult to predict. We designed two short guides targeting the 5’ UTR of <italic>tcf21</italic>, and both were reasonably efficient at inducing DSBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007754.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).

Embryos injected with <italic>tcf21</italic> sgRNA5, nCas9n mRNA and the HDR oligonucleotide were raised to adulthood and screened for germline transmission of the loxP site. Out of nine incrosses, three were positive for germline transmission of a loxP site by nested PCR. One had an insertion of approximately 100 nucleotides and was not analyzed further. Single embryos from the other two transmitter pairs were analyzed. An incomplete loxP site was identified in one of the pairs, and integration of a full loxP site without indels was found in the second pair (<italic>tcf</italic>inxB). Siblings of analyzed embryos from <italic>tcf</italic>inxB were raised to adulthood and genotyped.

<p>Upon deciding which exon to flox, we recommend sequencing the target sites to identify polymorphisms compared to reference genome. Next, sgRNAs should be designed and tested by either direct sequencing of PCR fragments, T7 endonuclease assay or loss of a restriction enzyme site on bulk DNA from pooled embryos. Once active sgRNAs have been identified, experiments integrating the first loxP site should be performed. In the absence of conclusive data that certain HDR template performs significantly better than others (such experiments are not practical at the only level that matters–germline transmission), we recommend using the design we successfully used to integrate loxP into <italic>fleer</italic>, <italic>aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>tcf21</italic>: antisense to PAM, with 49-base 5’ homology arm and 21-base 3’ homology arm, with 3-nucleotide spacers flanking loxP site. As injected embryos are being raised, we then recommend to optimize nested PCR screening conditions DNA from pools of injected embryos. We found “plain” Taq polymerases (NEB #M0270, Thermofisher Scientific 2x PCR Master Mix Cat# AB-0575/DC and #EP0402, or similar) to be most suitable for nested PCR. In contrast, high-performance mixes such as Platinum Taq (Thermofisher #10966026) or Kapa 2G Fast ReadyMix + dye (Kapa Biosystems- KM5101) yield very high background and may only be used for the second (nested) reaction. It is also very helpful if primers for one end of the nested PCR are anchored within an exon. We recommend generating a deletion allele in parallel with integration of the first loxP site. Once highly active sgRNAs are identified, we recommend injecting a pair of sgRNAs flanking the exon to be floxed in order to confirm that removal of selected exon will yield an overt phenotype. We have been able to very efficiently delete exon 8 of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> using sgRNAs spaced just over 450 base pairs, but larger deletions are certainly feasible too (1, 2). An additional benefit of a deletion allele is that it can be crossed to Cre drivers of interest, eliminating the need to back-cross floxed allele to obtain homozygotes. Screening for germline transmission should be performed by nested PCR on pools of embryos obtained from incross. Positive crosses should be analyzed by performing short flanking PCR (ideally under 400 base pairs) on DNA from individual embryos. Bands corresponding to loxP-containing allele should be extracted from gel and sequenced to ensure presence of intact loxP site. Siblings of screened embryos should be raised to adulthood and loxP-positive F1s should be identified by flanking PCR as well. Two strategies can be used for integration of the second loxP site. If speed is the main priority, loxP-positive F1s can be in-crossed and second sgRNA/HDR oligonucleotide can be injected. The main drawback of this strategy that there is only 50% likelihood that the second loxP site will integrate into a chromosome already containing the first loxP. It is therefore necessary to genotype adults for presence of the first loxP site before out-crossing. Even though we successfully used this strategy to engineer a floxed allele of <italic>tbx20</italic>, we consider it impractical and would generally recommend to first generate adults homozygous for the first loxP site, incross them and then inject the second sgRNA/HDR oligonucleotide.</p>

<p>Our data clearly demonstrates the feasibility of conditional mutagenesis by oligonucleotide-mediated sequential integration of loxP sites into the zebrafish genome. Two aspects of our method are likely to have contributed to its success. First, based on the previous observation of a high rate of indels at the junctions between the integrated sequences and homology arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref015">15</xref>], we flanked the loxP site by 3-nucleotide spacer sequences. A loxP site consists of an 8-base core flanked by 13-base inverted repeats. The melting temperature of the inverted repeats is calculated at 32°C, meaning that a loxP site may form a hairpin in zebrafish embryos. The 3-nucleotide spacers may have facilitated homology-directed repair by providing spacing between the hairpin and homology arms. Indeed, successful oligonucleotide-mediated integration of the mlox site, which has 3 substitutions in one of the inverted repeats, has been reported by two laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref021">21</xref>]. We have not directly compared the efficacy of oligonucleotide templates with short or long homology arms, but 110-base long oligonucleotides with a longer 5’ arm, antisense to the PAM, have been successfully used in the majority of our experiments, leading us to recommend this particular design. Further gains in HDR efficiency may be achieved by using phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref049">49</xref>]. The second aspect of our method is screening for germline transmission by nested PCR. Over the course of our work, we have used several different loxP-specific primers and find that even in nested PCR, different loxP-specific primers need to be tested with different genomic primers to identify optimal pairs. The palindromic nature of the loxP site likely contributes to poor performance of loxP-specific primers.</p>
<p>Given that it takes a considerable amount of time to engineer a conditional mutant, it makes sense to ensure that the mutant will display a phenotype as early as possible. This is a two-step process. To determine the likelihood that the selected gene will be required for biological function of interest, it may be important to examine the expression of homologs which may provide identical or similar biochemical activity, as we have done for retinal dehydrogenases in regenerating hearts. Second, it is important to ensure that loss of the exon selected for floxing will lead to a severe or null phenotype. Using <italic>aldh1a2</italic> as the model locus, we demonstrate that a pair of sgRNAs can be used to direct very efficient excision of the target exon. While our sgRNA target sites were less than 500 base pairs apart, larger deletions can also be readily induced using sgRNAs spaced over 15 kilobases apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref050">50</xref>]. An additional benefit of a deletion allele is that it can be crossed to Cre drivers of interest, eliminating the need to back-cross the floxed allele to obtain homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007754.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative way to ensure that a conditional mutant will display a phenotype of interest is to start from a Cre-revertible Gene Breaking Transposon allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref043">43</xref>]. The very high efficiency of Cre/lox recombination makes it possible to establish a line homozygous for Cre-reverted GBT allele with minimal effort. Only one loxP site then needs to be integrated to convert such Cre-reverted gene traps into fully conditional alleles, as demonstrated with <italic>fleer</italic>.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of using CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate loxP sites into the introns is that intronic sequences are often of low complexity, have low G/C content, and are repetitive. These features may limit targeting possibilities by making it difficult to design highly efficient sgRNAs. Requirement for GC-rich 5’-NGG-3’ PAM sequence poses an additional complication. Nonetheless, we were able to find suitable targets in each gene and intron of interest. We have used several methods to assess guide RNA activity: T7 endonuclease assay, loss of restriction enzyme site, and direct sequencing of PCR fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref046">46</xref>]. Activity assessment is always performed on DNA extracted from a pool of at least 10 embryos, thus providing a quantitative estimate of average editing efficiency. In our experience, about half of the guides meet the minimum requirement of at least 50% editing efficiency. CRISPR/Cas9 systems recognizing A/T-rich PAMs, such as Cpf1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref052">52</xref>], will make editing of intronic sites even more straightforward.</p>
<p>Conditional mutagenesis relies on the availability of high quality, tissue-specific drivers of tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. In the mouse, the majority of drivers have been engineered by integrating CreERT2 into the specific loci, thus likely fully recapitulating the expression of the “driver” gene. In zebrafish, drivers are typically engineered by Tol2-mediated transgenesis of an expression cassette. High activity of Tol2 transposase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref055">55</xref>] means that many lines, at least initially, are multicopy, with each copy subject to position effects (for extreme examples, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007754.ref058">58</xref>]). As we have shown for two different copies of <italic>ubb</italic>:CreERT2, it is not sufficient to validate a given transgenic construct; the specific transgene integration, as a single-copy transgenic line, has to be validated for use in loss-of-function experiments.</p>
<p>Our genome editing experiments were performed in three different genetic backgrounds: AB (<italic>tbx20</italic>), TLF (<italic>aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>tcf21</italic>), and undefined pet store-derived (<italic>fleer</italic>). The majority of our experiments were performed in the United States, but initial integrations of loxP sites into <italic>tbx20</italic> were recovered in Germany. We therefore believe that our conditional mutagenesis methodology can be readily adapted by any laboratory and performed in any genetic background. Additionally, the oligonucleotide templates we used for homology directed repair are both inexpensive and widely available. The ability to efficiently generate conditional mutants in zebrafish offers new possibilities for understanding the roles of pleiotropic genes, and essential for studies of post-embryonic processes such as regeneration.</p>
