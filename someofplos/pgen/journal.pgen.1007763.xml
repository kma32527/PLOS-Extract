<abstract>
<p>Even across genomes of the same species, prokaryotes exhibit remarkable flexibility in gene content. We do not know whether this flexible or “accessory” content is mostly neutral or adaptive, largely due to the lack of explicit analyses of accessory gene function. Here, across 96 diverse prokaryotic species, I show that a considerable fraction (~40%) of accessory genomes harbours beneficial metabolic functions. These functions take two forms: (1) they significantly expand the biosynthetic potential of individual strains, and (2) they help reduce strain-specific metabolic auxotrophies via intra-species metabolic exchanges. I find that the potential of both these functions increases with increasing genome flexibility. Together, these results are consistent with a significant adaptive role for prokaryotic pangenomes.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Recent and rapid advancements in genome sequencing technologies have revealed key insights into the world of bacteria and archaea. One puzzling aspect uncovered by these studies is the following: genomes of the same species can often look very different. Specifically, some “core” genes are maintained across all intraspecies genomes, but many “accessory” genes differ between strains. A major ongoing debate thus asks: do most of these accessory genes provide a benefit to different strains, and if so, in what form? In this study, I suggest that the answer is “yes, through metabolic interactions”. I show that many accessory genes provide significant metabolic advantages to different strains in different conditions. I achieve this by explicitly conducting a large-scale systematic analysis of 1,339 genomes across 96 diverse species of bacteria and archaea. A surprising prediction of this study that in many ecological niches, co-occurring strains of the same species may help each other survive by exchanging metabolites exclusively produced by these different accessory genes. More pronounced gene differences lead to more underlying metabolic advantages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prokaryotes exhibit remarkable genome flexibility, with strains from the same species often containing dramatically different gene content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref004">4</xref>]. Intraspecific differences in gene content are often characterized by a “core” genome (genes common to all strains) and “accessory” genome (genes found in a fraction of strains) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref005">5</xref>]. While the core genome might represent a set of species-specific indispensable genes, we do not yet understand whether the accessory genome of a species is the result of neutral or adaptive evolution. Indeed, this is the subject of an ongoing debate: do the majority of prokaryotic accessory genes have negligible or positive fitness effects, i.e. are they neutral or adaptive?</p>
<p>Recent population genetics arguments support roles for both neutral and adaptive evolution as possible factors driving accessory genome evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref009">9</xref>]. For example, microbial species with more accessory genes also tend to have larger effective population sizes, as expected of genetic variation in a population under neutral evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref009">9</xref>]. On the other hand, models in which microbial genomes evolve in large, migrating populations, suggest that acquired genes can often be beneficial, as expected under adaptive evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref007">7</xref>]. However, these studies have only addressed broad aspects of microbial populations such as effective population size, migration, and the fitness effects of gene loss and gain. In response, subsequent criticisms of these studies have strongly expressed the need for more functional, gene-explicit and ecological analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref011">11</xref>]. Here I present the first such systematic analysis of 96 phylogenetically diverse prokaryotic species, which suggests that prokaryotic accessory genomes often provide significant metabolic benefits.</p>
<p>I chose to study metabolism as a possible explanatory factor for three reasons. (1) Metabolic genes dominate the functional content of accessory genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref012">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). (2) Metabolic interactions between microbes—especially interdependencies—can often be adaptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref014">14</xref>]. For instance, microbes that obligately cross-feed, i.e. that critically depend on exchanging metabolites with each other, can grow faster than their wild-type counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref013">13</xref>]. Such a fitness benefit can also drive genomes, in many cases, to lose genes and become metabolically dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref015">15</xref>]. If different genes are lost between different conspecific strains, this can lead to both metabolic interdependence, as well as accessory genomes (since different strains will have different metabolic repertoires) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref016">16</xref>]. (3) Databases such as KEGG contain already-curated genomes for several fully-sequenced strains. KEGG contains high-quality gene and reaction annotations, allowing us to accurately predict the biosynthetic capabilities of each strain under different conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, I ask to what degree accessory genes can metabolically benefit conspecific strains. For this, I have used genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions of 1,339 prokaryotic strains (corresponding to 92 bacterial and 4 archaeal species) from the KEGG database over 59 distinct nutrient environments. In general, my analyses reveal two beneficial roles for the accessory metabolic content of prokaryotes. First, I find that the accessory genome of most species harbours extensive biosynthetic potential, with several accessory genes providing strains with additional nutrient utilization abilities. Second, I find that pairs of strains from the same species often display a remarkable potential for metabolic interdependence, which scales with the amount of accessory genome content. These interdependencies have the ability to alleviate strain-specific auxotrophies in a particular niche through the exchange of secreted metabolites. My results are, from a metabolic standpoint, consistent with a possible adaptive evolution of accessory genomes.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>To obtain a large set of species pangenomes, I first collected a list of all prokaryotic species in the KEGG GENOME database, and filtered those that had complete genomes for 5 or more conspecific strains. This gave me 1,339 genomes (96 species), which I used in all my subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s012">S1 Table</xref>). To account for potential biases due to uneven phylogenetic sampling, I verified that a more restrictive choice of one species per genus did not significantly impact my results (55 species; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). For each strain, I then extracted all annotated genes and metabolic reactions from the KEGG GENES and REACTION databases, respectively. To quantify accessory genome content for every species, I used the well-studied genome fluidity measure, φ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref018">18</xref>]. For this, I calculated, across each pair of conspecific strains, the fraction of all genes in the pair that were unique to each strain. The average of this fraction over each species gave me its genome fluidity φ (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>I constructed metabolic networks for every individual strain, where each network contained the set of reactions corresponding to the strain’s genome in KEGG. I included gap-filled reactions when curated models were available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref019">19</xref>], though I verified that their addition did not impact my results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). I used these reaction networks to infer the biosynthetic capabilities of each strain under several different conditions. To define these conditions, I selected 59 different carbon sources, previously shown and commonly used to sustain the growth of diverse microbial metabolisms in laboratory experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s013">S2 Table</xref>). I associated with each carbon source a different nutrient environment or condition. In each condition, I included exactly one of the 59 carbon sources, say glucose, along with a set of 30 commonly available metabolites, which I assumed were always available (for example, water and ATP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s014">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess biosynthetic capability, I curated a list of 137 crucial biomass precursor molecules, often essential for growth (hereafter, “precursors”) from 70 experimentally verified high-quality metabolic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref023">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s015">S4 Table</xref>). Finally, to calculate what each strain could synthesize in a particular environment, I used a popular network expansion algorithm: called scope expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref025">25</xref>]. This algorithm determines which metabolites each strain can produce—its “scope”—given an initial seed set of already available metabolites. To start with, only those reactions whose substrates are available in the environment can be performed, and their products constitute the initial set of metabolites that can be produced. These metabolites can then be used as substrates for new reactions that can then be performed, and step by step, more metabolites can be produced. When no new reactions can be performed, the algorithm stops, giving the full set of metabolites that could be synthesized in the given environment. Such a calculation sidesteps the need for arbitrary assumptions of binary (yes/no) growth and optimality typically used in more complex metabolic modeling approaches such as flux balance analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref026">26</xref>] and is well-known for its ability to infer what metabolic networks can synthesize in diverse conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>I first investigated the capabilities of individual strains. Specifically, I was interested in the extent to which the accessory genes in each strain expanded the set of precursors that could be synthesized. For each species, I calculated, via network expansion, the list of precursors that could be produced per strain per condition. I then counted how many unique precursors each strain could synthesize across all conditions, i.e. by the accessory genes alone. From this, I computed, for every species, its accessory metabolic capacity α, defined as the average number of precursors (per strain per condition) produced exclusively due to the accessory genome.</p>
<p>I found that while for 18 species this quantity was zero, for the majority of prokaryotic species (81%), this number lay between 0.1 and 15.0 (mean 3.1; median 2.0). Further, α scaled positively with genome fluidity φ (Spearman's rho = 0.44; <italic>P</italic> value = 7 x 10<sup>−6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007763.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Since I observed that the accessory genome of different strains typically imparted different biosynthetic capabilities to different strains, I wondered if, in the same conditions, metabolic interactions between conspecific strains could further expand these capabilities. This could, for instance, indicate a potential dependence of an auxotrophic strain on another strain, i.e. a strain that cannot produce a crucial precursor in an environment. Such auxotrophies have been previously shown for example, in different strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> co-inhabiting the human gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>For each pair of conspecific strains in each condition, I calculated a metabolic dependency potential (MDP), defined as the average number of new precursors each strain has the potential to synthesize when grown as a pair versus alone. Here I assessed, in every pair, which metabolites that could be produced and secreted by one strain could subsequently allow the production of a new precursor in the other strain that it would not otherwise be able to make (i.e. was auxotrophic for). Note that this method does not count those metabolic interactions that can provide extra (functionally redundant) pathways to produce a precursor and supplement growth, and is thus more likely to represent actual or obligate dependencies. I verified that my approach can successfully predict such obligate dependencies by comparing with some well-documented intra- and inter-species pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref032">32</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>I found that while I could not detect any dependency potential for 17 species, surprisingly, the majority of species (82%) showed an MDP per strain per condition between 0.1 (for <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>) and 3.3 (for <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>), with a mean 1.7 and median 1.4. Interestingly, the 17 species for which I could not detect any MDP matched those with zero α (the leftover <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> showed low MDP = 0.5). Over all tested pairs with detected dependency potential (48%), commensal interactions were more common than mutualisms (29% versus 19%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007763.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This is because, in species with detected dependencies, not all pairs show dependency potential (on average 46% conspecific pairs do). The auxotrophies relieved by these dependencies varied from those for amino acids, vitamins, carbohydrates, and organic acids, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007763.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Strikingly, like α, MDP also scaled positively with genome fluidity φ, suggesting that greater amounts of accessory content can potentially sustain more conspecific metabolic dependencies (Spearman's rho = 0.56, <italic>P</italic> value = 4 x 10<sup>−9</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007763.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). For both α and MDP, considering medians instead of means did not impact my results (for α: Spearman's rho = 0.38, <italic>P</italic> value = 10<sup>−4</sup>; for MDP: Spearman's rho = 0.51, <italic>P</italic> value = 10<sup>−7</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s005">S5</xref> Figs). To verify that such potential conspecific dependencies are indeed ecologically realizable, I repeated my analysis, this time restricting it to those genomes, which were known to co-occur in microbial communities (29 strains across 14 species; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>). I found that my observed trend was still valid, namely MDP still scaled with φ, suggesting that several auxotrophies may indeed be reduced through within-species metabolic exchanges in nature (Spearman’s rho = 0.56, <italic>P</italic> value = 0.03; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the extent to which I detected the potential for obligate metabolic interactions between conspecific strains, I wondered whether such interactions are possibly common among prokaryotes. For this, I extended my study to analyze metabolic dependency potential between inter-specific strains (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>). I found that, indeed, strains from all species can metabolically depend on strains from at least one other species to alleviate potential auxotrophies across many different environments (with MDP ranging from 1.6 to 3.2, with mean 2.2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, I found that these interspecific metabolic interactions often involve accessory metabolic genes as well.</p>
<p>Taken together, my results suggest that a considerable fraction of prokaryotic accessory genomes contains potentially beneficial metabolic functions (upto 70% of accessory genes per strain across this study, with median 40%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). Specifically, I found that the accessory “metabolome”: (1) expands a genome’s biosynthetic potential, possibly allowing for niche-specific adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref034">34</xref>]; and (2) reduces potential auxotrophies via obligate metabolic interactions, also explaining how conspecific strains can coexist despite high competitive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref038">38</xref>]. The accessory genes that impart these functions are often different (median overlap 10%), suggesting that these are indeed distinct, non-redundant benefits. Moreover, apart from these additional biosynthetic abilities, the y-intercept for genome fluidity (at φ = 0.03 for both α and MDP) provides an estimate of metabolic redundancies (such as extra pathways).</p>
<p>My findings may additionally help explain the following observations: (1) metabolic functions are enriched in accessory genomes (median 50% in accessory versus 38% in core; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s008">S8C Fig</xref>); and (2) the variation in accessory metabolic genes exceeds the variation in genes of many other functions (metabolic variation being dominant in 81% of examined cases; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that the evolution of metabolic dependencies likely occurs via adaptive gene loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref039">39</xref>] (e.g. the Black Queen hypothesis). Such a mechanism suggests that metabolic dependency evolution can often lead to reduced genome sizes, but makes no comment on genome flexibility (i.e. gene content variability). My results also indicate that metabolic dependency evolution can impact genome flexibility as well. Specifically, more flexible genomes (with more variable gene content) are more likely to display a potential for metabolic interactions.</p>
<p>Can stochastic accessory gene turnover explain these results? To test this, I repeated my study with randomly assembled pangenomes. Within each species, I retained the core genes in every strain and shuffled the accessory genes between strains (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>). During this randomization, I preserved the observed within-species genome size distribution, strain number distribution, and ensured that any change in species’ genome fluidity was insignificant. I found that not only did this significantly diminish the metabolic benefits observed in each species, both measurements of α and MDP yielded non-significant correlations, suggesting that the mere presence of additional accessory genes is unlikely to explain my observed trends (for α: Spearman's rho = 0.01, <italic>P</italic> value = 0.9; for MDP: Spearman's rho = 0.17, <italic>P</italic> value = 0.1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s009">S9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s010">S10A</xref> Figs). The measured benefits remained lower than observed, even when I shuffled known operons of genes together instead of shuffling genes one by one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s009">S9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s010">S10B</xref> Figs; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>). I believe this is because often, prokaryotic operons do not contain complete metabolic pathways, but instead parts of them (in my data set, each metabolic operon encoded 1.5 reactions on average, while pathways typically had 4 to 5 steps). Collectively, this suggests that accessory gene acquisition is consistent with the coordinated gain of functional and beneficial pathways, which I believe provides further support for the accessory genes being maintained for adaptive reasons.</p>
<p>To summarize, here I addressed the debate on whether the accessory genomes of prokaryotes are beneficial. I found that, indeed, large fractions (about 40%) of the prokaryotic accessory gene pool can contribute to metabolic benefits. Specifically, such genes can allow microbes to produce a larger repertoire of crucial molecules, and facilitate the exchange of others. Since these functions can improve growth in many habitats, my results suggest that adaptation may explain accessory gene maintenance. Note, however that my analyses are only capable of detecting obligate metabolic dependencies and biosynthetic potential, and do not consider signaling, regulation, metabolic redundancy, etc. that could also play important functional roles and might indicate potential benefits due to additional accessory genes. Further work might also explain accessory genomes in those species, where I could not detect additional metabolic functions, if such roles are indeed there. Moreover, even in the context of metabolism, more detailed metabolic models, when available, may be used to probe even more precise fitness effects of intraspecies metabolic variability, including the effect of higher-order interactions. However, these studies would require knowledge of a large number of parameters such as reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and exact strain biomass compositions before they are feasible. Finally, systematic measurements of the fitness effects of all accessory genes, metabolic and otherwise, are needed for more complete estimates of the fraction of accessory genomes consistent with adaptive versus neutral evolution.</p>

Briefly, this algorithm is given a reaction network (one from each genome) and an initial “seed” set of available metabolites (each nutrient environment). It first determines which reactions can be performed by the network using only the nutrients in the environment. I assume that metabolites that are products in this initial set of reactions can be synthesized by the network, and can be subsequently used as reactants in new reactions. Again, I consider that the products of such new reactions can be synthesized by the network, and may allow additional new reactions to be performed. This continues step by step, till no no new reactions can be performed. All metabolites that can be produced over all such steps are defined as the “scope” of the metabolic network, i.e. I assume that these metabolites can be synthesized by the reaction network from the initial nutrients in the environment.</p>

For every genome, I considered each constituent gene’s KO number as its unique identifier.

The average over all pairs for a species was considered its genome fluidity φ.

I then explicitly removed these metabolites within every species from the scope of each strain and counted how many precursors remained in the corresponding “accessory” metabolome of every strain across all conditions. This gave me a number of additional precursors that could be synthesized per strain per condition for each species, and was defined as the species’ accessory metabolic capacity α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s016">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

For each pair, I calculated the scope for both strains first in “monoculture”, i.e. when grown alone. I then calculated, for every metabolite that could be produced by one strain but not the partner strain, whether or not its secretion could alleviate an auxotrophy in the partner. I specifically considered auxotrophies only for the 137 key precursors I had selected. I then counted each alleviated auxotrophy as a potential metabolic dependency, and the average number of dependencies (per strain per pair per condition) for each species was defined as its metabolic dependency potential, or MDP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s016">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Determining strain co-occurrence from microbial community data</title>

These data list all 16S rRNA sequences co-detected across several microbial community samples. Here, sets of sequences are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to different sequence similarity thresholds. To map these OTUs to the genomes in my study, I first obtained 16S rRNA sequences for all the 1,339 genomes I analyzed from KEGG. When multiple sequences were available for a given genome, I used the longest sequence and maped that as the unique 16S identifier for that strain. Then, using BLAST, I mapped OTUs in the co-occurrence data to the genomes in my study (where OTUs were binned with a sequence similarity threshold of 99%). Here, I used the BLAST bit score as my assignment criterion. I used the 689 genomes that could be mapped this way for further analysis. Here, across all microbial community samples, I asked which conspecific genomes co-occurred in at least one sample—from which I found 29 genomes corresponding to 14 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s018">S7 Table</xref>).

<title>Testing for the role of stochastic accessory gene turnover</title>
<p>To test if my observed correlations between φ and α as well as φ and MDP could be explained by random accessory gene turnover, I repeated my study with a “randomly assembled” pangenome dataset. I randomized genomes species by species. I first collected all available genomes for a species, and picked a random pair of these. I then shuffled the accessory genes in this pair in two ways: (1) gene by gene, and (2) operon by operon.</p>
<p>When shuffling gene by gene, for each strain pair, I randomly picked two genes, one from each strain in the pair, and swapped them. I repeated this several times before picking another conspecific pair from the same species. The number of swaps per pair was chosen such that each accessory gene was swapped once on average. I verified that the exact number of swaps does not affect my results. By the end of this process, I had a new set of genomes which had undergone “stochastic accessory gene turnover”. Note that in order to avoid any potential biases, this process preserves the observed genome sizes and strain numbers while only slightly affecting genome fluidity. I then repeated my α and MDP calculations for these “shuffled” genomes. This would test if the mere acquisition of extra genes from a species’ accessory genome could allow the expanded biosynthetic potential and metabolic dependencies observed in the data.</p>
<p>To identify operons, I used the ProOpDB database, which lists operon compositions for more than 1200 prokaryotic genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref041">41</xref>]. I found that this database had operon compositions available for 795 strains across 64 of the species in my study, which I used for the operon shuffling analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007763.s019">S8 Table</xref>). Here, when shuffling operons, I used a similar method as when shuffling genes, but instead of swapping merely randomly chosen genes from a pair of strains, I identified which operon they belonged to in their respective strain’s genome, and swapped all genes in those operons across the pair. I repeated these operon swaps several times for each strain pair, and for several pairs, at the end of which, I had another new set of randomly shuffled genomes.</p>

For conspecific dependencies, I used 2 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cross-feeding pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref013">13</xref>] and for inter-species, I used (1) a <italic>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic> pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref030">30</xref>]; (2) an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref014">14</xref>]; (3) an <italic>Lactobacillus bulgaris</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref031">31</xref>]; and (4) a <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> and <italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic> pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007763.ref032">32</xref>].

<p>Scatter plot of genome fluidity φ versus conspecific metabolic dependency potential (MDP), similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007763.g002">Fig 2</xref>, but here MDP was measured between inter-specific strains (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>). For each strain within a species, I measured its dependency potential with 25 randomly chosen strains from other species. Each point represents the average number of dependencies detected per strain per condition across several inter-specific pairs for one species. The solid black line represents a linear regression and the gray envelope around it, the 95% prediction interval. MDP is nonzero for all species in the study, though it does not increase significantly with increasing genome fluidity.</p>

<title>Comparing KEGG ortholog-based genome fluidity estimates with alignment-based estimates.</title>
<p>Scatter plot of genome fluidity φ using KEGG (this study; y-axis) versus estimates of φ reported in Andreani et. al., <italic>The ISME Journal</italic> (2017) (x-axis) for the 38 species common to both analyses. Each point represents one species. My measure uses KEGG’s orthologous gene categories for scoring gene presence-absence, whereas Andreani et. al. use thresholded sequence alignment to classify genes into “families”. The solid black line represents a linear regression. rho corresponds to Spearman’s nonparametric correlation coefficient and <italic>P</italic> to a one-way asymptotic permutation test for positive correlation. While my estimates are lower than those of Andreani et. al., they show consistent linear scaling and can thus still be used to infer trends.</p>
