<abstract>
<p>Development of a functional musculoskeletal system requires coordinated generation of muscles, bones, and tendons. However, how axial tendon cells (tenocytes) are generated during embryo development is still poorly understood. Here, we show that axial tenocytes arise from the sclerotome in zebrafish. In contrast to mouse and chick, the zebrafish sclerotome consists of two separate domains: a ventral domain and a previously undescribed dorsal domain. While dispensable for sclerotome induction, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is required for the migration and maintenance of sclerotome derived cells. Axial tenocytes are located along the myotendinous junction (MTJ), extending long cellular processes into the intersomitic space. Using time-lapse imaging, we show that both sclerotome domains contribute to tenocytes in a dynamic and stereotypic manner. Tenocytes along a given MTJ always arise from the sclerotome of the adjacent anterior somite. Inhibition of Hh signaling results in loss of tenocytes and enhanced sensitivity to muscle detachment. Together, our work shows that axial tenocytes in zebrafish originate from the sclerotome and are essential for maintaining muscle integrity.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The coordinated generation of bones, muscles and tendons at the correct time and location is critical for the development of a functional musculoskeletal system. Although it is well known that tendon is the connective tissue that attaches muscles to bones, it is still poorly understood how tendon cells, or tenocytes, are generated during embryo development. Using the zebrafish model, we identify trunk tenocytes located along the boundary of muscle segments. Using cell tracing in live animals, we find that tenocytes originate from the sclerotome, an embryonic structure that is previously known to generate the trunk skeleton. In contrast to higher vertebrates, the zebrafish sclerotome consists of two separate domains, a ventral domain and a novel dorsal domain. Both domains give rise to trunk tenocytes in a dynamic and stereotypic manner. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, an important cell signaling pathway, is not required for sclerotome induction but essential for the generation of sclerotome derived cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling leads to loss of tenocytes and increased sensitivity to muscle detachment. Thus, our work shows that tenocytes develop from the sclerotome and play an important role in maintaining muscle integrity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organogenesis relies on the precise and coordinated generation of many different cell types. One such example is the development of the musculoskeletal system, which provides support and mobility to the body. In a functional musculoskeletal system, muscles are attached to bones via tendons, which are essential to transmit mechanical force from muscle to bone. However, despite extensive studies on muscle and skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref002">2</xref>], relatively little is known about how tendon cells are generated during development.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, skeletal muscles and the axial skeleton arise from the somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref005">5</xref>]. The somite is further subdivided into three compartments as it matures. The sclerotome and dermomyotome are the first to form, and the dermomyotome further splits to form the myotome and the dermatome. Together, these three somitic compartments eventually form much of the trunk, including the skin (dermatome), muscles (myotome), and the axial skeleton (sclerotome).</p>
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays an essential role in somite patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref008">8</xref>]. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the notochord and the floor plate, and patterns the surrounding tissues including the somite. In the canonical pathway, Shh functions by binding to its receptor Patched (Ptc), which releases the repression on Smoothened (Smo). Activation of Smo leads to activation of the Gli family of transcription factors, resulting in the expression of downstream target genes, such as the receptor <italic>Ptc</italic>. Mutant analysis and grafting experiments have demonstrated the requirement of Hh signaling in sclerotome development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref009">9</xref>]. For example, <italic>Shh</italic> mutant mice have significantly reduced expression of <italic>Pax1</italic>, a sclerotome marker, during early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref010">10</xref>]. Similarly, deletion of both <italic>Gli2</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> results in severe loss of sclerotomal marker expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref011">11</xref>]. Conversely, ectopic expression of Shh induces and expands <italic>Pax1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref013">13</xref>]. Thus, the current model suggests that the canonical Hh pathway via Gli transcriptional activation plays a critical role in sclerotome development.</p>
<p>The sclerotome arises from the ventromedial region of the somite through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The formation of the axial skeleton by the sclerotome is largely mediated by the combined action of four transcription factors, Pax1, Pax9, Nkx3.1, and Nkx3.2 (also known as Bapx1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition to the axial skeleton, the sclerotome also contributes to the formation of axial tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref020">20</xref>]. Tendons contain fibroblasts (termed tenocytes) embedded in extensive collagen-rich extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref021">21</xref>]. Analysis of the expression of <italic>Scleraxis</italic> (<italic>Scx</italic>), encoding a tendon progenitor specific transcription factor, reveals that axial tenocytes are located along the junctions of somite borders in both mouse and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref022">22</xref>]. Although this <italic>Scx</italic>-expressing domain is defined as a fourth somitic compartment termed the syndetome, genetic analysis in chick reveals that the syndetome (and thus axial tenocytes) is induced from <italic>Pax1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> sclerotome along the sclerotome-myotome interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref019">19</xref>]. However, it remains unknown whether the generation of tendon progenitors from the sclerotome is an evolutionarily conserved process.</p>
<p>Land animals and fish species have very different requirements for bones and muscles. Land animals typically have more sophisticated skeletons to combat gravity and provide support and motility to the body. By contrast, fish can rely on the buoyancy of water to help support their bodies and thus depend less on a robust skeletal system, but they require large blocks of skeletal muscles to help them navigate through their viscous environment. This raises the question of whether the sclerotome has evolved differently to accommodate these different needs in fish. Early somite patterning in zebrafish follows a largely conserved developmental program as in mouse and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref008">8</xref>]. In both zebrafish and medaka, expression of the sclerotomal markers <italic>pax9</italic> and <italic>twist1</italic> in the ventral region of the somite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref025">25</xref>] suggests that basic sclerotome development is conserved between higher vertebrates and teleosts. Indeed, cell tracing experiments in zebrafish demonstrate that the presumptive sclerotome contributes to the formation of the vertebral column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref026">26</xref>]. Morpholino knock-down of key sclerotome genes in medaka, such as <italic>pax1</italic>, <italic>pax9</italic> and <italic>twist1</italic>, causes defects in vertebral column formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref025">25</xref>]. These results suggest a similar role for the sclerotome in skeleton development in teleosts.</p>
<p>In zebrafish, tendon progenitor cells can be identified by the expression of <italic>scleraxis a</italic> (<italic>scxa</italic>), similar to mouse and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref027">27</xref>]. Although cranial tendon progenitors are shown to be derived from the neural crest lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref027">27</xref>], it remains unknown how axial tendon progenitors are generated. Zebrafish axial tendon progenitors are located along the somite boundary, a structure known as the myotendinous junction (MTJ). The MTJ is functionally homologous to mammalian tendons, allowing the transmission of force between muscles during fish swimming. The structure of MTJ is maintained by the interaction between the extracellular matrix and the dystrophin-dystroglycan protein complex on the muscle membrane. Defects in MTJ, for instance in <italic>dystrophin</italic> or <italic>dystroglycan</italic> zebrafish mutants, result in severe muscle detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref031">31</xref>], reminiscent of phenotypes in muscular dystrophy patients. However, it is not clear how tendon cells interact with MTJ and regulate muscle attachment.</p>
<p>Here we describe the developmental origins of axial tendon cells in zebrafish. Through marker analysis, we show that the zebrafish sclerotome comprises two separate domains, distinct from mouse and chick. Hh signaling is not required for the induction of sclerotome but instead is essential for the migration and sustained marker expression of sclerotome derived cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging reveals that both sclerotome domains contribute to tenocyte formation in a dynamic and stereotypic fashion. Thus, our results suggest that the generation of axial tenocytes from the sclerotome is an evolutionarily conserved process.</p>

<title>Characterization of zebrafish sclerotome</title>
<p>During development, the maturing somite is split to form the dermomyotome, myotome, and sclerotome. To characterize sclerotome development in zebrafish, we determined the expression pattern of key sclerotome transcription factors, which are essential for sclerotome development in higher vertebrates. At 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), two distinct expression patterns were observed by RNA in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>pax9</italic> were primarily expressed in a domain located at the ventromedial edge of the somite, a smaller domain at the dorsomedial edge of the somite, and a population of cells surrounding the notochord in a metameric pattern.

<title>Characterization of the zebrafish sclerotome.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of two patterns of sclerotome marker expression. <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>pax9</italic> are expressed in both the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains along with sclerotome derived notochord associated cells. In contrast, <italic>pax1a</italic> and <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> are expressed only in sclerotome derived notochord associated cells. Lateral views of three somites are shown with the notochord (n) indicated. (B) Expression of sclerotome markers in wild-type zebrafish at 24 hpf in lateral and transverse (Trans.) views. Close-up images are expanded views of boxed regions in lateral images. <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>pax9</italic> are expressed in three regions: a small domain at the dorsomedial edge of the somite (short arrows), a large domain at the ventromedial region of the somite (long arrows), and cells surrounding the notochord (arrowheads). In contrast, <italic>pax1a</italic> and <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> are expressed only in cells around the notochord. The notochord (n) is indicated by brackets in close-up views and by dotted lines in transverse views. <italic>n</italic> = 60 embryos per staining. (C) Schematic drawings of Kaede lineage tracing experiment. <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>green</italic></sup> in the presumptive ventral sclerotome of a single somite at 18 hpf was photoconverted to <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> and followed over time. (D) Lineage tracing of sclerotome derived cells from the ventral sclerotome domain using Kaede. The presumptive ventral sclerotome domain (indicated by dotted line) was photoconverted to <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> at 18 hpf. At 24 hpf, a few sclerotome derived cells (arrowheads) were seen surrounding the notochord. By 40 hpf, many sclerotome derived cells have populated the region surrounding the notochord. <italic>n</italic> = 35 embryos. (E) Lineage tracing of sclerotome derived cells using Kaede in <italic>ola-twist1</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> transgenic line. <italic>ola-twist1</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> embryos were injected with <italic>Kaede</italic> mRNA at the one-cell stage, and photoconverted in the ventral region of a single somite at 18 hpf as described in (C). At 48 hpf, the red channel was first imaged to identify <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> expressing cells, then the <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>green</italic></sup> signal was completely photoconverted, and finally, the green channel was imaged in the same z-stack to reveal <italic>ola-twist1</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> positive cells. Most <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> sclerotome derived cells surrounding the notochord are positive for <italic>ola-twist1</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> (arrowheads). <italic>n</italic> = 21 embryos.

<p>Based on the expression pattern of these sclerotome markers, we hypothesized that the sclerotome gives rise to the cells surrounding the notochord. To test this possibility, we first performed a time course analysis of sclerotome markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). At 16 hpf, only <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> was expressed in the ventral regions of somites. At 18 hpf, <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> mRNA was also detected in the dorsal domains, along with the emergence of <italic>pax9</italic> expression in the ventral domains. By 20 hpf, <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1/pax9</italic> cells appeared to “sprout” from the ventral domain of each somite to surround the notochord in an anterior-to-posterior progression, coinciding with the expression of <italic>pax1a</italic> and <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> around the notochord. These results suggest that the ventral sclerotome domain likely gives rise to cells surrounding the notochord.</p>
<p>To confirm that cells migrate out of the ventral sclerotome to populate around the notochord, we performed cell tracing experiments using the photoconvertible fluorescent protein, Kaede [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Wild-type embryos were injected with <italic>Kaede</italic> mRNA at the one-cell stage. At 18 hpf, a small ventral region in a newly formed somite, containing the presumptive ventral sclerotome, was photoconverted to switch all green-fluorescent Kaede protein to red-fluorescent Kaede protein (<italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup>). This targeted photoconversion approach allowed us to strongly label the ventral somite with <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> expression but minimally in deeper tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). The perdurance of <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> protein can be used to trace the dynamics of converted cells over 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). By 24 hpf, a few mesenchymal-like <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> cells were seen to exit from the posterior end of the somite and migrate towards the notochord (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s002">S2C</xref>). By 40 hpf, 10–15 cells derived from the ventral sclerotome can be identified surrounding the notochord (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s002">S2C</xref>). Interestingly, these <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> cells derived from the presumptive ventral sclerotome always occupied a region about one half-somite more posterior to the somite of origin. Since the photoconversion approach also labeled a small patch of skin cells and weakly some deeper tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), we carried out additional experiments to confirm the sclerotomal identity of <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> cells around the notochord. We performed similar cell tracing experiments in <italic>Kaede</italic> mRNA injected <italic>ola-twist1</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> embryos. The medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) <italic>ola-twist1</italic> promoter has previously been shown to drive expression in sclerotome derived cells around the notochord in both medaka and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, most <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> cells surrounding the notochord were also positive for <italic>ola-twist1</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Together, our results suggest that sclerotome derived cells around the notochord originate from the ventral sclerotome.</p>
<p>In mouse and chick, the sclerotome is defined as one single domain located in the ventromedial region of the somite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref037">37</xref>]. By contrast, we identified a separate dorsal domain expressing several known sclerotome markers in zebrafish (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s001">S1B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the dorsal domain corresponded to non-sclerotome dorsal structures, we performed double fluorescent in situ hybridization using markers labeling the myotome and neural crest cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s003">S3A and S3B</xref>). At 24 hpf, no co-expression of <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> with either the myotome marker <italic>myoD</italic>, or the neural crest markers <italic>sox10</italic>, <italic>crestin</italic>, and <italic>mitfa</italic>, was observed in lateral or cross section analysis of zebrafish somites. In addition, <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells around the notochord were distinct from muscle pioneers, labeled by <italic>eng2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Together, our results reveal that the zebrafish sclerotome initially consists of two separate domains: a ventral domain analogous to that in higher vertebrates and a novel dorsal domain. As the somite matures, the ventral sclerotome domain also contributes to cells around the notochord. We referred to this population of cells as “sclerotome derived notochord associated cells” in this manuscript.</p>

<title>Distinct roles of Hh signaling in sclerotome development</title>
<p>Since Hh signaling is essential for sclerotome formation in mouse and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref013">13</xref>], we asked how Hh signaling regulates the development of zebrafish sclerotome. We treated wild-type embryos at the onset of somite formation (10 hpf) with cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of the Hh signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref038">38</xref>], and analyzed sclerotome marker expression at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Expression of <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>pax9</italic> in both the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains was largely intact in cyclopamine-treated embryos, suggesting that sclerotome can be induced in the absence of Hh signaling. By contrast, expression of <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, <italic>pax9</italic>, <italic>pax1a</italic>, and <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> in sclerotome derived notochord associated cells was completely abolished. To further test the requirement of Hh signaling in sclerotome development, we analyzed a ciliary mutant, <italic>iguana</italic>, which shows loss of the highest level of Hh response, but expansion of low level of Hh pathway activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref044">44</xref>]. Similar to those in cyclopamine-treated embryos, both dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains formed normally in <italic>iguana</italic> mutants, but marker expression in sclerotome derived notochord associated cells was largely absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Consistent with these results, Hh signaling activity, as indicated by <italic>ptc2</italic> expression, was present in <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells surrounding the notochord but absent in dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains in wild-type embryos at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Similar results were observed using a sensitive Hh signaling reporter, <italic>ptc2</italic>:<italic>Kaede</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref045">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Photoconversion experiments using the <italic>ptc2</italic>:<italic>Kaede</italic> reporter revealed that cells surrounding the notochord, likely derived from the sclerotome, displayed active Hh response at both 30 hpf and 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that the initial formation of sclerotome domains is not dependent on Hh signaling, but sclerotome derived notochord associated cells require high levels of Hh signaling.</p>

<p>The absence of marker expression in sclerotome derived notochord associated cells in cyclopamine-treated embryos suggests two non-mutually exclusive possibilities. First, marker expression in these cells is maintained by active Hh signaling. Second, the migration of these cells requires active Hh signaling. To test the first scenario, we blocked Hh signaling at 24 hpf, after cells from the ventral sclerotome have migrated and surrounded the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Control embryos showed strong <italic>pax1a</italic> and <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> expression in cells around the notochord at 30 hpf. However, in embryos treated with cyclopamine, <italic>pax1a</italic> and <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> expression was completely absent around the notochord. This result suggests that sclerotome derived notochord associated cells require active Hh signaling to maintain the expression of sclerotomal markers.</p>
<p>To determine whether Hh signaling also regulates the cell migration from the ventral sclerotome, we combined cyclopamine with <italic>Kaede</italic>-mediated cell tracing. Similar to previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), we labeled the presumptive ventral sclerotome domain at 18 hpf by photoconversion, incubated embryos with DMSO or cyclopamine at 22 hpf, and followed <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> sclerotome derived cells from 22 to 42 hpf using time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In DMSO-treated embryos, sclerotome derived cells migrate dorsally out from the posterior side of the ventral somite to surround the notochord slightly posterior to the original somite. These cells then divided 1–3 times to generate a population of cells surrounding the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s008">S1 Video</xref>). However, in the presence of cyclopamine, cells failed to migrate out of the ventral sclerotome domain to surround the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s009">S2 Video</xref>). These results suggest that migration of cells from the ventral sclerotome to surround the notochord also requires active Hh signaling. Therefore, although dispensable for the induction of sclerotome domains, Hh signaling is required in multiple steps during sclerotome development: first the migration of sclerotome derived cells, and then the maintenance of marker expression in these cells.</p>

<title>Zebrafish trunk tenocytes display a unique morphology</title>
<p>Previous work in chick suggests that axial tendon progenitors arise from a sub-compartment of the sclerotome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref020">20</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, close examination of cell tracing experiments revealed that a population of sclerotome derived <italic>Kaede</italic><sup><italic>red</italic></sup> cells eventually located along the myotendinous junction (MTJ) between neighboring somites at 42 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), reminiscent of tenocytes in mouse and chick.

Cell bodies of tenocytes were located at the somite boundaries as a single column along each MTJ.

Taking advantage of the mosaic nature of this transgenic line, we were able to visualize the morphology of individual tenocytes. The cell bodies of tenocytes were positioned at the medial edge of the MTJ, and they extended long, tree-like cellular processes within the intersomitic space towards the lateral surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This morphology can be better visualized in transverse sections, in which tenocytes extended multiple processes mediolaterally with an average length of 40 μm (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g004">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s007">S7</xref>).

<title>The sclerotome gives rise to axial tenocytes</title>
<p>To directly test whether different sclerotome domains give rise to axial tenocytes, we generated a <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic>:<italic>Gal4</italic> BAC transgenic line to trace the lineage of sclerotome cells. The cDNA encoding the Gal4-VP16 cassette was engineered into a BAC containing the <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> genomic region, including 144 kb upstream and 45 kb downstream regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We crossed this <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic>:<italic>Gal4</italic> line with a <italic>UAS</italic>:<italic>Nitroreductase-mCherry</italic> (<italic>UAS</italic>:<italic>NTR-mCherry</italic>) line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref049">49</xref>] to label not only the initial sclerotome domains, but also sclerotome derived cells due to the perdurance of the mCherry protein. The <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic>:<italic>Gal4; UAS</italic>:<italic>NTR-mCherry</italic> transgenic line (referred to as <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup>) faithfully recapitulated endogenous <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> expression, labeling the dorsal sclerotome, ventral sclerotome as well as sclerotome derived notochord associated cells at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), the dorsal and ventral sclerotomes marked by <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup> appeared to flank the myotome, labeled by <italic>α-actin</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>, at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). By 72 hpf, some <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup> positive cells were observed along the MTJ, displaying extensive long cellular projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s010">S3 Video</xref>), reminiscent of <italic>col1a2</italic><sup><italic>Kaede</italic></sup> tenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>).

To establish the lineage relationship between <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> sclerotome cells and <italic>col1a2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> tenocytes, we performed time-lapse imaging in <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup><italic>; col1a2</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> embryos. We found that <italic>mCherry</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> sclerotome derived cells were weakly positive for <italic>col1a2</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> at 26 hpf, but as <italic>mCherry</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> tenocytes emerged at the myotendinous junction, they showed much stronger <italic>col1a2</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s011">S4 Video</xref>). To further confirm this result, we took advantage of the nitroreductase enzyme expressed in the <italic>UAS</italic>:<italic>NTR-mCherry</italic> reporter which allowed us to ablate NTR-expressing cells.

<title>Stereotypic generation of tenocytes from different sclerotome domains</title>
<p>The zebrafish sclerotome consists of three compartments at 24 hpf: the dorsal sclerotome domain, the ventral sclerotome domain, and sclerotome derived notochord associated cells originating from the ventral sclerotome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We next asked how cells from each of these compartments contribute to tenocyte formation. We carried out confocal time-lapse imaging to assess the cellular origin of tenocytes at different dorsal-ventral positions along the “V” of MTJ. Cells were tracked at high temporal resolution using the <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup> transgenic reporter from 25 to 50 hpf. Tenocytes were identified at the end of the time-lapse movie, based on their position along the medial edge of the MTJ and the presence of cellular processes extending into the intersomitic space. By retrospective cell tracing, we showed that tenocytes can originate from progenitor cells at the dorsal sclerotome, ventral sclerotome, and sclerotome derived notochord associated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s012">S5 Video</xref>). Tenocytes along a given MTJ were almost exclusively generated by the immediate anterior somite (232/233 cells). Cells originating from either the dorsal or ventral sclerotome domains typically divided 1–2 times before generating 1–2 tenocytes along with other interstitial cells, likely osteoblast precursors. By contrast, sclerotome derived notochord associated cells often divided 2–3 times generating descendants including 1–4 tenocytes. For example, a single cell near the notochord (indicated by the green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) underwent multiple cell divisions, generating 2 tenocytes at the dorsal MTJ and 4 interstitial cells occupying the space in between the notochord, muscles and the spinal cord. At 12 hours of imaging (37 hpf), we saw the first cell occupying the MTJ. After about 17.5 hours of time lapse imaging (41.5 hpf), we observed that cells had occupied and filled the “V” of MTJ, consistent with the emergence of <italic>scxa</italic> expression by 42 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Our result suggests that tenocytes in the zebrafish trunk are established by 42 hpf and are derived from both dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains as well as sclerotome derived notochord associated cells. Interestingly, we found that some cells in the dorsal sclerotome domain migrated dorsally and generated fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s012">S5</xref> Video), suggesting that the dorsal sclerotome also contributes to the formation of other dorsal appendages.</p>

<p>(A) Snapshots of time-lapse imaging of an <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup> embryo between 25 hpf and 50 hpf. Tenocytes were retrospectively traced to determine their cells of origin. Four representative cells (at 0h) from the dorsal sclerotome (2 cells, white arrow and yellow arrowhead), sclerotome derived notochord associated cells (1 cell, green arrow), and the ventral sclerotome (1 cell, cyan arrow) were traced over 25 hours with their daughter cells indicated by the same colored arrows/arrowheads. Based on its initial position, the traced sclerotome derived notochord associated cell was likely derived from the same somite (S1) as the traced dorsal sclerotome cells, whereas the ventral sclerotome cell was from the adjacent posterior somite (S2). Three of the traced cells generated tenocytes along the MTJ (solid arrows) along with several other interstitial cells (open arrows) at the 24.5 hour time frame, whereas one traced dorsal sclerotome cell gave rise to 2 fin mesenchymal cells. The corresponding time-lapse movie is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007775.s012">S5 Video</xref>. <italic>n</italic> = 7 embryos. (B) Schematic representation of how tenocytes were quantified based on their origin and positioning along the MTJ. Starting locations of each sclerotome cell at 24 hpf were divided into three compartments: the dorsal sclerotome, the ventral sclerotome, or sclerotome derived notochord associated cells. At 48 hpf, tenocytes were quantified based on their final locations along the “V” of each MTJ: dorsal MTJ (grey, above the notochord), ventral MTJ (cyan, below the notochord), or MTJ tip (green, near the notochord). (C) Quantification of contribution of different sclerotome compartments to axial tenocytes. Tenocytes originated from the ventral sclerotome, sclerotome derived notochord associated cells, or the dorsal sclerotome were graphed based on their final locations along the MTJ. Since sclerotome derived notochord associated cells are derived from the ventral sclerotome, the graph on the right depicts the combined contribution of all cells from the ventral domain. Overall, the dorsal sclerotome mainly gives rise to tenocytes found in the dorsal MTJ, while the ventral sclerotome generates tenocytes along the entire MTJ axis. <italic>n</italic> = 233 tenocytes from 7 movies.

<p>To better quantify the cell tracing data, we subdivided axial tenocytes into three different domains based on their final dorsal-ventral positions along the MTJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). From the lateral view of the zebrafish, the “MTJ tip” represents the region of MTJ that sits directly on top of the notochord, while “dorsal MTJ” and “ventral MTJ” represents the regions of MTJ that are dorsal or ventral of the MTJ tip, respectively. We individually traced 233 tenocytes and correlated their final positions with the origin of progenitor cells (dorsal sclerotome, ventral sclerotome, and sclerotome derived notochord associated cells). Of the 233 tenocytes traced, 40 originated from the dorsal sclerotome, 108 from the ventral sclerotome, and 85 from sclerotome derived notochord associated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The dorsal sclerotome mostly contributed to tenocytes along the dorsal MTJ, accounting for 97.5% of dorsal tenocytes traced (39/40 cells). However, we did find 1 tenocyte (2.5%) in the MTJ tip, suggesting that the dorsal sclerotome also has the capacity to generate tenocytes more ventrally along the MTJ. By contrast, the ventral sclerotome generated tenocytes predominantly in the ventral MTJ (29/108 cells, 26.9%) and MTJ tip (78/108 cells, 72.2%), and occasionally in the dorsal MTJ (1/108 cells, 0.9%). Sclerotome derived notochord associated cells generated tenocytes in the MTJ tip (21/85 cells, 24.7%) and dorsal MTJ (64/85 cells, 75.3%), but never tenocytes in the ventral MTJ. Since we previously showed that sclerotome derived notochord associated cells originate from the ventral sclerotome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>), we conclude that the ventral sclerotome contributes to tenocytes in all 3 regions along the MTJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Together, our results suggest that the sclerotome of a given somite contributes to tenocytes along the posterior boundary of the same somite with a distinct spatial pattern: tenocytes along much of the MTJ come from the ventral sclerotome, while the dorsal sclerotome contributes to tenocytes primarily at the dorsal MTJ region.</p>

<title>Loss of tenocytes compromises muscle integrity</title>
<p>Since axial tenocytes originate from the sclerotome and the migration of sclerotome derived notochord associated cell is regulated by Hh signaling, we hypothesized that inhibition of Hh signaling would result in loss of tenocytes.

At 18 hpf, the dorsal and ventral domains of the sclerotome are induced independent of Hh signaling. By 24 hpf, cells begin to migrate from the ventral sclerotome and generate a population of cells surrounding the notochord (n). Cells always exit from the posterior end of the ventral somite, and eventually occupy an area around the notochord about one half-somite more posterior to the somite of origin. The migration of sclerotome derived notochord associated cells is dependent on Hh signaling. Hh signaling is subsequently required to maintain sclerotomal marker expression in these cells. By 48 hpf, the MTJ is populated by tenocytes derived from the sclerotome from the anterior somite. Three somites (S1, S2, and S3) corresponding to somite 17–19 are depicted in the model.</p>

<p>Since the MTJ plays an essential role in maintaining muscle integrity, we hypothesized that the reduction in tenocytes along the MTJ may affect muscle attachment. To test this possibility, we utilized the <italic>dystroglycan</italic> (<italic>dag1</italic>) mutant, a well-established model of muscular dystrophy in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref031">31</xref>]. <italic>dag1</italic> homozygous mutants have normal early muscle development but develop a progressive muscle detachment phenotype starting at 2 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref031">31</xref>]. Wild-type embryos or <italic>dag1</italic> mutants were treated with DMSO or cyclopamine from 24 hpf to 48 hpf, and then stained with antibodies to label Dag1 protein and all myofibers (A4.1025) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>). Cyclopamine-treated wild-type or <italic>dag1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> embryos showed normal Dag1 localization along the MTJ and normal muscle attachments as controls. By contrast, cyclopamine-treated <italic>dag1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants displayed a substantial increase in muscle detachment compared to DMSO-treated controls. Thus, loss of tenocytes by the inhibition of Hh signaling correlates with significantly enhanced muscle detachment phenotype. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that cyclopamine might compromise muscle integrity independent of tenocytes, our results suggest that tenocytes play an important role in maintaining muscle integrity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we characterize the development of the sclerotome in zebrafish and show that the sclerotome generates axial tenocytes. First, the zebrafish sclerotome consists of two separate domains in the somite, distinct from mouse and chick. Second, Hh signaling is not required for the induction of the sclerotome, but is essential for the migration and maintenance of sclerotome derived cells. Third, different domains of the sclerotome give rise to tenocytes in a stereotypic pattern, and loss of tenocytes results in enhanced susceptibility to muscle detachment.</p>

<title>Identification of a novel dorsal sclerotome domain in zebrafish</title>
<p>Using classic sclerotome markers, we identified one domain located at the ventromedial region of each somite similar to what has been described in mouse and chick, suggesting that some aspects of sclerotome development are conserved across evolution. Interestingly, we also identified a smaller dorsal domain, located at the dorsomedial edge of the somite, which has not been previously described in any species. Four lines of evidence suggest that the dorsal domain is a true compartment of the sclerotome. First, the dorsal domain expresses key sclerotome markers identified in mouse and chick similar to the ventral domain, such as <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, <italic>pax9</italic>, <italic>twist2</italic> and <italic>foxc1b</italic>. Second, the dorsal domain is distinct from the myotome and the neural crest lineage. Third, the dorsal compartment is not derived from cells migrating from the ventral domain. By the time the earliest marker expression emerges in sclerotome derived cells sprouting from the ventral domain at 20 hpf, the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains are already separate, suggesting that these two domains are induced independently. Most importantly, at the functional level, both the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains give rise to tenocytes in a similar stereotypic manner. Together, our results suggest that zebrafish sclerotome consists of two separate domains, at the dorsomedial and ventromedial edge of each somite. Consistent with our findings, <italic>twist1</italic> has been shown to express in the dorsal region of each somite in medaka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref025">25</xref>]. Similar dorsal expression has also been observed in <italic>nkx3-1</italic> in Xenopus (Xenbase). We propose that the bipartite sclerotome organization is conserved among lower vertebrates.</p>
<p>Why does zebrafish process two separate sclerotome domains rather than one single continuous domain as in mouse and chick? One possibility is that the dorsal sclerotome domain in zebrafish is required to generate some dorsal structures unique to lower vertebrates. Consistent with this idea, cell tracing in <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup> transgenic fish showed that some cells from the dorsal sclerotome domain migrate dorsally and contribute to fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold. Therefore, the dorsal sclerotome might be a unique feature for finned species. Since mice and chick do not have fins, the dorsal domain is not maintained and thus eliminated during evolution. An alternative scenario is that the difference in sclerotome organization between teleosts and higher vertebrates is due to the different requirements for bone and cartilage. In land animals, the skeletal structure must be able to resist the forces of gravity in addition to providing structural support for skeletal muscles. Because of the requirement for a more sophisticated skeleton, higher vertebrates such as mouse and chick might allocate a much larger proportion of the somite for the sclerotome to generate the required bone and cartilage. In contrast, zebrafish requires a larger myotome to generate the large muscles required for movement in their viscous environment. It is therefore plausible that during evolution, the increasing size of the sclerotome eventually merges the two separate sclerotome compartments, resulting in one large single sclerotome domain seen in higher vertebrates. To distinguish these two scenarios, one will need to perform detailed analysis of sclerotome development across different species along the evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>The divergence in sclerotome development between amniotes and teleosts is reminiscent of differential requirements of the notochord and the sclerotome in vertebral column formation. In amniotes, the segmentation of vertebral columns is determined by the sclerotome while the notochord is not intrinsically segmented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref052">52</xref>]. By contrast, recent work has demonstrated that segmentation of axial skeleton in zebrafish is dictated by notochord sheath cells but not the somite segmentation clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref056">56</xref>]. Combining our results, it suggests that the divergence in sclerotome development between amniotes and teleosts might underlie their different roles in vertebral column segmentation.</p>

<title>Unique roles of Hh signaling in sclerotome development</title>
<p>Hh signaling is an essential regulator of sclerotome development in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref037">37</xref>]. Early work in zebrafish shows that manipulation of Hh signaling results in changes in sclerotome marker expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref057">57</xref>]. Our work clarifies the distinct roles of Hh signaling during sclerotome development in zebrafish. In the absence of active Hh signaling, both the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains still form normally. However, the compartment marked by sclerotome derived notochord associated cells is completely lost. Consistent with this finding, active Hh signaling, indicated by the expression of Hh pathway target gene <italic>ptc2</italic>, is only present in sclerotome derived cells around the notochord but is absent from the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains. Together, these results suggest that Hh signaling is not required for the initial induction of sclerotome domains but is essential for the maintenance of sclerotome derived cells. Our model is in agreement with the phenotype of mouse <italic>Shh</italic> knock-out mutants, in which sclerotome formation still occurs, but the sclerotome appears to be much smaller with drastically reduced <italic>Pax1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref010">10</xref>], suggesting a conserved role of Hh signaling in sclerotome development. Indeed, the induction of sclerotome is likely due to the inhibition of BMP signaling, as elimination of two BMP antagonists, Noggin (Nog) and Gremlin1 (Grem1), in <italic>Nog;Grem1</italic> double mutants, results in complete disruption of sclerotome initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref058">58</xref>]. Whether BMP signaling plays a similar role in zebrafish sclerotome induction remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Combining cell tracing and marker analysis, our study reveals two distinct functions of Hh signaling during sclerotome development. First, Hh signaling is required for the directed migration of cells from the ventral sclerotome to surround the notochord. Photoconversion-based cell tracing experiments showed that cells fail to migrate out of the ventral sclerotome in embryos treated with a Smo antagonist, cyclopamine. Second, Hh signaling is required for the sustained marker expression in sclerotome derived notochord associated cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling after sclerotome derived cells finish their migration completely blocks the expression of sclerotome markers. As Shh is expressed in the notochord and the floor plate, it is conceivable that Shh first functions as a chemoattractant to mediate the migration of sclerotome derived cells towards the notochord, and then Shh activates the canonical Gli-dependent pathway in sclerotome derived cells to activate downstream target gene expression. Consistent with this model, previous work has shown that the transcriptional and chemotactic responses of Hh signaling bifurcate at or downstream of Smo, and cyclopamine can block Smo-dependent chemotaxis in commissural axons <italic>in vivo</italic> and cultured cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref060">60</xref>]. However, whether the migration of sclerotome cells is independent of Gli-mediated transcription still needs to be tested.</p>

<title>Tenocytes originate from the sclerotome</title>
<p>Early work in chick embryos has shown that tenocytes are derived from a somitic compartment in between the myotome and sclerotome, termed the syndetome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref019">19</xref>]. It is important to note that although it is described as a fourth somitic compartment, the syndetome is induced from <italic>Pax1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> sclerotome. Our analysis has revealed striking similarities in tenocyte development between zebrafish and higher vertebrates. First, zebrafish tenocytes are located between somite boundaries along the myotendinous junctions. This organization is conserved in mouse and chick, where tenocytes are found in the intersomitic mesenchyme between neighboring somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref022">22</xref>]. Second, zebrafish tenocytes have a similar profile of marker expression: they first express the early tenocyte progenitor marker <italic>scxa</italic>, and later express the differentiated tenocyte markers <italic>tnmd</italic> and <italic>col1a2</italic>. Third, by taking advantage of the perdurance of the mCherry protein in the <italic>nkx3</italic>.<italic>1</italic><sup><italic>NTR-mCherry</italic></sup> transgenic line, we show that both the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains can give rise to tenocytes along the myotendinous junctions. Similar to what has been described in chick, by the time tenocytes begin to express <italic>scxa</italic> at 36 hpf, expression of sclerotome markers in these cells has largely disappeared. Together, our analysis shows that trunk tenocytes in zebrafish are analogous to axial tenocytes in higher vertebrate in their anatomical locations, molecular signature, and developmental origin. In agreement with our findings, gene expression studies suggest that myoseptal cells in trout show similar characteristics of tenocytes in zebrafish and likely arise from the sclerotome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref061">61</xref>]. Thus, the generation of tenocytes from the sclerotome is an evolutionarily conserved process in vertebrates.</p>
<p>Our high-resolution analysis also reveals several novel features of tenocyte development in zebrafish. First, a mosaic labeling technique reveals that tenocytes display a unique morphology. Their cell bodies are located along the medial boundary of the myotendinous junction, and they project tree-like processes laterally into the intersomitic interface. These tenocyte processes are on average 40 μm in length, and can sometimes extend across the entire depth of the somite. As a result, the intersomitic space along the myotendinous junction is filled with fine tenocyte processes, consistent with previous ultrastructural studies of the MTJ by transmission electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref047">47</xref>]. This unique morphology might allow for maximal interactions between tenocytes and neighboring muscle fibers. Second, our cell tracing experiments show that different sclerotome domains make topologically distinct contributions to tenocytes. The dorsal domain generates primarily tenocytes at the dorsal MTJ, whereas the ventral domain can give rise to tenocytes along the entire dorsal-ventral axis. Cyclopamine-treated embryos show a severe reduction in the number of tenocytes, suggesting that Hh signaling also regulates tenocyte formation from the dorsal and ventral sclerotome domains. Third, our time-lapse movies show that the formation of tenocytes is a highly dynamic process, in which cells migrate out of the sclerotome, and undergo multiple rounds of cell divisions. Some of the daughter cells migrate to locate along the MTJ and change their multipolar mesenchymal morphology to tree-like tenocyte morphology, projecting long cellular processes into the space between the MTJ. This process is in contrast with the previous static view of tenocyte formation, in which tenocytes are induced at the boundary of the sclerotome by FGF (fibroblast growth factor) secreted from the myotome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref019">19</xref>]. Lastly, previous chick-quail chimera experiments suggest that a given <italic>Scx</italic>-expressing domain between two somites arises from the same two neighboring somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref019">19</xref>]. By contrast, we show that sclerotome domains from a given somite exclusively give rise to tenocytes located at the posterior boundary of the same somite. In an extreme rare case (1/233), we found sclerotome cells from one somite gave rise to a tenocyte located at the posterior boundary of the next somite. Our result is in contrast with the “resegmentation” model in vertebral formation, where a single vertebral column is formed by sclerotomes from two neighboring somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref062">62</xref>]. In zebrafish, tenocytes along a given MTJ all arise from the same somite immediately anterior to the MTJ.</p>

<title>Function of tenocytes in maintaining muscle integrity</title>
<p>Tendons are ECM-rich structures that connect muscles with bones. In zebrafish, the myotendinous junction is analogous to mammalian tendon, essential for the attachment of flanking muscle fibers. Interestingly, we show that axial tenocytes are located along the MTJ with their extensive processes sandwiched between adjacent somites. This raises the question: do zebrafish tenocytes play a regulatory role in maintaining muscle attachment? Based on the tenocyte morphology, it is plausible that ECM proteins, such as Col1a2, are synthesized in tenocyte cell bodies at the medial boundary of the MTJ, transported via cellular projections, and secreted in the extracellular space along the entire MTJ. In support of this idea, compromising tenocyte formation by the inhibition of Hh signaling results in a severely augmented muscle detachment phenotype in <italic>dystroglycan</italic> mutants. Similarly, depletion of Thrombospondin 4b (Tsp4b), an ECM protein secreted by putative tenocytes, in zebrafish, results in muscle detachments upon contraction due to defects of ECM assembly in the MTJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007775.ref046">46</xref>]. Although the precise mechanism of how tenocytes regulate muscle attachment is likely to be more complicated, our work highlights the importance of non-muscle cells in regulation of muscle integrity.</p>
<p>In summary, our study suggests the following steps for axial tenocytes formation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007775.g007">Fig 7G</xref>): (1) two distinct sclerotome domains in each somite are induced independent of Hh signaling. (2) Hh signaling promotes the migration of sclerotome derived cells to surround the notochord, and maintains the sclerotomal marker expression in these cells. (3) Both sclerotome domains and sclerotome derived notochord associated cells give rise to tenocytes along the MTJ in a stereotypic pattern. (4) Tenocytes undergo morphological changes to extend tree-like cellular processes into the intersomitic space. Thus, our work shows that axial tenocytes in zebrafish arise from bipartite sclerotome domains and are essential for maintaining muscle integrity.</p>

<title>Time-course analysis of tenocyte marker expression in wild-type zebrafish.</title>
<p>Expression of <italic>scxa</italic> and <italic>tnmd</italic> was analyzed every 6 hours between 24 hpf and 84 hpf. <italic>scxa</italic> expression appears in the ventral MTJ by 36 hpf and fills the entire “V” of the MTJ by 42 hpf.
