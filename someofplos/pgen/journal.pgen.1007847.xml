<abstract>
<p>The embryonic cuticle is necessary for normal seed development and seedling establishment in Arabidopsis. Although mutants with defective embryonic cuticles have been identified, neither the deposition of cuticle material, nor its regulation, has been described during embryogenesis. Here we use electron microscopy, cuticle staining and permeability assays to show that cuticle deposition initiates <italic>de novo</italic> in patches on globular embryos. By combining these techniques with genetics and gene expression analysis, we show that successful patch coalescence to form a continuous cuticle requires a signalling involving the endosperm-specific subtilisin protease ALE1 and the receptor kinases GSO1 and GSO2, which are expressed in the developing embryonic epidermis. Transcriptome analysis shows that this pathway regulates stress-related gene expression in seeds. Consistent with these findings we show genetically, and through activity analysis, that the stress-associated MPK6 protein acts downstream of GSO1 and GSO2 in the developing embryo. We propose that a stress-related signalling pathway has been hijacked in some angiosperm seeds through the recruitment of endosperm-specific components. Our work reveals the presence of an inter-compartmental dialogue between the endosperm and embryo that ensures the formation of an intact and functional cuticle around the developing embryo through an “auto-immune” type interaction.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Plant embryogenesis occurs deep within the tissues of the developing seed, and leads to the production of the mature embryo. In Arabidopsis and many other plant species embryo-derive structure (such as the cotyledons) are suddenly exposed to environmental stresses such as low humidity. In these species the embryonic cuticle provides a primary defence against environmental stress, and particularly dehydration, at germination. The formation of an intact and functional cuticle during embryogenesis is thus of key importance for seedling survival. Our work shows that a signalling pathway involving receptor-kinases expressed in the embryo epidermis, and a protease expressed in the endosperm tissue surrounding the embryo, is critical for ensuring the production of an intact cuticle. Furthermore, we show that a component of stress-related MAP-Kinase signalling in plants acts downstream in this pathway, possibly to mediate transcriptional responses characteristic of responses to stress. We propose that plants have redeployed a signalling pathway associated with stress resistance to ensure the formation of an intact embryonic cuticle prior to germination, and thus ensure seedling survival at germination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Arabidopsis seed is a complex structure composed of three genetically distinct compartments, the maternally-derived seed coat, the embryo, and the endosperm. After fertilization the expansion of the endosperm drives the growth of the seed. However, during later developmental stages the endosperm breaks down, leaving space for the growing embryo. By the end of seed development, only a single endosperm cell layer envelops the embryonic tissues (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref001">1</xref>]).</p>
<p>The endosperm is an angiosperm innovation, thought to have arisen through the sexualisation of the central cell of the female gametophyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref002">2</xref>]. The ancestors of angiosperms probably had seeds more similar to those of gymnosperms, in which tissues of the female gametophyte proliferate independently of egg cell fertilization to produce a nutrient rich storage tissue. However, the endosperm plays not only a nutritional role, but also a role in regulating embryo development. For example, the peptide CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED8 (CLE8) may act non-cell autonomously to regulate early Arabidopsis embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref003">3</xref>]. Recently, maternally-expressed peptides present in the central cell pre-fertilization, and subsequently in the early EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (ESR), were shown to regulate Arabidopsis suspensor development. Genetic analysis suggests that this regulation could be mediated by a pathway involving the Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase SHORT SUSPENSOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref005">5</xref>], although the receptor involved remains unidentified.</p>
<p>In previous work we showed genetically that the ESR-specific subtilisin protease Abnormal LEaf-shape1 (ALE1) acts in the same genetic pathway as two embryonically-expressed receptor kinases, GASSHO1 [(GSO1) also known as SCHENGEN3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref006">6</xref>]] and GASSHO2 (GSO2), to control the formation of the embryonic cuticle in developing seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref010">10</xref>]. Our results indicate that a seed specific inter-tissue signalling event is necessary for the formation of a functional embryonic cuticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref007">7</xref>]. The results of genetic studies have led us to speculate that the role of this pathway is to ensure the robust elimination of apoplastic continuity between the developing embryo and the surrounding endosperm thus gating molecular movement between the two compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The cuticle is the outermost layer of the aerial parts of the plant. It is a highly complex structure mainly composed of a lipid polymer (cutin) and waxes, either associated with the polymer (intracuticular waxes) or deposited on the top of it (epicuticular waxes) (recently reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref014">14</xref>]). Cutin and waxes are composed of complex mixtures of hydroxylated and very long-chain fatty acid derivatives, respectively. Cuticle structure and composition are highly regulated not only at the tissue level, but also in response to environmental stimuli such as drought, radiation and pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, several reports have highlighted the important role played by the cuticle in biotic interactions, and particularly in protecting plants from attack by bacterial pathogens (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref016">16</xref>]).</p>
<p>In Arabidopsis although little, if any, evidence exists for the presence of cutin-like substances in the wall between the mature egg cell and the central cell, by the end of embryogenesis the hypocotyl and cotyledons of the embryo are covered with a continuous cuticle which renders the germinating seedling impermeable to hydrophilic dyes, and resistant to water loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref017">17</xref>]. Cuticle biogenesis is considered to be a unique property of epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref018">18</xref>]. During plant development, epidermal cells are generated by anticlinal divisions of pre-existing epidermal cells so that each cell inherits an intact external cuticularised cell wall. In this respect the embryonic cuticle is atypical as it is deposited <italic>de novo</italic> at the interface between the developing embryo and endosperm. Although mutants with defective embryonic cuticles have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref017">17</xref>], only very fragmentary evidence about when the embryonic cuticle appears is present in the literature. Furthermore, the structure of the embryonic cuticle, its composition, the mechanisms via which it is deposited and its function during seed development remain unexplored. In this study we aimed to elucidate how the embryonic cuticle is formed, and to investigate how the ALE1 GSO1 GSO2 signalling pathway impacts its biosynthesis and deposition.</p>

<p>Since previous results showed that epidermal identity is not affected in <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref012">12</xref>], the expression of cuticle biosynthesis genes was analysed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> double mutant seeds (which show a stronger cuticle phenotype than <italic>ale1-4</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref007">7</xref>]). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g001">Fig 1</xref> (and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s002">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), no reduction in the expression of any of the cuticle biogenesis genes analysed was detected in the embryonic epidermis of this background, whereas reduced expression of both <italic>GSO1</italic> and <italic>GSO2</italic> was clearly visible. For these results, we concluded that although many genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis are co-expressed with GSO1 and GSO2 in the embryonic epidermis, their expression is not dependent upon GSO1 and GSO2.</p>

<title>Loss of GSO1/GSO2 and ALE1 function affects cuticle integrity</title>
<p>The cutin content of seedling cotyledons was assessed by measuring the quantities of the main cutin monomers released after cutin isolation followed by depolymerisation (mainly C16 and C18 ωOH (omega-hydroxy acid) and DCA (α,ω-dicarboxylic acid)). As clearly illustrated by the quantification of 18:2-DCA, the major component of Arabidopsis cutin, a slight loss in cutin load was detected in <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic>, but not in <italic>ale1-4</italic> cotyledons compared to wild-type. In contrast a very clear reduction in cutin load was observed in control plants lacking the acyltransferases GPAT4 and GPAT8 required for cutin biosynthesis, as has previously been reported in rosette leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We therefore investigated the cuticle permeability of etiolated cotyledons by submerging them in the hydrophilic dye toluidine blue, which can only penetrate internal tissues through defects in the cuticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref017">17</xref>]. Surprisingly, we found that the cotyledons of etiolated <italic>gpat4 gpat8</italic> seedlings showed a rather similar toluidine blue permeability to <italic>ale1-4</italic> seedlings and a considerably reduced permeability compared to <italic>gso1-1 gso1-2</italic> double mutants, suggesting that the <italic>gpat4 gpat8</italic> cuticle, although quantitatively strongly deficient in cutin monomers, remains partially functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Taken together with gene expression analysis, these results suggest that the ALE1, GSO1 and GSO2-mediated signalling pathway might impact cuticle organisation or integrity rather than the quantity of cuticle components produced by epidermal cells.</p>

<p>The process of embryonic cuticle deposition was investigated in more detail in wild-type (Col-0) seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref>). At the two-cell stage the embryo was surrounded by a thick cell wall but no electron dense material was detected at the embryo surface. At the mid-late globular stage, a cutin-like electron-dense material was detected in patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). From heart stage onwards, an apparently continuous layer of electron-dense cutin-like material was detected at the surface of the outer epidermal cell wall. Embryonic cuticle production therefore involves the <italic>de novo</italic> deposition and subsequent coalescence of “patches” of cuticular material at the surface of epidermal cells. Toluidine blue assays with wild-type embryos extruded at different developmental stages indicated that embryonic cuticle permeability started to reduce noticeably at the mid torpedo stage (after apparent gap closure), and that the embryo cuticle continues to become more and more impermeable during embryo development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the coalescence of visible gaps in the embryonic cuticle precedes a measurable reduction in embryonic permeability, and that cuticle reinforcement continues throughout embryogenesis.</p>

<p>In <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutant embryos the cuticle still showed discontinuities at the heart and walking stick stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In this background the cuticle also appeared thicker, but less condensed than that of wild-type embryos. The outer epidermal cell wall was also abnormally thick at later stages (compare embryonic cell wall thickness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g004">Fig 4D</xref> with that in 4F). Similar discontinuities were observed, although at a lower frequency, in the <italic>ale1-4</italic> background at the heart stage as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref010">10</xref>], but were less frequent at later stages, consistent with the less severe cuticle permeability phenotype observed in the seedlings of this background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). Consistent with these observations <italic>ale1</italic> and <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutant embryos remained permeable to toluidine blue throughout embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g005">Fig 5</xref>), with permeability phenotypes in fully expanded but immature embryos correlating closely with those observed in etiolated seedlings. Importantly <italic>ale1</italic> mutants were more permeable to toluidine blue at embryo maturity despite an apparent lack of visible gaps in the <italic>ale1</italic> cuticle after the torpedo stage. Interestingly fully expanded embryos of <italic>gpat4 gpat8</italic> mutants were not significantly more permeable than those of wild-type plants, suggesting that permeability defects observed in etiolated seedlings in this background could be due to the rapid expansion of embryonic tissues (especially the hypocotyl) after germination. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the ALE1 GSO1 GSO2 pathway is necessary for generating a continuous cuticle layer and further suggest that it controls “gap closure” during embryonic cuticle maturation.</p>

<p>Genes up-regulated in both mutant backgrounds showed a moderate over-representation in GO terms associated with responses to abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In contrast, genes down-regulated in both backgrounds, particularly at the heart stage, showed a very striking overrepresentation for GO terms linked to abiotic and biotic stress responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Mis-regulation of 19 of these genes was validated using additional independent biological samples by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The expression levels of these genes in seeds were generally low, and attempts to carry out <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization were inconclusive. However, for one target, <italic>SWI3A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref033">33</xref>], expression in the developing embryo predicted from <italic>in silico</italic> data was confirmed, and shown to be convincingly reduced in embryos of the <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Thus, consistent with the embryonic expression of <italic>GSO1</italic> and <italic>GSO2</italic>, some of the transcriptional regulation downstream of ALE1 GSO1 GSO2 signalling occurs in the embryo.

A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref039">39</xref>], reported aberrantly shaped seeds, resembling those of <italic>ale1-4</italic> mutants, in Arabidopsis <italic>mpk6</italic> mutants lacking the MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE6 (MPK6) protein, which acts downstream of PEPR signalling. In addition a proportion of <italic>mpk6</italic> mutant seeds were reported to rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref039">39</xref>]. We confirmed these phenotypes in the <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). A recent article has suggested that some seed defects in <italic>mpk6</italic> mutants may depend upon the genotype of the maternal tissues in the seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref040">40</xref>].

Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref040">40</xref>] <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants produce embryos with highly variable phenotypes, around 30% of which fail to develop a normal hypocotyl region (“deformed” embryos <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7</xref>). We found that 40–50% of both deformed and normal <italic>mpk6-2</italic> embryos showed abnormal permeability to the hydrophilic dye toluidine blue, consistent with the presence of embryonic cuticle defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This phenotype correlated well with toluidine blue permeability phenotypes observed in etiolated seedlings, confirming that defects were not simply a consequence of abnormal development post-germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).

Fertility in <italic>ale1-4 mpk6-2</italic> double mutants was similar to that in <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants, while triple <italic>mpk6-2 gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutant plants were viable but produced very few seeds. In terms of seed shape and cotyledon cuticle permeability, triple <italic>mpk6-2 gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutants had phenotypes identical to those observed in <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Since all <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutant seeds are twisted, non-additivity cannot be concluded from this phenotype. However, recent work has shown that additivity of toluidine blue staining phenotypes can be detected in mutant combinations with <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref041">41</xref>].

<p>MPK6 is involved in a plethora of reproductive and non-reproductive developmental processes and shows functional redundancy with other MPK proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref052">52</xref>] meaning that global transcriptome analysis in the <italic>mpk6-2</italic> background would likely be uninformative for this study. We therefore directly tested a subset of genes mis-regulated in <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> and <italic>ale1-4</italic> mutants for misregulation in <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants at three stages of embryo development. Five out of eight genes tested showed reduced expression in <italic>mpk6-2</italic> either at all three stages (<italic>SWI3A</italic>, <italic>WRKY70</italic> and <italic>NIMIN1</italic>), or in two out of three developmental stages tested (<italic>SIB1</italic> and <italic>NIMIN2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). Unsurprisingly given the relatively weak cuticle phenotype of <italic>mpk6</italic> mutants compared with <italic>gso1 gso2</italic> mutants, some genes showing strong down-regulation in the <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> mutants (<italic>WRKY33</italic>, <italic>WRKY46 and WRKY53)</italic> did not show any significant reduction in expression in the <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s013">S13 Fig</xref>) indicating that their transcriptional regulation downstream of GSO1 and GSO2-mediated signalling could be dependent on signalling components acting redundantly with MPK6. The expression of <italic>ALE1</italic>, <italic>GSO1</italic> and <italic>GSO2</italic> was not altered in <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s013">S13 Fig</xref>), indicating that MPK6 most probably acts downstream of GSO1 and GSO2-mediated signalling.</p>
<p>To further confirm this hypothesis, we analysed MPK phosphorylation in developing seeds from Col-0 and <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> double mutants. In seedlings, phosphorylation of MPK6 (and additional MPKs) can only be detected after elicitation (for example with the flg22 peptide). The response to flg22 is not attenuated in <italic>gso1/gso2</italic> mutant seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s014">S14 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). In contrast, MPK6 phosphorylation (but not phosphorylation of other MPKs) could be detected in un-elicited seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s016">S16 Fig</xref>). Following quantification, we found that the degree of phosphorylation of MPK6 was reduced by approximately 50% in <italic>gso1-1 gso2-1</italic> double mutant seeds compared to wild-type, suggesting that a significant proportion of MPK6 phosphorylation in seeds depends on the activity of GSO1 and GSO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s016">S16 Fig</xref>). Intriguingly, in seeds, a band corresponding to a second phosphorylated MPK was detected exclusively in <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), suggesting that the relatively weak <italic>mpk6</italic> seedling cuticle phenotype could be due to compensation by an as yet unidentified MPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref053">53</xref>].</p>

<title>MPK6 activity is required in the embryo, but not the endosperm, to maintain cuticle integrity</title>
<p>The strong expression of GSO1 and GSO2 in the embryonic epidermis, suggests that the activity of GSO1 and GSO2 in cuticle formation is required in the embryo. No promoters confirmed as specifically being expressed only in the embryo or embryo epidermis, have been published. To further confirm the spatial requirement for GSO1/GSO2-dependent signalling in the seed, we therefore complemented the <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutant either with the <italic>MPK6</italic> cDNA expressed under the ubiquitously expressed <italic>RPS5A</italic> promoter, or under the endosperm specific <italic>RGP3</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref055">55</xref>]. We were unable to complement either the misshapen seed/seed bursting phenotypes or the toluidine blue permeability phenotypes of <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants by expressing <italic>MPK6</italic> in the endosperm, but obtained full complementation of all phenotypes in plants expressing <italic>MPK6</italic> under the <italic>RPS5A</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007847.g008">Fig 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007847.s017">S17 Fig</xref>). Together with the results of our reciprocal crosses, these findings indicate that the seedling permeability phenotype of <italic>mpk6-2</italic> mutants is most likely due to signalling defects in the embryo. Seed size and seed bursting defects could be caused by lack of MPK6 in the testa, as suggested by reciprocal crosses, although this remains to be investigated in more detail. In order to further confirm the function of MPK6 downstream of GSO1/GSO2 signalling we attempted to express a constitutively active form of MPK6 under the <italic>RPS5A</italic> promoter in wild type and double mutant plants, but were unable to generate any transformants, potentially due to the critical roles played by MPK6 during early embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It this study, consistent with the similarity between GSO1/2 and PEPR1/2 proteins, we found that stress-associated kinase MPK6, which has been shown to act downstream of PEPR signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref056">56</xref>], shows constitutive phosphorylation in developing seeds, and that this phosphorylation is partially dependent upon GSO1 and GSO2. In addition, we showed that GSO1/GSO2, are required for the expression of a set of stress-related genes during early seed development. Our results suggest that GSO1/GSO2 dependent stress response-related signalling pathways are active in developing seeds. Because of the conserved transcriptional targets expressed downstream of GSO1/GSO2 dependent signalling, and in defence responses, this scenario is distinct from previously reported situations in which single pathway components, such as the co-receptor BAK1, play distinct roles in developmental and defence-related signalling cascades through interaction with multiple receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref058">58</xref>]. However, the role of the transcriptional targets of GSO1/GSO2 signalling in seeds remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Our work also shows that GSO1/GSO2, ALE1 and MPK6 act in a genetic pathway involved in ensuring embryonic cuticle integrity. We show for the first time that embryonic cuticle biogenesis involves the coalescence of discontinuous patches of cutin-like material that appear on the embryo surface at the globular stage, and that pathway mutants are either incapable of completing, or retarded in the completion of “gap closure” during this process. Interestingly, GSO1 (also known as SCHENGEN3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref006">6</xref>]) was recently shown to be involved in ensuring the continuity of another apoplastic diffusion barrier, the Casparian strip, which prevents the apoplastic movement of solutes from the cortex to the stele of the root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref006">6</xref>]. GSO1 may therefore form part of a general mechanism employed by plants for monitoring the “integrity” of apoplastic barriers formed during plant development.</p>
<p>The role of GSO1 and GSO2 in the closure of gaps in the nascent cuticle implies spatial regulation of signalling outputs at the subcellular level. Cytoplasmic signalling components which, like MPK6 might not be uncovered by transcriptome analysis but instead be modified post-translationally, are therefore likely to be of critical importance in GSO1 GSO2 signalling in the embryonic epidermis. Indeed, although MPK6-mediated signalling has most often been implicated in the control of transcription, particularly via the modulation of the activity of WRKY transcription factors, evidence for potential roles in cytoplasmic responses, for example during funicular guidance of pollen tubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref046">46</xref>] and control of cell division planes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref050">50</xref>], exist in the literature.</p>
<p>Cytoplasmic responses downstream of receptor-like kinases include the local production of apoplastic Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and/or calcium influxes, and indeed localized ROS production has been implicated in Casparian strip formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref061">61</xref>]. However although a plausible model has proposed that ROS release could mediate Casparian strip polymerisation though polymerisation of monolignols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref059">59</xref>], it is less obvious how ROS could directly affect the biosynthesis of an aliphatic cutin-based barrier, although a possible role for ROS in linking the cuticle to the cell wall has been evoked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref062">62</xref>]. ROS production has been shown to directly modulate the activation of MAPK signalling, providing a mechanism permitting the reinforcement of localised signalling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref064">64</xref>]. Another, potentially linked, possibility is that GSO1/GSO2 activity in the embryo could spatially direct the secretion of either cuticle components or enzymes and cell wall components necessary for their integration into the cutin polymer, in a system analogous to the rapid and highly localized deposition of callose observed upon hyphal penetration into epidermal cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref066">66</xref>]). Interestingly MPK6 has also been shown to be involved in phragmoplast formation during root cell division and therefore could be involved in the localised production/secretion of apoplastic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref050">50</xref>]. However, observing these processes <italic>in situ</italic>, within the living seeds, would require developments in microscopy which are not yet available.</p>
<p>Our work highlights several questions which merit further discussion. A first important question is whether the GSO1/GSO2 signalling pathway could play a role in protecting seeds, or more generally plants, against pathogen attack. Cuticle integrity in adult plants has been shown to be required for resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> pathovars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref068">68</xref>]. The action of the ALE1 GSO1/GSO2 signalling pathway in ensuring embryonic cuticle integrity is therefore likely to have a significant influence on embryo and seedling susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. However, we have also shown that GSO1/GSO2, ALE1 and MPK6 are necessary for the expression of known defence marker genes in seeds. Cuticle permeability phenotypes have not been reported in the literature for mutants affected in the defence markers identified in our transcriptome studies. This raises the question of whether the ALE1, GSO1/GSO2, MPK6 signalling pathway, in addition to mediating localised apoplastic modifications, could act at a more global level either to protect developing seeds from the ingress of bacterial pathogens (thus affecting vertical pathogen transmission), or to “prime” embryos against pathogen attack upon germination. Exploring this possibility would necessitate functionally separating susceptibility caused by cuticle defects from lack of immune priming, and will be technically very challenging, but could ultimately inform strategies aiming to reduce vertical transmission of plant pathogens.</p>
<p>The second question concerns how signalling via GSO1 and GSO2 is triggered in the seed in the absence of pathogens. In this study we consolidate data supporting the function of ALE1 in the same pathway as GSO1 and GSO2. We previously proposed that the function of ALE1, GSO1 and GSO2 in ensuring the apoplastic separation of the embryo and endosperm became necessary in angiosperms due to developmental constraints imposed by the sexualisation of the female gametophyte, which led to the simultaneous development of the embryo and surrounding nutritive tissues post-fertilization, rather than their sequential development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>ALE1</italic> expression is endosperm specific and, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref069">69</xref>], the recruitment of <italic>ALE1</italic> to a function in reinforcing the embryonic cuticle may have occurred during the emergence of the angiosperm lineage. The fact that the phenotype of <italic>ale1</italic> mutants is weaker than that of <italic>gso1 gso2</italic> double mutants, particularly at later stages of embryogenesis, may be due to redundancy with other members of the subtilase family in Arabidopsis, several of which are encoded by genes expressed in the developing endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref020">20</xref>]. Subtilases have been shown to be involved in defence responses and immune priming in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref071">71</xref>]. It is thus possible that ALE1 acts to produce an as yet unidentified ligand for the GSO1 and GSO2 receptors. In such a scenario the function of ALE1 in the seed could be analogous to the “immune priming” function previously reported for the subtilase SBT3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref071">71</xref>].</p>
<p>Such a scenario naturally raises a third, and important question, around the identity of the ligand of GSO1 and GSO2. Two sulfated peptides, CIF1 and CIF2, which can act as ligands for GSO1 during Casparian strip formation, have recently been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref073">73</xref>]. Testing the role of these molecules in developing seeds will be an obvious priority. However Nakayama and colleagues specifically reported that no cuticle defects (as gauged by cotyledon fusion phenotypes) were observed in <italic>cif1 cif2</italic> double mutants and the possibility that other signalling molecules could be involved in ensuring embryonic cuticle integrity therefore cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that endosperm-localised factors (like ALE1) may have been recruited to hijack a defence-signalling pathway involving the ancestor(s) of GSO1 and GSO2, and downstream signalling components including MPK6, and trigger an “auto-immune” type response in the embryo to ensure cuticle integrity. The future identification of further pathway components, and in particular the substrates of ALE1 and ligands of GSO1 and GSO2, will help to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

Each 60 bp primer is present in triplicate in each chamber for robust analysis, and as both strands. The array contains 35 754 probes (in triplicate) corresponding to genes annotated in TAIRv8 (among which 476 probes correspond to mitochondrial and chloroplast genes), 1289 probes corresponding to EUGENE software predictions, 658 probes to miRNA/MIRs and 240 control probes.</p>
<p>3 independent biological replicates were produced. For each biological repetition and each point, RNA samples were obtained by pooling RNAs from staged siliques containing embryos at the pre-globular to globular, or the young to late heart stage. Total RNA was extracted using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the suppliers’ instructions. For each comparison, one technical replicate with fluorochrome reversal was performed for each biological replicate (i.e. four hybridizations per comparison). The labelling of cRNAs with Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP was performed as described in the Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Low Input Quick Amp Labelling manual (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The hybridization and washing steps were performed according to the Agilent Microarray Hybridization Chamber User Guide instructions ((Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Two micron scanning was performed with InnoScan900 scanner (Innopsys, Carbonne, FRANCE) and raw data were extracted using Mapix software (Innopsys, Carbonne, FRANCE).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis of microarray data</title>
<p>Experiments were designed with the statistics group of the Unité de Recherche en Génomique Végétale. For each array, the raw data comprised the logarithm of median feature pixel intensity at wavelengths 635 nm (red) and 532 nm (green). For each array, a global intensity-dependent normalization using the loess procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref079">79</xref>] was performed to correct the dye bias. The differential analysis was based on log-ratio averaging over the duplicate probes and over the technical replicates. Hence the number of available data points for each gene equals the number of biological replicates and is used to calculate the moderated t-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref080">80</xref>]. Analysis was carried out using the R software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>). Under the null hypothesis, no evidence that the specific variances vary between probes was highlighted by Limma and consequently the moderated t-statistic was assumed to follow a standard normal distribution. To control the false discovery rate, adjusted p-values found using the optimized FDR approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007847.ref081">81</xref>] were calculated. We considered as being differentially expressed, the probes with an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. The function SqueezeVar of the library Limma was used to smooth the specific variances by computing empirical Bayes posterior means. The library kerfdr was used to calculate the adjusted p-values.</p>

<title>Quantitative gene expression analysis in seeds</title>
<p>Intact siliques were frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma). Total RNAs were digested with Turbo DNA-free DNase I (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR reactions were performed in an optical 384-well plate in the QuantStudio 6 Flex System (Applied Biosystems), using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) (Roche), in a final volume of 10 μl, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following standard thermal profile was used for all PCR reactions: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, and 60°C for 30 s. Data were analysed using the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System Software (Applied Biosystems). As a reference, primers for the EIF4A cDNA were used. PCR efficiency (E) was estimated from the data obtained from standard curve amplification using the equation E = 10<sup>−1/slope</sup>. Expression levels are presented as E<sup>-ΔCt</sup>, where ΔCt = Ct<sub>GOI</sub>-Ct<sub>EIF4A</sub>.

<title>Toluidine blue staining</title>
<p>The lids of plates containing etiolated seedlings were removed and plates were immediately flooded with staining solution [0.05% (w/v) Toluidine Blue + 0.4% (v/v) Tween-20] for one minutes. The staining solution was poured off and plates were immediately rinsed gently by flooding under a running tap until the water stream was no longer visibly blue (1–2 minutes). Seedlings were photographed under a Leica MZ12 stereomicroscope. For embryo staining, flowers were marked at anthesis and seeds were dissected from siliques of the same age for all genotypes in parallel. Embryos were removed from seeds by dissection with fine forceps and placed in handling baskets, which were then submerged in toluidine blue solution for one minute prior to rinsing 5 times in an excess of tap water. Embryos were photographed using a Keyence VHX-900 microscope.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and MPK6 activation analysis</title>
<p>Seedlings or seeds were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and proteins were extracted in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 10% glycerol, 0.1% tween 20, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail P9599 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1x MS-Safe protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of proteins (20 μg for seedlings and 10 μg for seeds) were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schuell). For seedlings primary antibodies against phospho p44/42 MAP kinase (1:2000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technologies) and then against MPK6 (1:10000 dilution) (Sigma-Aldrich) were used with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit as secondary antibody. Signal detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (Pierce). For seeds primary antibodies against phospho p44/42 MAP kinase and then against MPK6 were used with IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H + LI-COR, 1:10000 dilution), and the bound complex was detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor; Lincoln, NE). The images were analysed and quantified with ImageJ. Background was subtracted for each band. To test the linearity of the detection, 5–15 μg protein from heart stage developing seeds were treated as previously. To detect the antibody against phospho p44/42 MAP kinase an anti-Rabbit IgG, HRP conjugate (Amersham, 1:30000) was used. Anti-alpha-tubulin (Sigma, 1:2000) was used with an anti-mouse IgG, HRP conjugate (GE HealthCare, 1:10000). Signal detection was performed using Clarity Max Western ECL Substrate (Biorad) with a ChemiDoc Touch (Biorad) instrument. The images were quantified with ImageJ. Background was subtracted for each band.</p>
