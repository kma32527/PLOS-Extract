<abstract>
<p>Hbs1 has been established as a central component of the cell’s translational quality control pathways in both yeast and prokaryotic models; however, the functional characteristics of its human ortholog (Hbs1L) have not been well-defined. We recently reported a novel human phenotype resulting from a mutation in the critical coding region of the <italic>HBS1L</italic> gene characterized by facial dysmorphism, severe growth restriction, axial hypotonia, global developmental delay and retinal pigmentary deposits. Here we further characterize downstream effects of the human <italic>HBS1L</italic> mutation. <italic>HBS1L</italic> has three transcripts in humans, and RT-PCR demonstrated reduced mRNA levels corresponding with transcripts V1 and V2 whereas V3 expression was unchanged. Western blot analyses revealed Hbs1L protein was absent in the patient cells. Additionally, polysome profiling revealed an abnormal aggregation of 80S monosomes in patient cells under baseline conditions. RNA and ribosomal sequencing demonstrated an increased translation efficiency of ribosomal RNA in Hbs1L-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that there may be a compensatory increase in ribosome translation to accommodate the increased 80S monosome levels. This enhanced translation was accompanied by upregulation of mTOR and 4-EBP protein expression, suggesting an mTOR-dependent phenomenon. Furthermore, lack of Hbs1L caused depletion of Pelota protein in both patient cells and mouse tissues, while <italic>PELO</italic> mRNA levels were unaffected. Inhibition of proteasomal function partially restored Pelota expression in human Hbs1L-deficient cells. We also describe a mouse model harboring a knockdown mutation in the murine <italic>Hbs1l</italic> gene that shared several of the phenotypic elements observed in the Hbs1L-deficient human including facial dysmorphism, growth restriction and retinal deposits. The <italic>Hbs1l</italic>KO mice similarly demonstrate diminished Pelota levels that were rescued by proteasome inhibition.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>We have identified a patient with biallelic mutations in <italic>HBS1L</italic> affecting Hbs1LV1 and V2 transcripts leading to a loss of Hbs1L implicated in ribosomal recycling. In contrast to yeast studies, loss of Hbs1LV1/V2 in human cells did not appear to impact the translational quality control mechanisms of non-stop and no-go decay. However, patient cells demonstrated accumulation of free 80S ribosomes based on polysome profiling. In addition, Hbs1LV1/V2 deficient cells demonstrated an increase in translation efficiency of ribosomal mRNA based on RiboSeq data, which may suggest an attempt to compensate for defective mobilization of free 80S ribosomes. The patient samples demonstrated increased 4EBP1 and mTOR expression and phosphorylation compared to controls, suggesting an mTOR-dependent ribosomal RNA regulation is involved in the response to Hbs1LV1/V2 deficiency. Loss of Hbs1L in both human and mouse fibroblasts lead to diminished Pelota levels, and this phenomenon could be partially rescued by proteasome inhibition. In all, these data support a role for Hbs1LV1/V2 as a Pelota binding partner with a specific function in utilization of free ribosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hbs1L belongs to a specialized family of translational GTPases (trGTPases), members of which are structurally homologous but functionally distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref001">1</xref>]. Each trGTPase binds to a specific “decoding” protein and transports it to the ribosomal A site, where it recognizes a unique mRNA code. In mammals, eEF1A transports aminoacyl (aa)-tRNAs to sense codons, eRF3 transports eRF1 to termination codons, and Hbs1L transports Pelota to stalled ribosomes with either an empty A site or an mRNA-occupied A site without sequence preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref003">3</xref>]. Engagement of each decoding protein with the ribosome initiates a distinct anabolic event: aa-tRNAs lengthen the nascent chain, eRF1 terminates translation, and Pelota triggers mRNA surveillance pathways.</p>
<p>mRNA surveillance is a critical component of translational quality control (tQC) in all cells. There are three mRNA surveillance pathways that have been well-defined in eukaryotes, each of which is responsible for the selective degradation of a specific class of aberrant mRNA. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets sequences containing a premature termination codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref004">4</xref>], non-stop decay (NSD) degrades mRNAs lacking any termination codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref006">6</xref>], and no-go decay (NGD) targets mRNAs containing cis-acting features that cause translational arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref007">7</xref>]. Pelota:Hbs1L has been implicated in NGD and NSD in plants and eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref011">11</xref>]. Our understanding of its role in these processes is largely predicated on studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> of the orthologous protein complex, Dom34:Hbs1. Yeast Hbs1 (Hsp70 subfamily B suppressor 1) was originally identified for its ability to rescue stalled ribosomes by suppressing Hsp70 (heat shock protein 70) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref012">12</xref>]. Subsequent studies structurally associated Hbs1 with eRF3 and eEF1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref013">13</xref>], and recognition of Dom34 as an Hbs1-interacting protein functionally linked the complex to translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref014">14</xref>]. Recent biochemical studies have shown that Dom34:Hbs1 promotes the dissociation of the stalled ribosome into subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref016">16</xref>] during aberrant translation. Subunit dissociation is a critical component of canonical ribosomal recycling, a process to reutilize ribosomes from a terminated or aberrant round of translation.</p>
<p>Hbs1 and Dom34 have additionally been implicated in ribosomal recycling mechanisms outside of canonical tQC pathways. For example, the Dom34:Hbs1 complex has been suggested to play a role in ribosomal recycling of inactive 80S monosomes in yeast cells recovering from stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref017">17</xref>]. Under stress conditions, free ribosomal subunits associate to form large pools of inactive 80S monosomes stabilized by the ‘clamping’ Stm1 factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref022">22</xref>]. This effectively limits or inhibits translation, allowing the cell to reserve metabolic resources and protect ribosomal subunits from damage and degradation. Dom34:Hbs1 has been shown to work in conjunction with Rli1 (ABCE1 in mammals) to dissociate inactive ribosomes following stress relief, thus playing a critical role in translation re-initiation during stress recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref017">17</xref>]. Interestingly, 80S monosome accumulation has been observed in Hbs1- and Dom34- deficient yeast cells even in non-stressed conditions, suggesting that under normal conditions there may be inactive ribosomes that require Dom34:Hbs1-mediated dissociation prior to starting translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>We have previously described an Hbs1L-deficient patient with a phenotype that included severe intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, axial hypotonia, lax joints, global developmental delay, fused C2-C3 vertebrae, scoliosis, submucous cleft palate and retinal pigmentary deposits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref023">23</xref>]. We have now interrogated Hbs1L-deficient mice that demonstrated a similar phenotype. Our data demonstrate that one of the important functions of Hbs1L in mammals is to stabilize Pelota protein, and proteasomal inhibition can increase Pelota levels in the Hbs1L-deficient cells. Furthermore, Hbs1L:Pelota appear to be important for utilization of free 80S ribosomes, and in the absence of Hbs1L, there is an increase in ribosomal RNA translation efficiency (TE) which may act to compensate for the impaired ability to utilize 80S monosomes.</p>

<title>Hbs1L deficiency leads to a unique phenotype featuring growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delay</title>

These included sparse hair and eyebrows, deep-set eyes with blue sclerae, bifid uvula with a submucous cleft palate, velopharyngeal insufficiency, C2-C3 vertebral fusion, scoliosis, vesicoureteral reflux with a bladder diverticulum, significant hypotonia, and global developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref023">23</xref>]. To delineate the phenotype further, the patient was born at 37 weeks gestation with severe symmetric intrauterine growth restriction, weighing only 1530 grams at birth (&lt;1<sup>st</sup> percentile, z-score -3.72), head circumference of 29.5 cm (&lt;1<sup>st</sup> percentile, z-score -2.59) and length of 41 cm (&lt;1<sup>st</sup> percentile, z-score -2.84).

<p>In addition to the facial findings described previously, the patient had low posterior hairline, low-set ears, midface hypoplasia, a thin nose with a small mouth and small teeth, and small medial clefts on the lower third of each eyelid. Further issues include dysphagia with aspiration, chronic sinus disease and left-sided conductive hearing impairment needing tympanostomy tube. The patient also displayed thirteen pairs of ribs. She had no history of anemia, abnormal bleeding, or increased infectious susceptibility, and routine complete blood counts revealed normal hematocrit indices and red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet counts over time. The patient’s mother, father, and younger brother had no medical problems and extensive family history revealed no other family members with similar constellations of symptoms.</p>
<p>The patient’s muscle bulk was greatly diminished throughout the body; axial muscles more affected than appendicular. She had delayed motor milestones as she began to sit unsupported at twelve months and achieved independent ambulation at six years. Her psychological testing at four years demonstrated significant delays in language development and fine and gross motor development, although nonverbal reasoning skills were average. The patient had some astigmatism and decreased visual acuity (20/100 OS and 20/80 OD), and retinal examination revealed diffuse pigmented deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007917.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 30 months showed prominence of the ventricles and sulci with rare, scattered non-specific foci of T2 prolongation in the cerebral white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007917.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

<title>Pelota expression decreases with Hbs1L deficiency and increases with proteasome inhibition</title>
<p>As Pelota is a known interacting partner of Hbs1L, we evaluated its abundance using Western blot.

<title>HBS1L-deficient mice display tissue-dependent Pelota depletion</title>

Some residual expression of V1/V2 was also noted on the Western blot, and this is due to an incomplete knock-down with some residual protein expression, making these mice Hbs1L reduced rather than completely null.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In lower eukaryotes, Hbs1 protein has been established as a critical factor in several translational processes for its ability to bind with Pelota and perform ribosomal recycling. Pelota is a known interacting partner of Hbs1L, and we noted a marked reduction in Pelota protein levels in patient cell lines despite normal <italic>PELO</italic> transcript levels. This effect was also observed in the majority of murine tissues. One explanation for this finding is that Pelota stability is disrupted in the absence of Hbs1L, and destabilization of its tertiary structure leads to premature degradation of the protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. In concordance with this hypothesis, treating both patient fibroblasts and Hbs1L-deficient mouse fibroblasts with a specific dose of proteasome inhibitor induced an increase in Pelota levels. This effect was also observed in control cells, indicating that the proteolytic degradation pathway is responsible for regulating Pelota levels under normal conditions. Similar observations of coordinate regulation at the post-translational level have been described for paralogous translation factors eRF1 and eRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref029">29</xref>], affirming a pattern in which trGTPases and their binding partners are targeted for degradation when they are in an unbound state.</p>
<p>Monosomes are traditionally considered inactive complexes, consisting of “vacant couples” of large and small subunits which stably associate in the cytoplasm in the absence of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref030">30</xref>]. When synthetic demand increases, monosomal subunits typically dissociate from one another and then re-associate in the presence of an mRNA transcript to initiate translation. The mechanism by which the subunits are split has not been well-characterized, and, although Pelota:Hbs1L has been shown to engage in ribosomal splitting in other contexts including ribosomal rescue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref031">31</xref>] and translational re-initiation after cell stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref017">17</xref>]; our findings suggest that it may also be involved in pre-translational dissociation of cytosolic monosome complexes. Human Hbs1L-deficient fibroblasts displayed increased levels of 80S monosomes relative to controls, suggesting that Hbs1L deficiency may impair translation initiation by preventing the dissociation of monosomes into translationally available subunits. This has been previously shown for yeast Hbs1, where a mutant Dom34 caused increased accumulation of inactive 80S ribosomes both at baseline and following starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref032">32</xref>]. The heightened baseline monosome peak in patient cells may represent a missing link to the initial rate-limiting step of translation initiation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the enhanced monosome peak could reflect a population of monosomes that are unable to dissociate due to incomplete salvation from a previous round of aberrant translation or a defect in the ribosome itself. In yeast, aggregated monosomes induced by Dom34 deficiency are resistant to dissociation at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, indicating that they are not affected by the electrophysiological conditions that regulate the natural equilibrium between free and paired ribosomal subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref033">33</xref>]. We profiled several pre-rRNA species in our patient’s cells to address the possibility of a defective rRNA processing pathway leading to a population of “stuck” monosomes; however, no significant deficits in ribosomal processing were observed. It is likely that Pelota:Hbs1L regulates monosome binding at the post-translational level, either through direct contact with the inactive complex or through critical events that occur during ribosomal rescue from aberrant translation.</p>
<p>Analysis of mRNA-Seq data demonstrated strong correlation with the patient’s clinical phenotype. Skeletal, renal/urogenital, and eye development biological process pathways were all significantly different in patient versus control fibroblasts, corresponding to the clinical phenotype of skeletal, urogenital and ocular anomalies. There was also a significant difference in axon development genes, and this suggests a neuronal etiology of the patient’s diffuse weakness.</p>
<p>Ribo-Seq is a technique that sequences only the RNA being actively transcribed by the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref037">37</xref>]. We used Ribo-Seq to assess whether there was clustering of ribosomes at a particular region of the mRNA sequences. For instance, if there is a defect in non-stop decay increased ribosome coverage at the 5’ end of the transcript would be expected. Ribosomal footprint analysis showed no difference in the ribosomal footprint in patient versus control fibroblasts. Hbs1 has been shown in yeast and plant systems to function with Pelota in NSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref010">10</xref>]. The footprinting is an indirect assessment of NSD and supports the shRNA data showing no differences in NSD. This difference might be due to differences in the importance of the Hbs1LV1/V2 isoforms for NSD and NGD in the human compared with yeast. However, it is also possible that it is a function of footprinting strategy, as others have recently shown with an epidermal Pelota-deficient model that shorter length sequencing (20–21 nt) revealed differences in footprinting where standard length footprints (28–34 nt) did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref038">38</xref>]. This deserves further investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the position mapping of the ribosomes, Ribo-Seq was also used to assess translation efficiency by comparing with the mRNA-Seq data. Strikingly, efficiency was dramatically increased for cytosolic ribosomal RNAs compared with control fibroblasts. The ribosomal genes upregulated correspond with the ribosomal RNAs known to be upregulated by mTOR and phosphorylation of 4-EBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref039">39</xref>]. In accordance with this likely mechanism, levels of phosphorylated and native mTOR and 4-EBP proteins were all increased in the Hbs1L deficient fibroblasts compared with controls. This indicates that the enhanced ribosomal translation is likely to be an mTOR mediated response to the diminished ribosomal pool.</p>
<p><italic>Hbs1l</italic>-KO mice demonstrated abundant Pelota expression in the liver and kidney despite the absence of Hbs1L. In addition, others have shown an important role for Pelota in epidermal regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref038">38</xref>], and the Hbs1L-deficient patient did not demonstrate any skin phenotype. Tissue-specific binding of Pelota with novel interacting partner GTPBP2 in central nervous tissue has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref040">40</xref>], and it is possible that another Pelota binding partner exists in the liver, kidney, and skin, making Hbs1L less critical for the health of these tissues. Alternatively, it could be that ribosomal RNA upregulation seen in the Hbs1L-deficient human fibroblasts is not as robust in tissues that demonstrate a phenotype, causing them to be unable to overcome the inability to re-utilize unbound 80S monosomes.</p>
<p>These findings begin to detail an intricate and variegated role for Pelota:Hbs1L in mammalian translational processes. This is further complicated by the isoforms of Hbs1L, and the particular functional differences between Hbs1LV1/V2 and Hbs1LV3. We have demonstrated that Hbs1LV1/V2 deficiency leads to diminished Pelota in mammals. Additionally, we show that deficiency of Hbs1L:Pelota complex leads to increased levels of 80S ribosomal monosomes as well as an increase in translation of ribosomal RNA. This appears to be an mTOR-dependent phenomenon. Fibroblasts from the patient exhibited altered expression of gene families related to skeletal development, renal development, and ocular development, relating well to the clinical phenotype of the patient. Skeletal gene pathways and many developmental pathways were also significantly altered in the Ribo-Seq analysis, indicating differential translation of these gene sets compared to controls. In addition to our biological insights, we have identified proteasome inhibition to be effective in increasing the levels of Pelota in Hbs1L-deficient patients, which may have therapeutic potential.</p>

The targeting vector contained an IRES:LacZ trapping cassette and a floxed promoter-driven Neo-cassette, which was inserted into introns 4–5 of the murine <italic>Hbs1l</italic> gene. FRT sites flanked the LacZ and Neo cassettes and LoxP sites flanked exon 5, which was targeted for its critical ability to create frameshift mutations in <italic>Hbs1l</italic> splice variants V1 and V2 when deleted.

Cell debris was removed by the centrifugation at 12.000 g for 4 min. Cleared lysates were loaded on 10–50 sucrose gradients and spun 3 hours at 35.000 g. For ribosome profiling, the concentration of magnesium was lowered to 5 mM, lysates were pre-treated with 1000 U RNase T1 (Epicentre) for 30 min at room temperature, and the monosomal peak was collected for further Ribo-seq assay. There was no sign of ribosomal degradation and over digestion as a result of such treatment.</p>

<title>mRNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from aliquots of the same lysates used for ribosomal profiling. Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by the Direct-zol kit (Zymo Research) ware used for RNA extraction. The library was prepared by the Dana Farber Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility using a Kapa library prep kit. Sequencing was done on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using single-end 75bp reads.</p>

<title>Ribo-seq library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>Ribosome protected footprints were isolated from sucrose gradient fractions with Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Direct-Zol kit (Zymo Research). Libraries were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007917.ref047">47</xref>]. Briefly, ribosomal footprints (25–32 nt) were cut and eluted from the polyacrylamide gel, the preadenylated adapter was ligated to footprints and reverse transcription performed with individually barcoded primers. After PCR amplification, libraries were pooled together and sequenced on Illumina high-throughput sequencer.</p>

<title>Statistical approach</title>
<p>Data are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless indicated otherwise. Protein expression data derived from Western blots were normalized to the loading control and then calculated as fold change relative to the expression level of the experimental control(s). Relative quantification of gene expression data derived from RT-PCR experiments was performed using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method. rRNA and pre-rRNA expression data derived from Northern blots were calculated as log<sub>2</sub> ratios of product to precursor pre-rRNA species and 18S to 28S rRNAs relative to three control cell lines. The single-source nature of our biological sample representing human Hbs1L-deficiency precluded the use of tests of statistical significance in some of our human experimental analyses, though several control samples and a minimum of three technical replicates for each sample were used for all human cell line experiments to increase the power. When replicates were sufficient, as for polysome profiling of fibroblast cultures, we used paired t test to compare patient to control replicates. Statistical analyses for RNA Seq and RiboSeq analyses were calculated using the Github GSEA package in R. Gene ontology significance in GOrilla was assessed using the minimum-hypergeometric (mHG) statistic in R and p values were assigned to be &gt;10<sup>^-3</sup>. For mouse phenotyping, morphological and X-ray data were analyzed using the Fisher Exact Test framework, and body compositional, hematological, and clinical chemistry data were analyzed using the Mixed Model framework (linear mixed-effects model, equation with or without weight). Fertility results were supplied as data.</p>

<title>Targeting vector design for Hbs1l-KO mouse model.</title>
<p>Targeting vector HTGRS06009_A_B02 was used for the electroporation of ES stem cells in the generation of <italic>Hbs1l</italic>-KO mice. The vector contained an IRES:LacZ trapping cassette and a floxed promoter-driven Neo-cassette, which was inserted into introns 4–5 of the murine <italic>Hbs1l</italic> gene. FRT sites flanked the LacZ and Neo cassettes and LoxP sites flanked critical exon 5. Splicing across the gene-trap insertion yielded a null allele.
