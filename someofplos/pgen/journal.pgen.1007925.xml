<abstract>
<p>Telomerase-independent ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) cells are characterized by high frequency of telomeric homologous recombination (HR), C-rich extrachromosomal circles (C-circles) and C-rich terminal 5' overhangs (C-overhangs). However, underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that both C-circle and C-overhang form when replication fork collapse is induced by strand break at telomeres. We find that endogenous DNA break predominantly occur on C-rich strand of telomeres in ALT cells, resulting in high frequency of replication fork collapse. While collapsed forks could be rescued by replication fork regression leading to telomeric homologous recombination, those unresolved are converted to C-circles and C-overhang at lagging and leading synthesized strand, respectively. Meanwhile, multiple hallmarks of ALT are provoked, suggesting that strand break-induced replication stress underlies ALT. These findings provide a molecular basis underlying telomeric HR and biogenesis of C-circle and C-overhang, thus implicating the specific mechanism to resolve strand break-induced replication defect at telomeres in ALT cells.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>10 to 15% human cancers utilize telomerase-independent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) to maintain their telomere length. Unexpectedly, we find that endogenous C-strand breaks predominantly exist in telomeres of ALT cells, which induce high frequency of replication fork collapse. While collapsed fork triggers fork regression machinery to restart the replication, leading to telomeric homologous recombination; those unresolved are converted to C-circle and C-overhang. These findings suggest that the formation of C-circle and C-overhang represents a unique manner for ALT cells to prevent chromosome instability induced by replication defect at telomeres. Moreover, multiple hallmarks of ALT are provoked during this process, demonstrating that DNA strand break at telomeres underlies ALT mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Linear chromosome ends are capped by telomeres, which are composed of TTAGGG/CCCTAA tandem DNA repeats and a protein complex called shelterin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref003">3</xref>]. Because of end replication problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref004">4</xref>] and possible DNA resection by Exo I (Exonuclease I) and Apollo to form single-stranded overhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref006">6</xref>], telomeres shorten with every cell division until the critically short telomere length is reached that induces cell senescence or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref009">9</xref>]. To counteract telomere shortening, approximately 85% of human cancer cells express telomerase, while those that don’t express telomerase induce alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>As a typical fragile site, telomere of ALT cells experiences a high frequency of homologous recombination (HR), which may contribute to lengthening of telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref013">13</xref>]. ALT cells are characterized by high heterogeneity of telomere length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref010">10</xref>], an elevated frequency of telomere-sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref014">14</xref>], the presence of APBs (ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref015">15</xref>] and abundant extrachromosomal circular telomeric DNA (C-circles) and C-rich terminal 5' overhangs (C-overhangs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref018">18</xref>]. The biogenesis of C-circles and C-overhangs is not clear and their functions in cells are largely unknown. It has been proposed that telomeric DNA damage, particularly double-stranded breaks (DSBs), promotes C-circles generation in ALT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref020">20</xref>], and that defects in telomere replication related proteins, such as SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix associated, actin-dependent, regulator of chromatin subfamily A-like 1) or the CST (CTC1/STN1/TEN1), changes the level of C-circles in ALT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref023">23</xref>]. These results imply a potential connection between C-circles formation and DNA damage repair and/or replication defect at telomeres. Regarding to C-overhang, it appears that telomeric DNA damage is not sufficient to induce 5' C-overhangs, rather, the production of C-overhangs is associated with rapid cleavage of telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref024">24</xref>]. The question regarding whether and how the formation of C-circle and C-overhang is coordinated and their relationship with high frequency of telomeric HR and ALT remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>The tandemly repeated G-rich DNA in human telomeres has a relatively high tendency to form highly compacted G-quadruplex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, telomeric DNA is susceptible to ultraviolet light-induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref023">23</xref>] and oxidative DNA damage, leading to a relatively high frequency of single- and double-stranded DNA breaks (SSBs and DSBs) and other DNA lesions in telomeric DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref028">28</xref>]. G-quadruplex and DNA lesions frequently block replication fork progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref032">32</xref>]. In ALT cells, telomeres may experience particularly high frequency of telomeric DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref034">34</xref>], leading to replication fork stalling and/or collapse. In addition, it has also been reported that ALT is linked to mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone variant H3.3, which interfere with nucleosome assembly at telomeres and likely increase replication stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref036">36</xref>]. With such replication stress, it has been interpreted that ALT cells are competent to replication defect at telomeres. Alternatively, ALT cells may develop a mechanism to cope with unsuccessfully replicated telomeres and to maintain the integrity of chromosome ends.</p>
<p>This study provides evidences that C-circles and C-overhangs are produced during replication of lagging and leading strand of telomeres, respectively, and that their production is associated with DNA break-induced replication fork collapse in ALT cells. Replication fork regression, which facilitates HR-dependent replication fork restart, is utilized to rescue collapsed replication fork. However, unsuccessful rescue results in the formation of C-circles and C-overhangs. Meanwhile, multiple hallmarks of ALT were raised by DNA break-induced replication fork collapse, including increased frequency of telomeric HR, formation of ALT associated PML body as well as high abundance of C-circles and C-overhangs.</p>

<title>C-circles and C-overhangs arise from lagging and leading telomeric strands, respectively</title>
<p>C-circle is an extrachromosomal circular telomeric DNA composed of full C-rich strand and notched G-rich complementary strand that is a quantitative biomarker of the ALT mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref037">37</xref>]. Here, the cell cycle dependence of the appearance of C-circles was explored in ALT-positive U2OS cells. Specifically, U2OS cells were synchronized at G1/S by double-thymidine block, released for 0, 3, 6, 9 or 12h, corresponding to G1/S, early S, middle S, late S/G2 and G1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and then assayed for the presence of C-circles. Φ29 DNA polymerase-based C-circle assay was used to determine the abundance of C-circles in cells. Reliability of method was validated by experiments in which lack of Φ29 leads to no amplified product and C-circle signal is well proportional to the amount of input DNA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96 in linear regression of standard curve) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref037">37</xref>]. The results showed that the abundance of C-circles increased gradually during S phase, peaked (doubled) at late S/G2 (9h after release) and decreased when cells re-entered G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Since telomeric DNA replicates throughout S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref039">39</xref>], this result suggests that C-circles may be produced during telomere replication and subsequently degraded during or after G2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<p>It has been reported that RPA2 (replication protein A2) colocalizes with telomeric DNA in human ALT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref041">41</xref>]. We observed that the abundance of telomeric RPA2 foci also gradually increased during S phase and decreased during or after G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Given that RPA2 is a sensor of single-stranded DNA that might be produced during DNA damage repair and/or replication process, the specific correlation between appearance of C-circles and telomeric RPA2 foci implies that C-circle formation may associated with DNA damage response (DDR) and/or DNA replication at telomeres.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which C-circles form was further explored by BrdU pulse-labeling synchronized U2OS cells for 12 h after release from G1/S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref042">42</xref>], isolating nascent C-circle and analizing its composition by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The results showed that while the leading and lagging telomeric DNA was synthesized with similar efficiency (0.96 vs 1.11 in amount) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), BrdU-labeled C-circles were dominently enriched in lagging strand telomeric DNA (0.88 vs 1.64 for leading vs lagging synthesized C-circles after normalizing with total amount of leading or lagging telomeres) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), in which C-rich strand is newly synthesized and therefore BrdU-labeled. This result is consistent with the previous observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref043">43</xref>], the mechanism underlying the production of C-cirlce from lagging strand would be exlored below.</p>
<p>A similar procedure was used to determine whether 5' C-overhangs arise preferentially during leading or lagging strand DNA replication. 12h or 6h BrdU-labeled DNA was fractionated by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, fractions corresponding to leading, lagging and unreplicated telomeric DNA were collected, and divided into two parts, one of which was incubated with RecJf, a 5'→3' exonuclease for ssDNA, to specifically degrade 5' overhang DNA to validate telomeric C-rich ssDNA polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref018">18</xref>]. The resulting samples were analyzed by neutral-neutral 2D agarose gel electrophoresis in which DNA fragments are resolved first by size in one dimension, and then by conformation in second dimension. In combination with in-gel hybridization under native or denatured conditions, 2D agarose gel electrophoresis is able to separate and distinguish linear ssDNA (G-rich or C-rich), linear dsDNA (with or without single-stranded G/C-rich overhangs) and open circular DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). C-overhangs were sensitive to RecJf digestion, but resistant to Exo I (a 3'→5' exonuclease for ssDNA), demonstrating that C-overhang is in the 5' to 3' direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s001">S1C Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref018">18</xref>]. Both 12h and 6h BrdU labeling experiments showed that RecJf sensitive 5' C-overhangs are preferentially generated on telomeres replicated by leading strand (leading: lagging = 1.00 : 0.36 for 12h labeling sample and 1.00 : 0.29 for 6h labeling sample) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s001">S1D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>DNA strand break-induced replication fork collapse stimulates formation of C-circle and C-overhang</title>
<p>To examine a potential relationship between replication-blocking and formation of C-circle and C-overhang, U2OS cells were treated with agents that result in replication fork stalling. To this end, exponentially growing U2OS cells were treated with HU (hydroxyurea) that blocks replication fork by inducing dNTP pool deficiency or aphidicolin that inhibits B-family DNA polymerase leading to replication fork stalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref045">45</xref>].

<p>When U2OS cells were exposed to zeocin, a radio-mimetic chemical that induces oxidative DNA damage including ssDNA and dsDNA breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref046">46</xref>], increased level of DDR at telomeres was detected, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Meanwhile, we observed increased abundance of C-circles and C-overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). In contrast, zeocin treatment led to slight decrease of G-overhangs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Importantly, we also found that the increase of C-circle and C-overhang upon zeocin treatment was restricted to S-phase (when cells were treated during S-phase), and was abrogated when cells were synchronized at G1 and exposured to zeocin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s003">S3C–S3F Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that C-circles and C-overhangs are produced in ALT cells during telomere replication encountering DNA damages.</p>
<p>To imitate the situation in which replication fork progress is blocked by DNA damage, U2OS cells were treated with CPT (camptothecin), a specific inhibitor of Topo I (topoisomerase I) that induces protein-linked ssDNA break at the front of replication fork, leading to fork collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref048">48</xref>]. Strikingly, CPT strongly stimulated the formation of C-circles and C-overhangs in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>) and the abundance of G-overhangs decreased accordingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Increased C-circle and C-overhang by zeocin or CPT treatment was also observed in other ALT VA13 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s003">S3G and S3H Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar experiment, U2OS cells were treated with inhibitors of Topo II (topoisomerase II), VP-16 (etoposide) or ICRF-187 (dexrazoxane) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref051">51</xref>]. VP-16 induces protein-linked dsDNA breaks in replicating DNA leading to replication fork collapse, while ICRF-187 inhibits the cleavage activity of Topo II leading to replication fork stalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref052">52</xref>]. Interestingly, VP-16 stimulated formation of C-circles and C-overhangs, whereas the abundance of G-overhangs decreased. However, ICRF-187 treatment showed a limited effect on C-circle, C-overhang and G-overhangs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s004">S4A–S4C Fig</xref>). This result further demonstrated that DNA damage-induced replication fork collapse rather than replication fork stalling promotes formation of C-circles and C-overhangs. This conclusion was further confirmed by duplicating the experiments in other ALT positive VA13 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s004">S4D–S4F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Intrinsic DNA damage at C-rich strand of telomeres leads to the formation of C-circle and C-overhang</title>
<p>Given a high abundance of C-circles and C-overhangs in ALT cells, we then asked whether intrinsic DNA strand breaks exist in telomeres that induce replication fork collapse. For this purpose, genomic DNA was digested with HinfI and RsaI, followed by digestion with Exo III (Exonuclease III), a 3' to 5' exonuclease that remove nucleotides from blunt end or break/gap in double stranded DNA to generate single stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The digested DNA were hybridized with C-rich or G-rich probe under native or denatured condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref053">53</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The rationale was to determine whether endogenous ssDNA breaks and gaps occur in the G-rich or C-rich strand of telomeric DNA in ALT cells. If such lesions were enriched in the C-rich strand, it would be preferentially degraded by Exo III, leaving primarily G-rich ssDNA to hybridize with a C-rich probe, while the reverse specificity, or lack of specificity would be observed in the absence of preferential endogenous ssDNA breaks in the C-rich strand of the telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We detected much more G-rich ssDNA than C-rich ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This suggests that endogenous ssDNA breaks and gaps are present predominantly on the C-rich strand of telomeric DNA in U2OS cells.</p>

<p>(A) Experimental protocol to study strand specific (G-rich or C-rich) breaks/gaps on telomere is shown schematically. HinfI and RsaI digested genomic DNA was purified and further digested with Exo III to examine potential breaks/gaps on G-strand or C-strand of telomeres. If breaks/gaps occur on C-strand, Exo III would degrade all C-strand, leaving single-stranded G-strand that can be detected by hybridization with C-rich probe under native or denatured condition. Contrariwise, only C-strand can be detected if breaks/gaps occur on G-strand. (B) Breaks/gaps occur more frequently on C-rich strand of telomere. Exo III digestion produces single-stranded DNA that is less in molecular weight than corresponding double-stranded DNA, thereby migrating faster during electrophoresis.

To further confirm that ssDNA breaks in the C-rich strand of telomeric DNA induce formation of C-circle and C-overhang, we expressed CRISPR-Cas9 with a D10A mutation in the RuvC nuclease domain of Cas9 (Cas9-D10A), which specifically generates ssDNA breaks in the strand complementary to sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref057">57</xref>]. Indeed, when sgRNA with telomeric G-rich sequence (sgTel) was co-expressed with Cas9-D10A in U2OS cells, we observed significant number of C-rich, but not G-rich DNA fragments (smear on gel) that are released from telomeres and detected by alkaline constant-field gel electrophoresis (alkaline plug assay, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Method</xref> for detail) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>), indicating specific induction of DNA breaks by Cas9-D10A at C-rich strands. As expected, expression of wild-type Cas9 (wtCas9, WT) induced double-stranded breaks at telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref058">58</xref>], leading to increase of both G- and C-rich fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>).

We observed significant increase of C-circles and C-overhangs in cells expressing wtCas9 or Cas9-D10A but not in cells expressing dCas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). Similar experiments were also performed in non-ALT human HEK 293T cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that wtCas9, dCas9 and Cas9-D10A protein were expressed at a similar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). The results showed that expression of both wtCas9 and Cas9-D10A stimulated formation of C-circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). The formation of C-overhangs was strongly stimulated by expression of Cas9-D10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). And the expression of wtCas9 also slightly increased the abundance of C-overhangs, consistent with our previous finding that telomeric DSB initiates homologous recombination mediated repair that produces 3′ C-rich overhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref058">58</xref>]. Collectively, these results suggest that endogenous breaks/gaps or extraneously induced ssDNA breaks in C-rich strand of telomeric DNA stimulates formation of C-circles and C-overhangs.</p>

<title>Replication fork regression prohibits formation of C-circles and C-overhangs</title>
<p>Evidences presented above suggest that replication fork collapse in telomeric DNA is tightly linked to formation of C-circle and C-overhang structures. Therefore, it was predicted that replication fork regression, mediated by RPA2-Rad51-SMARCAL1-SLX4 axis, might rescue collapsed replication fork and thus suppress formation of C-circles and C-overhangs. To test this, U2OS cells were treated with RPA2- or SMARCAL1-targeted siRNA and the abundance of C-circles and C-overhangs was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g005">Fig 5A and 5D</xref>).

Accordingly, G-overhangs were slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

<p>Meanwhile, we observed that pDNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit), a key sensor in the NHEJ (non-homologous end-joining) pathway, localizes to telomeres in U2OS cells, and that telomeric pDNA-PKcs (S2056) foci are more abundant in CPT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigates the biogenesis of C-circles and C-overhangs in ALT cells. Evidence is presented that C-circles and C-overhangs represent circularized lagging and broken leading strands of telomeric DNA, respectively, and that their formation is tightly linked to strand break-induced collapse of DNA replication forks in telomeric DNA in ALT cells. Although replication fork regression and HR-mediated replication restart can rescue replication fork collapse, the formation of C-circle and C-overhang on unresolved replication fork may represent a new manner for ALT cells to cope with unsuccessfully replicated telomeres and to maintain chromosome integrity.</p>

<title>Breaks in the C-Rich strand stimulate formation of C-circles and C-overhangs</title>
<p>The results show that replication fork collapse leading to C-circles and C-overhangs can be induced by exogenous agents that generate ssDNA or dsDNA breaks in telomeric DNA (zeocin, CPT, VP16, MMS and CRISPR-Cas9 system). In addition, we found that endogenous lesions occur preferentially in the C-rich strand of telomeres in ALT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). During replication progression, the C-rich strand templates leading strand DNA synthesis, while the G-rich strand templates lagging strand DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref063">63</xref>]. Replication fork collapse, induced by a break or gap on the C-rich strand, has different consequences for leading and lagging replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g007">Fig 7</xref>). For leading synthesis, long single-stranded C-rich DNA remains unreplicated, forming C-overhangs at the end of the chromosome; lagging strand synthesis still proceeds, but would likely lead to “looping-out” during which the stalled replication fork is cut out and cyclized to form C-circles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref050">50</xref>]. The evidence supporting this model include: 1) C-circles are primarily derived from the lagging strand, whereas C-overhangs are primarily derived from the leading strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g001">Fig 1</xref>); 2) replication fork collapse, but not conventional replication fork stalling, stimulates production of C-circles and C-overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g002">Fig 2</xref>); 3) endogenous breaks/gaps are present in the C-rich telomeric strand and agents that introduce ssDNA breaks in the C-rich telomeric strand (i.e., MMS treatment and CRISPR-Cas9 (D10A)) stimulate formation of C-circles and C-overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g003">Fig 3</xref>); 4) the formation of C-circles is NHEJ-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed model summarizing effects of replication fork collapse and replication fork regression on formation of C-circles and C-overhangs in ALT cells.</title>
<p>Replication fork collapse induced by break or gap on the C-rich strand of telomere, if not rescued, leads to different consequences for leading and lagging replication: for leading synthesis, long single-stranded C-rich DNA (C-overhang) remains unreplicated, whereas stalled lagging replication fork is cut out and cyclized to form C-circles. Fork regression machinary including SMARCAL1, SLX4 and Rad51 may restore collapsed replication fork, and thereby suppressing C-circle and C-overhang formation. HR-mediated fork regression is based on the model proposed by Petermann and Helleday [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref031">31</xref>].</p>

<title>Unsolved replication fork collapse leads to formation of C-circle and C-overhang</title>
<p>Spontaneous telomeric DNA damage response and telomeric RPA2 foci are often observed in ALT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref064">64</xref>]. We found that RPA2 accumulate in telomeric DNA of CPT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>) but not in HU- or aphidicolin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), suggesting that replication fork collapse, but not replication fork stalling, is the signal that recruits RPA2. Binding of RPA2 to ssDNA activates the ATR pathway, leading to replication fork protection and restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref065">65</xref>]. DNA damage-induced replication fork collapse can be rescued by replication fork regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref048">48</xref>]. And, SMARCAL1, which is activated by ATR-dependent phosphorylation, plays an essential role in replication fork regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref066">66</xref>]. Indeed, it has been previously reported that the deficiency of SMARCAL1 leads to fragile telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref060">60</xref>]. Our results also demonstrated that components of fork regression machinery including Rad51, SMARCAL1 and SLX4 are recruited to telomeres in CPT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g004">Fig 4E–4L</xref>). This, however, does not exclude the possibility that the mechinary other than fork regression might also be adopted to rescue collapsed replication fork. In fact, it has been reported that translesion synthesis, which is composed of FANCJ, RAD18, <sup>ub</sup>PCNA and Polη, is engaged in bypassing DNA lesions on replication fork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref067">67</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, depletion or inhibition of each component of fork regression machinery stimulated formation of C-circles and C-overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We thus proposed that endogenous breaks/gaps in C-rich strand of telomeric DNA in ALT cells either induce replication fork collapse, leading to C-circle and C-overhang structures, or, fork regression or other fork rescue machinary restores the collapsed replication fork, and C-circle and C-overhang formation is suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In supporting this model, it has been recently discovered that SMARCAL1 loss-of-function mutations in cancers link to the ALT mechanism of telomere maintenance, resulting in ultrabright telomeric foci and the generation of C-circles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref069">69</xref>]. In additon, deficiency of Polη, which is essential for translesion synthesis, increases replication stress at telomeres and stimulates the formation of C-circles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref068">68</xref>].</p>

<title>Replication fork collapse and ALT mechanism</title>
<p>ALT cells are characterized by high frequency telomeric recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref013">13</xref>]. It has been found that a DNA damage at ALT telomeres triggers long-range movement and clustering, resulting in homology-directed telomere synthesis between sister and non-sister chromatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref070">70</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that DNA strand break in the C-rich strand of the telomere leads to replication fork collapse, followed by replication fork regression and telomeric HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Whether or not this recombination contributes to telomere elongation remains to be elucidated. However, homologous searching and recombination could occur anywhere along the telomere due to its repetitive nature, creating the possibility for telomere extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In the presence of Rad51 inhibitor B02, short telomeres accumulate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007925.s008">S8F Fig</xref>), supporting the idea that Rad51-dependent HR promotes telomere extension. Furthermore, it is worth noting that APBs accumulate in CPT-treated ALT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007925.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Therefore, replication fork collapse provokes multiple hallmarks of ALT, including telomeric HR, APBs, C-circles and C-overhangs. While C-circles and C-overhangs are associated with telomere trimming, telomeric HR might contribute to telomere elongation. Additional studies are needed to understand how these events are coordinated in order to maintain chromosome end integrity and telomere length homeostasis in ALT cells.</p>

<p>The alkaline constant-field gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref077">77</xref>]. Briefly, 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were rinsed with 1×PBS, resuspended in 50μl 0.7% 45°C pre-warmed agarose (made with 1×TE, pH 8.0), and solidified in 1ml decapitated injector. Agarose plugs were incubated in fresh-made lysis-buffer (30mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 300mM NaCl, 25mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1mg/ml Protease K, 0.1mg/ml RNase A) overnight. The plugs were then denatured in 100mM NaOH with 1mM EDTA, placed into the wells of 0.7% alkaline agarose gel (50mM NaOH with 1mM EDTA) and sealed with 0.7% alkaline agarose gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 1V/cm for 12h at 4°C. The gel was subjected to in gel hybridization with telomeric probe.</p>

<title>In gel hybridization</title>
<p>In-gel hybridization was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref078">78</xref>]. For native in gel hybridization, gels were hybridized in Denhart’s hybridization buffer with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled C-/G- telomeric probe. The telomeric probes were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007925.ref079">79</xref>]. Gels were washed 3 times with 2×SSC and 0.5% SDS, exposed to PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare) and scanned on Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare). Image Quant software was used for data analysis. For denatured in-gel hybridization, gels were denatured with 0.5 M NaOH, neutralized with 1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and then followed the procedure for native hybridization.</p>
