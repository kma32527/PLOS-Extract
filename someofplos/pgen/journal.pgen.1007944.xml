<abstract>
<p>Heme-containing peroxidases are important components of innate immunity. Many of them functionally associate with NADPH oxidase (NOX)/dual oxidase (DUOX) enzymes by using the hydrogen peroxide they generate in downstream reactions. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> encodes for several heme peroxidases, and in a previous study we identified the ShkT-containing peroxidase, SKPO-1, as necessary for pathogen resistance. Here, we demonstrated that another peroxidase, HPX-2 (<bold>H</bold>eme-<bold>P</bold>ero<bold>X</bold>idase 2), is required for resistance against some, but not all pathogens. Tissue specific RNA interference (RNAi) revealed that HPX-2 functionally localizes to the hypodermis of the worm. In congruence with this observation, <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant animals possessed a weaker cuticle structure, indicated by higher permeability to a DNA dye, but exhibited no obvious morphological defects. In addition, fluorescent labeling of HPX-2 revealed its expression in the pharynx, an organ in which BLI-3 is also present. Interestingly, loss of HPX-2 increased intestinal colonization of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic>, suggesting its role in the pharynx may limit intestinal colonization. Moreover, disruption of a catalytic residue in the peroxidase domain of HPX-2 resulted in decreased survival on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic>, indicating its peroxidase activity is required for pathogen resistance. Finally, RNA-seq analysis of an <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant revealed changes in genes encoding for cuticle structural components under the non-pathogenic conditions. Under pathogenic conditions, genes involved in infection response were differentially regulated to a greater degree, likely due to increased microbial burden. In conclusion, the characterization of the heme-peroxidase, HPX-2, revealed that it contributes to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> pathogen resistance through a role in generating cuticle material in the hypodermis and pharynx.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the host tissues is one of the first lines of defense when microbial infection occurs. ROS has been shown to be involved in multiple protective pathways in innate immunity. However, given the complexity of mammalian systems, the exact manner in which ROS are used for host defense remains incompletely understood. In this study, we use <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a simplified model system to decipher the protective functions of ROS in innate immunity. We describe a peroxidase, HPX-2, that protects <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> from multiple infectious microbes by strengthening barrier tissue. This finding brings insight into the mechanisms by which peroxidases utilizes ROS to contribute to innate immunity. With infectious diseases being one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality around the world, understanding ROS production and its function in pathogen resistance will provide us with important information in developing new therapies against pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When exposed to pathogen, production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is one of the first innate immune responses initiated by the host. ROS can exert immune-protective effects by acting directly as an antimicrobial, serving as a signal to activate downstream responses, and/or contributing to the generation of physical barriers (Reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref002">2</xref>]). There are two major groups of enzymes involved in this process–the ROS producing NADPH oxidases/Dual-oxidases (NOX/DUOX) and the ROS utilizing, heme-containing peroxidases (Reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref002">2</xref>]). In many cases, these enzymes are functionally, and sometimes physically linked to contribute to innate immunity against pathogen. The most canonical case studied in mammalian systems is that of myeloperoxidase (MPO), which resides in the phagolysosome of macrophages and neutrophils and utilizes the superoxide produced by NOX2 to generate the powerful oxidant HOCl during the oxidative burst that occurs as a result of microbial engulfment (Reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref003">3</xref>]). Additionally, it has been shown that lactoperoxidase (LPO), coupled with DUOX2, is responsible for the generation of the antibiotic oxidant hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and thiocyanate (SCN-) on mucosal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref006">6</xref>]. These responses are not limited to animals; plants also employ peroxidases and NADPH oxidases as part of their antimicrobial arsenal (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref007">7</xref>]).</p>
<p>In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, the one functional NOX/DUOX encoded by the genome is BLI-3, a dual oxidase that produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when animals are exposed to pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref011">11</xref>]. Like all dual oxidases, BLI-3 consists of an NADPH oxidase domain and a heme peroxidase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref010">10</xref>]. The production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from the NADPH oxidase domain of BLI-3 is required for pathogen resistance and point mutants that affect this domain significantly increase pathogen susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition to its role during infection, BLI-3 is crucial for cuticle development. The peroxidase domain uses the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by the NADPH oxidase domain to cross-link collagen proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref010">10</xref>]. Another heme-binding peroxidase, MLT-7, additionally contributes to this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref013">13</xref>]. Mutations in the peroxidase domains of BLI-3 and MLT-7 that impair activity result in a blistered phenotype. However, these mutations do not affect pathogen susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Since peroxidases in other systems do play a role in innate immunity, we hypothesized that one or more of the peroxidases encoded in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome would affect pathogen resistance. Indeed, previous studies in our lab showed that a ShkT domain containing peroxidase, which we named SKPO-1, is required for resistance to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>]. A <italic>skpo-1</italic> mutant was more susceptible to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> compared to the N2 reference strain. In addition to pathogen sensitivity, the <italic>skpo-1</italic> mutant also had an incomplete penetrance of dumpy phenotype, suggesting a potential role in the process of cuticle bio-generation. Interestingly, SKPO-1 localized to the hypodermis of the worm, a tissue where BLI-3 also is present, indicating a potential physical interaction between the two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the immune-protective peroxidase, F09F3.5, which we named HPX-2, for <bold>H</bold>eme <bold>P</bold>eroxidase 2. Using a combination of RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutation, we demonstrated that HPX-2 is important for protecting <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> against some, but not all, pathogens. Through fluorescent-tagging and tissue-specific RNAi, we demonstrated that HPX-2 is present in the pharynx and the hypodermis of the worms. Despite low expression of its gene at the organismal level, HPX-2 functions in these two tissues and contributes to cuticle integrity; <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants exhibited higher intestinal colonization by pathogens with thick cell walls and possessed weaker cuticles, more penetrant to dye. We also examined animals with a point mutation at the catalytic site of HPX-2 peroxidase domain and discovered that peroxidase activity is partly required for the protective function of HPX-2. Lastly, a transcriptomic analysis of the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant revealed an altered immune response when exposed to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic>. In summary, the results of these experiments demonstrated that HPX-2 is an immuno-protective peroxidase likely functioning in the development of cuticle barrier tissue associated with the hypodermis and pharynx.</p>

To further study the function of HPX-2, we generated a truncated mutant allele (<italic>hpx-2(dg047)</italic>) by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing. <italic>hpx-2(dg047)</italic> is missing most of the predicted peroxidase domain and is a predicted loss-of-function mutant. We additionally obtained a nonsense mutant allele, <italic>hpx-2(gk252521)</italic>, from the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center that is predicted to produce a protein lacking the entire peroxidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The mutants were tested for general defects in fitness by measuring their longevity on live (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and heat-killed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). While both mutants showed slight longevity defects compared with the wild type reference strain, N2, on live <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, there was no significant difference on heat-killed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. The minor longevity defect of the mutants on live <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OP50 might result from the slight pathogenicity of OP50 towards worms as they age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref015">15</xref>]. Overall, these data suggest that the loss of HPX-2 does not dramatically affect the fitness of the worms.</p>

<p>We next tested the susceptibility of both <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic>. In agreement with the RNAi experiment, both mutants showed significantly decreased survival on this species of bacteria compared to N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the difference disappeared when worms were exposed to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> inactivated by vancomycin treatment, suggesting live bacteria were required for killing, and again indicating that the animals do not have a general fitness defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To test if the pathogen susceptibility of the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants is pathogen-specific, we exposed them to multiple human pathogens including the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> SC5314 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), Gram-positive pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> NCTC8325 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic> NCTC12129 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), and finally Gram-negative pathogens <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 Sakai (EHEC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1H</xref>), and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> SL1344 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants showed susceptibility to all the microbial pathogens tested except for the Gram-negative bacteria, raising the possibility that differences in microbial cell wall structure might impact the phenotype observed with loss of <italic>hpx-2</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify that HPX-2 is required for pathogen resistance, we complemented the mutant strains with DNA containing the <italic>hpx-2</italic> gene and subjected the animals to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> exposure.

<title>HPX-2 is present in the hypodermis and pharynx</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that the only functional NOX/DUOX in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, BLI-3, is present in the pharynx, the hypodermis and the intestine of the worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref012">12</xref>]. We postulated that heme peroxidases that might functionally interact with BLI-3 are likely to be in one or more of the tissues that harbor BLI-3. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that SKPO-1, another immune-protective peroxidase, localizes to the hypodermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref016">16</xref>]. To functionally localize HPX-2, we conducted tissue-specific RNAi to knock down <italic>hpx-2</italic> in the intestine or hypodermis and measured the worms’ susceptibility to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic>. We observed that intestinal RNAi did not affect pathogen susceptibility, whereas hypodermal RNAi resulted in a slight but significant decrease, suggesting that HPX-2 might be present in the hypodermis and contribute to pathogen resistance in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To directly visualize the expression of HPX-2, we created a partial translational fusion of HPX-2 to GFP. Specifically, the upstream sequence and the first two exons of the <italic>hpx-2</italic> gene were cloned to generate a fusion with GFP, and the construct was injected into the worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The resulting extrachromosomal array was then integrated into the chromosome. We initially looked at the stable, transgenic worms at different development stages, but did not observe GFP expression in the majority. Occasionally (in about ~1% of the worms), we observed a green fluorescent stripe extending from the distal bulb of the pharynx to the anterior of the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). We postulated that the expression level might be too low to detect. In fact, expression data from Wormbase and our RNA-seq data (see below) indicate that the overall expression level of <italic>hpx-2</italic> gene is extremely low at the whole worm level but increases significantly upon entry into dauer. When we subsequently analyzed dauer animals using confocal microscopy, we observed weak expression of <italic>hpx-2</italic>::GFP in the distal bulb of the pharynx in nearly all animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). At higher magnification, the localization pattern was most consistent with expression in the gland cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref017">17</xref>]. Again, around 1% of the worms showed the striped expression pattern, resembling the structure called the “process” that extends from the dorsal g1 gland cell to the anterior of the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the process functions in transporting excreted material from the gland cell to the pharyngeal lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref019">19</xref>].

<title>HPX-2 contributes to cuticle integrity</title>
<p>A functional role in cuticle biogenesis was demonstrated for some of the previously studied heme peroxidases and loss-of-function mutations sometimes caused abnormal cuticle morphology. For example, MLT-7, was shown to function in conjunction with BLI-3 to cross-link the cuticular collagens during the molting process. Loss of MLT-7 resulted in a blistered phenotype due to incomplete cross-linking of these extracellular matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref013">13</xref>]. Another immune protective peroxidase previously studied by our lab, SKPO-1, has an incomplete penetrance of dumpy phenotype when mutated, again suggesting a role in cuticle generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the pathogen sensitivity phenotype that resulted from hypodermal-specific RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), we postulated that HPX-2 might play a role in the generation and/or structural integrity of the cuticle. However, unlike the <italic>mlt-7</italic> or <italic>skpo-1</italic> mutants, the <italic>hpx-2</italic> animals displayed normal morphology as observed under the dissecting microscope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). To test for more subtle defects, cuticle integrity was measured by testing how permeable the animals were to a DNA dye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref020">20</xref>]. Specifically, we exposed the worms to the DNA staining agent Hoechst 33258 and scored how many exhibited nuclear staining of underlying tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). While about 15% of N2 animals showed evidence of nuclear staining, twice as many of the HPX-2 mutants displayed this phenotype, indicative of some loss of cuticle integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The staining was observed at higher resolution to better classify which tissues were affected. Along the length of the worm, we sometimes observed enhanced staining of the hypodermal cell nuclei that underlie the cuticle on the outside of the worm’s body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We counted animals that were specifically positive for this staining pattern and found that less than 1% of N2 animals were positive for dye penetrance along the body cuticle, but 2–5% of the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants were, depending on the allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Staining of the hypodermal cell nuclei also occurs in the head region, but at higher resolution additional staining of the pharyngeal muscle tissue was observed, indicative of penetration of the cuticle that lines the pharyngeal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Approximately twice as much staining was apparent in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants compared to N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). These data are consistent with a weaker, more penetrant cuticle in both the hypodermal and pharyngeal cuticle.</p>

<p>Even though the loss of HPX-2 did not affect the low-resolution morphology of the worm, we observed that some of the strains generated by injection of higher amounts of the <italic>hpx-2</italic> complementation construct displayed a slightly dumpy or partial roller phenotype.

<p>Next, the functional relevance of the pharyngeal presence of HPX-2, was further examined. As mentioned, the apical surface of the pharyngeal lumen is lined with cuticle, which connects to the cuticle of the hypodermis. Specialized projections of the pharyngeal cuticle can form structures, such as the teeth-like formations found in the terminal bulb (grinder) that are thought to contribute to mechanical microbial disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref018">18</xref>]. HPX-2 was found to be expressed in the gland cells of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3D–3G</xref>), and the pharyngeal cuticle was more penetrant to Hoescht dye in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). The data is consistent with HPX-2 aiding cuticle development/remodeling of this organ following excretion into the pharyngeal lumen. We hypothesized that loss of <italic>hpx-2</italic> weakens the pharynx, resulting in less disruption of ingested bacteria and increased intestinal colonization by pathogens. To test this hypothesis, we exposed L4 worms to a strain of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> OG1RF that constitutively expresses GFP and measured the level of intestinal colonization by both fluorescence microscopy and CFU plating. At Day 2 of infection, we observed a higher level of intestinal colonization in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant strains, indicated by higher fluorescent intensity and CFU counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). In contrast, when we exposed worms to a <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> PA14 strain expressing dsRed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref021">21</xref>], we did not observe any significant differences between the N2 strain and the mutants in either fluorescent intensity or CFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that N2 and <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants are equally susceptible to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Although the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant might have impaired grinding capability, no obvious structural abnormalities of the pharynx were observed when examined by light and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). TEM also show that the teeth-like structures found in the grinder are normally shaped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). In addition, the pumping rate and brood size of the worms were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s003">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that HPX-2 functions in the pharynx to reduce intestinal colonization by some pathogens, possibility through structural reinforcement, hardening, of the pharyngeal cuticle, and not by changing morphological features such as the overall shape of the grinder and the grinder teeth.</p>

<title>The catalytic activity of HPX-2 is partially required for the resistance to pathogens</title>
<p>Sequence comparison of HPX-2 to other peroxidases indicates that HPX-2 possesses all the conserved residues required for peroxidase catalytic activity, including the proximal histidine (H<sup>240</sup>), the catalytic Arginine (R<sup>372</sup>), and the distal histidine (H<sup>476</sup>) (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref022">22</xref>]). On the other hand, similar to BLI-3 and MLT-7, HPX-2 lacks the covalent heme-binding residues that are conserved in mammalian peroxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref022">22</xref>]. However, this does not rule out the possibility of non-covalent heme binding since both human DUOX1 and 2 lack the conserved residues but still bind heme weakly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref024">24</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize HPX-2 has peroxidase activity.</p>
<p>In previous work, a <italic>skpo-1</italic> mutant was characterized as releasing more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than N2 when exposed to the pathogen <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic>, presumably because less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was being utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>]. In contrast, we found H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels generated by the <italic>hpx-2 (dg047)</italic> mutant were comparable to N2 following exposure to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). While this could be because HPX-2 possesses little peroxidase activity, it also could be due to its low expression level or a lack of activity under these conditions.</p>
<p>To further examine the possible contribution of HPX-2’s peroxidase activity to pathogen resistance, we analyzed a strain harboring a single amino acid mutation that changes an active site residue of the peroxidase domain. Specifically, the catalytic arginine residue was substituted to alanine using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). The catalytic arginine is conserved throughout the peroxidase–cyclooxygenase superfamily, and the substitution of the arginine to alanine abolishes peroxidase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref026">26</xref>].

All of them are upregulated, suggesting a perturbed cuticle biogeneration process upon the loss of HPX-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s008">S1 Table</xref>). We next analyzed gene expression in a <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant after 16 hours of exposure to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> OG1RF. We chose this early time point because the worms show limited damage and thus the indirect effects should be smaller than later during infection. Under these conditions, there were a total of 125 genes that were differentially expressed in the mutant (72 up-regulated and 53 down-regulated) with 106 of them unique to the pathogenic condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Interestingly, genes involved in cuticle generation were again significantly altered. Compared to the 21 genes under the nonpathogenic conditions, a total of 41 cuticle genes were affected and up-regulated. In addition to the increased changes in cuticle structural genes, there was an enrichment of genes encoding proteins involved in defense response to Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).

<p>Although the transcriptome changes we detected were modest, both in the number of genes affected and the amplitude of the effect, several observations suggest these reflect the biological effect of HPX-2. First, <italic>hpx-2</italic> gene expression is restricted to a few cells, and thus we would not expect large transcriptome effects that are averaged over the whole animal. Second, we performed five biological replicates of RNAseq and the differences were highly reproducible. Third, the affected genes are enriched for cuticle biogenesis, which correlates well with the known requirement for peroxidases in cuticle cross-linking and the increased permeability of the cuticle to dye that was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Fourth, although the overlap in genes that were significantly affected in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant under the two conditions is modest, in most cases genes that were significantly affected in one direction under the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> condition were affected in the same direction under the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> condition and vice versa, even if the effect reached significance only in one comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Finally, we used qRT-PCR to validate ten genes that were changed in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant compared to N2 under pathogenic conditions. These qRT-PCR experiments were performed on RNA isolated from three biological replicates that were independent of the RNAseq RNA samples, yet there was a strong correlation between the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g007">Fig 7C</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 between fold change by RNAseq and qRT-PCR). Therefore, we conclude that there are modest but significant effects on the transcriptome that implicate HPX-2 in cuticle biogenesis and defense against Gram-positive bacteria.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the gene profiles of animals exposed to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> as compared to those exposed to OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s010">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s011">S4</xref> Tables). In N2, a total of 4217 genes (2560 up-regulated and 1657 down-regulated) were significantly differentially expressed, many of which were consistent with previously published data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s010">S3 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref030">30</xref>]. In the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant, however, a larger number of genes were significantly differentially expressed: 8313 genes in total with 4255 of them up-regulated and 4058 down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s011">S4 Table</xref>). To examine the relationship between the two sets of genes, genes that were significantly expressed under at least one condition were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Compared to the N2 strain, the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant had similar, but stronger responses to the pathogen, contributing to the larger number of genes with significant changes in expression under the pathogenic condition. In summary, we conclude that the loss of <italic>hpx-2</italic> results in a similar, but stronger response to infection. We speculate that the greater microbial load of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> observed in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) caused this observation of a more robust transcriptional response. In other words, the <italic>hpx-2</italic> animals are essentially farther along in the infectious process than the N2 animals when they were assayed because they controlled the microbial load more poorly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that the heme-containing peroxidase HPX-2 plays an important role in attenuating infection by a variety of pathogens. We postulate that HPX-2 functions in two tissues, the pharynx and the hypodermis, to protect worms from infection as modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g008">Fig 8</xref>. In the pharynx, we favor a model in which HPX-2 contributes to the hardness/impermeability of the grinder, allowing better disruption of microbes with thick cells walls, and inhibiting microbial colonization of the intestine. In the hypodermis, we postulate that HPX-2 also contributes to the structural integrity of the cuticle, and changes to this barrier tissue perturb signaling pathways resulting in greater susceptibility. We discuss both these aspects of HPX-2 function in more detail below.</p>

Brown lines on the outside of the worm as well as in the pharyngeal lumen indicate the cuticle material that makes up the hypodermal cuticle and pharyngeal cuticle, respectively. The blue globular structures in the terminal bulb of the pharynx are the gland cells, and the blue line extending from them represent the processes through which vesicles travel for export of material to the lumen. We postulate that HPX-2 is released from the gland cells for building of the pharyngeal cuticle and released from the underlying hypodermal cells for building of the hypodermal cuticle.

<title>Pharyngeal function of HPX-2</title>
<p>In the pharynx, the expression pattern of <italic>hpx-2</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> resembles that of the gland cell reporter gene B02807::GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref031">31</xref>], with expression being observed in the process that extends from the terminal bulb to the posterior end of the buccal cavity. There are two groups of gland cells, three g1 cells and two g2 cells, located at the distal bulb of the pharynx. The gland cells are thought to secrete vesicles containing enzymes that function in the digestion of microbial food and aid in cuticle formation during the molting process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref019">19</xref>]. Specifically, during the feeding process, small vesicles are transported from the g1 cells through the process to the secretory ducts to aid digestion. During molting, much larger vesicles are transported through the process and the enzymes they contain are thought to be involved in the tearing down and building up of the cuticle, a critical remodeling process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>HPX-2 has a signal peptide sequence and is predicted to be secreted. We postulate that HPX-2 is protective by virtue of it being released into the pharyngeal lumen by gland cells to aid in cuticle remodeling of the pharynx during development. A properly developed pharyngeal cuticle is likely necessary for effective disruption of microbes during the digestive process. Because Gram-positive bacteria and fungi like <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> have thicker, harder-to-disrupt cell walls, this model could explain why the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants were colonized more efficiently by, and were more susceptible to, these pathogens compared to Gram-negative bacteria (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g005">5</xref>). The increased microbial load of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> in the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutant could also explain why the transcriptional response was stronger compared to N2 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g005">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g005">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g007">7D</xref>). The cell envelope of Gram-negatives is comprised of two membranes, but only a thin layer of peptidoglycan, rendering these organisms easier to disrupt by mechanical means (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref032">32</xref>]), and may explain why the <italic>hpx-2</italic> mutants were not more susceptible to them. While we favor HPX-2 function ultimately affecting the mechanical efficiency of pharyngeal grinding, other explanations such as helping generate a microbicidal oxidant or effects on immune signaling remain formally possible.</p>
<p>In previous studies examining staged animals, significant levels of <italic>hpx-2</italic> expression were only observed during dauer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref033">33</xref>]. Using lines expressing an HPX-2::GFP fusion, we also detected expression during dauer in most animals examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). However, we did not observe GFP expression in the vast majority of animals at other stages (L1-L4 and adult) and during pathogen exposure. The <italic>hpx-2</italic> transcript was also not induced following pathogen exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007944.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Expression was observed only occasionally in the pharyngeal processes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007944.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. Other genes encoding proteins involved in cuticle development like <italic>mlt-7</italic> are expressed at intervals corresponding to the larval molts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref013">13</xref>]. However, we did not observe consistent expression associated with molting using staged HPX-2::GFP animals. Based on all these observations, it appears that <italic>hpx-2</italic> is expressed during dauer, a time of cuticle remodeling, but the timing of its role in non-dauer development remains unclear. It is possible that HPX-2 is subject to mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation that would not necessarily be elucidated by these approaches focused on transcriptional regulation.</p>

<title>Hypodermal function of HPX-2</title>
<p>Peroxidases play important roles in cuticle bio-generation process and loss-of-function mutants frequently exhibit morphological defects. Mutations in MLT-7 or the peroxidase domain of BLI-3 result in severe blister phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref034">34</xref>]. <italic>skpo-1</italic> mutants have a partially penetrant dumpy phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>]. Loss of HPX-2 did not result in a morphological phenotype observable by light-microscopy or TEM. However, the increase in cuticle permeability, as evidenced by Hoechst staining, indicates some perturbation of the cuticle. Additionally, overexpression of <italic>hpx-2</italic>, by injection of higher concentrations of the transgene, resulted in some <italic>dpy</italic> and <italic>rol</italic> animals, again indicative of HPX-2 playing a role cuticle biogenesis in the hypodermis. Tissue-specific RNAi knock-down of <italic>hpx-2</italic> in the hypodermis resulted in a weak susceptibility phenotype. Collectively, these data suggest that <italic>hpx-2</italic> is expressed and plays an infection-protective role in the hypodermis, though expression of our HPX-2::GFP transgene was not detectable in this tissue.</p>
<p>How might a hypodermal cuticle impaired by lack of HPX-2 translate into susceptibility to pathogen, particularly pathogens that colonize and infect the intestine? First of all, it is important to note that not all cuticle defects alter sensitivity. For example, <italic>mlt-7</italic> mutations and <italic>bli-3</italic> peroxidase domain mutations result in severe blistered phenotypes, with no concomitant increase in pathogen susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref014">14</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study showed that disruption of some, but not all, aspects of hypodermal cuticle structure triggers the activation of multiple stress response pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref035">35</xref>]. Specifically, it was discovered that disruption of the annular furrows activates detoxification, osmolyte sensitivity, and most importantly, antimicrobial responses. In regards to HPX-2, we hypothesize that structural disturbance of the hypodermal cuticle perturbs signal transduction related to innate immune and/or stress responses. These changes in signaling in the hypodermis could affect the responses in other tissue by cell non-autonomous signaling events. However, a precise understanding of how cuticular localized HPX-2 impacts innate immunity will require more detailed knowledge of exactly how HPX-2 modulates cuticle structure.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In conclusion, we report the characterization of a heme peroxidase, HPX-2, that functions protectively against multiple pathogen infections in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Our data suggest that HPX-2 contributes in a peroxidase-dependent manner by modulating cuticle structure, affecting barrier function and possibly signaling. Such functions are consistent with the role of peroxidases in other systems. For example, plant peroxidases function during infection in barrier tissue remodeling, specifically cell wall cross-linking and cell wall expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref036">36</xref>]. Additionally, it has been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that ROS contribute to barrier defense when utilized by peroxidases, but also serve as a signal to induce global production of antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref038">38</xref>].

Images were acquired using Olympus FLUOVIEW FV3000 confocal microscopy equipped with Fluoview FV315-SW software. Z-stack images were acquired using a step size of 0.7 μm and processed using Olympus cellSens Dimension Desktop software. Hoechst-positive worms were scored based on staining of the cell nuclei, indicative of cuticle penetration.</p>

<title>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis</title>
<p>L4 animals were exposed for 16 hours to the condition of interest and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNA free kit (Applied Biosystems) to eliminate DNA contamination. qRT-PCR was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref047">47</xref>].

<title>RNA sequencing</title>
<p>L4 stage worms were exposed to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> or <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> for 16 hours and total RNA was extracted for 4 biological replicates. Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer with 75 nt pair-ended read format was used to conduct the sequencing. The sequencing reads (ranging from 20 million to 37 million per biological replicate) were quality and adaptor trimmed and mapped to the reference genome (version WBcel235 downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ensemblgenomes.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://ensemblgenomes.org</ext-link>) using Tophat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref048">48</xref>]. The expression level (RPKM) of annotated genes was measured using Cufflink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref049">49</xref>], and differential expression analysis was conducted using Cuffcompare and Cuffdiff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref049">49</xref>] using the gene annotation (Caenorhabditis_elegans.WBcel235.37.gff3 downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ensemblgenomes.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://ensemblgenomes.org</ext-link>).

<title>Amplex red assay</title>
<p>To measure H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration of the worms, the Amplex red assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007944.ref016">16</xref>] using the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase kit (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with the following modifications: L4 worms were exposed to a bacterial strain for 16 hours and transferred to 96 well plates with 30 worms in each well. A total of 80 mM diphenyleneiodinium chloride (DPI) (TCI, Tokyo) was added to some wells and allowed to incubate for 15 minutes prior to addition of Amplex Reagents. After 1 hour of incubation, fluorescence was measured at 540/590 nm excitation and emission, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Pharyngeal pumping rate</title>
<p>To measure the pharyngeal pumping rate of the worms, contractions of the posterior pharyngeal bulb were observed and counted over a 10 second interval for 15 adult animals under a 20X magnification stereo microscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec026">
<title>Brood size</title>
<p>To measure the brood size of the worms, 9 L4 stage worms were singled on NGM plates, allowed to lay eggs and transferred to a new plate each day until no more eggs were produced. The offspring on the plates were counted to calculate brood size.</p>

<sec id="sec027">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Survival, longevity assays, qRT-PCR, intestinal CFU, and Hoechst staining data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Kaplan-Meier log rank analysis was used to compare longevity and survival curves. An unpaired Student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the intestinal CFU and Hoechst staining data. In all the experiments, P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant and are noted in the Figs with one asterisk indicating P &lt; 0.05, two indicating P &lt; 0.01, three indicating P &lt; 0.001 and four indicating P &lt; 0.0001.</p>
