<abstract>
<p>Identifying regulatory mechanisms that influence inflammation in metabolic tissues is critical for developing novel metabolic disease treatments. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) during diet-induced obesity in mice. miR-146a is reduced in obese and type 2 diabetic patients and our results reveal that miR-146a-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have exaggerated weight gain, increased adiposity, hepatosteatosis, and dysregulated blood glucose levels compared to wild-type controls. Pro-inflammatory genes and NF-κB activation increase in miR-146a-/- mice, indicating a role for this miRNA in regulating inflammatory pathways. RNA-sequencing of adipose tissue macrophages demonstrated a role for miR-146a in regulating both inflammation and cellular metabolism, including the mTOR pathway, during obesity. Further, we demonstrate that miR-146a regulates inflammation, cellular respiration and glycolysis in macrophages through a mechanism involving its direct target <italic>Traf6</italic>. Finally, we found that administration of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, was able to rescue the obesity phenotype in miR-146a-/- mice. Altogether, our study provides evidence that miR-146a represses inflammation and diet-induced obesity and regulates metabolic processes at the cellular and organismal levels, demonstrating how the combination of diet and miRNA genetics influences obesity and diabetic phenotypes.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Obesity and metabolic disease are on the rise throughout the world, creating a need for research into the interaction between diet and genetics. It is known that chronic inflammation contributes to obesity, but it is not well understood how inflammation and inflammatory genes are controlled to prevent obesity. Here we found that a specific microRNA, miR-146a, controls inflammation and prevents obesity onset when mice are fed a high-fat diet. In the absence of miR-146a, mice become obese and develop diabetic symptoms in a diet-dependent manner. We found that miR-146a is highly expressed in immune cells and regulates the inflammatory function of macrophages within fat tissue. Within macrophages, we identified metabolic pathways regulated by miR-146a that could contribute to its protective role during DIO, and show that blockade of mTOR using rapamycin could reverse the obesity phenotype in miR-146a-/- mice. Human studies have previously shown that miR-146a expression is decreased in obese and diabetic patients, and our work suggests that miR-146a is mechanistically involved in the development of obesity and therefore can be a potential therapeutic target. Taken together, our work demonstrates that miRNA genetics and lifestyle are both important, contributing factors to diet-induced metabolic disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity incidence has reached epidemic rates in recent years, now affecting over one-third of the adult population in the United States and rising in incidence around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref001">1</xref>]. Obesity and its comorbidities, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and infections, account for the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, placing a large burden on the healthcare system and diminishing the health and life expectancy of affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref003">3</xref>]. Chronic, low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysregulation are at the center of obesity pathogenesis and progression, but the mechanisms underlying this dysregulation are not fully understood. Insights into how inflammation and metabolism contribute to obesity could aid in developing therapies and combating further spread of this condition.</p>
<p>Among regulators of metabolic pathways and inflammation are microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are ~22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA targets, thus inhibiting protein expression. Roles for miRNAs in inflammation and immunity have been widely studied, and many particular miRNAs are essential for proper immune system function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref006">6</xref>]. One such miRNA, miR-146a, is induced during inflammatory responses and acts to dampen inflammation in multiple contexts, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref009">9</xref>], autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref011">11</xref>], immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref012">12</xref>], and intestinal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref013">13</xref>]. Importantly, miR-146a has been shown to function in human adipose tissue during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref014">14</xref>], and its expression is reduced in obese and type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref019">19</xref>], suggesting a role for miR-146a in obesity.</p>
<p>Here, we show that genetic deletion of miR-146a in mice results in obesity, fatty liver disease, and dysregulated glucose levels during diet-induced obesity (DIO). These mice exhibit elevated inflammation in metabolic tissues both before and during metabolic disease. We found that miR-146a is expressed within adipose tissue and regulates the accumulation of inflammatory foci that resemble crown-like structures during a high-fat diet (HFD). Further, miR-146a is highly expressed in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of the adipose tissue, suggesting a role for miR-146a within immune cells within this compartment. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that miR-146a regulates not only inflammatory pathways, but also metabolic pathways including mTOR in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), a role not previously identified. Further assessment found that miR-146a regulates both the inflammatory response and metabolic state of macrophages through a mechanism involving repression of its target, <italic>Traf6</italic>. Finally, we found that inhibition of mTOR using rapamycin was able to reverse the obesity phenotype in miR-146a-/- mice. Altogether, these data indicate that miR-146a functions to limit diet-induced metabolic disease in mice.</p>

<title>miR-146a limits obesity during a high fat diet</title>
<p>In order to study the role of miR-146a in obesity and metabolic disease, we fed miR-146a-/- and C57BL/6 WT mice HFD. Over time, miR-146a-/- mice gained significantly more body weight than WT controls as a measure of percent initial weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s001">S1a Fig</xref>) as well as weight in grams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1b</xref>). NMR body composition analysis revealed that miR-146a-/- mice gained significantly more body fat than WT mice, with a body composition of ~40% body fat by week 12 of the HFD compared to ~20% fat for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1c</xref>). We observed no significant difference in weight gain or fat accumulation between WT and miR-146a-/- mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s001">S1b–S1d Fig</xref>). Further indicative of obesity and metabolic dysregulation, miR-146a-/- mice on HFD developed elevated serum Leptin protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s001">S1e Fig</xref>). Increased weight gain was seen in both male and female miR-146a-/- mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s001">S1f Fig</xref>). To account for possible colony-specific microbiota differences and as further confirmation, miR-146a-/- mice from Jackson Labs also showed increased weight gain compared to WT Jackson C57BL/6 controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s001">S1g and S1h Fig</xref>). The significant weight and fat gain by miR-146a-/- HFD mice was not caused by an increase in food consumption, as the groups had similar food intake over the course of the diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s001">S1i Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Upon histological examination of the adipose tissue, miR-146a-/- mice fed HFD displayed varying degrees of hypertrophied adipocytes compared to WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1e</xref>, left). Liver histological analysis showed steatosis in miR-146a-/- HFD mice that was not apparent in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1e</xref>, right). Further, liver histology scores, which measure portal inflammation and steatosis as previously outlined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref021">21</xref>], revealed that miR-146a-/- HFD mice had significantly increased liver histology scores compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1f</xref>), indicating miR-146a-/- HFD mice have worsened metabolic disease in the liver. Visceral white adipose tissue (VAT) pads from miR-146a-/- mice on HFD weighed significantly more than WT VAT pads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1g</xref>).</p>
<p>Mice were placed in metabolic chambers at 0, 3, or 18 weeks during HFD to measure phenotypic parameters before and during onset of obesity. At 18 weeks HFD, miR-146a-/- mice showed a decreased respiratory exchange ratio compared with WT mice, while minimal differences were observed at earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1h</xref>), indicating that miR-146a-/- mice began using more fat for energy later in the time course. No difference in movement was observed at 0 or 3 weeks HFD, but by 18 weeks HFD miR-146a-/- mice displayed significantly decreased movement compared to WT controls likely a result of their increased adiposity and weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1i</xref>). Although subtle, altered energy expenditure further suggested metabolic dysregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g001">Fig 1j</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether brown adipose tissue (BAT) played a role, we removed BAT from young, untreated animals and determined gene expression for BAT activation genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s002">S2a Fig</xref>), lipogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s002">S2b Fig</xref>), and inflammatory immune genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s002">S2c Fig</xref>). We did not find significant differences between WT and miR-146a-/- BAT tissue in terms of gene expression, while the removed BAT tissue weighed the same between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s002">S2d Fig</xref>). We also determined that miR-146a was expressed in BAT tissue from WT mice and absent in BAT from miR-146a-/- mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s002">S2e Fig</xref>). Following HFD, we again assessed expression of relevant genes and saw no significant differences between WT and miR-146a-/- (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s002">S2f Fig</xref>). These data suggest that mouse BAT function is not playing a major role in the phenotype. Taken together, these data indicate that the combination of a miR-146a deficiency and HFD work together to exacerbate weight gain and metabolic disease in this model of DIO.</p>

<title>miR-146a protects mice from hyperglycemia during HFD</title>
<p>Obesity is closely associated with glucose dysregulation, and recent reports found decreased miR-146a levels in PBMCs and serum of patients with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, we examined glucose homeostasis in miR-146a-/- mice during DIO. miR-146a-/- mice fed HFD displayed higher blood glucose during glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) than WT controls, or than either group on NCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s003">S3a and S3b Fig</xref>). GTTs were performed on fasted WT and miR-146a-/- mice at 0, 3, or 18 weeks HFD to determine if glucose phenotypes precede or succeed obesity in miR-146a-/- mice. Results indicate little difference between WT and miR-146a-/- mice in blood glucose at 0 and 3 weeks of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>). However, after 18 weeks, miR-146a-/- mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels than WT mice at resting and during GTT, with an increase in the GTT area under the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>). These data indicate that miR-146a-/- mice are glucose tolerant when on NCD and during early stages of DIO but lose the ability to properly regulate glucose after adiposity has begun.</p>

<p>miR-146a-/- and WT mice had comparable fasting serum insulin levels at 0 and 3 weeks HFD, yet miR-146a-/- mice had notably higher levels of serum insulin at 18 weeks HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g002">Fig 2c</xref>), revealing that miR-146a-/- mice still make insulin. Increased insulin levels can indicate insulin resistance, as hyperinsulinemia is a common symptom in T2D patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref022">22</xref>]. HOMA-β and HOMA-IR, which are based on fasting blood glucose and insulin levels and measure pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance, respectively, were calculated. Consistent with our observation that miR-146a-/- mice can still produce insulin, we saw no difference in HOMA-β function between WT and miR-146a-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g002">Fig 2d</xref>); additionally, pancreatic architecture of HFD-fed WT and miR-146a-/- mice appeared normal upon H&amp;E staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s003">S3c Fig</xref>). On the other hand, HOMA-IR was increased in the miR-146a-/- HFD group at 18 weeks, demonstrating that miR-146a-/- mice develop insulin resistance following DIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g002">Fig 2e</xref>). Taken together, these data show that miR-146a is required in mice to prevent development of a T2D phenotype during DIO.</p>

<title>miR-146a constrains inflammation in metabolic tissues during NCD and HFD</title>
<p>miR-146a has previously been shown to reduce inflammation in several contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref014">14</xref>]; therefore, we hypothesized that it may regulate inflammatory gene expression within metabolic tissues, including VAT and liver. To determine whether gene expression changes were due to HFD, inflammatory gene expression was measured via qPCR in VAT and liver tissue from WT and miR-146a-/- mice on NCD or HFD. Prior to HFD, miR-146a-/- mice had increased pro-inflammatory gene expression in VAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3a</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3d</xref>) compared to WT controls. These differences were also observed in miR-146a-/- controls on NCD for 14 weeks, where inflammatory and fatty acid transporter genes were higher in miR-146a-/- adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3b</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3e</xref>). In miR-146a-/- mice fed HFD for 14 weeks, we observed greater increases in a variety of inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3c and 3f</xref>) from miR-146a-/- compared with WT mice. Additionally, VAT from miR-146a-/- mice had increased NFκB activation, as measured by phosphorylated IKBα which serves as a surrogate for measuring NF-κB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref023">23</xref>], and this was further increased by HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3g</xref>). These data indicate that inflammation in miR-146a-/- metabolic tissues occurs in the absence of HFD and likely predisposes mice to obesity and glucose dysregulation in response to elevated fat in the diet. DIO further activates inflammation in miR-146a-/- mice, as the fold change in pro-inflammatory gene expression was further increased during HFD.</p>

<p>Blinded histological examination of H&amp;E-stained VAT revealed greater accumulation of inflammatory foci resembling crown-like structures in miR-146a-/- than in WT mice following HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3h</xref>), indicating increased immune cell activation in VAT during DIO. miR-146a has known roles within immune cells, and immune cells in VAT cause inflammation that drives metabolic disease; thus, we hypothesized that the absence of miR-146a from immune cells may exacerbates metabolic disease. To assess expression of miR-146a within certain adipose-associated cell types, we separated the SVF, which contains ATMs, fibroblasts, preadipocytes, and other leukocytes, from the adipocyte fraction of WT and miR-146a-/- VAT. qPCR was performed on RNA from these fractions, revealing mature miR-146a more highly expressed in SVF than in the adipocyte fraction of WT mice as hypothesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3i</xref>). As a control, we measured mature miR-146a in the SVF and adipocyte fractions of miR-146a-/- samples where it was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3i</xref>). Specific expression of <italic>Ptprc</italic> (CD45) in the SVF and <italic>Leptin</italic> in the adipocyte fraction ensured proper separation of these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g003">Fig 3j and 3k</xref>). These results indicate that miR-146a is more abundant within the SVF of VAT than adipocytes, suggesting that miR-146a exerts its regulatory function within adipose tissue immune cells. However, miR-146a might also be expressed and function in adipocyte progenitors or other non-immune cells and this could also contribute to the observed phenotypes.</p>

<title>Exaggerated obesity and hyperglycemia in miR-146a-/- mice is not miR-155 dependent</title>
<p>We previously showed that some age-related chronic inflammatory phenotypes exhibited by loss of miR-146a are dependent upon miR-155, an inflammation-promoting miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref010">10</xref>] whose deletion in mice has been shown to reduce DIO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref024">24</xref>]. We thus wanted to assess whether the metabolic disease and inflammatory phenotypes in miR-146a-/- mice during DIO were also dependent on miR-155. To test this, we fed HFD to WT, miR-155-/-, miR-146a-/-, and miR-155-/- miR-146a-/- (double knockout or DKO) mice for a period of 12 weeks and measured weight gain over time. miR-155-/- and WT mice gained similar weight in response to HFD, while miR-146a-/- and DKO mice both gained significantly more weight than either WT or miR-155-/- (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s004">S4a and S4b Fig</xref>). Fasting blood glucose followed this pattern, with DKO and 146a-/- mice having similar levels to each other, both higher than WT or miR-155-/- (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s004">S4c Fig</xref>). Further, miR-146a-/- and DKO mice had larger VAT pads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s004">S4d Fig</xref>), a higher percent body fat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s004">S4e Fig</xref>), and reduced lean body composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s004">S4f Fig</xref>) compared to WT or miR-155-/- mice. As evidenced by DKO mice showing no significant differences from the miR-146a-/- mice, these results demonstrate that miR-155 does not play a significant role in driving the obesity and metabolic disease phenotypes observed in miR-146a-/- mice on HFD.</p>

Of note, the top two pathways enriched in miR-146a-/- HFD macrophages were ‘TNFa signaling via NFkB’ and ‘Inflammatory Response’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s005">S5d Fig</xref>); interestingly, ‘Inflammatory Response’ was also enhanced in miR-146a-/- NCD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s005">S5e Fig</xref>). Inflammatory response genes upregulated in miR-146a-/- HFD ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4g</xref>) indicate that miR-146a regulates inflammatory ATM pathways in both lean (NCD) and obese (HFD) adipose tissue, corroborating our finding that inflammatory cytokine expression is elevated in miR-146a-/- mice regardless of diet.</p>
<p>The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and mTORC1 signaling gene sets were enriched in miR-146a-/- HFD macrophages, which was not seen in ATMs from mice on NCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4e and 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s005">S5d Fig</xref>). Genes from these enriched gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4h</xref>) indicate a novel role for miR-146a in regulating the mTOR/AKT pathway which has previously been linked to cellular metabolism and obesity. Interestingly, the Reactive Oxygen Species gene set was upregulated in miR-146a-/- macrophages during HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s005">S5d Fig</xref>). Increased reactive oxygen species are important for effective inflammatory responses and are produced in LPS-activated macrophages which undergo a metabolic switch to downregulate oxidative phosphorylation and increase aerobic glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref026">26</xref>]. Consistent with this, the glycolysis gene set was also enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s005">S5d Fig</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that miR-146a regulates gene expression in ATMs, particularly of the inflammatory response as well as a unique subset of metabolic pathways during DIO.</p>

<title>miR-146a targets Traf6 to regulate macrophage inflammation and metabolism</title>
<p>To further understand the mechanism by which miR-146a regulates metabolism and inflammation in ATMs, we analyzed the expression levels of predicted miR-146a targets from Targetscan in our RNA-seq dataset. Among the relevant predicted targets, <italic>Traf6</italic> mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the miR-146a-/- HFD ATMs compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). Traf6 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> miR-146a target in several inflammatory contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref027">27</xref>] making it a viable option for further analysis in our system. Traf6 protein levels were increased in miR-146a-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with LPS compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5b</xref>). To further investigate Traf6 as the miR-146a target regulating inflammation in our model, we developed Traf6 mutant Raw264.7 macrophages using Crispr-Cas9 (Traf6 Cr) to disrupt expression of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). Upon deletion of Traf6, we observed reduced LPS-mediated inflammatory cytokine expression, consistent with miR-146a dampening these inflammatory genes by downregulating Traf6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5d</xref>). Additionally, we used a previously characterized Traf6 peptide inhibitor (Traf6i) to reduce Traf6 activity in primary miR-146a-/- BMDMs and observed reduced inflammatory gene expression in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5e</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref028">28</xref>]. These data support a model whereby miR-146a regulates adipose inflammation at least in part by targeting Traf6 in ATMs.</p>

<p>RNA-seq also suggested an altered metabolic state in miR-146a-/- ATMs specifically when placed on HFD. This was indicated by increases in gene sets for PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, glycolysis, and reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g004">Fig 4f and 4h–4i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007970.s005">S5d Fig</xref>). Therefore, we examined the role of miR-146a in regulating metabolism in activated BMDMs. First, we assessed expression of glycolysis genes including HK2 and HIF1a and found that they were induced to higher levels in LPS-treated miR-146a-/- vs. WT control BMDMs, but not when miR-146a-/- BMDMs were treated with a Traf6i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5f</xref>). We also measured oxidative phosphorylation in LPS-activated miR-146a-/- BMDMs. Throughout a Mito Stress Test, miR-146a-/- BMDMs stimulated with LPS had low oxygen consumption rates (OCR) as compared with WT controls and media-treated cells, indicating lower oxidative respiration and little responsiveness to added glucose or to mitochondrial respiration inhibitors oligomycin (OM), FCCP, or Rotenone/Antimycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5g</xref>). Additionally, Traf6 mutant cells exhibited greater OCR when compared with WT empty vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g005">Fig 5h</xref>). These data are consistent with previous studies showing that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages undergo a metabolic switch involving increased aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. These results suggest a role for miR-146a in restricting this metabolic alteration in activated macrophages. Altogether, these data suggest that miR-146a regulates macrophage activation by influencing both inflammatory response genes and metabolic state through targeting of Traf6.</p>

<title>Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin reduces the excessive weight gain by miR-146a-/- mice on HFD</title>
<p>Having identified a novel role for miR-146a in regulating macrophage metabolism, including evidence for increased activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, we tested whether administration of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR activation, would reverse the miR-146a-/- DIO phenotypes. WT and miR-146a-/- mice on HFD were injected intraperitoneally with rapamycin 3 times per week for the last 10 weeks of a 14 week HFD experiment. Consistent with a role for elevated mTOR as a driver of DIO, miR-146a-/- mice given rapamycin put on significantly less weight than miR-146a-/- mice given the vehicle control, and resembled WT control mice in terms of their weight, percent body fat and VAT pad size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g006">Fig 6a, 6c and 6d</xref>), with no differences in food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007970.g006">Fig 6b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Obesity is a global problem, with an estimated 600 million individuals affected worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref029">29</xref>]. Understanding its pathogenesis is crucial for developing therapies and finding a cure. Our study demonstrates a physiologically relevant role for miR-146a in this context, where miR-146a is required for protection from obesity and metabolic disease during HFD and loss of miR-146a causes underlying inflammation that acts as a predisposing factor for DIO. This underlying inflammation, however, does not trigger metabolic disease on its own in our model. Although we cannot rule out a possible role for miR-146a in regulating certain aspects of metabolism in the presence of a normal diet, most metabolic phenotypes analyzed in this study only showed robust differences in the context of HFD. Thus, the combination of a miR-146a deficiency together with HFD triggers the onset of obesity and metabolic disease. This is likely caused by pro-inflammatory adipokines expressed during caloric excess that act in concert with inflammatory pathways to signal a need for increased fat storage. Importantly, our results suggest that obesity onset can be driven by a combination of miRNA genetics and diet, a finding which could have clinical relevance.</p>
<p>miR-146a is highly expressed within the SVF of adipose tissue which is rich in leukocytes, suggesting a role for this miRNA within immune cells. Based on the miR-155 data presented above, we speculate that our miR-146a-/- mouse obesity and metabolic disease phenotype might be T cell-independent as our previous model revealed a T cell-intrinsic role for miR155 during age-dependent chronic inflammation or antitumor immunity upon loss of miR-146a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref010">10</xref>]. Rather, miR-146a has been shown in previous studies to be important within myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref007">7</xref>], and our findings suggest that ATMs are at least one cell type where this miRNA may act to protect against inflammation and DIO. However, other cell types also express miR-146a and could play a role, such as B or T lymphocytes or preadipocytes, which are also found in the SVF. miR-146a has been shown to function in each of these cell types in other contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref012">12</xref>], and future work utilizing conditional knockout animals to characterize the cell-specific roles of miR-146a will further contribute to our understanding of miR-146a’s role in obesity development and progression.</p>
<p>miR-146a is well-known for regulating genes that are part of the inflammatory response, which we have shown to be dysregulated during DIO; however, other regulatory functions of miR-146a are not well-studied and could be key to understanding its role in disease as well as its therapeutic potential. Here, we found that miR-146a regulates the metabolism of activated macrophages, a previously unrecognized function for miR-146a. We saw that activated miR-146a-/- macrophages undergo metabolic reprogramming characterized by decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and this phenotype could be rescued in miR-146-/- macrophages using a Traf6 peptide inhibitor and was the opposite in Traf6-deficient macrophages. In addition to decreased OCRs observed in miR-146a-/- macrophages, the glycolysis gene set was significantly enriched in our RNA sequencing data, and we saw increased expression of glycolysis genes by qPCR which could again be rescued with the Traf6 inhibitor. This suggests that miR-146a represses Traf6 not only to control inflammatory gene expression, but also to limit the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic metabolism during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref031">31</xref>]. Our GSEA also indicated increased mTOR activation, which has been shown to regulate both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref032">32</xref>]. Of significance, we found that blocking mTOR <italic>in vivo</italic> using rapamycin could reverse the increased adiposity observed in miR-146a-/- mice on HFD.</p>
<p>Although miR-146a has been shown to have many direct targets, we found Traf6 to be de-repressed in miR-146a-/- ATMs. There is evidence that Traf6 is involved in activating Akt and mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref034">34</xref>] which may explain how these pathways are impacted by miR-146a. This may also be a more complex mechanism, as Traf6 itself localizes to the mitochondria during TLR activation, a process that is required for activation of inflammation and ROS production by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref035">35</xref>]. Further work will be needed to understand the pathways and mechanisms through which miR-146a and Traf6 regulate macrophage metabolism during DIO.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results point to a physiologically relevant role for miR-146a in protecting against DIO. Recently, direct targeting of miRNAs has been shown to have therapeutic success in disease treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref036">36</xref>], and miRNA mimics are currently being investigated for their therapeutic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref037">37</xref>]. Human studies have shown that miR-146a expression is decreased in individuals with obesity and T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref016">16</xref>]. This observation, combined with our current study, suggests that utilizing miRNA mimics to enhance miR-146a levels may have therapeutic potential for treating obesity, diabetes, and other forms of metabolic inflammation and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref015">15</xref>]. Overall, our study provides evidence that the combination of diet and miRNA genetics can have a substantial impact on obesity and diabetic phenotypes in mammals.</p>

Homogenates were placed on ice for 30 minutes then spun to separate adipocytes from SVF. Adipocytes, which float on the top, were considered the adipocyte fraction. Supernatant was then removed to obtain the pelleted SVF. RBC lysis buffer was added to the SVF, which was spun and washed. RNA was collected from the adipocyte and SVF fractions via Qiazol/miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and miR-146a levels were measured using miRCURY LNA RT PCR (Exiqon) and the mmu-miR-146a primer from Exiqon. Primer sequences for CD45 and Leptin can be found in supplemental materials and methods.</p>

<title>RNA-seq using adipose tissue macrophages</title>
<p>WT and miR-146a-/- mice were treated with NCD (Teklad 2920, Envigo) or HFD from 6 weeks of age (Research Diets D12451i) and were sacrificed at 20 weeks old. SVF pellets from three mice were combined to obtain sufficient cells for sorting and RNA collection for RNA-Seq that was performed as described above. Cells were stained with antibodies to CD45, CD11b, and F4/80, and live, singlet, CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+ cells were sorted using a FACS Aria (BD). RNA was collected via Qiazol/RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Library preparation used Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold and RNA-seq was performed using Illumina HiSeq 50 cycle single-read sequencing version 4. Sequence alignment was performed through the University of Utah Bioinformatics Core Facility and Geneset Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software were used to examine types of genes that were up or downregulated in miR-146a-/- macrophages. Predicted miR-146a targets were obtained via Targetscan for mmu-miR-146a-5p. The RNA-Seq data have been deposited into NCBI GEO under accession number GSE119703.</p>

<title>lentiCRISPR infection</title>
<p>RAW 264.7 cells were infected with a lentiviral CRISPR construct containing a Traf6 guide RNA or an Empty Vector using the same system we have previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007970.ref039">39</xref>]. The two Traf6 guide RNA constructs were: GGAGATCCAGGGCTACGATG and GATGGAACTGAGACATCTCG. For infection, the lentiCRISPR and packaging plasmids pVSVg and psPAX2 were transfected into 293T cells using Trans-IT to produce virus. The lentiCRISPR was then transduced into RAW 264.7 cells via spin infection for 90 minutes at 30 C. The day after spin infection, cells were selected with 3.75 ug/mL puromycin. Media plus puromycin was replaced every 3 days and cells split as needed. Cells were allowed to grow for 17 days before experimental use.</p>

<title>Seahorse metabolic analysis</title>
<p>WT and miR-146a-/- BMDMs were cultured in DMEM and mMCSF for 7 days, then seeded into a 96-well Seahorse XF-96 plate. Cells were treated with LPS or media control and then incubated for 24 hours, followed by a second stimulation of LPS. For Traf6i experiment, cells were pre-incubated with 20 μM Traf6i or media control for 1 hour prior to each LPS stimulation. 1 hour after the second LPS stimulation, the Seahorse XF Mito Stress test was performed using a Seahorse XF-96 analyzer. Alternatively, Cultured RAW 264.7 cells were seeded into a 96-well Seahorse XF-96 plate and LPS-stimulated at 24 hours and 1 hour prior to the Seahorse experiment. This assay was performed by the Metabolic Phenotyping Core Facility at the University of Utah, USA. Concentrations of the following were added into the injection ports: 25 mM glucose (A), 1.5 μM oligomycin A (B), 1.5 μM FCCP + 1 mM sodium pyruvate (C), 2.5 μM antimycin A + 1.25 μM rotenone (D). Glucose and pyruvate-free assay media were used during the Seahorse assay, and cultured BMDMs or RAW 264.7 cells were washed with assay media before beginning the test.</p>
