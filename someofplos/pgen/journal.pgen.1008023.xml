<abstract>
<p>The shoot systems of plants are built by the action of the primary shoot apical meristem, established during embryogenesis. In the axil of each leaf produced by the primary meristem, secondary axillary shoot apical meristems are established. The dynamic regulation of the activity of these axillary meristems gives shoot systems their extraordinary plasticity of form. The ability of plants to activate or repress these axillary meristems appropriately requires communication between meristems that is environmentally sensitive. The transport network of the plant hormone auxin has long been implicated as a central player in this tuneable communication system, with other systemically mobile hormones, such as strigolactone and cytokinin, acting in part by modulating auxin transport. Until recently, the polar auxin transport stream, which provides a high conductance auxin transport route down stems dominated by the auxin export protein PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1), has been the focus for understanding long range auxin transport in the shoot. However, recently additional auxin exporters with important roles in the shoot have been identified, including PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7. These proteins contribute to a wider less polar stem auxin transport regime, which we have termed connective auxin transport (CAT), because of its role in communication across the shoot system. Here we present a genetic analysis of the role of CAT in shoot branching. We demonstrate that in Arabidopsis, CAT plays an important role in strigolactone-mediated shoot branching control, with the triple <italic>pin3pin4pin7</italic> mutant able to suppress partially the highly branched phenotype of strigolactone deficient mutants. In contrast, the branchy phenotype of mutants lacking the axillary meristem-expressed transcription factor, BRANCHED1 (BRC1) is unaffected by <italic>pin3pin4pin7</italic>. We further demonstrate that mutation in the ABCB19 auxin export protein, which like PIN3 PIN4 and PIN7 is widely expressed in stems, has very different effects, implicating ABCB19 in auxin loading at axillary bud apices.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The plant shoot system can be considered as a population of communicating growing tips, each driven by a shoot apical meristem. Communication between these meristems acts to mediate decisions about which meristems should be active and which dormant, depending on local and systemic environmental information, and hence how branchy a plant becomes. Here we analyse the role of transporters for the plant hormone auxin in this communication network and its ability to make meristem activity decisions. Previous work in this area has focussed on the auxin export protein PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1), which has a relatively narrow expression pattern in stems and is important for high conductance transport of auxin down toward the root. Here we analyse the unique contributions of more widely expressed auxin exporters, namely PIN3 PIN4 and PIN7, as well as ABCB19. We demonstrate that they have distinct roles in regulating axillary meristem activity. PIN3 PIN4 and PIN7 are likely important for communication between the axillary meristems and the main stem PIN1-dominated polar auxin transport stream. In contrast, our results suggest a role for ABCB19 in auxin loading at axillary shoot apices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The co-ordinated regulation of plant growth requires effective communication across the plant body, prioritising growth where it is needed. A good example of this is the degree of shoot branching. The primary shoot axis of a plant is built by the activity of the shoot apical meristem, established during embryogenesis. The meristem produces stem underneath it and leaves at its flanks, and in the axil of each leaf, a new shoot apical meristem is established. These axillary meristems can become dormant buds after producing a few unexpanded leaves, or they can activate to produce a new shoot axis.</p>
<p>It has been known for many decades that shoot meristems are able to influence each other’s growth, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in apical dominance. Here, growth of the primary shoot prevents outgrowth of subtending axillary buds, and decapitation of the primary shoot releases axillary bud outgrowth. Apical dominance is mediated at least in part by the plant hormone auxin. Application of auxin to the decapitated stump of the primary shoot is able to restore axillary bud inhibition, even in axillary buds located far from the shoot tip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref001">1</xref>], suggesting long-range auxin-mediated communication between shoot apices. Consistent with this idea, the young expanding leaves of growing shoots are known to be major sites for auxin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref002">2</xref>] and this auxin is exported into the stem and transported towards the root in the polar auxin transport stream (PATS) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref003">3</xref>]). Radiolabelled auxin applied apically is transported through the PATS to the root and can be detected in vascular-associated tissues in the stem, particularly the xylem parenchyma and the cambium. In Arabidopsis, these tissues are the sites of highly polar accumulation of the PIN1 auxin efflux carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref004">4</xref>]. Mutation in PIN1 strongly reduces stem auxin transport, demonstrating an important role for PIN1 in the PATS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Although it is clear that auxin moving in the PATS can inhibit the activity of axillary buds, the auxin does not enter the buds but rather acts indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref007">7</xref>]. One mechanism by which auxin in the main stem could indirectly regulate bud activity is by reducing the ability of axillary buds to establish their own PATS out into the main stem. Establishment of high conductance auxin transport and PIN polarisation between the bud and the stem correlates with bud activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref012">12</xref>]. It likely proceeds by auxin transport canalisation, which is a process whereby an initial broad flow of auxin between an auxin source and an auxin sink becomes increasingly narrowed, upregulated, and polarised in the direction of the flow, generating files of cells that transport auxin between the source and the sink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref013">13</xref>]. If sustained bud activation requires canalised transport of auxin between the bud and the stem PATS then it will depend on the relative bud auxin source strength and stem auxin sink strength, as well as the degree of positive feedback between auxin flux and auxin transporter accumulation and polarisation. Under these circumstances, auxin moving in the main stem can inhibit bud activity indirectly by reducing stem auxin sink strength. In this way all shoot apices compete to export their auxin into a common sink- the PATS in the main stem.</p>
<p>This model has previously been considered in the context of the behaviour of PIN1. However, recent work has shown that the stem auxin transport network is more complex than the unitary highly polar activity characteristic of the PATS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref016">16</xref>]. Rather, current evidence suggest that stem auxin transport is multimodal with high-conductance, highly polar transport, as in the PATS, acting in concert with a more widespread low-conductance, less polar auxin transport activity, which we termed connective auxin transport (CAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref016">16</xref>]. The PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 auxin transporters are major contributors to CAT and play an important role in communication across tissues, since <italic>pin3pin4pin7</italic> mutant shoot apices show a reduced ability to communicate with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition to PINs, the wide tissue distribution of ABCB family auxin transporters and their demonstrated contribution to bulk stem auxin transport suggests that they may also contribute to CAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Communication between apices is also highly dependent on another class of plant hormones, strigolactones. Plants with mutations in the strigolactone pathway are highly branched (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref018">18</xref>]). Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid-derived compounds, which signal by binding to the D14 receptor triggering MAX2-dependent degradation of a small family of HSP101-like proteins, in Arabidopsis SMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref020">20</xref>]. Strigolactones appear to influence branching in two distinct ways. Firstly, they modulate auxin transport by triggering endocytosis of PIN1 from the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref022">22</xref>]. This is predicted to dampen the feedback between auxin flux and auxin transport, making it more difficult for buds to establish canalised auxin flow into the main stem, which is hypothesised to reduce branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref012">12</xref>]. In effect, through this mode of action strigolactone enhances the level of competition between buds. This increase in competition is most evident when stem segments bearing two buds are supplied basally with exogenous strigolactone. Rather than inhibiting the growth of both buds, strigolactone focuses growth into a single branch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The second mode of action for strigolactones in reducing branching is through local up-regulation of the expression of the <italic>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</italic> (<italic>TB1</italic>) class of TCP transcription factors in buds. In maize, overexpression of <italic>TB1</italic> inhibits the activity of axillary buds, leading to plants that are less branched than their wild relative teosinte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref023">23</xref>]. <italic>TB1-</italic>related genes have been identified in multiple species, including <italic>FINE CULM1</italic> (<italic>FC1</italic>) in rice and <italic>BRANCHED1</italic> (<italic>BRC1</italic>) in Arabidopsis, tomato, potato and pea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref031">31</xref>]. Loss of <italic>BRC1</italic> in Arabidopsis leads to increased branching, reduced bud-bud communication in 2-node explants, and a reduced response of branches to strigolactone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref033">33</xref>]. Strigolactone can up-regulate the transcription of <italic>BRC1</italic>, independent of new protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref027">27</xref>]. Furthermore, mutants deficient in strigolactone synthesis or perception have very low levels of bud <italic>BRC1</italic> transcripts, and Arabidopsis mutants lacking SMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8 proteins have constitutively high bud <italic>BRC1</italic> transcript levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>BRC1</italic> expression is high even in active buds of <italic>smxl6 smxl7 smxl8</italic> triple mutants, demonstrating that high <italic>BRC1</italic> expression is not sufficient for bud inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, many buds in <italic>brc1</italic> mutant plants can remain dormant, demonstrating that high <italic>BRC1</italic> is not necessary for bud inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>These data demonstrate that loss of strigolactone signalling, loss of <italic>BRC1</italic> and loss of the CAT PINs, PIN3 PIN4 and PIN7 all reduce bud-bud communication and/or competition. This raises the interesting question of the relationship between these factors, and more generally of the role of CAT in bud activation. Here we analyse the effects of CAT mutants in order to address these questions. We conclude that CAT is important for bud activation and that strigolactone-mediated shoot branching control is strongly affected by CAT, independent of effects on <italic>BRC1</italic>. We further demonstrate that ABCB19 action is distinct from that of PIN3 PIN4 and PIN7 and is involved in both strigolactone and <italic>BRC1</italic>-dependent bud regulation.</p>

<p>In addition to increased branching, strigolactone mutants display a syndrome of characteristic shoot phenotypes, including more acute branch angles, shorter stature and thinner stems than wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref036">36</xref>]. Since <italic>pin347</italic> mutants display more obtuse branch angles than wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>], we measured branch angle in <italic>max2pin347</italic> and <italic>max4pin347</italic> plants. In both these mutant backgrounds branch angle was restored to wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008023.s003">S1B Fig</xref>). Because the <italic>maxpin347</italic> mutants also appeared taller than the strigolactone mutants, we quantified plant height and found that that loss of PIN347 was able to restore partially the short stature of <italic>max</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008023.s003">S1C Fig</xref>).

<p><italic>MAX2</italic> is known to act not only in strigolactone signalling, with perception mediated by the D14 protein, but also in KAI2-mediated signalling of karrikin and its presumed endogenous karrikin-like ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref019">19</xref>].

<title>CAT contributes to increased stem auxin transport in strigolactone mutants</title>
<p>The increased branching phenotype of the <italic>max</italic> mutants can at least in part be attributed to reduced PIN1 removal from the plasma membrane, which results not only in increased branching, but also in increased PIN1 accumulation and bulk auxin transport in the stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref038">38</xref>]. To determine whether loss of PIN347 affects <italic>max</italic> stem auxin transport, we measured bulk auxin movement in relevant genotypes using our standard auxin transport assay.

<p>To determine whether the reduction of stem auxin transport in <italic>max pin347</italic> mutants is associated with reduced accumulation of PIN1, we crossed a <italic>PIN1</italic>::<italic>PIN1-GFP</italic> reporter into the <italic>max2pin347</italic> mutant background and quantified GFP on the basal plasma membrane of stem xylem parenchyma cells. Consistent with earlier reports, <italic>max2</italic> stems displayed high levels of PIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref022">22</xref>]). Loss of PIN347 had no effect on PIN1 accumulation in either wild-type or <italic>max2</italic> mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the effect of <italic>max2</italic> mutation on the accumulation of PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7, we crossed <italic>PIN3</italic>::<italic>PIN3-GFP</italic>, <italic>PIN4</italic>::<italic>PIN4-GFP</italic> and <italic>PIN7</italic>::<italic>PIN7-GFP</italic> reporter constructs into the <italic>max2</italic> mutant background and quantified GFP on the basal plasma membrane of stem xylem parenchyma cells.

<p>Together these data suggest that CAT PINs contribute to auxin transport and shoot branching in strigolactone mutants, and while PIN7 accumulation might be regulated by strigolactone, this alone is insufficient to account for the effects of <italic>pin347</italic> mutation on branch suppression in <italic>max</italic> backgrounds.</p>

<title>CAT contributes to strigolactone-mediated bud-bud competition</title>
<p>Competition between buds can be assayed using isolated stem explants bearing two nodes, and hence two axillary buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref039">39</xref>]. Typically, either one bud or both buds activate, and the degree of competition between buds is reflected in the proportion of these two outcomes. One measure of this is the relative growth index (RGI), which is the length of the longest branch divided by the sum of the lengths of both branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref039">39</xref>]. Bud-bud competition in this assay is strongly reduced in strigolactone mutants as well as in the <italic>pin347</italic> mutant background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref039">39</xref>], whereas strigolactone supplied basally through the stem increases competition between buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref021">21</xref>]. To determine whether <italic>pin347</italic> buds on two-node explants are still responsive to exogenous strigolactone, we determined the RGI of explants supplied basally with 5 μM <italic>rac-</italic>GR24, a synthetic strigolactone, or solvent control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As previously observed, <italic>pin347</italic> two-node explants without treatment display decreased bud-bud competition, with both buds often activating, resulting in a low RGI compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]). Addition of basal GR24 increased bud-bud competition, as indicated by the increased RGI, but not to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Consistent with these results, loss of PIN347 in the <italic>max4</italic> background led to a partial response to basal GR24, whereas GR24 restored <italic>max4</italic> bud-bud competition to levels comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As expected, RGI was not significantly affected by basal GR24 supply in the strigolactone-insensitive <italic>max2</italic> and <italic>max2pin347</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether the partial response of <italic>pin347</italic> to exogenous strigolactone application is also observed in intact plants, we grew plants under axenic conditions in jars, with 5 μM <italic>rac</italic>-GR24 added to the growth medium, or a solvent control. Branching was assessed 8 weeks after sowing, at which point all plants had reached terminal flowering. Both wild type and <italic>pin347</italic> plants responded to strigolactone treatment by reducing branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As for soil-grown plants, the loss of PIN347 reduced branching in both the <italic>max2</italic> and <italic>max4</italic> mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<p>Growing plants on GR24 can affect overall plant vigour, which is reflected in total dry weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref022">22</xref>]. To determine whether differences in branching could be attributed to changes in overall vigour, the dry weight of the plants used to assess branching was determined. No difference in dry weight could be detected between any of the genotypes or treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Together these data suggest that PIN347 contribute to the ability of buds to respond to strigolactone, but this can only be detected in the more sensitive bud-bud competition assay.</p>

<title>ABCB19 contributes to shoot branching</title>
<p>In addition to PIN proteins, ABCB auxin transporters also affect stem auxin transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref017">17</xref>]. Loss of two closely related members, ABCB1 and ABCB19, leads to severe growth defects and strongly reduced stem auxin transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref017">17</xref>]. Both ABCB1 and ABCB19 are expressed in a predominantly non-polar manner in a variety of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref041">41</xref>], with ABCB19 non-polarly expressed across the stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. Combined, these data suggest that ABCB1 and ABCB19 could contribute to CAT. However, we have previously been unable to detect consistent significant changes in bulk stem auxin transport in either single mutant, and the double mutant data are difficult to interpret owing to the severe morphological phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. To explore in more detail the role of ABCB19 in stem auxin transport in general, and CAT in particular, we extended our analysis of the effects of its mutation. Our standard bulk auxin transport assay is conducted over a 6-hour period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. To increase the sensitivity of this assay we assessed transport over an 18-hour period.

<p>The concept of CAT was introduced to account for the kinetics of auxin transport in Arabidopsis stems. When a pulse of radiolabelled auxin is applied to the apical end of an Arabidopsis stem segment its progress down the stem can be followed by cutting the stem into small segments and counting their radiolabel content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. The auxin pulse rapidly spreads in a manner consistent with at least two modes of stem auxin transport with exchange between them, namely PATS, consisting of high capacity highly polar transport, and CAT consisting of less polar lower capacity transport. Evidence supporting a role for PIN347 in CAT and particularly in the exchange of auxin between CAT and the PATS is the bimodal progress of an auxin pulse down the stem of <italic>pin347</italic> mutants, with some auxin moving more slowly than wild type, presumably because it is trapped in CAT tissues, and some auxin moving faster, presumably because it is trapped in the PATS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. To assess the contribution of ABCB19 to this exchange, we followed the movement of a pulse of auxin transport down the stems of <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants. No differences from wild type were detected at any of the sampled time points, suggesting that ABCB19 is not required for efficient exchange of auxin between the PATS and surrounding CAT tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously shown that mutation in <italic>ABCB1</italic> and <italic>ABCB19</italic> have no effect on shoot branching in our standard soil-grown conditions.

<p>Because loss of ABCB19 in strigolactone mutant backgrounds reduces branching in intact plants, we wondered whether <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants were strigolactone resistant. To test this, we assayed the strigolactone response of <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants in bud-bud competition assays and in intact plants grown axenically in jars. We found that untreated <italic>abcb19</italic> two-node explants displayed reduced bud-bud competition compared to wild type and that treatment with basal GR24 was only partially able to rescue this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Branching in jar-grown <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants was reduced by GR24 addition, with branching levels lower than wild type for both untreated and GR24-treated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether ABCB19 protein accumulation is altered in strigolactone deficient mutants, we introduced an <italic>ABCB19</italic>::<italic>ABCB19-GFP</italic> reporter construct into <italic>d14</italic> and assessed protein accumulation at the xylem parenchyma.

No clear effect on branching levels at maturity could be detected under standard long day conditions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008023.s005">S3D</xref>).

<p>We next measured bulk auxin transport through <italic>abcb19pin347</italic> stems over an 18-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Consistent with previous results (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g004">4A</xref>), <italic>abcb19</italic> and <italic>pin347</italic> stems displayed reduced stem auxin transport compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Auxin transport in <italic>abcb19pin347</italic> stems was no different from either <italic>abcb19</italic> or <italic>pin347</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess bud activation in more detail, we followed bud activation over two weeks in a well-established decapitation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref042">42</xref>]. In this assay, wild-type plants activate buds at a rate of approximately one per day over a period of a week, after which no further buds activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The rate of bud activation gradually increases and then decreases over this week. The <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutant showed similar bud activation kinetics to wild type for the early part of the time course, but activation then slowed earlier than in the wild type, such that there were fewer activated branches than wild type at 7 days (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Holm-Bonferroni adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), but no significant difference by 10 days onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), consistent with previously observed trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>abcb19</italic> mutant activated buds more rapidly than wild type over the first two days following decapitation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Holm-Bonferroni adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), with activation rate decreasing over time such that branch numbers converged with wild type at day three. The <italic>abcb19pin347</italic> quadruple mutant showed an essentially additive phenotype, combining the rapid early activation rate of <italic>abcb19</italic> with early slowing, similar to <italic>pin347</italic>. Total branching was reduced compared to the other genotypes by the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the effects of loss of both ABCB19 and PIN347 in strigolactone mutant backgrounds, we created <italic>max abcb19pin347</italic> quintuple mutants. Since the additive effects of <italic>abcb19</italic> and <italic>pin347</italic> are too small detect under standard long day growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), we assessed intact branching under conditions where plants were initially grown under short day conditions for four weeks and then shifted to long day growth conditions. Growth under short days prolongs the vegetative phase and increases the number of vegetative nodes, which typically all activate in <italic>max</italic> mutant backgrounds. Plants were scored at terminal flowering. As in long day conditions, <italic>max abcb19</italic> and <italic>max pin347</italic> mutants displayed reduced branching compared to <italic>max</italic> mutants alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Branching in <italic>max abcb19pin347</italic> mutants was further reduced compared to <italic>max abcb19</italic> and <italic>max pin347</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Branching in <italic>pin347</italic> was not significantly different from wild type, as in long day conditions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">6A</xref>). In contrast, branching in <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants was significantly decreased under these growth conditions, with a further reduction observed in the <italic>abcb19pin347</italic> quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). This differs from <italic>abcb19</italic> branching under long days, where no difference from wild type was detected (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g005">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g006">6A</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>BRC1</italic>-mediated branching is differentially dependent on PIN347 and ABCB19</title>
<p>The data presented above demonstrate a strong interaction between stem-expressed auxin transporters and strigolactone-mediated branching.

We have previously shown that <italic>BRC1</italic> mutants have wild-type bulk auxin transport levels and PIN1 accumulation in the xylem parenchyma, indicating that its effects on shoot branching are PIN1-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref036">36</xref>]. To determine the relationship between <italic>BRC1</italic> and CAT, we introduced the <italic>pin347</italic> and <italic>abcb19</italic> mutations into the <italic>brc1-2brc2-1</italic>, hereafter <italic>brc1brc2</italic>, mutant background.</p>
<p>Mutants lacking BRC1, and to a lesser extent the closely related BRC2, show increased branching compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref028">28</xref>]. In long-day conditions almost all nodes produce a branch, but under short-day conditions, where many more nodes are formed, many nodes carry inactive buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref033">33</xref>]. In contrast, strigolactone mutants such as the <italic>d14</italic> strigolactone receptor mutant, display a higher degree of branching than <italic>brc1brc2</italic> mutants, and this is particularly clear under conditions where many nodes are produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g007">Fig 7</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref036">36</xref>]).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Auxin transport plays a central role in shoot branching. This role has been largely attributed to the Polar Auxin Transport Stream (PATS), in which PIN1 plays a critical role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref043">43</xref>]. Loss of PIN1 results in highly pleiotropic phenotypes, including failure to produce axillary meristems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref044">44</xref>], making its specific role hard to assess. Here we have established an important role for auxin transporters with wider and less polar accumulation, specifically PIN347 and ABCB19.</p>
<p>Historically, the role of basipetal auxin transport in shoot branching has been considered in the context of auxin exported from young expanding leaves at the primary shoot apex and carried down the stem, with auxin acting at each node to inhibit bud growth. According to this idea the absolute concentration of auxin at the node is read out to modulate bud activity, for example by regulating the synthesis of a second messenger that moves up into the bud. Strigolactone has been proposed to act in this way- as a second messenger for auxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref032">32</xref>]. In this scenario, low auxin transport in the stem should correlate with low auxin concentration at nodes and hence increased branching. This correlation is broken in strigolactone mutants, where high auxin transport and high stem auxin concentrations correlate with increased shoot branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref038">38</xref>]. That the auxin transport phenotype is directly associated with the branching phenotype is supported by the fact that treatment with low concentrations of auxin transport inhibitors such as NPA can restore wild-type branching levels in strigolactone mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref038">38</xref>]. Here we extend this result, demonstrating that the <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutant reduces main stem auxin transport in strigolactone mutant backgrounds, and also reduces branching.</p>
<p>These data provide support for an auxin transport canalisation-based mechanism for bud activation, where bud activity does not depend straightforwardly on stem auxin concentration, but rather on the relative sink strength of the stem for auxin compared to the source strength of the bud, coupled with the degree of positive feedback between auxin flux out of the bud into the stem and auxin transporter accumulation and polarisation along this transport route. Furthermore, the data support the idea that strigolactone modulates shoot branching at least in part through effects on auxin transport canalisation between the bud and the main stem. PIN3 PIN4 and PIN7 accumulate in the tissues between the bud and the stem PATS and their mutation reduces branching in strigolactone mutants. This is not a generic effect, since there is no effect on branching in either the wild type, or the highly branched <italic>brc1brc2</italic> double mutant. This can be explained if strigolactone mutant buds activate because low PIN1 removal from the plasma membrane makes establishment of auxin transport canalisation between the bud and the stem easier to achieve. Under this model, reduced PIN347-mediated auxin flux from the bud across the CAT tissues and into the main stem PATS could work against the feedback in the canalisation process, restoring bud inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The reduced bud activation rate of <italic>pin347</italic> mutants following decapitation is consistent with this idea. Similarly, the reduced ability of <italic>pin347</italic> mutant buds to communicate with each other in 2-node assays is consistent with reduced auxin flow across the stem.</p>

<title>Model for bud activation.</title>
<p>Cartoon of a nodal Arabidopsis stem segment with associated bud (leaf not shown). The coloured arrows indicate the flow of auxin (green) and strigolactone (red). The blue shading indicates the polar auxin transport stream (PATS), with PIN1 dominating, and the orange shading represents the connective auxin transport (CAT), with PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 dominating. The black lines indicate hypotheses involving either promotion (arrowheads) or repression (end lines). Specifically, we have previously proposed that positive feedback between auxin flux and PIN polarisation drives canalisation of auxin transport between the bud and the main stem, and this is necessary for sustained bud activation. We have also previously proposed that strigolactone inhibits canalisation by triggering PIN1 endocytosis. Data presented here suggest that this might also be true for PIN7, but that the transport activities of PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 are all important to allow maximal bud activation in strigolactone-defective mutants. Although it is possible that ABCB transporters are also important in the stem, the very different effects of the <italic>abcb19</italic> mutant compared to the <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutant lead us to propose that an important site of action is in the bud, where they may contribute to auxin loading, and therefore canalisation of auxin transport out of the bud. Consistent with this idea, the branchy phenotype of <italic>brc1</italic> mutants is partly suppressed in the <italic>abcb19</italic> mutant background. This is consistent with the idea that BRC1 acts at least in part through increasing bud auxin loading, either independently of upstream of ABCB19.</p>

</fig>
<p>This highlights an important feature of the 2-node assay. A low relative growth index can reflect two distinct system properties. Both buds could activate because each bud is difficult to inhibit, as in the case of strigolactone mutants, or both buds could activate because of their reduced ability to inhibit one another, as we propose for the <italic>pin347</italic> mutant. In this context it is interesting to note that <italic>pin347</italic> and <italic>abcb19</italic> explants behave similarly in 2-node assays. Both show reduced competition between buds and reduced strigolactone response compared to wild type. However, for a range of other branching phenotypes they show marked differences.</p>
<p>A particularly striking difference is that <italic>abcb19</italic> mutation reduces branching in both strigolactone and <italic>brc1brc2</italic> mutants, whereas <italic>pin347</italic> has no effect in a <italic>brc1brc2</italic> background. In addition, <italic>abcb19</italic> has a stronger effect on branching in wild-type plants than <italic>pin347</italic>. Another notable contrast is that of bud activation kinetics following decapitation, where <italic>pin347</italic> mutation slows activation rate late after decapitation, while <italic>abcb19</italic> mutation accelerates activation rate early after decapitation. Similarly, there are different effects on stem auxin transport dynamics, with evidence supporting a role for PIN347 in auxin exchange between the PATS and CAT, but no indication of a similar role for ABCB19, despite at least some effect of <italic>abcb19</italic> on bulk stem auxin transport. Consistent with these distinct modes of action are the additive effects of <italic>pin347</italic> and <italic>abcb19</italic> on branching in high branching environments and genetic backgrounds. Thus, PIN347 and ABCB19 have distinct roles in stem auxin transport and this is associated with distinct roles in bud activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpreting these results requires caution. According to the auxin transport canalisation-based model, bud activation depends on the relative auxin source strength of the bud, the sink strength of the stem and the degree of positive feedback between auxin flux and auxin transport in the direction of the flux. Changes in the auxin transport system can affect all of these properties simultaneously and in interconnected ways, making it difficult to predict the outcome of a simple intervention, or to establish straightforward causal relationships. These interconnections also mean that the same intervention can have opposite effects depending on the state of the system. For example, we have previously shown that strigolactone treatment can promote branching in genetic backgrounds with compromised PIN insertion, whereas it typically inhibits branching in wild-type backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In the context of the genetic analyses we present here, it is tempting to speculate about the extent to which these different transporters act directly in the signalling pathways for the various players in the system. Interestingly, while PIN3 and PIN4 levels at the plasma membrane of xylem parenchyma cells are unchanged in the strigolactone mutants, PIN7 over-accumulates compared to wild type. This raises the possibility that PIN7, like PIN1, is a direct target for strigolactone signalling, whereas PIN3 and PIN4 are not. However, only the triple <italic>pin347</italic> mutant strongly suppresses the shoot branching phenotypes of strigolactone mutants. Therefore, as well as PIN7 potentially directly contributing to the strigolactone response, it is likely that expression of PIN347 in the stem tissue between the bud and the PATS is required for efficient auxin transport canalisation between the bud and the stem. This could result in strigolactone resistance and suppression of branching in strigolactone mutants by reducing positive feedback during auxin transport canalisation independently of the effect of strigolactone on this same process, acting via PIN7 and PIN1, in the same way that NPA treatment reduces branching in strigolactone mutants.</p>
<p>In this context it is interesting that <italic>pin347</italic> mutation does not affect <italic>brc1brc2</italic> branching. Current evidence suggests that strigolactone regulates bud growth in Arabidopsis by two separate mechanisms- inducing PIN1 endocytosis and up-regulating <italic>BRC1</italic> transcription. The mechanism of action of BRC1 in regulating bud growth is apparently independent of PIN1, and lack of suppression by <italic>pin347</italic> is consistent with this idea, while at the same time supporting the idea that <italic>pin347</italic> influences branching through effects on the positive feedback in canalisation.</p>
<p>In contrast <italic>abcb19</italic> mutation suppresses both strigolactone and <italic>brc1brc2</italic> mutants. The effect of <italic>abcb19</italic> could be a general bud suppressing effect, or it could be specifically downstream of strigolactone acting via <italic>BRC1</italic>. An attractive hypothesis is that ABCB19 is important for loading auxin into the bud PATS in the bud apex. This is consistent with its role in young seedlings, where auxin loading at the shoot apex has been shown to be deficient in <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref045">45</xref>]. According to this model, <italic>abcb19</italic> mutants might have reduced bud auxin source strength as a result of poor auxin loading. This could account for the suppression of branching in <italic>brc1brc2</italic> by <italic>abcb19</italic>, particularly if BRC1 modulates bud activation potential by an effect on bud auxin source strength, either via ABCB19 or via a parallel mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The strong reduction in ABCB19 accumulation in the <italic>d14</italic> mutant background is somewhat counterintuitive, since our double mutant analysis demonstrates that loss of <italic>ABCB19</italic> function suppresses branching in strigolactone mutants. On the other hand, this result does suggest a direct link between ABCB19 and strigolactone signalling which could be explained by negative feedback in the pathway. For example, as proposed above, strigolactone acting via <italic>BRC1</italic> may down-regulate ABCB19 activity, repressing shoot branching by reducing auxin loading in the bud. In strigolactone mutants ectopic bud activation could therefore be partly due to over-activation of ABCB19. If this hyperactivity triggers negative feedback in ABCB19 accumulation, then strigolactone mutants would both show reduced shoot branching and reduced ABCB19 accumulation.</p>
<p>Distinct effects of PIN347 and ABCB19 at different points in the canalisation process- auxin flux and therefore PIN1 accumulation, versus bud auxin loading- is consistent with the additive effects of their mutation on branching. The establishment of canalised auxin export, and therefore sustained bud growth, could be differently sensitive to changes in different parts of the system in different contexts. This could account for the different effects the auxin transporter mutations in different assays. For example, both <italic>abcb19</italic> mutation and <italic>pin347</italic> mutation suppress branching in strigolactone deficient mutants, but in decapitated wild-type plants, <italic>abcb19</italic> mutation accelerates bud activation, whereas <italic>pin347</italic> delays it, although for both the total number of buds activated eventually equilibrates at wild-type levels. In decapitated plants, sustained bud activation may be driven by high stem auxin sink strength. Under these circumstances, the positive feedback in flux-driven PIN accumulation along the route from the bud to the stem PATS might be important for rapid canalisation, whereas auxin loading in the bud may be less critical.</p>
<p>This explanation raises questions, which we hope to address in the future, about the importance of auxin loading at the bud apex for bud activation and bud-bud competition, and the role, if any, that <italic>BRC1</italic> plays in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008023.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Given the multiple levels of feedback in the shoot auxin transport network, further refinement of our computational models of auxin transport dynamics is likely to be essential in tackling these questions.</p>

<title>Phenotypic measurements</title>
<p>All measurements were conducted at terminal flowering, unless indicated otherwise. In our growth conditions this was approximately 7 weeks post-germination. Primary branching was quantified for each plant, counting the number of first-order cauline and rosette branches &gt; 5 mm. Rosette branch activation was determined as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008023.ref042">42</xref>], where the number of active rosette branches (&gt; 5 mm) was determined daily post-decapitation. Branch angles were measured by photographing the junction of the primary inflorescence and the two most basal two cauline inflorescences. Using these images, the angle between the stem and the adaxial side of the branch was determined using Fiji. The branch angle of each plant was defined as the average of these two measurements. Stem diameter was determined using digital callipers (Mitutoyo 150 mm, 0.01 mm accuracy) by measuring the diameter of the primary inflorescence at the base. The widest and narrowest points were measured and the stem diameter of each plant was defined as the average of these two measurements.</p>
