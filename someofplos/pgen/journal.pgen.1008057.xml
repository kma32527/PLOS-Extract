<abstract>
<p>Identifying small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively stalling the ribosome constitutes a new strategy for therapeutic development. Compounds that inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified that reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical models and that affect the translation of only a few off-target proteins. Although some of these compounds hold potential for future therapeutic development, it is not known how they impact the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control pathways. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor, PF-06378503 (PF8503). The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503, the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3, bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. In genetic interaction experiments, ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L. Taken together, these results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways, and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation that will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>A fundamentally new approach to treat human diseases caused by “undruggable” proteins would be to use small molecules to selectively inhibit their synthesis by the ribosome. Here we compare two related compounds (PF846, PF8503) that selectively stall human translation to the effects of a more general translation inhibitor, homoharringtonin. We used genome-wide approaches to probe the effects of these compounds, including measurements of which messenger RNAs are being translated and the effects of knocking down gene expression on cell growth. These experiments revealed new and surprising genetic connections between ribosome quality control pathways. We then used biochemical and cell-based experiments to test the involvement of particular ribosome quality control proteins such as ASCC2, ASCC3 and HBS1L in the physiological response of cells to translation inhibitors. The genetic and biochemical insights presented here should aid the development of next-generation selective translation inhibitors to treat disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proteins are the main druggable therapeutic targets for the treatment of human diseases, ranging from metabolic disease, to cancer and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref001">1</xref>]. Most therapeutic strategies consist of inactivating key protein enzymatic or binding activities by using small molecules or antibodies. However, many proteins remain “undruggable” due to the difficulty in identifying small molecule or biological inhibitors of their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref002">2</xref>]. An alternative approach would be to prevent the synthesis of target proteins in the first place, by targeting the step of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref003">3</xref>]. However, targeting translation in a highly specific way remains an unsolved problem. Many known translational inhibitors bind to the ribosome in close proximity to messenger RNA (mRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA) binding sites, and thereby interfere with different steps of the translation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref004">4</xref>]. These mechanisms of action, even if context-specific, lead to substantial inhibition of translation which is extremely toxic, as exemplified by the many classes of antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref006">6</xref>]. In humans, the low specificity and high toxicity of homoharringtonine (HHT), the only translational inhibitor approved as a drug treatment, makes this compound useful as a last resort treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref008">8</xref>], but it is not clear how its mechanism could be repurposed for specific drug targets.</p>
<p>As opposed to affecting translation for much of the proteome, a new class of compounds has been identified that selectively targets the translation of PCSK9, with few off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref011">11</xref>]. These compounds bind in the ribosome exit tunnel, and seem to affect the trajectory of the growing nascent polypeptide chain in the exit tunnel as it is extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref012">12</xref>], thereby selectively stalling translation of a narrow spectrum of transcripts. Understanding the molecular basis for how these compounds selectively stall translation will be critical for the future design of transcript-specific translation inhibitors to target previously undruggable proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref002">2</xref>]. However, designing new molecules as selective translation inhibitors to treat disease also necessitates a better understanding of how cells respond and adapt to compound-induced translational stalling.</p>
<p>Genomic screens serve as powerful and unbiased tools to identify genetic modifiers of the action of small molecule inhibitors. They can be used to discover proteins involved in an inhibitor’s mechanism of action, and to assess possible targets for combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref014">14</xref>]. In particular, CRISPR interference screens (CRISPRi) allow robust and highly specific knockdown of gene transcription with minimal off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref015">15</xref>]. These screens can be used to compare the effects of inhibitors on cell growth as a function of genetic background, and to identify components of genetically related pathways and how these are influenced by drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref016">16</xref>]. Here, we used a genomic CRISPRi screen using a compound that selectively stalls the translation of human PCSK9, to test the effects of this class of compound on human cell fitness. We used compound PF-06378503 (PF8503) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>], a compound related to the PCSK9 selective translational inhibitor PF-06446846 (PF846) described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>], but which is slightly more toxic, to exert the selective pressure required for growth-based CRISPRi screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>]. We show using ribosome profiling that PF8503 inhibits translation of an overlapping set of proteins compared to PF846, along with a distinct set of off-target proteins. In the CRISPRi screen, we identified proteins that suppress or enhance the toxicity of PF8503, a number of which are associated with translation and ribosome quality control pathways. We used targeted CRISPRi to validate the involvement of these proteins in cell fitness during PF8503 treatment, and to identify genetic interactions between ribosome quality control pathways. We also compared the genes identified in the PF8503 CRISPRi screen with those identified using the non-selective translation inhibitor HHT, in order to reveal the pathways likely to be general cellular responses to the stress induced by translation inhibition. Taken together, these results reveal pathways affected by selective stalling of translation, and suggest the cell dependencies most likely to be impacted by this class of inhibitors.</p>

<title>Cell toxicity of PF8503 and PF846</title>
<p>Growth based CRISPRi genetic screens require variation of cellular fitness of knockdowns to identify pathways and proteins involved in resistance or sensitivity to a stress condition. Therefore, to carry out a growth-based screen, a slightly toxic concentration of compound must be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>]. Previous studies showed that cells from the hematopoietic lineage are more sensitive to the class of compounds that include PF846 and PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>]. In these experiments, which used rat bone marrow, PF846 and PF8503 had similar toxicity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>]. The CRISPRi screen library was originally developed and validated in K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref015">15</xref>], immortalized leukemia cells that can be induced to develop characteristics similar to early-stage erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref018">18</xref>]. Given their close relationship to the hematopoietic lineage, we therefore used K562 cells to implement the CRISPRi screen. We first compared K562 cellular viability as a function of PF8503 and PF846 concentrations, and found PF8503 had a slightly higher negative impact on cellular metabolic activity and was slightly more toxic than PF846 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). We determined the best concentration of PF8503 to use in the CRISPRi screen to be 7.5 μM, which decreases cell viability 30–40% (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Ribosome profiling to identify proteins targeted by PF8503</title>
<p>Before using PF8503 in a CRISPRi screen, we first used ribosome profiling to compare proteins targeted by PF8503 and the previously described compound PF846 in liver-derived Huh-7 cells, which endogenously produce PCSK9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>]. We first treated Huh-7 cells with increasing concentrations of PF8503 to identify its IC50 value with respect to inhibiting PCSK9 production, which was similar to that of PF846, or ~0.4 μM (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). We then treated Huh-7 cells with 1.5 μM PF8503, which corresponds to ~70% of the maximal inhibition of PCSK9 production, or 0.5% DMSO (vehicle control) for 1 hour prior to isolating ribosome protected fragments for ribosome profiling library generation. The same experiment and pipeline was used in parallel with PF846 in order to compare our results to previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>]. After using the bioinformatic pipeline described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s002">S2A Fig</xref></bold>), we found that PF8503 affected the translation of 46 mRNAs, whereas PF846 affected translation of 24 mRNAs after 1 hr of treatment. As expected PCSK9 was affected by both compounds with a log<sub>2</sub> fold change of -1.5 and -2 for PF8503 and PF846, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s013">S1 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The percentage of mRNAs affected by PF8503 (0.50%) is comparable to that for PF846 (0.27%), (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>). The protein targets of PF8503 overlap with those of PF846 (10 of 24 proteins, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>), but PF8503 and PF846 inhibit the translation of 36 and 14 distinct mRNAs, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3C Fig</xref></bold>). Notably the potency of PF8503 stalling on many of the common targets is higher than that of PF846 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>), as assessed by differential readcounts 3’ of the stall sites (defined by DMax) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Furthermore, some of the additional proteins stalled in PF8503-treated cells are slightly impacted in the PF846-treated cells, but to a lower extent that did not allow these to pass the statistical filters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3C Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s013">S1 Table</xref></bold>). We found that the stall sites on a given mRNA occurred at identical or nearly the same codons of the transcript when comparing ribosomal footprints from the PF8503- and PF846-treated cells. As observed previously, stalling occurs near the N-terminus of the protein, although not exclusively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We also compared our present PF846 results with the 21 PF846 targets previously identified in Huh-7 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3D Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s014">S2 Table</xref></bold>) and observed that changes in the read count 3’ of the stall site defined by DMax were highly correlated between experiments (Pearson R = 0.82), showing the high reproducibility of our method of analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). However, we found that the main stall site position seen in the ribosome profiling read-counts varied slightly when comparing the present PF846 treatment and the previously published PF846 data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>], and when comparing PF8503 and PF846 stall sites on common targets (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s013">S1 Table</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s014">S2 Table</xref></bold>). This could be due to technical variability in the preparation of the ribosome profiling libraries, such as the efficiency of RNAse I digestion. Alternatively or in addition, this variability may reflect that compound-induced inhibition of translation is not due to a sharp stall at one codon position, but occurs due to a slow-down of translation over multiple adjacent codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref012">12</xref>]. Altogether, these results indicate that PF8503 is a selective inhibitor of translation and shares a similar mechanism of action to that of PF846 in stalling protein synthesis.</p>

<title>CRISPRi screen to uncover genetic modifiers of cellular growth in the presence of PF8503</title>
<p>To identify pathways involved in the cellular response to high concentrations of PF8503, we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen with an established whole-genome library of sgRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>]. Human K562 cells constitutively expressing dCas9-KRAB-BFP were cultured with 7.5 μM PF8503 or 0.5% DMSO as a control. We used deep sequencing of the genomically-expressed sgRNAs in the cell population at the start and end of the experiment to determine their enrichment or depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>]. Briefly, sgRNA enrichments in the DMSO-treated control and PF8503-treated populations correspond to growth phenotypes termed Gamma and Tau, respectively, and quantify the impact of sgRNA expression on cell fitness independent of treatment. The difference in sgRNA enrichment between the control and PF8503-treated population corresponds to the impact of the compound on cell fitness independent of the impact of sgRNAs on cell growth, a parameter termed Rho (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>).</p>

Promoters in the lentiviruses for sgRNA (murine U6, mU6) and Puromycin resistance cassette (EF1α) are shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>]. After the cells were cultured for 11 days, with or without treatment with PF8503, the quantified genomically-integrated sgRNAs (day 0 and day 11) were used to calculate the effect of each sgRNA on growth without drug (Gamma), with drug (Tau) and the effect of drug treatment (toxin phenotype, Rho). Cells are color-coded as follows: white, no sgRNA; grey, non-targeting sgRNA; green, enriched sgRNA; blue, depleted sgRNA. Right, genes with enriched sgRNAs sensitize cells (green, protein product predicted to enhance PF8503 toxicity) or with depleted sgRNAs protect cells (blue, protein product predicted to decrease PF8503 toxicity), from PF8503 treatment (Rho parameter). (B) Position of the 50 top protective (blue) and sensitizing (green) genes mapped to cellular pathways. The size of the circles are proportional to the PF8503 Rho phenotype shown in (A).

<p>Genes from the PF8503 CRISPRi screen were filtered based on their compound-specific phenotypes (Rho &gt; |0.1|) and Mann-Whitney adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value (&lt;0.000001) leading to a total of 452 genes impacting cell fitness (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). These genes were then assessed for pathway enrichment using the STRING database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref019">19</xref>]. This analysis revealed a clear distinction between pathways protecting or sensitizing the cell to PF8503 toxicity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). For example, proteins whose expression protects cells from PF8503 toxicity are highly enriched in mRNA synthesis and export pathways (transcription regulation, splicing, EJC-TREX complex) and cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair pathways (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). By contrast, pathways sensitizing cells to PF8503 are concentrated in the mitochondrion, ribosome biogenesis and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002"><bold>Fig 2B</bold> and <bold>2C</bold></xref>). A third category of proteins are protective in the DMSO control (Gamma) but sensitizing in the PF8503-treated samples (Tau) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>), including proteins involved in tRNA wobble nucleotide U<sub>34</sub> modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref020">20</xref>], 60S ribosomal subunit maturation (ZNF622) and mRNA turnover (CNOT10, CNOT11).</p>
<p>Notably, proteins known to be involved in rescuing stalled ribosomes also affect cell viability in the presence of PF8503, suggesting that ribosome quality control pathways are triggered upon compound-induced stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002"><bold>Fig 2B</bold> and <bold>2C</bold></xref>). No-Go Decay proteins (NGD) Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L, involved in recognizing stalled ribosomes, enhance PF8503-induced cell toxicity, with PELO showing the highest sensitizing phenotype among these hits (Rho = 0.43). Other proteins that sensitize cells to PF8503 include Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) proteins NEMF and LTN1, involved in recycling the 60S subunit of the ribosome, and CNOT proteins involved in mRNA degradation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>). The sgRNAs most potent in decreasing cell fitness target two of the three subunits that constitute the activating-signal co-integrator complex (ASC-1), subunits ASCC2 and ASCC3. ASCC3 has been implicated in ribosome quality control, by aiding in resolving stalled ribosomes on poly-A sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<title>ASCC2 and ASCC3 impact caspase induction, and interact with cytoplasmic ribosomes</title>
<p>The observation that knockdown of ASCC2 or ASCC3 is highly toxic in the presence of PF8503 suggests a major role of the ASC-1 complex in cell survival upon PF8503 induced translational stress. Induction of apoptosis has been observed in conditions of proteotoxic stress, i.e. downstream of the integrated stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref022">22</xref>]. We therefore assessed the impact of decreased ASCC2 or ASCC3 expression in the presence of PF8503 by testing for activation of executioner caspases 3 and/or 7 upon long term compound treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). Whereas cells transfected with a non-targeting scrambled sgRNA and treated with PF8503 showed no significant induction of caspase 3/7 activation (apoptotic index ~0.1), knockdown of ASCC3 increased the apoptotic index to greater than 1 in the presence of PF8503 but not in DMSO-treated controls. ASCC2 knockdown also elicited a higher apoptotic index in the presence of PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). By contrast, in a survey of genes identified by the CRISPRi screen, no other knockdown cell lines showed an appreciable induction of apoptosis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Although ASCC2 and ASCC3 contribute to cell viability in the presence of PF8503, their role in rescuing stalled translation complexes of the type generated by PF8503 is not established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, these proteins in the ASC-1 complex have known roles in the nucleus as transcriptional activators and in the alkylated DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref024">24</xref>]. If these proteins have a direct role in the recognition or rescue of stalled ribosomes, they should interact in the cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation of ASCC3 in the cytoplasmic fraction of HEK293T cells showed that ASCC2 and ASCC3 interact in the cytoplasm, independently of PF8503 treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>), although the presence of ASCC2 in the non-bound fraction indicates that not all of ASCC2 is associated with ASCC3. None of three ribosomal proteins tested (RPL27 or RPS3, RPS19) was found in these immunoprecipitations (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>). Interestingly, ASCC2 and ASCC3 can be found to co-fractionate with ribosomes in a sucrose cushion of K562 cellular extracts (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). In high-salt sucrose cushions, ASCC2 remains bound to the ribosome, whereas ASCC3 levels are greatly reduced, suggesting that the interaction of ASCC3 with the ribosome is indirect and/or unstable. The third member of the ASC-1 complex, ASCC1, also fractionates with the 80S ribosome (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>), in both low- and high-salt conditions.</p>

<title>ASCC2, ASCC3 and HBS1L knockdowns do not impact general translation or the ability of PF8503 to induce PCSK9 stalling</title>
<p>Since HBS1L is involved in NGD pathways, and ASCC2 and ASCC3 bind the ribosome and could also contribute to ribosome quality control, we wondered whether their knockdown would impact translation in the presence of PF8503. Using metabolic labelling with the methionine homologue L-AHA, we measured global translation in the presence and absence of PF8503. PF8503 did not decrease global translation in control cells with a scrambled sgRNA, whereas translation was significantly inhibited with non-specific translation inhibitor cycloheximide (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, none of the knockdowns of HBS1L, ASCC2, or ASCC3 affected global translation compared to the control cell line, either in the presence or absence of PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). The ability of PF8503 to induce selective stalling was also unaffected by the knockdowns of HBS1L, ASCC2, or ASCC3. Using a reporter mRNA with codons 1–35 of PCSK9 encoded at the N-terminus of Renilla luciferase, the IC50 for PF8503 was found to be ~0.3 μM for control cells and all three knockdown cell lines (Control, 0.39 +/- 0.02 μM; ASCC2 KD, 0.31 +/- 0.04 μM; ASCC3 KD, 0.26 +/- 0.06 μM; HBS1L KD, 0.39 +/- 0.03 μM; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g004">Fig 4D</xref></bold>). These results indicate that the effects of knocking down HBS1L, ASCC2, and ASCC3 on cell fitness in the presence of PF8503 is not due to generally lower rates of translation, or to a direct role for these proteins in PF8503-induced stalling.</p>

<title>Genetic interactions between ASCC3 and RQC and NGD pathways</title>
<p>In order to check whether the effects of ASCC2 and ASCC3 on cell fitness during PF8503 treatment are interdependent, we constructed a cell line in which both ASCC2 and ASCC3 were knocked down using dual sgRNAs, as described in previous Perturb-seq experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref025">25</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s009">S9A Fig</xref></bold>). We also generated cell lines in which both ASCC3 and NEMF or ASCC3 and HBS1L were knocked down, to check for genetic interactions with the RQC or NGD pathways, as hypothesized by a role of ASCC3 in a RQC-trigger (RQT) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>]. In these experiments, we noted that knockdown of ASCC3 in the context of using dual sgRNAs was not as efficient as the case with single sgRNAs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s009">S9B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s009">S9C Fig</xref></bold>). We therefore generated a dual-sgRNA cell line with a scrambled sgRNA and ASCC3 sgRNA to serve as a control for the double-knockdown cell lines. We then used competitive growth assays as in the CRISPRi validation experiments to determine the effects of combined knockdowns in the presence of PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s009">S9A Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Effects of double knockdowns of ASCC3 and genes involved in translation quality control on PF8503 toxicity.</title>
<p>(A) Lentiviral construct used to generate double knockdown cell lines. For each construct, the sgRNA targeting ASCC3 was placed after the human U6 (hU6) promoter, and a second sgRNA (scrambled or targeting ASCC2, NEMF, or HBS1L) was placed after the murine U6 (mU6) promoter. (B) PF8503 phenotype (Rho) obtained in competitive growth assays performed using double knockdown cell lines (grey), compared with the rho phenotype expected from the sum of phenotypes of individual knockdowns. Due to less efficient knockdown of ASCC3 in the dual-sgRNA context, the individual phenotype of ASCC3 knockdown was taken from the cell line expressing mU6-scrambled sgRNA-hU6-ASCC3 sgRNA pair. All other phenotypes were taken from the individual knockdowns in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>.

<p>Interestingly, simultaneous knockdown of both ASCC2 and ASCC3 recovered wild-type fitness in the presence of PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). This negative epistasis provides strong genetic support that ASCC2 and ASCC3 are part of the same pathway in the context of cell response to PF8503-induced translational stress. On the other hand, the fitness of the NEMF-ASCC3 double knockdown cells is that expected based on simple addition of each protein’s individual phenotype in the presence of PF8503. This does not fully rule out a role of ASCC3 in activating RQC but suggests that these proteins can act in independent pathways. Interestingly, the double knockdown of HBS1L and ASCC3 also showed a negative epistasis, with a phenotype of the double knockdown (Rho~0.3) similar to the phenotype of the single knockdown for HBS1L (Rho~0.2) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). In separate experiments in which lentiviral vectors expressing sgRNAs for HBS1L and either ASCC2 or ASCC3 were introduced into cells sequentially, we also observed a strong negative epistasis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>). Importantly, PF8503 retained its ability to stall PCSK9 reporters in the ASCC2-ASCC3 and HBS1L-ASCC3 double knock-down cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s011">S11 Fig</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results suggest that ASCC3 and ASCC2 act in an overlapping pathway with the NGD pathway, which requires HBS1L.</p>

<title>Comparison of PF8503 with the non-specific translational inhibitor HHT highlights common pathways affected by translation inhibition</title>
<p>In order to ascertain whether the genes identified by the PF8503 CRISPRi screen are specific to selective translational stalling, we compared the PF8503 screen to a CRISPRi screen carried out with the general translation inhibitor HHT, a non-specific translation inhibitor that stalls translation immediately after initiation and early in elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref027">27</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref028">28</xref>]. The HHT CRISPRi screen used the same engineered K562_dCas9-KRAB cells, with HHT added at its LD50 value (100 nM). Overall, the HHT-dependent phenotypes for all genes did not correlate well with the PF8503-dependent phenotypes, using the stringent filters applied for the PF8503 CRISPRi screen (Rho<sub>PF8503</sub> vs. Rho<sub>HHT</sub>, Pearson R = 0.11) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). By contrast, the growth phenotypes due to the inherent effects of knockdowns for both CRISPRi screens (Gamma<sub>PF8503</sub> vs. Gamma<sub>HHT</sub> and Tau<sub>PF8503</sub> vs. Tau<sub>HHT</sub>) were well correlated (Pearson R = 0.87 and 0.78, respectively, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s012">S12A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s012">S12B Fig</xref></bold>). In order to compare the PF8503 and HHT effects, we adjusted the <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff for compound-dependent phenotypes with Rho<sub>HHT</sub> &gt; |0.1| to identify a similar number of genes in the HHT CRISPRi screen (496) when compared to the PF8503 screen (452) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s012">S12 Fig</xref></bold>). This allowed us to identify pathways shared between PF8503 and HHT treatments, as well as distinct pathways.</p>

<p>Notably, although only 126 genes were shared between the two screens using the less-stringent cutoff (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>), a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis performed using the STRING database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref019">19</xref>] identified a significant enrichment of the same pathways in the HHT and PF8503 screens, including ribosome biogenesis, the spliceosome and RNA transport (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). Proteins with functions related to mitosis, apoptosis, cell cycle, and response to DNA damage also significantly impacted cell fitness in the presence of either of the compounds (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3 Table</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s016">S4 Table</xref></bold>). For some of the proteins with shared effects on cell fitness, we compared cell growth in the presence of PF8503, HHT, or PF846 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006">Fig 6D</xref></bold>). Similar effects were observed with all 3 compounds suggesting that these proteins may play a more general role in stress response to translational inhibitors. For example, the two main proteins of the NGD pathway (PELO and HBS1L) and of the RQC pathway (NEMF and LNT1) strongly sensitize cells in the presence of either PF8503 or HHT, suggesting that NGD and RQC could be involved in rescuing stalled or paused ribosomes more generally. By contrast, HHT affected pathways associated with the proteasome and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, whereas these did not have a PF8503-dependent phenotype, possibly due to its lower toxicity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3 Table</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s016">S4 Table</xref></bold>). Interestingly, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathways were only enriched in the PF8503 CRISPRi screen (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). Most of these genes have a Rho phenotype close to 0 in the HHT screen.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PF8503 belongs to a new family of compounds able to selectively inhibit the translation of target proteins by the human ribosome. Originally discovered as an orally-available small molecule inhibitor of PCSK9 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref029">29</xref>], this class of compound could eventually serve as as a new paradigm for designing therapeutics for “undruggable” proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref002">2</xref>]. These compounds have the unique ability to bind inside the ribosome exit tunnel, allowing them to interact with the protein nascent chain and selectivally stall translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref012">12</xref>]. However, the molecular basis for the strength of compound-induced stalling is still unknown. Furthermore, it has not been clear how the cell may respond to ribosomes stalled by these compounds. For example, the cell may clear selectively and non-selectively stalled ribosomes using quality control pathways that remain to be determined. Depending on the strength of the stall, quality control mechanisms could rescue or arrest translation on some transcripts more efficiently than others, participating in the selectivity of these compound and impacting cellular fitness during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref030">30</xref>]. Here we used ribosome profiling to map the selectivity landscape of PF8503, allowing comparisons to the related compound PF846 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>], and CRISPRi screens to uncover pathways impacting the toxicity of this class of compound. Taken together, these results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways, and should inform future designs of new molecules of this class.</p>

<title>Selective stalling of translation induced by PF8503</title>
<p>We originally determined the selectivity of compound PF846 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>) using human liver-derived Huh-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>]. Although highly selective, PF846 had some toxic effects in certain cell types and a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>], which would preclude its use for chronic conditions. While optimizing this class of compound, PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>) was shown to have similar potency to PF846 in inhibiting PCSK9 production, as well as a similar cellular toxicity using rat bone marrow as a model for the most sensitive cells to these compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>]. Here, we confirmed that PF8503 and PF846 inhibit PCSK9 production by Huh-7 cells with nearly identical IC50 values (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>), with PF8503 being slightly more toxic when treating human K562 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Although compounds with similar potency to PF8503 and PF846, but with dramatically reduced cellular toxicity, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>], it is still important to understand why compounds like PF8503 and PF846 decrease cell viability at high doses, as these pathways may arise in the development of new compounds in the future.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although PF8503 and PF846 have similar potency inhibiting PCSK9, they induce ribosome stalling on a surprisingly different array of off-target mRNAs, as determined by ribosome profiling. Of the 46 mRNAs subject to PF8503-induced stalling, only 12 overlap with the mRNAs affected by PF846 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). For example, translation of <italic>CNPY4</italic>, <italic>TM4SF4</italic>, and <italic>DHFRL1</italic> mRNAs is potently inhibited by PF8503, but these are unaffected or barely affected by PF846 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3C Fig</xref></bold>). PF846 potently inhibits translation of <italic>FAM13B</italic> and <italic>HSD17B11</italic>, whereas these mRNAs are unaffected by PF8503 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>). Other mRNAs targeted by one of the compounds may also be stalled by the other, but only at much lower levels that do not lead to a statistically significant reduction in translation past the stall site (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3 Table</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s016">S4 Table</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). These results suggest that future efforts to tune the structure of these compounds could lead to selective stalling of new targets beyond PCSK9.</p>

<title>Genetic interactions with PF8503 identified by CRISPRi</title>
<p>To identify genetic interactions with PF8503 toxicity, we used PF8503 to carry out a whole-genome CRISPRi screen in human K562 cells. By comparing the genetic interactions with PF8503 and the more general translation inhibitor HHT, we were able to identify shared pathways that affect cell viability in the presence of these compounds, as well as ones distinct to each compound class. Although it is possible that common pathways that interact genetically with treatment with PF8503 or HHT (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3 Table</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s016">S4 Table</xref></bold>) may reflect a general stress response to translation inhibition, PF8503 does not have an observable effect on global translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g004"><bold>Fig 4A</bold> and <bold>4B</bold></xref>). This suggests that even the low level of stalled translation induced by PF8503 is sufficient to induce a cellular response that can be detected using CRISPRi. Common pathways that decrease overall translation due to, for example, a decrease in ribosome biogenesis may lower the overall burden on cells to monitor translation defects, and enable cells to mount a more robust response to PF8503-stalled ribosomes or HHT treatment. In support of this model, we observe sgRNA enrichment (i.e. protein reduction) for a number of factors in ribosome biogenesis and translation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). An additional explanation for the shared pathways is that HHT, although an inhibitor of late steps of translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref027">27</xref>], generates a low level of stalled translation elongation complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref028">28</xref>] that behave similarly to those generated by PF8503.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, we found that genes involved in tRNA maturation and in particular modification of tRNA nucleotide U<sub>34</sub> at the wobble position affect cell viability only in the presence of PF8503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002"><bold>Fig 2C</bold> and <bold>2D</bold></xref>), not HHT (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s016">S4 Table</xref></bold>). Modifications of U<sub>34</sub> in tRNAs have been shown to increase the rate of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref031">31</xref>]. In the present experiments, knockdown of tRNA U<sub>34</sub> modification enzymes would be predicted to slow down overall translation, providing a protective effect against PF8503-induced stalling similar to that expected from a decrease in ribosome biogenesis. The fact the tRNA synthesis genetically interacts only with PF8503 and not HHT may reflect that fact that PF8503 stalling could be more dependent on the speed of translation, whereas HHT inhibits translation primarily before elongation begins, and would not depend as much on U<sub>34</sub> modified tRNAs. This interpretation is also consistent with the known binding sites of both drugs. Whereas HHT is bound to the ribosomal A site in the 60S subunit and inhibits the first step of elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref027">27</xref>], PF8503 binds inside the ribosome exit tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref012">12</xref>], and likely depends on the speed of translation to stall ribosome nascent chain complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>]. Notably, some forms of cancer are dependent on high levels of the enzymes that modify U<sub>34</sub> in tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref032">32</xref>], suggesting that PF8503-class compounds could be developed in the future to target this type of cancer cell addiction.</p>

<title>Ribosome quality control pathways that interact with PF8503</title>
<p>Interestingly, we found that knocking down NGD proteins PELO and HBS1L, as well as RQC proteins NEMF and LTN1, had a positive impact on cell fitness upon either PF8503 or HHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006"><bold>Fig 6A</bold> and <bold>6D</bold></xref>), suggesting that NGD and RQC are involved in resolving at least some PF8503- or HHT-stalled ribosomes. Notably, whereas the NGD and RQC pathways in yeast have been associated with mRNA turnover, treatment of cells with PF846 has been shown not to lead to decreased levels of PF846-targeted mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref011">11</xref>]. The fact that ribosome quality control-related pathways sensitize cells to PF8503 at first seems surprising, since it implies that rescuing translation in response to PF8503-induced translational stalling has a negative impact on cell fitness. However, an alternative explanation is that PF8503-stalled complexes saturate the NGD or RQC pathways in the context of normal cells, preventing these pathways from carrying out their normal quality control functions. Consistent with this saturation hypothesis, the PF846 class of compounds are relatively more toxic in the hematopoietic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>], which is more dependent on a functional NGD pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments likely miss weak translation stalling events that may occur across the human transcriptome, or those that are robust substrates for ribosome quality control pathways and are therefore not detected in the ribosome profiling analysis. It is notable that some derivatives of the PCSK9-stalling compounds can retain potency without the associated toxicity in rat bone marrow cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref009">9</xref>], suggesting that the NGD- and RQC-dependent cellular responses can be managed for new therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>Role of ASCC2 and ASCC3 in ribosome quality control pathways</title>
<p>Surprisingly, the genes that protect cells the most from the toxic effects of PF8503-dependent stalling encode components ASCC2 and ASCC3 of the transcriptional activating signal cointegrator complex ASC-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref024">24</xref>]. Recent experiments have also identified ASCC2 and ASCC3 as integral to the cellular response to DNA alkylation damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>]. ASCC3 is an RNA helicase and has been shown to be the human ortholog of yeast Slh1 (<italic>SLH1</italic> gene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref034">34</xref>]. ASCC2 harbors a CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation) domain that binds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains as part of the DNA alkylation damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>]. In yeast, there is emerging evidence of a role for Slh1 in RQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref034">34</xref>]. Furthermore, K63 polyubiquitination has been found to be essential for certain stalled ribosome quality control pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref035">35</xref>]. These studies led to the proposal that Slh1 and Cue3, the presumed orthologue of ASCC3 and ASCC2, are components of a new complex called the RQC-trigger complex (RQT), triggered by ribosomal stalling but not necessary for RQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>]. Notably, we do not observe a phenotype for the ubiquitin E3 ligase ZNF598 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s015">S3 Table</xref></bold>), which has been found to ubiquitinate the ribosome in certain contexts of ribosome stalling, i.e. on challenging sequences such as CGA codons and poly(A) stretches in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref034">34</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref030">30</xref>], and in the presence of colliding ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref036">36</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref030">30</xref>]. These observations prompted us to investigate further the function of ASCC2 and ASCC3 in cellular response to PF8503-induced selective stalling.</p>
<p>Although ASCC2 and ASCC3 are primarily known for their roles in the transcription activator complex ASC-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref024">24</xref>] and in DNA alkylation damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>], there is substantial evidence that ASCC2 and ASCC3 also act in the cytoplasm. First, the role of the ASC-1 complex in alkylated DNA damage repair is not phenocopied in the CRISPRi screen in the presence of PF8503. For example, loss of splicing factor BRR2 (<italic>SNRNP200</italic> gene) increases sensitivity to MMS DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>]. PRP8 knockdown (<italic>PRPF8</italic> gene) also decreases ASCC3 foci upon DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>]. In the PF8503 CRISPRi screen, BRR2 knockdown is mildly protective (Rho = 0.13) and knockdown of PRP8 has only a mildly negative effect (Rho = -0.05). Knockdown of RNF113A and UBC13 (<italic>UBE2N</italic> gene) in this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>] also had mildly negative effects (Rho = -0.13 and -0.05, respectively). Finally, knockdown of the key dealkylase connected to ASCC helicase complex, ALKBH3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>], had no effect (Rho = 0.03). Similarly, other proteins involved in alkylated DNA damage repair had no discernable phenotype, which suggests ASCC3 is unlikely linked to alkylation damage in the presence of PF8503 (MGMT, -0.02; ALKBH2, 0.00; ALKBH5, 0.00, source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref037">37</xref>], under “DNA Repair -&gt; DNA Damage Reversal” tab. Second, in addition to the results described above in relation to the yeast RQT system, there is substantial evidence for the cytoplasmic localization of the ASC-1 subunits. In the Human Protein Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref038">38</xref>], ASCC2 and ASCC3 are robustly cytoplasmic as well as nuclear. ASCC1 is less abundant in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, ASCC3 has been identified to be in close proximity to the translational repressor 4EHP (eIF4E2), based on proximity ligation experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>We were able to confirm a role for ASCC2 and ASCC3 in response to PF8503-induced stalling using a combination of CRISPRi knockdowns, cell-based assays and cell fractionation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). We observed decreased cell fitness and increased induction of apoptosis in PF8503-treated cells when either ASCC2 or ASCC3 were knocked down. Although this could be attributed to nuclear signaling events based on the reported functions for the ASC-1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref024">24</xref>], we found all three components of ASC-1 associated with cytoplasmic ribosomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>), consistent with previous results connecting K63 polyubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref035">35</xref>] and ASCC3 to translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>], and suggesting that ASCC1 might be the human counterpart of the third protein of the RQT complex, yKR023W (Rqt4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>]. Additionally, the fact that ASCC2 and ASCC3 co-IP in the cytoplasm (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>) is consistent with a role for ASC-1 in translation, independent of its role in DNA alkylation repair and transcription activation in the nucleus. Also supporting a role for ASC-1 in translation quality control, both ASCC2 and ASCC3 knockdowns negatively affect cell fitness of HHT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g006"><bold>Fig 6A</bold> and <bold>6D</bold></xref>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s012">S12 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We also observe that EIF6 and ZNF622, two proteins known to be involved in late stages of ribosomal 60S subunit assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref040">40</xref>], play a role in PF8503-induced stalling (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s006">S6D Fig</xref></bold>). Knockdown of either factor has a positive effect on cell fitness. Intriguingly, both EIF6 and ZNF622 can be affinity-purified with ASCC2 in a K63-linked polyubiquitin chain-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref023">23</xref>]. These affinity-purification experiments were conducted in the context of defining the DNA alkylation damage response. However, based on their role in PF8503-induced stalling, it is possible that EIF6 and ZNF622 function in translation quality control pathways, acting downstream of ASC-1.</p>
<p>We were surprised not to identify ZNF598, the ubiquitin E3 ligase that ubiquinates ribosomal proteins in a ribosome stalling-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref041">41</xref>], in the CRISPRi screen with either PF8503 or HHT. Its absence could be due to the fact that the CRISPRi screen reveals genetic and not necessarily all biochemical connections. For example, residual ZNF598 levels in the CRISPRi knockdown cells may be sufficient for ribosome quality control in the present experimental conditions. Furthermore, there may be other ubiquitin ligases that serve an overlapping role with ZNF598. Finally, ZNF598 is thought to mark ribosomes after ribosome collisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref041">41</xref>]. In the case of PF8503 and HHT, there may be no or few ribosomal collisions since most stalling events occur very near the N-terminus of the protein, i.e. the 5’ end of the open reading frame. Future experiments will be required to reconstitute the initial ubiquitination events responsible for ribosome quality control observed here.</p>
<p>Importantly, we were able to use double-knockdown cell lines in genetic interaction experiments to identify connections between different translation quality control pathways in human cells. We found that the HBS1L phenotype in the presence of PF8503-induced stalling is dominant over the ASCC3 phenotype (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>), suggesting that HBS1L and ASCC3 function in a common translation quality control pathway, with ASCC3 involved in steps after translation stall recognition. This result implies that the NGD pathway and ASC-1 intersect to resolve at least some stalled ribosome-nascent chain complexes. The model that ASC-1 acts downstream of HBS1L, after the stalling event, is further supported by the fact that that ASCC2 and ASCC3 knockdowns do not impact general translation or the IC50 for PF8503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g004"><bold>Fig 4B</bold> and <bold>4C</bold></xref>). Interestingly, we found all three ASC-1 subunits bound to the 80S ribosome independent of active translation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>), implying that ASC-1 surveillance of translation may be widespread. By contrast to HBS1L and ASCC3, NEMF which is part of the RQC pathway seems to act independently of ASCC3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>), suggesting that PF8503-induced stalling may not be a “classic” RQC substrate like those identified previously, such as poly-lysine stretches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref030">30</xref>]. Alternatively, the RQC pathway components may not be as limiting in the presence of PF8503, precluding our ability to detect a genetic interaction. Interestingly, we find that a double-knockdown of ASCC2 and ASCC3 rescues the negative effect of single knockdowns of ASCC2 or ASCC3 upon PF8503 treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). We suggest that the negative effect of individually knocking down ASCC2 or ASCC3 could result in a partially activated translation quality control pathway that leads to a build-up of stalled ribosomes that cannot be resolved, thereby leading to severe cell stress.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The genetic interactions we observe between components of the NGD and RQT, but not RQC, pathways in the presence of specific translational stalling by PF8503-related compounds (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>) opens new avenues for exploring the mechanisms of translation quality control pathways in humans. Although the exact role of ASC-1 complex on the ribosome is still unclear, the fact that ASCC2 and ASCC3 strongly impact cell fitness in the presence of PF8503 suggest that ASC-1 may play an essential role in either stall recognition, ribosomal degradation or recycling, or stress signaling to the nucleus. Furthermore, it is possible that ribosome assembly factors EIF6 and ZNF622 also play a role in translation quality control pathways (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008057.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>), an idea that can now be explored in depth. Combined with the new insights into changes in selectivity when comparing PF8503 and PF846, these results provide a foundation for the future development of compounds that selectively stall the translation of diverse protein targets involved in human disease.</p>

<title>Model for translation quality control pathway that resolves PF8503-induced stalling.</title>
<p>PELO/HBS1L detection of PF8503-stalled 80S ribosomes activates a translation quality control pathway that includes ASC-1 (ASCC1-3), which recognizes a K63-linked polyubiquitin signal on the ribosome. These steps are also triggered by HHT. After the 60S subunit is released from the stalled 80S ribosome, RQC may clear the stalled peptidyl-tRNA (LTN1/NEMF). In late steps of recycling, PF8503 bound in the exit tunnel may interfere with quality control functions of ZNF622 and EIF6.</p>

<p>Ribosomes and libraries were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref042">42</xref>]. In short, 300 μL of thawed lysate were digested with RNAse I (Invitrogen, AM2294) for 45 min at room temperature, monosomes were collected using a 1 M sucrose cushion and ultracentrifugation (603,000 g, 2 hr, 4°C), and total RNA was purified using miRNAEasy kit (Qiagen, 217004). RNA fragments of 26 to 34 nucleotides (corresponding to ribosome footprints) were size-selected using a denaturing urea gel.

<p>De-multiplexed reads were stripped of 3′ adapters with the FASTX toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html</ext-link>) and aligned to human ribosomal RNA sequences using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref043">43</xref>] to remove ribosomal RNA-mapped reads. A reference transcriptome for Bowtie was built using the UCSC/Gencodev24 known coding Canonical Transcripts of the Grch38 human reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref045">45</xref>]. To avoid ambiguously mapped reads, only the alignments that mapped to one position of the reference transcriptome were selected for further analysis. To map the reads along the transcripts, an mRNA P site-offset was determined depending on the size of the fragment as 14 nt for fragment of 26 nucleotides or less, 15 nt for fragments of 27 to 29 nucleotides, and 16 nt for fragments of 30 nucleotides or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref046">46</xref>]. Codon maps were then generated for the CDS of each transcript. The data was then processed using custom python scripts and R (<bold>Supplemental document 1</bold>) as previously described with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref010">10</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). In short, a DMax value was calculated for each transcript as the maximum difference between cumulative normalized reads in PF8503- or PF846-treated and untreated (DMSO control) samples. For each sample, a Z-score transformation of the DMax values was calculated using the scale function in R and the DMax positions with a Z-score greater than or equal to 2 were considered putative stalled transcripts. A differential expression analysis was then performed in R using DEseq for transcripts that had more than 30 counts mapping to CDS reads located 3’ of the DMax position, or 10 codons after the start codon for transcripts lacking a clear DMax value. Reads 10 codons before the end of the transcript were also omitted. Transcripts showing a log<sub>2</sub> fold change and FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
<p>To generate ribosomal footprint density plots, the number of ribosomal footprints aligning to each codon position was divided by the total number of reads aligning to the protein-coding regions, then multiplied by 100 to yield reads percentage. All read density plots represent average values for 3 biological replicates. For mRNAs affected by treatment with PF846 and/or PF8503, putative pause sites were found using R and defined as the codon position at which the average read density is at least 10 times higher than the median of the positions on the transcript with more than 0 reads. Footprint densities were then analyzed manually to identify the main stall sites.</p>

<title>Whole genome CRISPRi negative screen</title>
<p>The “Top5” and “Supp5” plasmid sub-pools of the whole-genome human CRISPRi sgRNA library hCRISPRi-v2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>] were first pooled to obtain the full 10 sgRNA/gene library and then amplified. Amplification was performed by electroporation into Endura electrocompetent cells (Lucigen, 60242) using the manufacturer’s instructions and amplified in 1 L LB broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The transformation efficiency assured coverage of at least 400X the size of the library. Even coverage of the libraries was confirmed by PCR amplification and deep sequencing.</p>
<p>PF8503 and HHT screens were conducted separately. For each screen, the sgRNA libraries were transduced into K562 cells expressing dCas9-KRAB-BFP as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref015">15</xref>]. In short, lentiviral vectors were produced in HEK293T cells by transfection of the hCRISPRi-v2 plasmid library along with packaging (pCMVdeltaR8.91) and envelope plasmids (pMD2.G) using TransIT-293 Transfection Reagent (Mirius, MIR 2704). Virus-containing media was harvested after 72 hours, supplemented with polybrene (8 μg/mL), and applied to 250x10<sup>6</sup> K562_dCas9-KRAB cells. Cells were spun in 6-well plates (2 hr, 200 g, 33°C) to enhance infection efficiency. Cells were then suspended in fresh culture medium. 60% (for PF8503) or 75% (for HHT) of the cells were infected determined using flow cytometry detection of BFP expression at 2 days post-infection. Cells were then treated with puromycin (0.75 ng/mL, Gibco), for 2 days, at which point the population of BFP-expressing cells reached 80–90% (for both screens). Cells were split into two replicates and the screen was started after one day of recovery in puromycin-free media (T0).</p>
<p>The K562_dCas9-KRAB cells expressing the genome-wide sgRNA library were cultivated in 3 L spinner flasks. For the PF8503 screen, cells were treated 3 times with 7.5 μM PF8503 or vehicle (DMSO), on days 0, 4, and 7. For the HHT screen, cells were treated with 100 nM HHT on day 8. In each screen, the total amount of cells was kept above 250x10<sup>6</sup>, and cell density between 0.25x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL for coverage of at least 1000X the sgRNA library throughout the screen. Cell size, number, and fraction of sgRNA-containing cells were monitored using a Scepter cell counter and by flow cytometry during the screen. Cells were harvested for library sequencing on the initial cell population (T0) and after 11 days (for PF8503 and corresponding vehicle) or 15 days (for HHT and vehicle).</p>
<p>The CRISPRi screen libraries were prepared from the cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref015">15</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from about 300x10<sup>6</sup> harvested cells using Nucleospin XL Blood kit (Machery-Nagel, 740950) and digested overnight at 4°C with SbfI-HF restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, R3642S). Fragments of about 500 bp, corresponding to the sgRNA cassette, were size selected on a large scale 0.8% Agarose gel and purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit (28706X 4). The libraries were then indexed and amplified by 23 cycles semi-quantitative PCR using HF-Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0530S). The libraries were multiplexed and sequenced at the QB3 Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory, UC Berkeley, or the Center for Advanced Technology, UCSF, on an HiSeq4000 Illumina sequencer using custom primers as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref015">15</xref>]. Computational analysis of the CRISPRi screens was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref015">15</xref>], using the pipeline available on github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mhorlbeck/ScreenProcessing" xlink:type="simple">https://github.com/mhorlbeck/ScreenProcessing</ext-link>), with the hCRISPRi-v2 library tables/alignment indices. Briefly, the quantified genomically-integrated sgRNAs were used to calculate the effect of each sgRNA on growth without drug (Gamma; T0 vs vehicle), with drug (Tau; T0 vs drug), and the effect of drug treatment only (Rho; vehicle vs drug). Gene-level scores in each condition were obtained by averaging the top 3 sgRNAs for each gene (as ranked by absolute value) and by Mann-Whitney <italic>p</italic>-value of all 10 sgRNAs/gene compared to non-targeting control sgRNAs.</p>

<title>Lentivirus infection for single and double knockdown cell lines</title>
<p>For each gene candidate to be tested for validation of the CRISPRi results, two sgRNA protospacers giving strong phenotypes in the CRISPRi screen were selected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008057.s017">S5 Table</xref></bold>) and cloned into a pSLQ1371-GFP or -BFP vector using restriction sites BstXI and BlpI as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref017">17</xref>]. Lentiviral vectors were produced in HEK293T cells by transfection of the pSLQ1371-GFP or -BFP sgRNA lentiviral expression vectors along with packaging (pCMVdeltaR8.91) and envelope plasmids (pMD2.G) using TransIT-293 Transfection Reagent (Mirius, MIR 2704). K562_dCas-KRAB cells were then infected with the resulting lentiviruses in 6-well plates, and puromycin selected (1 μg/mL) two days after infection. The MOI was determined by flow cytometry using GFP or BFP fluorescence before puromycin selection. Knockdown of PELO levels was too toxic to obtain stable cell lines. We therefore used HBS1L knock-down cell lines to explore disruption of NGD.</p>
<p>The double knockdown cell lines were obtained in a similar manner, either by carrying out two sequential lentiviral infections with lentiviruses each expressing one sgRNA. Alternatively, we prepare double knock-down cell lines by a single infection of a lentivirus containing two sgRNA expression cassettes. These plasmids were obtained by ligating a synthetic DNA sequence containing the human U6 (hU6) promoter followed by the sgRNA sequence targeting ASCC3 and a different constant region cr2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008057.ref025">25</xref>] downstream of a murine U6 (mU6) promoter and sgRNA expression cassette, in the pSLQ1371-GFP or -BFP vector.</p>
