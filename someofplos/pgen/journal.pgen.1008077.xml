<abstract>
<p>The role of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) phosphorylation in mRNA translation remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a potential role in modulating the translation rate of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (<italic>CXCL8</italic> or Interleukin 8, <italic>IL8</italic>). We observed that more CXCL8 protein was being secreted from less <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA in primary macrophages and macrophage-like HL-60 cells relative to other cell types. This correlated with an increase in <italic>CXCL8</italic> polyribosome association, suggesting an increase in the rate of <italic>CXCL8</italic> translation in macrophages. The cell type-specific expression levels were replicated by a <italic>CXCL8-</italic> UTR-reporter (Nanoluc reporter flanked by the 5’ and 3’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic>). Mutations of the <italic>CXCL8</italic>-UTR-reporter revealed that cell type-specific expression required: 1) a 3’ UTR of at least three hundred bases; and 2) an AU base content that exceeds fifty percent in the first hundred bases of the 3’ UTR immediately after the stop codon, which we dub AU-rich proximal UTR sequences (APS). The 5’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> enhanced expression at the protein level and conferred cell type-specific expression when paired with a 3’ UTR. A search for other APS-positive mRNAs uncovered TNF alpha induced protein 6 (<italic>TNFAIP6</italic>), another mRNA that was translationally upregulated in macrophages. The elevated translation of APS-positive mRNAs in macrophages coincided with elevated rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation. Both were attenuated by the ERK1/2 signaling inhibitors, U0126 and AZD6244. In A549 cells, rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation was induced by TAK1, Akt or PKA signaling. This enhanced the translation of the <italic>CXCL8</italic>-UTR-reporters. Thus, we propose that the induction of rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation enhances the translation of mRNAs that contain APS motifs, such as <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>. This may contribute to the role of macrophages as the primary producer of CXCL8, a cytokine that is essential for immune cell recruitment and activation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is a component of the cell translation system. This system produces proteins based on the instructions found on messenger ribonucleic acids or mRNAs. The activity of rpS6 is modified via the attachment of phosphate groups. This rpS6 “phosphorylation” regulates cell size, cell proliferation, glucose homeostasis and cancer defense. However, the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we propose that rpS6 phosphorylation may affect the rate of translation of certain mRNAs. These mRNAs contain a high frequency of adenine and uracil bases in the first hundred or so bases of their 3’ UTR sequences, which we dub AU-rich proximal UTR sequences (APS). APS-modulated mRNAs include the immune signaling proteins, <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>. This novel mechanism allows macrophages to secrete sufficient CXCL8 protein to attract and activate other immune cells such as neutrophils during injury or disease. It may also be aberrantly upregulated in a subset of tumors, leading to the overexpression of APS-positive genes such as <italic>CXCL8</italic>. Indeed, both rpS6 phosphorylation and <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression are consistently found, by separate studies, to be tumor-promoting and upregulated in cancers. Modulating these APS-positive mRNAs may be a novel strategy to treat diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Translation is an essential step in protein synthesis. Mechanisms that regulate the rate of translation determine the expression levels of a large fraction of the genome. This was revealed by metabolic pulse labeling of global cellular mRNA and protein synthesis rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref001">1</xref>]. Consistently, multiple large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed a lack of correlation between mRNA and protein abundance across different mammalian cell-types and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref003">3</xref>]. Translational control is mRNA-specific and the specificity is sometimes dependent on sequence motifs within the 5’ untranslated region (UTRs), such as 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref004">4</xref>], which lead to selective protein synthesis during increased activity of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). More recent studies have tentatively proposed that cytosine enriched regulator of translation (CERT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref004">4</xref>] and pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref005">5</xref>] may also regulate translation. Besides the 5’ UTR, the involvement of the 3’ UTR in conferring translational control has also been hinted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>While the translational control mediated by eIF4E is well-studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref010">10</xref>], the translational control mediated by phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is still the subject of ongoing investigations. Physiologically, phosphorylation-deficient rpS6 knock-in mice display abnormalities in cell size, cell proliferation, and glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref011">11</xref>]. Aberrant rpS6 phosphorylation has also been implicated in pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref013">13</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these physiological effects remain elusive, as rpS6 phosphorylation does not appear to affect global protein synthesis. More recently, rpS6 phosphorylation-deficient transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref014">14</xref>] were found with impaired translation in a subset of mitochondria-related mRNAs present in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, it appears that rpS6 phosphorylation may alter the translation of a subset of mRNAs, although the exact mechanism and RNA cis-regulatory motifs responsible for the action are unknown.</p>
<p>A possible target for rpS6-mediated translational control is chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 [<italic>CXCL8</italic> or Interleukin 8, <italic>IL8</italic>]. Studies on <italic>CXCL8</italic> have been complicated by the absence of the <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>CXCR1</italic> gene homologs from the muroid lineage due to a deletion event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref016">16</xref>]. The role of CXCL8 in mice appears to have been largely replaced by murine MIP-2 and the murine keratinocyte-derived protein chemokine KC, which activates murine CXCR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref018">18</xref>]. To study CXCL8, researchers have typically relied on clinical observations, <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures of primary human cells and cell line models. Such methods have revealed a critical role for CXCL8 in the chemotactic recruitment, phagocytosis and degranulation of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref019">19</xref>]; and in the recruitment and activation of monocytes and lymphocytes during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref020">20</xref>]. CXCL8 induces these functions by activating cell surface receptors, namely CXCR1 and CXCR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref019">19</xref>]. CXCL8 signaling has also been implicated in a number of diseases including atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref021">21</xref>], asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref022">22</xref>], allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref023">23</xref>] and various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref026">26</xref>]. In light of the importance of CXCL8, elucidating the mechanism of <italic>CXCL8</italic> translational control may prompt more effective treatments that target these pathways to alleviate CXCL8-mediated diseases.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate if <italic>CXCL8</italic> undergoes translational regulation. While the 5’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> does not appear to contain TOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref004">4</xref>], CERT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref005">5</xref>] or PRTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref006">6</xref>] motifs, certain observations hint at a cell type-specific translation rate. For example, macrophages secrete 70-fold more CXCL8 protein relative to neutrophils despite elevated <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA being detected in both cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref028">28</xref>]. This makes macrophages the undisputed primary producer of CXCL8 in the human system. This difference in expression is noteworthy as macrophages and neutrophils are descended from a common myeloid progenitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref029">29</xref>]. These observations suggest that macrophages and neutrophils are prime targets for the study of <italic>CXCL8</italic> translation. To facilitate the acquisition of a large number of cells for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, our initial experiments were performed with the HL-60 promyeloblast cell line. HL-60 is an established model to study myeloid progenitor cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref030">30</xref>]. Similar to primary myeloid progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref029">29</xref>], HL-60 promyeloblasts can be differentiated into either a macrophage-like (HL-60 macrophage /HL-60 Mac) or polymorphonuclear neutrophil-like (HL-60 PMN) phenotype via PMA or DMSO treatment, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref030">30</xref>]. <italic>CXCL8</italic> translation was also studied in KHYG-1, which is an established model of natural killer (NK) cells, and the A549 and NCI-H1299 lung epithelial carcinoma (EC) cells, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref033">33</xref>].

<title>CXCL8 protein secretion and polysome association is increased in HL-60 macrophages</title>
<p>First, we compared the expression levels of CXCL8 between HL-60 macrophage (HL-60 Mac), HL-60 neutrophils (HL-60 PMN), A549 EC and KHYG-1 NK cells. We found that HL-60 Mac cells secreted more CXCL8 protein from less <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA at the basal level and after stimulation with LPS or TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). An increase in secreted CXCL8 protein was also observed from H1299 cells relative to A549 cells despite lower <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA levels in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This increase was not observed for IL6 protein secretion, which mirrored <italic>IL6</italic> mRNA levels and was reduced in H1299 cells relative to A549 cells. We also observed an increase in the percentage of <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNAs associated with the larger polysomes (towards the right of the graph) in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 EC and KHYG-1 NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The same increase was not observed for the control mRNAs, <italic>RPL27</italic> and <italic>ACTB</italic>. Since a polysome (or polyribosome) is formed when an mRNA molecule complexes with two or more ribosomes during the translation process, the increased polysome association of <italic>CXCL8</italic> in Hl-60 Mac may be due to an increased rate of translation. Altogether, these observations suggest that the rate of <italic>CXCL8</italic> translation is cell type-specific, leading to elevated CXCL8 protein secretion in macrophages.</p>

<title>The elevated <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression in HL-60 macrophages required the untranslated regions (UTRs)</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the increased <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression observed in HL-60 Mac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) may involve the 5’ and 3’ UTR sequences.

<p>We then determined the effect of the UTRs on <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression by calculating the fold change of <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA and CXCL8 protein in <italic>CXCL8</italic>-full transfected cells relative to <italic>CXCL8</italic>-CDS. The 3’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> reportedly contains adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs) which accelerated mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref036">36</xref>]. These AREs are present in <italic>CXCL8</italic>-full but absent from the UTR-deficient <italic>CXCL8</italic>-CDS construct. This may explain why <italic>CXCL8</italic>-full transfections displayed <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA that were 4- to 16-fold lower than <italic>CXCL8</italic>-CDS in all the cell types tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For A549 EC and KHYG-1 NK cells, this coincided with 8- to 16-fold reductions in CXCL8 protein. For HL-60 Mac by contrast, a 4-fold increase in CXCL8 protein levels was observed. This suggests that more CXCL8 protein was being produced and secreted from less <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 and KHYG-1 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that the elevated <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">Fig 1</xref>) is reproduced by vector-derived <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA and requires the UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>The 3’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> conferred cell type-specific expression</title>
<p>To determine if the <italic>CXCL8</italic> UTR sequences alone were sufficient to confer enhanced expression in HL-60 Mac, we generated Nluc reporters with UTR fusions (UTR-Nluc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The Nluc reporter allowed us to study a much wider range of hard-to-transfect cells including primary macrophages, NK cells and HL-60 PMNs, since even low levels of vector-derived Nluc can be accurately quantified due to a lack of endogenous Nluc expression. The effect of the fused UTRs on Nluc expression in different cell types was calculated as the fold change of UTR-Nluc relative to Cntrl-Nluc (Nluc reporter with no UTR fusions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ (Nluc reporter with CXCL8 5’ and 3’ UTR sequences) expression was compared between HL-60 Mac, HL-60 PMNs, A549 ECs, KHYG-1 NK and H1299 ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein levels were elevated in HL-60 Mac and H1299 ECs. This was not due to differences in expression at the mRNA level, which remained largely unchanged among all cell types. This is consistent with an elevated rate of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ translation in HL-60 Mac and H1299 EC cells. The cell type-specific expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ was not noticeably altered by LPS or TNF treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) or by halving the amount of UTR- and Cntrl-Nluc plasmid transfected and replacing the other half with empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). We also deleted the Nluc secretory signal from <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ and Cntrl-Nluc, resulting in cytoplasmic expression of Nluc. <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’(-Sec) protein levels remained elevated in HL-60 mac relative to A549 ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). This suggests that the cell type-specific differences were not due to differences in protein secretion. Overall, these findings suggest that the <italic>CXCL8</italic> UTR sequences contribute to its elevated expression in HL-60 Mac and H1299 cells.</p>
<p>The cell type-specific Nluc protein fold changes observed for <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ was also distinct from that observed for <italic>TNF</italic>-5’+3’, <italic>IL6</italic>-5’+3’ and <italic>TIMP1</italic>-5’+3’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Relative to Cntrl-Nluc, both <italic>TNF</italic>-5’+3’ and <italic>IL6</italic>-5’+3’ reduced Nluc protein expression across all cell lines. This is consistent with previous reports that the 3’ UTR sequences of <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> contain AREs that reduce expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref038">38</xref>]. By contrast, the protein and mRNA levels of <italic>TIMP1</italic>-5’+3’ were not substantially different from Cntrl-Nluc, since the <italic>TIMP1</italic> UTRs are not known to contain any AREs or other functional sequences. Altogether, these results suggest that the <italic>CXCL8</italic> UTRs mediate a cell type-specific expression pattern, at the protein level, that is not observed for <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>TIMP-1</italic>.</p>
<p>The UTR-Nluc reporter constructs tested thus far contained both the 5’ and 3’ UTRs. We also tested constructs containing either the 5’ or 3’ UTR alone (<italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’ and <italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’) to determine their individual contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). The Nluc protein and mRNA fold changes of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’ largely followed the pattern observed for <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’. This suggests that the cell type-specific expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> is largely mediated by its 3’ UTR.</p>

<title>A conserved motif within the 5’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> enhanced protein expression</title>
<p><italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’ protein levels were increased relative to Cntrl-Nluc in all cell lines (positive log<sub>2</sub> fold change values) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

Indeed, the enhanced expression was retained when the 5’ UTR was shortened into a 75-bp fragment [CXCL8-5’(79–153)] containing the conserved 37-bp motif; and was abolished upon further shortening to the CXCL8-5’(96–125) and CXCL8-5’(121–153) fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The <italic>CXCL8</italic> 5’ UTR fragment also successfully enhanced mCherry [<italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’-mCherry] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and firefly luciferase (pNFAT-5’-Fluc) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), confirming that the enhanced expression was applicable to other genes and was not specific to Nluc. The expression enhancement also occurred when driven by the NFAT promoter (i.e. in pNFAT-5’-Fluc”), which is a weaker promoter relative to the constitutive CMV promoter used for <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’(79–153) and <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’-mCherry.

<title>The deletion or insertion the APS modified cell type-specific expression</title>
<p>To investigate the role of the APS, we inserted short sequences into the 3’ UTR to disrupt or introduce the APS-motif. Performing insertions instead of substitutions ensured that the full 3’ UTRs sequences were retained. This ensured that any differences in expression observed were not due to deletions of functional motifs within the 3’ UTR sequences. The presence of the APS was determined by calculating the AU-content of the first 100 bp of the mutated 3’ UTR. We then determined if the protein levels of the mutant UTR reporter was elevated in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 ECs, which is indicative of the cell type-specific expression of CXCL8. The insertion of 8 bases immediately upstream of the 3’ UTR sequence of the <italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’ reporter, did not disrupt the APS and cell type-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Only the insertion of a longer sequence, namely the first 91 bp of <italic>TNF</italic> 3’ UTR, resulted in an APS-deficient <italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’::<italic>TNF</italic>-3’(1–91) reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This coincided with the disruption of cell type-specific expression as a much smaller difference in <italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’::<italic>TNF</italic>-3’(1–91) reporter protein levels was observed between HL-60 Mac and A549 ECs. As a control, the first 91 bp of the TNF 3’ UTR was also inserted in between positions 285 and 286 of the 3’ UTR of “CXCL8 3’” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The resulting “CXCL8 Δ3’-dis” mutant remained APS-positive and displayed elevated protein levels in HL-60 Mac. Inversely, we also inserted the first 100 bp of the <italic>CXCL8</italic> 3’ UTR sequence immediately before the <italic>TNF</italic> 3’ UTR of the APS-deficient <italic>TNF</italic>-3’ reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This generated an APS-positive mutant, <italic>TNF</italic>-3’::<italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’(1–100) which displayed elevated protein levels in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 ECs. Altogether, these data are consistent with the APS-motif conferring cell type-specific expression.</p>

<title>The <italic>CXCL8</italic> 5’ UTR conferred cell type-specific expression when paired with a 3’ UTR</title>
<p>We had deduced that the cell type-specific expression of CXCL8 was largely mediated by its 3’ UTR. This was based on the observation that the cell type-specific Nluc protein and mRNA fold changes of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ was largely replicated by <italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’ but not <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Indeed, the ability of the <italic>CXCL8</italic> 3’ UTR to mediate enhanced expression in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 ECs occurred even in the presence of the <italic>TNF</italic> 5’ UTR sequence, as was observed for the <italic>TNF</italic>-5’+<italic>CXCL8</italic>-3’ reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, our subsequent assays revealed that the 5’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> may not be entirely benign. We observed that the protein levels of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’::<italic>TNF</italic>-3’(1–91) and <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+<italic>TNF</italic>-3’ were elevated in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 EC, despite being APS-deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This may have been mediated by the presence of the 5’ UTR of CXCL8. The lack of this cell type-specific expression in the <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’ reporter may have been due to the absence of a 3’ UTR sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

<title>The polysome association of <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>, a putative APS-positive mRNA, was elevated in HL-60 macrophages</title>
<p>With the elucidation of the novel APS-motif, we then investigated if the presence of APS could be used to predict elevated translation in macrophages. An analysis of proximal AU content in the 3’ UTR of common cytokine signaling genes revealed that the <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>IL2</italic> genes possess high AU-contents in the first hundred or so bases of their 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), which is indicative of the presence of APS. Amongst these genes, only the <italic>TNFAIP6</italic> mRNA was expressed at a detectable level in HL-60 Mac. In agreement with our prediction, the polysome association of <italic>TNFAIP6</italic> was elevated in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 EC and KHYG-1 NK cells.

<p>Next, we elucidated the signaling pathways involved in the elevated expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ reporter protein in HL-60 Mac relative to HL-60 PMN, A549 EC and KHYG-1 NK. This cell type-specific expression remained largely unaffected by treatment with the inhibitors of mTOR (Torin-1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1C Fig</xref>), p38 (SB203580) and JNK (SP600125) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1D Fig</xref>).

<title>The phosphorylation of rpS6 S235/236 was elevated in HL-60 macrophages and attenuated by ERK1/2 signaling inhibitors</title>
<p>To identify the ERK1/2 target proteins involved, we examined known downstream targets of ERK1/2 such as rpS6, 4E-BP1 and eIF4E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Since the protein activities were modulated by their phosphorylation states, the ratios of phosphorylated protein over total protein expression (i.e.: [rpS6 S235/236+phos] / [rpS6]) between different cell types were compared. Amongst the ERK1/2 target proteins, the phosphorylation ratio of rpS6 (at S235/236 and S240/244) was elevated in HL-60 Mac relative to HL-60 PMN, A549 EC, KHYG-1 NK and H1299 EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Next, we determined if these proteins were affected by the inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling (via U0126 and AZD6244) or mTOR signaling (via Torin-1). Previous studies have found that ERK1/2 signaling induces the phosphorylation of rpS6 at S235/236 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref042">42</xref>] while Akt-mTOR signaling induces the phosphorylation of rpS6 at S235/236 and S240/244 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref043">43</xref>]. Here, the inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling via U0126 or AZD6244 treatment led to 8- to 16-fold reductions in rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation. The inhibition of mTOR signaling inhibition via Torin-1 treatment led to a much smaller 2- to 4-fold reduction. The smaller effect of Torin-1 on rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation was unlikely to be due to a lack of Torin-1 activity since the inhibitor almost completely abolished the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at T37/46, an effect that was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref044">44</xref>]. The phosphorylation at S240/244 on the other hand, was equally sensitive to U0126, AZD6244 and Torin-1 treatment, with a 4-fold reduction across all inhibitors. From these observations, we made three inferences. First, rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation in HL-60 Mac was predominantly mediated by ERK1/2 signaling. Second, ERK1/2 signaling inhibition may attenuate the expression of APS-positive mRNAs by blocking the phosphorylation of rpS6 at S235/236. Third, ERK1/2 signaling inhibition did not act via the blocking of rpS6 S240/244 phosphorylation since mTOR signaling inhibition also blocked rpS6 S240/244 phosphorylation to a similar degree but did not attenuate <italic>CXCL8</italic>+5’+3’ expression.</p>

<title>Increasing the availability of eIF4E did not enhance APS-modulated expression</title>
<p>Unlike rpS6, the expression and phosphorylation of eIF4E was not affected by treatment with U0126, AZD6244 or Torin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). This suggests that ERK1/2 inhibitors do not act via eIF4E to attenuate the cell type-specific expression observed. Since the availability of eIF4E to form the translation initiation complex has also been found to modulate the rate of mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref010">10</xref>], further investigations were performed to either confirm or rule out its role. We expressed the 4E-BP1-4A mutant–a phosphorylation deficient mutant of 4E-BP1 which constitutively binds to and inhibits eIF4E activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref004">4</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1E Fig</xref>). At first glance, this appeared to have reduced <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein synthesis in HL-60 Mac. However upon closer inspection, it was revealed that multiple proteins (including rpS6 S235/236+phos, rpS6 240/244+phos, total rpS6, eIF4E and μ-tubulin) were up-regulated in HL-60 Mac upon 4E-BP1-4A expression. This made it difficult to narrow down the cause of the reduced <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein levels. To investigate further, we expressed exogenous eIF4E to alleviate any potential shortage of eIF4E in A549 ECs. However, this did not enhance <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1F Fig</xref>). This suggests that eIF4E shortage was not a factor at play, which is consistent with our findings on Torin-1 treatment. Treatment with Torin-1 almost completely abolished the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at T37/46 in HL-60 Mac cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) but did not inhibit the expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Since the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at T37/46 is required for the subsequent “hyper” phosphorylation at S65/T70 which inhibits 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref045">45</xref>], this suggests that eIF4E availability was not being reduced by interaction with unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, our assays suggest that increasing the availability of eIF4E did not enhance APS-modulated expression.</p>

<title>The induction of rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation enhanced the expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> UTR reporters</title>
<p>To further investigate the role of rpS6, we activated pathways leading to the induction of rpS6 phosphorylation in A549 ECs. There are three known rpS6 kinases that directly phosphorylate rpS6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref011">11</xref>]. The first is p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk) which is activated by ERK1/2 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref042">42</xref>]. We activated this pathway, as indicated by increased ERK1/2 T202/204 phosphorylation, through the co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref047">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The second is p70 S6 protein kinase (S6K1) which is activated by Akt-mTOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref011">11</xref>]. We activated of this pathway, as indicated by increased Akt S473 phosphorylation, through the expression of myristoylated Akt or myrAkt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Finally, the third known rpS6 kinase is protein kinase A (PKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref048">48</xref>]. We activated this pathway through the expression of constitutively active PKA (caPKA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In A549 EC cells, all three rpS6 kinase pathways induced rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation and increased <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). The TAK1-ERK1/2 pathway produced a greater degree of rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation and this coincided with increased <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ expression relative to the myrAkt-mTOR pathway. This is consistent with our observations in HL-60 Mac where rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation was found to be predominantly mediated by ERK1/2 signaling and not Akt-mTOR signaling (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">7</xref>). By contrast, <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein synthesis was not increased when rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation was not induced, such as during the expression of constitutively active MKK7-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This is consistent with our earlier findings where the inhibition of JNK activity (via SP600125) did not attenuate <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ expression in HL-60 Mac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

Like their HL-60 Mac and KHYG-1 NK cell line counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), CXCL8-5’+3’ protein synthesis was elevated in primary macrophages relative to NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). This suggests that the UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> confers elevated translation in primary macrophages relative to NK cells. Additionally, the ratio of phosphorylated rpS6 over total rpS6 was also increased in primary macrophages relative to NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). The elevated rpS6 phosphorylation was attenuated by ERK1/2 inhibitor (AZD6244) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). These results matched their cell line counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Finally, primary macrophages treated with the ERK1/2 signaling inhibitors (U0126 and AZD6244) displayed attenuated expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> at the protein level but not at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">Fig 9F</xref>). The same inhibitors did not attenuate <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression in primary neutrophils. Taken together, these findings suggest that ERK1/2 signaling induces the phosphorylation of rpS6 in primary macrophages, leading to the elevated expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic> in these cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hitherto, the role of rpS6 phosphorylation has remained unclear as it did not appear to affect global mRNA translation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref015">15</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that the induction of rpS6 phosphorylation (at S235/236) selectively enhances the translation of certain mRNA transcripts that contain novel AU-rich proximal cis-regulatory UTR sequences (APS) [Summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g010">Fig 10</xref>]. In primary macrophages, ERK1/2 signaling induces the phosphorylation of rpS6 leading to the elevated translation of <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>. The location of the APS-motif, on the 3’ UTR, is distinct from known motifs found exclusively in the 5’ UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<title>A schematic summary of findings.</title>
<p>Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is directly phosphorylated by the kinases Rsk, S6K1 and PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref011">11</xref>]. Rsk and S6K1 are activated by ERK1/2 and Akt-mTOR signaling respectively. These signaling pathways induce of rpS6 phosphorylation at S235/236 and enhance the translation of CXCL8 mRNA. The enhancement requires: 1) a 3’ UTR that is at least 300 bases; and 2) an AU base content exceeding fifty percent in the first hundred or so bases of the 3’ UTR immediately after the coding sequence, which we refer to as AU-rich proximal RNA cis-regulatory sequences (APS). This translational control mechanism contributes to the elevated CXCL8 protein expression in macrophages. On its own, the 5’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> is a potent translation enhancer.</p>

<p>Like previous work on <italic>CXCL8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref026">26</xref>], our studies were conducted on primary human cells and cell line models. Studies on <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression could not use the mouse model since the homolog of <italic>CXCL8</italic> is deleted in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref016">16</xref>]. This also meant that we could not use phospho-deficient rpS6 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref014">14</xref>], although it would have been a powerful tool to investigate the role of rpS6 phosphorylation. To study the effect of rpS6 phosphorylation, we inhibited multiple pathways upstream of rpS6 phosphorylation. The mTOR inhibitor (Torin-1) only partially attenuated rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) and did not reduce the translation of APS-positive <italic>CXCL8-5’+3’</italic> in HL-60 macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). By contrast, when rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation was more completely attenuated by the ERK1/2 signaling inhibitors (AZD6244 and U0126) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">9E</xref>); the translation of APS-positive <italic>CXCL8-5’+3’</italic>, <italic>CXCL8-3’</italic>, <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic> reporters in macrophages was reduced (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">9F</xref>). The effect of ERK1/2 signaling inhibition was cross-validated by two different inhibitors since both inhibitors are unlikely to share the same off-target effects, such as the activation of AMPK by U0126 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref050">50</xref>]. All three inhibitors–Torin1, U0126 and AZD6244–also reduced rpS6 S240/244 phosphorylation to a similar degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). This suggests that the U0126 and AZD6244 treatments did not act via the inhibition of rpS6 S240/244 phosphorylation to attenuate <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ expression in HL-60 Mac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). If that were the case, the Torin-1 treatment should have been just as potent in attenuating reporter expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008077.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). From these findings, we deduced that the elevated rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation observed in HL-60 Mac was predominantly mediated by ERK1/2 signaling and that ERK1/2 inhibitors may attenuate the expression of APS-positive mRNAs by blocking this pathway.</p>
<p>In addition to kinase inhibitors, the expression of exogenous wildtype and mutant proteins was also employed to study the role of rpS6 phosphorylation. The expression of constitutively active TAK1, Akt or PKA led to increased expression of the APS-positive reporter, <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’. This was likely due to the increased rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, rpS6 is the only known common downstream target of the TAK1, Akt and PKA pathways. TAK1 signaling activates Rsk while Akt signaling activates S6K1. PKA, Rsk and S6K1 are the three currently known rpS6 kinases that directly phosphorylate rpS6 at S235/236 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref011">11</xref>]. Even though PKA is not known to phosphorylate rpS6 at S240/244, a small increase was observed in the caPKA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The increase was however, still at least 5-fold lower than that observed for 235/236. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the induction of rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation enhances the translation of APS-positive mRNAs.</p>
<p>Multiple mechanisms may contribute to the elevated level of CXCL8 protein secreted from macrophages. The 3’ UTR sequences have also been found to modulate the rate of mRNA transcription, mRNA stability and pre-recruitment of the signal recognition particle to the ribosome for secreted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref053">53</xref>]. Alterations in the rate of secretion could also occur as a result of changes in the activity of the eIF4E kinase, MNK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref054">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, the rate of secretion is unlikely to be involved in the elevated cytoplasmic expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’(-Sec) protein observed in HL-60 Mac relative to A549 EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Another possible mechanism may involve the ARE-motifs on the 3’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> which reportedly accelerate mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref036">36</xref>]. This may explain the reduced expression levels of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-full mRNA relative to <italic>CXCL8</italic>-CDS mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). However, the elevated expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ in macrophages was retained even after the deletion of these ARE motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), which suggests that these ARE motifs were not responsible for the cell type-specific expression. Additionally, increased transcription or mRNA stability would lead to increased mRNA levels which, in this case, did not account for the level of secreted CXCL8 protein observed in macrophages that was elevated relative to <italic>CXCL8</italic> mRNA levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">9A</xref>). Thus, the elevated <italic>CXCL8</italic> protein secretion in macrophages is most simply explained by an increase in the rate of <italic>CXCL8</italic> translation, which was corroborated by the polysome profiles of <italic>CXCL8</italic> in macrophages (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">9B</xref>).</p>
<p>Further studies are required to fully elucidate this novel mechanism of translational regulation. While it is clear that the mechanism involves: 1) a 3’ UTR that is at least a few hundred bases; and 2) an APS element; there may be other subtle requirements that await further discovery. The sequence feature in the <italic>CXCL8</italic> 5’ UTR that is responsible for its ability to enhance translation in macrophages when paired with a 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) also warrants further investigation. The 3’ UTR of CXCL8 in particular, is also known to be recognized by miRNA-93, leading to the downregulation of CXCL8 mRNA and protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref055">55</xref>]. However, since various deletion mutants of the CXCL8 3’ UTR retained the same pattern of elevated expression in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), it is highly unlikely that the same level of miRNA activity was exerted across all these deletion mutations. Additionally, it is likely that other pathways besides rpS6 phosphorylation are involved in the regulation of APS-positive mRNA expression. Certain observations point to this. For example, while the inhibition of ERK1/2 (via U0126) attenuated rpS6 S235/236 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), it did not reduce <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ protein levels in HL-60 Mac to the levels observed in KHYG-1 NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>The APS-motif was elucidated in mutation assays with heterologous vector-derived CXCL8 and UTR-Nluc reporter transcripts. Vector-derived transcripts are widely employed to evaluate UTR activity and have so far been consistent with native mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref051">51</xref>]. For example, both the endogenous mRNAs and vector-derived reporters that contain 5’ UTR CERT domains display selective translational repression in eIF4E haplo-insufficient mouse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref005">5</xref>]. In another study, the deletion of the 3’ UTRs of endogenous <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>CXCL6</italic> and <italic>CXCL8</italic>; led to increased mRNA stability which confirmed earlier findings based on heterologous reporter assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref051">51</xref>]. The deletion also led to an unexpected reduction in mRNA transcription leading to a decrease in mRNA levels despite increased mRNA stability. Thus, while the deletion of endogenous UTR sequences may lead to unintended effects on transcription, vector-derived transcripts have consistently replicated native UTR activity. Indeed, for this study, we found that the cell type-specific translation rate of endogenous CXCL8 matched that of vector-derived <italic>CXCL8</italic>-full mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and <italic>CXCL8</italic>-5’+3’ UTR-Nluc reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g002">Fig 2D</xref>)</p>
<p>Future research to establish the significance of APS in regulating gene expression and its evolutionary conservation is warranted. In addition to <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>, other APS-positive mRNAs may exist. An analysis of the proximal AU content in the 3’ UTR of common cytokine signaling genes revealed the presence of potential APS in the mRNAs of <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic> and <italic>IL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) but only the <italic>TNFAIP6</italic> mRNA was expressed at sufficiently high levels for polysome profilling (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g005">5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g006">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">9B</xref>). APS-positive mRNAs may form a highly selective subset of genes as the distribution of 3’ UTR AU content in human genes appears to be skewed towards a low AU content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref056">56</xref>]. The identification and characterization of genes that contain APS motifs may be an important area for future studies as this novel mechanism of translational control may regulate other genes that impact disease processes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose that rpS6 phosphorylation at S235/236 selectively enhances the translation of mRNAs that contain APS, a potentially novel RNA <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element. These mRNAs possess: 1) a 3’ UTR of at least three hundred bases; and 2) an AU base content that exceeds fifty percent in the first hundred or so bases of the 3’ UTR immediately after the stop codon. In primary macrophages, the ERK1/2 pathway induces the phosphorylation of rpS6 leading to the elevated expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP6</italic>. This novel translational control mechanism allows macrophages to act as the primary producer of CXCL8 protein despite expressing less CXCL8 mRNA than cells such as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008077.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Through the secretion of CXCL8, macrophages recruit and activate other immune cells such as neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref019">19</xref>], monocytes and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref020">20</xref>] to respond to infection, disease or injury. APS-modulated translation may also be aberrantly upregulated in a subset of tumour cells, leading to the overexpression of pro-oncogenic genes such as CXCL8. Modulating the rate of APS-positive mRNA translation, such as CXCL8, may be a novel strategy to treat diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref057">57</xref>].On its own, the 5’ UTR of <italic>CXCL8</italic> is a potent translation enhancer. The truncated 5’ UTR sequence (75 bp) could potentially be used to enhance the expression of therapeutic proteins.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis</title>
<p>Real-time PCR was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref061">61</xref>]. RNA was extracted in the presence of 4 μg glycogen (Ambion) using two rounds of Trizol Reagent (Ambion) to obtain a DNA-free sample. Purified RNAs were stored at -80 <sup>o</sup>C for less than a week before reverse transcription. RNA (0.5 μg via nanodrop) was primed with random hexamers and reverse transcribed with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was stored in TE buffer at -20 <sup>o</sup>C. The cDNA was analyzed by real-time qPCR using the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and a LightCycler 480 (Roche). qPCR experiments including primer design and efficiency tests was carried out according to the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008077.ref062">62</xref>].

<p>Total cell lysates were resolved on a denaturing SDS PAGE gel (12%) and transferred onto PVDF membranes via the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Biorad). These were then probed with antibodies (all from Cell Signaling) against rpS6 S235/236+phos (#4858), rpS6 S240/244+phos (#5364), total rpS6 (#2217), 4E-BP1 T37/46+phos (#2855), total 4E-BP1 (#9644), eIF4E S209+phos (#9741), total eIF4E (#2067), JUN S73+phos (#3270), total JUN (#9165), ERK1/2 T202/204+phos (#4370), total ERK1/2 (#4695), Akt S473+phos (#4060), total Akt (#9272), and β-Tubulin (#2067). These primary antibodies were then probed with the respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Western blot chemiluminescent signals were captured with an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare). Using ImageQuant TL 7.0 (GE Healthcare), the band signal intensities of each sample were background subtracted (minimum profile) and normalized to control samples for the inhibitor treatments or the highest intensity cell sample between different cell types.</p>
