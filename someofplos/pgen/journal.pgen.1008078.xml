<abstract>
<p>Phenotypic resistance describes a bacterial population that becomes transiently resistant to an antibiotic without requiring a genetic change. We here investigated the role of the small regulatory RNA (sRNA) RyhB, a key contributor to iron homeostasis, in the phenotypic resistance of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to various classes of antibiotics. We found that RyhB induces phenotypic resistance to gentamicin, an aminoglycoside that targets the ribosome, when iron is scarce. RyhB induced resistance is due to the inhibition of respiratory complexes Nuo and Sdh activities. These complexes, which contain numerous Fe-S clusters, are crucial for generating a proton motive force (pmf) that allows gentamicin uptake. RyhB regulates negatively the expression of <italic>nuo</italic> and <italic>sdh</italic>, presumably by binding to their mRNAs and, as a consequence, inhibiting their translation. We further show that Isc Fe-S biogenesis machinery is essential for the maturation of Nuo. As RyhB also limits levels of the Isc machinery, we propose that RyhB may also indirectly impact the maturation of Nuo and Sdh. Notably, our study shows that respiratory complexes activity levels are predictive of the bacterial sensitivity to gentamicin. Altogether, these results unveil a new role for RyhB in the adaptation to antibiotic stress, an unprecedented consequence of its role in iron starvation stress response.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms at work behind bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a major health issue in the face of the antibiotics crisis. Here, we show that RyhB, a bacterial small regulatory RNA, decreases the sensitivity of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to the antibiotic gentamicin when iron is scarce, an environmental situation prevalent during host-pathogen interactions. This phenotypic resistance is related to the activity of the respiratory complexes Nuo and Sdh, which are producing the proton motive force allowing antibiotic uptake. Altogether, this study points out to a major role for RyhB in escaping antibacterial action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The emergence and spread of bacterial multi-resistance to antibiotics has become a major health issue in the last decades, urging for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules and for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms at work behind bacterial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref002">2</xref>]. While acquired resistance mechanisms (acquisition of genes or mutations that confer resistance) have long been the main focus of attention, less is known about “phenotypic” resistance, which is the process in which a bacterial population becomes transiently resistant to an antibiotic without requiring a genetic change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref005">5</xref>]. For instance, this kind of resistance has been associated with specific processes such as stationary growth phase, persistence and metabolic changes, reinforcing the idea that the environment encountered by the pathogen is a key determinant for antibiotic susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Change in utilization of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis machineries in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> gives a striking example of phenotypic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>]. Fe-S clusters are ubiquitous and ancient cofactors used in a plethora of biological processes, such as metabolism and respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref009">9</xref>]. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, Fe–S clusters are formed and brought to target proteins thanks to two dedicated biogenesis systems: the so called “housekeeping” Isc machinery, which homologs are found in mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms, and the stress-responsive Suf system, in which homologs are found in chloroplasts of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref011">11</xref>]. These systems are responsible for the maturation of more than 150 Fe-S cluster containing proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, notably numerous proteins contained in the main respiratory complexes I (Nuo) and II (Sdh) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref014">14</xref>]. Strikingly, it was shown that impairment of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Isc machinery enhances resistance to aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics that target the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>]. This resistance is due to a deficiency in the maturation of the respiratory complexes in <italic>isc</italic> mutants, which in turn leads to a decrease in the proton motive force (pmf) that is essential for aminoglycosides uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref015">15</xref>]. Consistently, the Suf machinery was shown to maturate inefficiently the Fe-S cluster containing proteins of the respiratory complexes, although the molecular reason for this still remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>]. Overall this study predicted that an environmental signal that induces the switch from Isc to Suf should induce a transient resistance to aminoglycosides.</p>
<p>Iron starvation is one such signal as it decreases the expression of the <italic>isc</italic> operon and enhances that of the <italic>suf</italic> operon. The small RNA RyhB was proposed to participate to this transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref016">16</xref>]. RyhB is one of the most studied sRNAs to date in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref019">19</xref>]. RyhB is regulated by Fur, the main regulator of Fe-homeostasis in many bacteria and is expressed during iron starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref021">21</xref>]. When iron becomes limiting in the medium, RyhB base-pairs and represses the translation of more than 100 mRNA targets that encode non-essential iron-utilizing proteins, thus engaging an “iron sparing” response and redirecting iron consumption in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref019">19</xref>]. Notably, RyhB was shown to base-pair to the <italic>iscRSUA</italic> mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref016">16</xref>]. RyhB induces the degradation of the 3’ part of the mRNA that contains <italic>iscSUA</italic>, in this way limiting Isc levels, while the 5’ part that encodes <italic>iscR</italic> remains stable. While RyhB repression of <italic>isc</italic> expression is rather modest, it may play a more important role by indirectly contributing to the Isc to Suf transition. Indeed, IscR is the major regulator of Fe-S clusters homeostasis and is itself a Fe-S cluster protein maturated by Isc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref022">22</xref>]. Likewise inhibition of Isc functioning is predicted to yield to accumulation of IscR in its apo-form, which actually acts as an activator of the <italic>suf</italic> operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref023">23</xref>]. Note that the <italic>suf</italic> operon is also under Fur repression, which is alleviated under iron limitation.</p>
<p>Iron homeostasis has been shown to modify the sensitivity of bacteria to a number of antibiotics, although the molecular basis behind this is not always clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref024">24</xref>]. Here we asked if the sRNA RyhB could participate in phenotypic resistance to various antibiotics during iron starvation. We found that RyhB is necessary to induce gentamicin phenotypic resistance in low iron conditions. By further investigating the mechanism by which RyhB controls this phenotypic resistance, we show that RyhB controls entry of aminoglycosides in the cell by inhibiting the activity of the two pmf-producing respiratory complexes Nuo and Sdh.</p>

<title>RyhB is involved in sensitivity to the aminoglycoside gentamicin</title>
<p>We first investigated whether RyhB has any role in resistance against different classes of antibiotics during iron starvation. To mimic iron starvation, we treated the medium with 250 μM of dipyridyl (DIP), a strong iron chelator. We chose this concentration of DIP because it is known to induce RyhB synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref026">26</xref>]. Growth of both the WT and <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant strains were slightly affected by depleting iron from the medium, but importantly, doubling time of the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant was identical to that of the WT strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This observation precludes any difference in antibiotic sensitivity between strains to be attributed to difference in growth properties. We then performed antibiotic killing assays by growing wild type (WT) and <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant cells in LB medium added or not with DIP. Antibiotics were added when cells reached early exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2) and the number of survivors was determined by counting the number of colony forming units (c.f.u) after 3 hours of incubation. Four different major classes of antibiotics were tested: aminoglycosides (gentamicin), β-lactams (ampicillin), fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin), and tetracycline.</p>
<p>Iron chelation did not protect cells against tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In contrast, adding DIP to the medium protected the WT and <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant strains against toxicity of ampicillin, norfloxacin and gentamicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The protective effect of iron deprivation for these antibiotics has already been observed and its underlying cause has been greatly debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref028">28</xref>]. As cells were protected independently of <italic>ryhB</italic>, we did not pursue these antibiotics further. In contrast, WT cells were protected against gentamicin when DIP was added to the medium, but this protection effect was lost when cells were mutated for <italic>ryhB</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This result thus suggested that RyhB is involved in the protection of bacterial cells against aminoglycosides during iron starvation.</p>

<p>Next, we performed gentamicin kinetic killing assays by counting the number of WT or <italic>ryhB</italic> survivors at different time intervals after adding gentamicin. In this experiment, both the WT and <italic>ΔryhB</italic> strains showed the same profile when grown in LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In both cases, the majority of the cells were rapidly killed after 1 h 30 min of incubation with gentamicin (5 logs of killing). Again, addition of DIP to the medium had a ≈ 4 log protective effect against gentamicin on WT cells as early as 1 h 30 min post addition of the antibiotic. Cells then remained mainly resistant to gentamicin during the course of the experiment. In contrast, the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant gradually became as sensitive as cells grown in the absence of DIP (see 4 h 30 min time point), although killing kinetics were slightly slower than in presence of iron.</p>
<p>Finally, effect of RyhB on gentamicin efficacy during iron starvation was estimated by defining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for both WT and <italic>ryhB</italic> mutants in presence of increasing concentration of gentamicin, with or without DIP. MIC value for the WT strain almost doubled when the cells were grown in the presence of DIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In sharp contrast, MIC values of the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant were the same in the presence or absence of DIP. Altogether, these results indicated that RyhB is needed for the phenotypic resistance of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to gentamicin in low iron condition.</p>

<title>RyhB decreased sensitivity to gentamicin is dependent on Nuo and Sdh</title>
<p>Entry of aminoglycosides is dependent on the proton motive force (pmf) mainly produced directly by respiratory complex I and indirectly by the respiratory complex II, respectively encoded by the <italic>nuo</italic> and <italic>sdh</italic> operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, based on our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>], one hypothesis was that RyhB induced resistance was due to an inhibitory effect on the activity of these two complexes that would block entry of gentamicin in the cell.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis killing assays were run with a strain deleted for both respiratory complexes (<italic>Δnuo Δsdh</italic>). As expected, this mutant was resistant to gentamicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g002">Fig 2</xref>, left panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>]. Adding DIP to the medium somewhat increased by 1 log the survival of the <italic>nuo sdh</italic> mutant, suggesting that pmf might be even more decreased in these conditions. Nevertheless, deleting <italic>ryhB</italic> from this strain did not increase its sensitivity to gentamicin during iron starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g002">Fig 2</xref>, right panel) indicating that the observed DIP enhancing sensitivity of the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant was dependent on <italic>nuo</italic> and <italic>sdh</italic>.</p>

<title>RyhB represses <italic>nuo</italic> and <italic>sdh</italic> expression</title>
<p>RyhB inhibition of Sdh and Nuo activities may be due to the repression of the synthesis and / or of the maturation of the complexes. Expression of <italic>sdh</italic> has already been shown to be repressed by RyhB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref030">30</xref>].

<p>Using the RNA-fold software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://unafold.rna.albany.edu</ext-link>), we could predict a base-pairing in between RyhB and the 5’ un-translated region of the first gene of operon, <italic>nuoA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref034">34</xref>]. This base-pairing involves 21 nucleotides (nt) of RyhB and includes the ribosome-binding site (RBS) and the start codon of <italic>nuoA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<p>We then tested the biological relevance of the predicted base-pairing by introducing point mutations in the P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>nuoA-lacZ</italic> chromosomal fusion, giving rise to the <italic>nuoA</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub><italic>-lacZ</italic> fusion (G86C and C87G; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In contrast to the WT <italic>nuoA-lacZ</italic> fusion, RyhB overexpression was no longer able to repress activity of the <italic>nuoA</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We then introduced compensatory mutations in the pRyhB plasmid that should restore base-pairing to the mutated, but not to the WT, <italic>nuo-lacZ</italic> fusion, giving rise to pRyhB<sub>mut</sub>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, overexpression of RyhB<sub>mut</sub> failed to fully repress the WT <italic>nuo-lacZ</italic> fusion but was able to repress <italic>nuoA</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub><italic>-lacZ</italic> fusion. Altogether these results strongly suggest that RyhB represses <italic>nuo</italic> expression by base-pairing on the mRNA upstream <italic>nuoA</italic>.</p>
<p>We then evaluated the effect of this repression on protein levels by performing Western blot analyses against NuoG, a protein of the complex. Strikingly, NuoG protein levels decreased steeply, about 3-fold, when the WT strain was grown in presence of DIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). This phenotype was suppressed in the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant, confirming the <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of Nuo synthesis by RyhB.</p>
<p>As a control and to compare <italic>sdh</italic> regulation to <italic>nuo</italic>, we performed a series of similar tests on a <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> fusion. We saw that RyhB overexpression repressed the expression of the fusion by more than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). In addition, the WT fusion was also strongly inhibited when cells were grown in presence of DIP but not when <italic>ryhB</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Identical conclusions were reached from analyzing SdhB protein levels by performing Western blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). These experiments thus confirm the regulation of <italic>sdh</italic> by RyhB.</p>

<title>RyhB may impact Nuo and Sdh maturation through <italic>iscSUA</italic> repression</title>
<p>Biogenesis of Fe-S clusters by the Isc machinery has been shown to be key for full Nuo and Sdh activity and their associated pmf production. The <italic>iscSUA</italic> mRNA is a known RyhB target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref016">16</xref>]. Therefore, we asked if RyhB-mediated repression of the <italic>iscSUA</italic> genes bears any consequence on maturation of Nuo and Sdh.</p>
<p>We first checked that RyhB repressed <italic>isc</italic> expression in our conditions by following levels of the IscS protein after treatment with DIP in a WT and in a <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, DIP treatment did not seem to affect levels of IscS in the WT strain. However, in agreement with the study of Desnoyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref016">16</xref>], levels of IscS rose by a two-fold factor in the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant after 90 minutes of DIP treatment. These results thus confirm that RyhB limits the expression of Isc during iron starvation, albeit modestly, counteracting IscR alleviation of repression at the level of the P<italic>isc</italic> promoter.</p>
<p>We then measured Nuo and Sdh specific activities in strains deleted for <italic>suf</italic> (deletion of the whole operon) or for <italic>isc</italic> (<italic>iscUA</italic> deletion mutant), with or without <italic>ryhB</italic>. We first checked that deleting <italic>ryhB</italic> from the <italic>isc</italic> and <italic>suf</italic> mutants did not perturb growth in presence of DIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Growth of the <italic>iscUA</italic> mutant in LB was slightly slower than the WT strain, as expected from the literature, and was not affected by adding DIP to the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref035">35</xref>]. Introducing a secondary <italic>ryhB</italic> mutation did not change growth of the <italic>iscUA</italic> mutant. In sharp contrast, growth of the <italic>suf</italic> mutant was severely affected in presence of DIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). This was expected since the <italic>suf</italic> mutant was shown to be essential for growth in defined media containing higher doses of DIP (≥300 μM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref036">36</xref>]. Interestingly, introducing a <italic>ryhB</italic> mutation in the <italic>Δsuf</italic> background slightly improved growth, perhaps suggesting that the alleviation of <italic>isc</italic> repression in the <italic>suf</italic> mutant may partially restore Fe-S cluster homeostasis. We then measured Nuo activities of the different mutants grown until mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0,6). In agreement with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>], Nuo activity was decreased more than 5 fold in an <italic>isc</italic> mutant wherein the Suf machinery alone is responsible for Fe-S biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>The situation was slightly different for Sdh. Deleting <italic>isc</italic> severely affected activity of Sdh in presence or absence of iron. Further deleting <italic>ryhB</italic> from this strain marginally restored Sdh activity, indicating that a significant level of Sdh maturation can be controlled by Suf.

<title>There is de novo synthesis and maturation of the Nuo respiratory complex in the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant during iron starvation</title>

<p>As Nuo and Sdh activities are crucial for gentamicin sensitivity, we investigated if we could correlate both the levels of complexes enzymatic activity with that of resistance to gentamicin. Strikingly, there was an almost linear correlation between Nuo or Sdh activities of each strain and its sensitivity to gentamicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). For instance, strains displaying the lowest Nuo activities were the most resistant to gentamicin, and vice versa.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Phenotypic resistance can take place when environmental conditions change as adaptive molecular responses modify cellular physiology, giving rise to a transient resistance state. Here, we show that the sRNA RyhB is a major contributor of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> phenotypic resistance to gentamicin in iron limiting conditions. Aminoglycosides uptake depends upon pmf, which is produced by the activity of respiratory complexes I (Nuo), and, indirectly, by complex II (Sdh). RyhB negatively regulates synthesis of both respiratory complexes. RyhB may also impact activity of Nuo indirectly by limiting the levels of Isc, which we show to be essential for its maturation (i.e. acquisition of Fe-S clusters) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Our model strengthens the role of the pmf-producing respiratory complexes in entry of aminoglycosides. Fe-S biogenesis maturation of the complexes was earlier pointed out as the main factor for resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref007">7</xref>]. By identifying here that the <italic>nuo</italic> mRNA is targeted by RyhB in addition to <italic>sdh</italic>, we show that synthesis of the respiratory complexes is also key in this process.</p>

<title>Model for the RyhB induced resistance to gentamicin during iron starvation.</title>
<p>When iron is not limiting (left panel), the Isc Fe-S biogenesis machinery ensures the maturation of Nuo and Sdh, which generate a pmf that allows gentamicin uptake. Gentamicin reaches the ribosome and induces mistranslation, which renders cells sensitive to the antibiotics. When iron is scarce (right panel), RyhB is expressed and represses the expression of <italic>nuo</italic>, <italic>sdh</italic> and <italic>isc</italic>. The pmf is lowered and gentamicin cannot enter the cytoplasm thus making cells resistant to the antibiotic.</p>

<p>As early as 2005, the <italic>nuo</italic> mRNA was suspected to be a target of RyhB as the operon was down-regulated when the sRNA was over-expressed, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref017">17</xref>]. The <italic>nuo</italic> mRNA was also more recently found associated with Hfq and RyhB in a global study of sRNA-mRNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref033">33</xref>]. We here could predict and confirm a direct base-pairing of RyhB to the <italic>nuo</italic> mRNA at the level of the UTR of <italic>nuoA</italic>, the first gene of the operon. This base-pairing occurs close to the ribosome binding site of <italic>nuoA</italic>, which strongly suggests that RyhB represses expression of <italic>nuo</italic> by occluding binding of the ribosome, and subsequently degradation of the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref038">38</xref>]. The <italic>nuo</italic> mRNA is very long (about 15 kb) and comprises 14 genes, which makes it one of the longest mRNAs regulated by a sRNA to our knowledge. Importantly, in addition to the effects seen on <italic>nuoA</italic> expression by using beta-galactosidase assays as a read-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4</xref>), we could also observe repression at the level of the NuoG protein by using Western blots analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The structural <italic>nuoG</italic> gene lies more than 5 kb away from the RyhB/Nuo base-pairing site. It will thus be interesting to investigate how far downstream the <italic>nuo</italic> operon RyhB repression propagates.</p>
<p>Respiratory complexes are high iron consumers, with a total of 12 Fe-S clusters for Nuo and Sdh in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Thus, their repression by RyhB is in line with its role in installing an iron sparing response when iron becomes scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref019">19</xref>]. Before our results, one could have imagined that RyhB represses Nuo and Sdh expression in order to limit accumulation of inactive apo-complexes in iron scarce conditions. However, both protein levels and activity of Nuo are restored in a <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant in iron-deprived medium indicating that maturation of respiratory complex I is possible under these conditions. These results strongly suggest that RyhB inhibits synthesis of Nuo Sdh to preclude respiratory complexes to divert iron from other essential processes.</p>
<p>We here show that Isc is essential for Nuo maturation when iron is depleted in the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In contrast, maturation of Sdh was only partially restored in the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant in presence of DIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and, perhaps more surprisingly, this activity did not seem to be dependent on Isc but rather on Suf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). More investigation is needed to understand the molecular basis for the difference in between Isc and Suf substrates preference. In any case, our results also clearly show that Nuo activity is more important than that of Sdh in installing a phenotypic resistance to gentamicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This may relate to pmf production by Nuo and Sdh. Indeed, Nuo, but not Sdh, directly translocates 4 protons across the membrane while both indirectly contribute to pmf production by passing electrons to cytochrome oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Our experiments clearly show that there is de novo synthesis and biogenesis, at least of Nuo complexes, during iron starvation in the <italic>ryhB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008078.g006">Fig 6</xref>). We also confirm that the maturation of this respiratory complex depends on the Isc machinery. Taken together, these results indicate that the Isc machinery can be functional during iron starvation and mature at least the Nuo complex. In agreement with previous results from the Massé laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref016">16</xref>], we also show that RyhB limits levels of the Isc machinery during iron starvation. Thus, a tempting hypothesis is that RyhB inhibits indirectly Nuo activity by limiting its maturation by Isc. However, given that RyhB effect on Isc is relatively modest, we cannot exclude that producing Nuo complexes alone, even while keeping Isc synthesis repressed by RyhB, may be sufficient to restore Nuo activity. Furthermore, the situation might be even more complex as iron depletion is likely to modify to different extent both the levels and activity of all of the proteins intervening in this process, namely Isc, Suf, Nuo and Sdh. Thus, fully testing the hypothesis that RyhB-mediated reduction of Isc synthesis will bear an effect on Nuo/Sdh activity will require a thorough assessment of both the concentration and the activity of all components cited above. For the time being, we consider the hypothesis of an indirect control of Nuo maturation as a likely contribution to the RyhB dependent phenotypic resistance we observed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact that Isc is able to maturate Nuo in iron deprived conditions may seem contradictory with previous studies that have shown the Suf system to be essential during iron starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref036">36</xref>]. In agreement with that idea, we have seen that deleting <italic>ryhB</italic> partially suppressed the growth defect phenotype of a <italic>suf</italic> mutant grown in the presence of DIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008078.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). However, growth of this mutant is not restored to wild type-like levels, indicating that while when overexpressed Isc may promote Fe-S cluster biogenesis, during iron starvation, it is not as efficient as the Suf machinery and thus explaining the need for a second iron limitation stress responsive system.</p>
<p>Our study puts RyhB on the focus among a growing number of sRNAs that have been directly or indirectly linked to antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref041">41</xref>]. However, in most of these cases phenotypes were derived from overexpression of the sRNAs and such situations might not be relevant to physiological conditions. For instance, 17 out of 26 <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> sRNAs that were assessed in a systematic manner against a variety of antibacterial effectors were shown to affect sensitivity to antibiotics when overexpressed, but few showed any phenotype when mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>A most spectacular case is represented by the role RyhB could play in the bacterial persistence of uropathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to different classes of antibiotics, among which gentamicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref043">43</xref>]. Persistence is a phenomenon in which a fraction of the bacterial population enters a metabolically inactive state that enables it to survive exposure to bactericidal antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref044">44</xref>]. It was proposed that <italic>ryhB</italic> mutants would induce less persister cells because they display increased ATP levels and altered NAD<sup>+</sup> / NADH ratios. In the light of our results, we believe these effects could also be explained by the fact that <italic>ryhB</italic> mutants display higher levels of Nuo, Sdh and Isc and therefore are more metabolically active, but also more prone to uptake the antibiotic. It is noteworthy that these experiments were conducted in rich medium not devoid for iron, and after long treatment with antibiotics (four days), which may explain low induction of RyhB in only a small percentage of bacterial cells that would then be able to resist antibiotics treatment in a persister-like manner.</p>
<p>RyhB homologs and paralogs are found in multiple other bacterial species, which suggests that many bacteria outside of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> may share the resistance mechanism that we describe here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref045">45</xref>]. In particular, other pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Yersinia</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic> or <italic>Salmonella</italic> possess not only RyhB homologs, but also the Isc and Suf system and rely on Nuo and Sdh for respiration on oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref047">47</xref>]. RyhB has also been implicated in promoting sensitivity to colicin IA, which is not an antibiotic in a narrow sense, but a bacteriocin secreted by other species to outcompete bacteria sharing the same niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref048">48</xref>]. In addition, RyhB has been shown to be involved in the virulence of <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> by repressing the major virulence regulator <italic>virB</italic>, and the sRNA may be associated with the virulence of <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, as the expression of its two RyhB homologs (RyhB1 and RyhB2) increases in the lung of infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008078.ref050">50</xref>]. Altogether, these data point out for a major role for RyhB in escaping antibacterial action.</p>
