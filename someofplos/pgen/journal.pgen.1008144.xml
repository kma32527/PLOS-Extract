<abstract>
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in various biological processes such as apoptosis. The function of lncRNAs is closely correlated with their localization within the cell. While regulatory potential of many lncRNAs has been revealed at specific subcellular location, the biological significance of discrete distribution of an lncRNA in different cellular compartments remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified an lncRNA antisense to the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>PYCARD</italic>, named PYCARD-AS1, which exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution and is required for the <italic>PYCARD</italic> silencing in breast cancer cells. The <italic>PYCARD</italic>-regulated apoptosis is controlled by PYCARD-AS1; moreover, PYCARD-AS1 regulates apoptosis in a <italic>PYCARD</italic>-dependent manner, indicating that <italic>PYCARD</italic> is a critical downstream target of PYCARD-AS1. Mechanistically, PYCARD-AS1 can localize to the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter, where it facilitates DNA methylation and H3K9me2 modification by recruiting the chromatin-suppressor proteins DNMT1 and G9a. Moreover, PYCARD-AS1 and PYCARD mRNA can interact with each other via their 5′ overlapping region, leading to inhibition of ribosome assembly in the cytoplasm for <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation. This study reveals a mechanism whereby an lncRNA works at different cellular compartments to regulate the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>PYCARD</italic> at both the epigenetic and translational levels, contributing to the <italic>PYCARD</italic>-regulated apoptosis, and also sheds new light on the role of discretely distributed lncRNAs in diverse biological processes.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>As the reveal of tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from mammalian genomes, there is increasing interest to understand how these transcripts function in physiological and pathological processes. The regulatory potential of many lncRNAs has been revealed at specific subcellular location. Nevertheless, many lncRNAs are discretely distributed in different cellular compartments, and the related biological significance remains largely unclear. PYCARD-AS1 is such a “discrete” lncRNA, which exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. Here, we provide a comprehensive picture of how PYCARD-AS1 works at different cellular compartments to regulate the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>PYCARD</italic> at both the epigenetic and translational levels, thereby contributing to the apoptotic regulation. Our study adds a different layer to the lncRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression, and strongly suggests that the transcripts of a specific lncRNA may have distinct functionalities at different cellular compartments where they are located.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The great majority of mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed, giving rise to tens of thousands of noncoding transcripts, especially long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref001">1</xref>]. LncRNAs participate in a large range of biological processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation, and most of them function by participating in the regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref003">3</xref>]. Unlike mRNAs, which must be localized to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis, lncRNAs exhibit diverse subcellular distribution patterns, ranging from predominant nuclear foci to almost exclusively cytoplasmic localization, and exert distinct regulatory effects at their particular site of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref005">5</xref>]. Thus, the subcellular localization of lncRNAs is critical for their biological function.</p>
<p>A number of studies have implicated the regulatory potential of lncRNAs at specific subcellular location. Determined by the site of action where they are located, lncRNAs may work <italic>in cis</italic> on neighboring genes or <italic>in trans</italic> to regulate distantly located genes or molecular targets in the nucleus or cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref006">6</xref>]. Also, our related studies showed that several nuclear lncRNAs drive tumorigenesis by sequestering the activity of PSF protein in repression of proto-oncogene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref008">8</xref>], and revealed that the OCC-1 transcripts localized in cytoplasm inhibit cell cycle transition by modulating the stability of HuR protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref009">9</xref>]. Current studies on lncRNAs have greatly advanced our knowledge of their physiological and pathological roles. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of lncRNAs are revealed to exhibit a discrete subcellular distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref010">10</xref>], and the biological significance of discrete distribution of an lncRNA in different cellular compartments remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The pro-apoptotic gene <italic>PYCARD</italic> encodes a signaling factor that consists of an N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and operates in the intrinsic and extrinsic cell death pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>PYCARD</italic> was originally identified to undergo the DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1)-mediated epigenetic silencing in a wide range of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref017">17</xref>], and subsequent studies showed that its inactivation is also associated with other epigenetic events such as H3K9 dimethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref018">18</xref>]. In this study, we further report an lncRNA antisense to <italic>PYCARD</italic>, named PYCARD-AS1, which exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution and is required for the <italic>PYCARD</italic> silencing in breast cancer cells. PYCARAD-AS1 is functionally involved in the <italic>PYCARD</italic>-regulated apoptosis, and regulates apoptosis in a <italic>PYCARD</italic>-dependent manner, indicating that <italic>PYCARD</italic> is a critical function mediator of PYCARD-AS1. Mechanistically, PYCARD-AS1 not only acts <italic>in cis</italic> to facilitate the recruitment of DNMT1 and histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a to the <italic>PYCARD</italic> locus, but also inhibits ribosome assembly in the cytoplasm for <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation, leading to coordinated regulation of <italic>PYCARD</italic> expression at the epigenetic and translational levels. Our findings highlight the notion that the transcripts of a specific lncRNA may operate in biological processes by exerting distinct regulatory effects at different cellular compartments.</p>

<title>PYCARD-AS1 is an lncRNA distributed in both nucleus and cytoplasm</title>
<p>Through a GenBank search, we identified the gene <italic>C16orf98</italic> on the opposite strand of the <italic>PYCARD</italic> gene, which produces a transcript in a head-to-head orientation relative to the PYCARD mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Based on the sequence of <italic>C16orf98</italic>, the experiments of 5′- and 3′-RACE were initiated with total RNA from SKBR3 cells and resulted in a 1,095-nucleotide (nt) antisense transcript of <italic>PYCARD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), which is the same as the transcript annotated as PYCARD-AS1. PYCARD-AS1 originates in the second intron 892 nt downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of <italic>PYACRD</italic>, ends at nt 676 upstream of the <italic>PYCARD</italic> TSS, and consists of two exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). A “directional” RT-PCR assay, which was set up by using gene-specific reverse primers in RT reaction (AS-R and S-R, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), showed that neither <italic>PYCARD-AS1</italic> nor <italic>PYCARD</italic> produces longer RNA species spanning their 3’ non-overlapping regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In addition, the RT-PCR detection initiated by different primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), as well as the 3′-RACE experiment, indicated that PYCARD-AS1 is poly(A)-tailed, belonging to an mRNA-like transcript. We next examined the sensitivity of PYCARD-AS1 transcription to the Pol II inhibitor α-amanitin. Following α-amanitin treatment, the levels of PYCARD-AS1 and ACTB transcripts were reduced, whereas those of pre-tRNA<sup>tyr</sup> and 45S pre-rRNA showed no change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), indicating that PYCARD-AS1 is transcribed by Pol II.</p>

<p>PYCARD-AS1 is annotated as a noncoding transcript in GenBank. In addition, the Coding Potential Calculator tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref019">19</xref>] predicted that PYCARD-AS1 displays no protein-coding potentiality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Although UniProt showed a putative protein prediction of 204 amino acids for PYCARD-AS1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), we found that the putative open reading frame (ORF) of PYCARD-AS1 could not be expressed as an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>). By RNA FISH assay, PYCARD-AS1 was revealed to exhibit a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Moreover, cellular fractionation assay showed that the distribution of PYCARD-AS1 is clearly distinct from that of the nuclear-localized U1 snRNA, the mitochondrially retained 12S rRNA and the protein-coding GAPDH mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).

<title>PYCARD-AS1 is a negative regulator of <italic>PYCARD</italic></title>

Next, shRNAs were designed to silence PYCARD-AS1 and detect the effect of PYCARD-AS1 knockdown on <italic>PYCARD</italic> expression in SKBR3 cells.

<p>The silencing of <italic>PYCARD</italic> is closely correlated with the defective apoptosis of tumor cells, and its reactivation was revealed to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to cytotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref020">20</xref>]. Confirming the regulatory effect of PYCARD-AS1 on <italic>PYCARD</italic> expression prompted assays on the contribution of PYCARD-AS1 to <italic>PYCARD</italic>-regulated apoptosis. We tested whether PYCARD-AS1 regulates the sensitivity of SKBR3 cells to paclitaxel, which is also associated with the expression level of <italic>PYCARD</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref021">21</xref>]. Knockdown of PYCARD-AS1 increased <italic>PYCARD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s002">S2H Fig</xref>), and the PYCARD-AS1-knockdown SKBR3 cells showed increased sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g002">Fig 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s002">S2I Fig</xref>). Remarkably, simultaneous PYCARD knockdown, which neutralized the increased <italic>PYCARD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s002">S2H Fig</xref>), was shown to largely weaken the sensitivity of SKBR3 cells to paclitaxel increased by PYCARD-AS1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g002">Fig 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s002">S2I Fig</xref>), suggesting that PYCARD-AS1 regulates apoptosis in a <italic>PYCARD</italic>-dependent manner.</p>
<p>SKBR3 cells included in the above apoptosis assay were also subjected to global gene expression analysis. Microarray data revealed hundreds of genes that were induced or suppressed more than twofold as a consequence of PYCARD-AS1 knockdown, and showed that the expression of a significant proportion of these differentially expressed genes (91 of 175 PYCARD-AS1 knockdown-induced genes and 37 of 59 PYCARD-AS1 knockdown-suppressed genes) could be reversed at least 1.5-fold in PYCARD-AS1 and PYCARD double-knockdown SKBR3 cells compared with that in PYCARD-AS1 knockdown SKBR3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g002">Fig 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s006">S1 Table</xref>; GEO accession number: GSE85032).

<title>PYCARD-AS1 regulates <italic>PYCARD</italic> at the epigenetic level</title>
<p>Following on from the above studies, we attempted to determine how PYCARD-AS1 suppresses <italic>PYCARD</italic> by using SKBR3 cells. DNA methylation and histone H3K9 dimethylation are two types of epigenetic modifications contributing to the <italic>PYCARD</italic> silencing in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref018">18</xref>]. Since shRNAs were shown to act on the PYCARD-AS1 in nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>), we first analyzed whether PYCARD-AS1 knockdown can impact the methylation status of the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter, with the <italic>PYCARD-AS1</italic> promoter being detected as a control. The results from bisulfite sequencing showed that the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter, but not the <italic>PYCARD-AS1</italic> promoter, was partially demethylated by PYCARD-AS1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), leading to a relatively hypomethylated state. We also performed ChIP assay to examine the distribution of H3K9me2 across a genomic region of approximately 2.7 kb that covers the <italic>PYCARD</italic> and <italic>PYCARD-AS1</italic> loci. The decrease of H3K9me2 occupancy, which occurred upon PYCARD-AS1 knockdown, was only detected in the region near the <italic>PYCARD</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, upper). Histone modification H3K27me3 was included as a ChIP control, and the result showed that it was rarely enriched across this genomic region compared with H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, lower).</p>

<title>DNMT1 and G9a interact with the 3′ region of PYCARD-AS1</title>
<p>We proceeded to elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby PYCARD-AS1 epigenetically regulates <italic>PYCARD</italic>.

To map the DNMT1- and G9a-interacting region within PYCARD-AS1, nuclear extract from SKBR3 cells was subjected to limited RNase T1 digestion, so that G residues protected by an RNA binding protein would remain preferentially uncleaved. After DNMT1 or G9a RIP, the enriched RNA fragments, which were associated with DNMT1 or G9a and protected from degradation, were identified by qRT-PCR analysis using primer sets that scanned the PYCARD-AS1 transcript in overlapping ~150 nt-long segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

However, the effort to further narrow down and distinguish the DNMT1- and G9a-binding regions was failed because neither DNMT1 nor G9a could be retrieved by any of the biotinylated RNA segments derived from the 3′ PYCARD-AS1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

These analyses indicated that the region of potential RNA–DNA interaction is likely to be contained in a 317-nt fragment within exon 2 of PYCARD-AS1 (nt 576/892 with respect to the <italic>PYCARD-AS1</italic> TSS), which is complementary to a region of the first exon of <italic>PYCARD</italic> (nt 1/317 with respect to the <italic>PYCARD</italic> TSS), because this PYCARD-AS1 region is sensitive to the RNase H treatment, which degrades RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next established an RNase-ChIP assay to test whether R-loop formation contributes to the DNMT1/G9a occupancy at the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter, which was revealed to be PYCARD-AS1-dependent in SKBR3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). RNase T1 treatment, which would degrade the single-stranded PYCARD-AS1 sequence lying outside the 3′ DNMT1/G9a-binding region, led to a separation of the 3′ PYCARD-AS1 region from the <italic>PYCARD</italic> DNA that abrogated the association between DNMT1/G9a complex and <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter; if PYCARD-AS1 interacts with the <italic>PYCARD</italic> DNA sequence to recruit DNMT1 and G9a as expected, treatment with RNase H would result in the significant release of DNMT1 and G9a from the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). We next tested several other DNMT1- and G9a-targeted loci that include <italic>KCNQ1</italic> and <italic>CDH1</italic>, two genes characterized to also associate with the lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 or NEAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref030">30</xref>].

<title>PYCARD-AS1 interferes with <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation</title>
<p>As PYCARD-AS1 and PYCARD mRNA constitute a pair of head-to-head overlapping transcripts, we next sought to determine whether they can interact with each other. Affinity pull-down assay showed that the <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated biotinylated full-length PYCARD-AS1 retrieved a substantial amount of PYCARD mRNA compared with the negative controls including beads alone or EGFP transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In parallel, the deletion mutant of PYCARD-AS1 that lacks the overlapping region (PYCARD-AS1ΔOS, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, upper) was tested, and the result showed that deletion of the overlapping region led to an impaired association with PYCARD mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The interaction between PYCARD-AS1 and PYCARD transcripts was also confirmed within the cellular context by a MS2-RIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6B</xref>); furthermore, an RNase-A assay indicated that the overlapping region of this pair of transcripts was resistant to RNase degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, lower).

<p>The interaction between PYCARD-AS1 and PYCARD transcripts implies a post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>PYCARD</italic> by PYCARD-AS1. lncRNAs have been involved in the stability control of their paired mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref037">37</xref>]. However, it seems unlikely that PYCARD-AS1 operates through this strategy because its depletion didn′t change the half-life of PYCARD mRNA in SKBR3 cells, which were treated with α-amanitin in advance to block new RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). In addition, PYCARD-AS1 was demonstrated to have no effect on the subcellular distribution of PYCARD mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008144.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested whether PYCARD-AS1 gets connected to the <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation by monitoring the association of PYCARD mRNA with polysomes, the translational entity, in SKBR3 cells with or without PYCARD-AS1 knockdown. SKBR3 cell lysates fractionated through sucrose gradients were subjected to RNA isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), and the isolated RNA samples were used to measure the recruitment of PYCARD mRNA on polysomes by qRT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6E</xref> (upper), PYCARD-AS1 knockdown drove a shift of PYCARD mRNA toward heavier polysomes, in keeping with increased translation. As a negative control, the distribution of GAPDH mRNA in separation fractions did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, lower). Given that the overlapping region of this pair of sense–antisense transcripts is localized at their 5′ ends, we reasoned that PYCARD-AS1 can influence the ribosome assembly on PYCARD mRNA when they interact with each other. To test this, we established an RIP assay to determine whether PYCARD-AS1 knockdown can affect the ratio of ribosome-occupied PYCARD to total PYCARD mRNA, which was expected to eliminate the "contaminating" effect of PYCARD-AS1 knockdown on <italic>PYCARD</italic> transcription. The results clearly showed that occupancy of RPS6 and L26, the integral components of ribosomal subunits, on PYCARD mRNA was increased by PYCARD-AS1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, upper). In parallel, PYCARD-AS1 knockdown was shown to have no effect on the RPS6 and L26 occupancy on GAPDH mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, lower). To further address this issue, we performed a compensation experiment by infecting the PYCARD-AS1-knockdown SKBR3 cells, which had increased mRNA and protein levels of PYCARD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>), with lentivirus expressing the 5′ overlapping region of PYCARD-AS1 (PYCARD-AS1OS) or the PYCARD-AS1ΔOS, which contains several point mutations that disrupt the shRNA target. Neither of the transcripts could compensate for the effect of PYCARD-AS1 knockdown on PYCARD mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). However, the PYCARD-AS1OS, but not the PYCARD-AS1ΔOS, has the ability to neutralize the <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation increased by PYCARD-AS1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). Collectively, the results suggest that PYCARD-AS1 also suppresses the translation of <italic>PYCARD</italic> in addition to its transcription.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>LncRNAs have been implicated in a large range of biological processes such as apoptosis, and their function is closely correlated with the cellular compartments where they are located. It is interesting that a sizable proportion of lncRNAs are discretely distributed in different cellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref010">10</xref>]. PYCARD-AS1 reported here is such a "discrete" lncRNA, which exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution, and our current study describes a model whereby the discretely distributed PYCARD-AS1 transcripts link different effector mechanisms to simultaneously operate in the different aspects of <italic>PYCARD</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008144.g007">Fig 7</xref>), contributing to the <italic>PYCARD</italic>-regulated apoptosis.</p>

<title>Proposed model of PYCARD-AS1-mediated <italic>PYCARD</italic> regulation.</title>
<p><italic>PYCARD</italic> transcription is activated in the case of PYCARD-AS1 silencing <bold>(A)</bold>. Upon transcribed from the opposite strand of the <italic>PYCARD</italic> gene, a fraction of PYCARD-AS1 transcripts localize at <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter via the 5′ region, and interact with DNMT1 and G9a via the 3′ region, thereby recruiting the two chromatin-suppressor proteins to <italic>PYCARD</italic> locus <bold>(B)</bold>. On the other hand, some PYCARD-AS1 transcripts interact with PYCARD mRNAs via the 5′ sequence <bold>(C)</bold>, and then suppress <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation by interfering with the ribosome assembly <bold>(D)</bold>. This mechanism results in coordinated regulation of <italic>PYCARD</italic> at both epigenetic and translational levels by its antisense counterpart.</p>

<p>We first showed that PYCARD-AS1 can regulate <italic>PYCARD</italic> at the epigenetic level. Current evidence indicates that interaction with DNA methyltransferase or histone modifier is the major mechanism through which lncRNAs function in epigenetic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref038">38</xref>]. Nevertheless, PYCARD-AS1 represents one of the few lncRNAs, which include KCNQ1OT1 and NEAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref030">30</xref>], identified to simultaneously modulate DNA methylation and histone modification at the loci of regulated genes. Biochemical interactions between DNA and histone methyltransferases were thought to provide a molecular explanation for the combinatorial pattern of DNA and histone modification in chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref040">40</xref>]. The current data further indicate that PYCARD-AS1 interacts with the DNMT1/G9a complex and aids in its recruitment to the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter. The core functionality of lncRNAs relies heavily on the cooperative action of their dispersed functional regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref041">41</xref>]. In the case of PYCARD-AS1-mediated epigenetic regulation of <italic>PYCARD</italic>, PYCARD-AS1 interacts with DNMT1/G9a complex via its 3′ region, and localizes at the <italic>PYCARD</italic> promoter via its 5′ region, thereby facilitating the location-specific DNMT1/G9a recruitment. While the detailed mechanism underlying the lncRNA-mediated R-loop formation is not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref042">42</xref>], our results showed that the R-loop structure formed by the 5′ PYCARD-AS1 region substantially contributes to the PYCARD-AS1-mediated <italic>PYCARD</italic> regulation. On the other hand, the interactions between lncRNA and DNMT1 are documented to have either positive or negative effect on the activity of DNMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref045">45</xref>]. The "guiding" lncRNAs, including PYCARD-AS1 reported here, can facilitate the DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation by recruiting DNMT1, whereas some other lncRNAs, such as ecCEBPA and Dali, were found to sequester the DNMT1 activity as they compete with the DNA substrate of DNMT1 for DNMT1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>PYCARD-AS1 also exerts inhibitory effect on <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation. Recent studies have shown that through binding mRNAs, lncRNAs, especially antisense lncRNAs, can repress or promote mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref050">50</xref>]. The distinct effects may depend on specific binding sequences and embedded elements in lncRNAs. In the case of PYCARD-AS1-mediated repression of <italic>PYCARD</italic> translation, PYCARD-AS1 activity depends on the 5′ overlapping sequence, which interferes with the ribosome assembly on <italic>PYCARD</italic> mRNA. The feature of 5′ overlapping sequence is shared by many other natural antisense transcripts. Nevertheless, the antisense Uchli RNA was reported to exert an opposite effect on the translation of its sense counterpart due to the presence of an embedded inverted SINEB2 element, which facilitates the ribosome binding to mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref049">49</xref>]. The paired antisense lncRNA may also affect certain other steps in protein translation. For instance, a binding of the PXN mRNA by its antisense lncRNA PXN-AS1-S can reduce PXN protein synthesis by inhibiting translational elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, a recent study reported that through competitive RNA–RNA interaction, an lncRNA is able to attenuate the activity of its paired antisense lncRNA in repression of mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref050">50</xref>], thereby constituting a finely tuned lncRNA/antisense lncRNA/mRNA translational regulatory axis. The cluster of natural antisense transcripts comprises a surprisingly large fraction of lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref051">51</xref>]; moreover, the lncRNA–mRNA gene pairs are prevalent in mammalian genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref052">52</xref>]. Thus, effect on mRNA translation might be a common effector mechanism employed by lncRNAs, especially antisense lncRNAs, to function in biological processes.</p>
<p>Taken together, this study provides an example of how an lncRNA works at different cellular compartments to regulate a specific target gene at multiple levels, contributing to the regulation of apoptosis. The feature of discrete distribution in different cellular compartments is not exclusively exhibited by PYCARD-AS1; instead, it is extensively shared by other lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008144.ref010">10</xref>]. We propose that, as with PYCARD-AS1, many other discretely distributed lncRNAs should also be multifunctional within the cell, and that elucidating their different functionalities at distinct distribution sites will greatly broaden our knowledge of lncRNA biology and provide new insights into their physiological and pathological roles in depth.</p>
