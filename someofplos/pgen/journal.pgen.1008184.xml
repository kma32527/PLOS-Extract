<abstract>
<p>The function of AarF domain-containing kinase 1 (ADCK1) has not been thoroughly revealed. Here we identified that ADCK1 utilizes YME1-like 1 ATPase (YME1L1) to control optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT) in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and cristae structure. We firstly observed that a serious developmental impairment occurred in <italic>Drosophila ADCK1</italic> (<italic>dADCK1</italic>) deletion mutant, resulting in premature death before adulthood. By using temperature sensitive ubiquitously expression driver <italic>tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>/tub-Gal4</italic> or muscle-specific expression driver <italic>mhc-Gal4</italic>, we observed severely defective locomotive activities and structural abnormality in the muscle along with increased mitochondrial fusion in the <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production and survival rate along with increased ROS and apoptosis in the flies further demonstrated that the structural abnormalities of mitochondria induced by <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown led to their functional abnormalities. Consistent with the ADCK1 loss-of-function data in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ADCK1 over-expression induced mitochondrial fission and clustering in addition to destruction of the cristae structure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells. Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>YME1L1</italic> rescued the phenotypes of ADCK1 over-expression. Furthermore, genetic epistasis from fly genetics and mammalian cell biology experiments led us to discover the interactions among IMMT, OPA1 and ADCK1. Collectively, these results established a mitochondrial signaling pathway composed of ADCK1, YME1L1, OPA1 and IMMT, which has essential roles in maintaining mitochondrial morphologies and functions in the muscle.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Mitochondria function as energy producing factories in the cell, and thus the malfunctioning of mitochondria becomes the causes of many diseases. Especially in muscles that continuously require a vast amount of energy, dysfunction of mitochondria leads to abnormalities in muscles. Mitochondria maintain their homeostasis and recover from stresses induced by external stimuli through a dynamic process of continuous fusion and fission. Moreover, they constantly produce ATP through their wrinkled internal structure, called the cristae. We discovered that ADCK1 is important in maintaining these mitochondrial functions. In the fruit fly model, a severe developmental anomaly was observed in ADCK1 mutant, and inhibition of ADCK1 expression led to defects in locomotive activity, along with abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and functions in muscles. Interestingly, these anomalies in mitochondria were due to OPA1 and IMMT proteins that exist downstream of ADCK1, regulated by ADCK1 through a protease called YME1L1. These results provide better molecular understanding on how mitochondria contribute to degenerative diseases in the muscular system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ADCK family proteins have common structural signatures of protein serine/threonine or tyrosine kinase and the evolutionarily conserved AarF domain. Among the family proteins, ADCK3 (also known as COQ8A) is well-known for its functions related to production of coenzyme Q ubiquinone, which is an essential lipid-soluble carrier in the electron transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref001">1</xref>]. Similarly, there have been studies claiming that ADCK4 (also known as COQ8B) also participates in the production of coenzyme Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref002">2</xref>]. Interestingly, the mutated form of ADCK3 is reported to be the main cause of cerebellar ataxia with seizures as well as decrease in motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref004">4</xref>]. Based on these isoform-specific functions, additional studies are needed to determine the functional roles of the other ADCK family proteins including ADCK1.</p>
<p>The cristae formations of the mitochondria increase the surface area of the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays important roles in maintaining ATP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref005">5</xref>]. Any damage to the structure of the cristae results in defective ATP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref007">7</xref>]. In recent studies, it has been stated that the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex is a key component in developing and maintaining the cristae junctional structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref009">9</xref>]. The MICOS complex consists of many subunits and of these, IMMT (also known as MIC60) is recognized to be in the centre of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref010">10</xref>]. Although it is well-known that IMMT participates in the formation of the cristae structure, its mechanism was unknown. Defects in the MICOS complex result in many diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease and optic atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, there are many reports confirming the interaction between the MICOS complex and the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex which anchors the beta-barrel proteins to the outer membrane of the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, if IMMT expression is suppressed, the assembly of the MICOS complex and the SAM complex is highly defected, and consequently the cristae structures are reported to nearly disappear, resulting in a concentric circle-shaped inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref015">15</xref>]. In the cell, the functions of IMMT can be regulated by controlling its stability by an i-AAA type protease called YME1L1, located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref010">10</xref>]. YME1L1 is thought to be associated with apoptosis and cell proliferation through maintenance of the cristae structure and the assembly of the respiratory chain subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, abnormal YME1L1 has been revealed to be the direct cause of optic atrophy 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The mitochondrial fusion/fission was developed in the cell to adapt to the environmental changes and involves in many intracellular processes such as cellular stress responses, mitophagy, apoptosis, mitochondrial DNA stability, and respiratory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, disruption in balance between fusion and fission hinders the cellular homeostasis and hence induces various abnormalities, such as neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref020">20</xref>]. Mitochondrial fusion and fission work antagonistic to each other, as the increase in fusion or fission leads to the decrease in the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref021">21</xref>]. The fusion is regulated by mitofusin1 (MFN1) and mitofusin2 (MFN2) for the outer membrane and by OPA1 for the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref023">23</xref>]. Especially, OPA1 has a GTPase domain and exists in L-OPA1 form in the inner membrane and in S-OPA1 form in the intermembrane space, without the transmembrane domain. The central function of OPA1 is consistent with the activity of L-OPA1 in anchoring the inner membrane of mitochondria during mitochondrial fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref024">24</xref>]. According to many recent findings, the importance of L-OPA1 in cristae formation has also been discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref027">27</xref>]. Particularly, L-OPA1 was found to interact with the key subunit of the MICOS complex, IMMT, to maintain the cristae structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref028">28</xref>]. Although the function of S-OPA1 has not been well identified compared to L-OPA1, previous studies revealed that it is involved in the mitochondrial fission or assists L-OPA1 by forming an oligomer with L-OPA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref024">24</xref>]. It has been discovered that a disturbance in the balanced state of L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 causes mitochondrial dysfunction and induces fragmentation, thereby affecting cells even to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref029">29</xref>]. The balance between L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 is regulated by changing the cleavage pattern of OPA1 by YME1L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Our interest in this research was to identify the unknown functions of proteins residing in mitochondria. Through the discovery, we aimed to observe new functions and roles of the mitochondria in living organisms and to identify the causes and treatments of mitochondria-related diseases. Specifically, we predicted that ADCK1 would participate in a novel signal transduction cascade in the mitochondria. We unexpectedly found that ADCK1 plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics and cristae formation through interacting with critical mitochondrial proteins, such as YME1L1, OPA1 and IMMT.</p>

<title><italic>ADCK1</italic> mutant flies show developmental defects</title>
<p>We aimed to find a novel regulatory protein existing in mitochondria or a pathogenic mechanism of mitochondrial diseases that was not well studied. Hence, we underwent a screening procedure to find a new mitochondrial regulator with an evolutionarily conserved catalytic domain. Among 159,743 human proteins, 35 final candidates were acquired through series of text mining processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). These 35 candidates were again screened using RNAi-based fly genetics and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ADCK1 (dADCK1) was finally found to affect mitochondrial structures and dynamics.</p>
<p>The human ADCKs were encoded by a gene family of <italic>ADCK1</italic>, <italic>ADCK2</italic>, <italic>ADCK3</italic>, <italic>ADCK4</italic>, and <italic>ADCK5</italic>, whereas the fly has a family of <italic>Adck</italic> (<italic>CG3608</italic>), <italic>CG32649</italic>, and <italic>CG7616</italic>. According to homology database, <italic>Drosophila Adck</italic> is the homolog of human <italic>ADCK1</italic> (henceforth, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Adck is called dADCK1). CG32649 is the homolog of human <italic>ADCK3</italic> and <italic>ADCK4</italic>, and CG7616 is the homolog of human <italic>ADCK5</italic>. The fruit fly homolog of human <italic>ADCK2</italic> has not been found.</p>
<p>In this study, we have generated a loss-of-function mutant of <italic>dADCK1</italic> in order to understand the in vivo function of <italic>ADCK1</italic>. We produced the mutant by deleting the <italic>dADCK1</italic> gene from the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> exon to the middle of the 3<sup>rd</sup> exon using two guide RNAs by CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref031">31</xref>]. As a result, we created a <italic>dADCK1</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) without 501 base pairs of the evolutionarily very-well conserved amino acids positioned at 349–473 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). The <italic>dADCK1</italic> homozygous mutant flies showed defects in development. Compared to control larvae, the homozygote mutant showed a smaller body size in the second instar larva stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition, the mutant flies required an abnormally longer time of transition from the first instar stage to the second instar stage and could not proceed into the third instar stage. However, when exogenous dADCK1 was over-expressed in the homozygote mutant flies by muscle-specific <italic>mef2-Gal4</italic> driver, the mutant larvae were partially rescued and developed into the third instar stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Furthermore, when exogenous dADCK1 was over-expressed by ubiquitous <italic>hs-Gal4</italic> driver, the mutants developed normally into the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). We also observed that the survival rates of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> homozygote mutants were notably lower than control flies and could not survive longer than 7 days after egg laying (AEL). Yet, the short survival rate of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> homozygote mutant flies was rescued by dADCK1 over-expression by <italic>hs-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).

<title><italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown causes abnormality in the muscle</title>
<p>Due to the early lethal phenotype of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> homozygote mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), we studied the function of dADCK1 using RNA interference knockdown by UAS-Gal4 system. We first tested <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> that is expressed in the entire body of <italic>UAS-dADCK1 RNAi</italic> flies, and we were again able to confirm that the flies die without dADCK1 during development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Thus, we started to use the <italic>Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> system which represses the expression of Gal4 driver depending on the culture temperature in order to observe the effect of <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown in an adult fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref032">32</xref>]. In our experiment, we grew our flies at low temperature of 18°C and allowed them to grow into adulthood by repressing <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> driver. Thereafter, we performed <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown on adult flies by temporarily increasing the temperature to 30°C for 7 days to induce <italic>tub-Gal4</italic>. As a result, we were able to confirm that if the expression of <italic>dADCK1</italic> was repressed by inducing <italic>dADCK1</italic> RNAi, the flies showed defective ‘held-up’ wing position phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and flight disability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Next, the behavior of the flies was observed with the video tracking system and their locomotive activities were analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref033">33</xref>]. It was notable that <italic>dADCK1</italic> RNAi flies at 30°C displayed an obvious decline in the movement and the walking speed analyses than either <italic>dADCK1</italic> RNAi flies at 18°C or the control flies at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>mhc-Gal4</italic> driver selectively expresses target genes in muscle tissues and is less strongly expressed than <italic>mef2-Gal4</italic> driver, which often allows the transgenic flies to grow into adulthood. Hence, using <italic>mhc-Gal4</italic> driver, we were able to confirm that <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) had defective wing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), flight ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) and locomotive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2H and 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>), compared to the control flies.

<title><italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown causes mitochondrial abnormality in the muscle</title>
<p>From previous experiments, we were able to establish that decrease in the locomotive activity of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> loss-of-function flies was due to muscle abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">Fig 2E–2I</xref>). To further investigate the cause of the abnormalities, we dissected the adult fly thorax and stained with streptavidin and phalloidin to mark mitochondria and muscle actin fibers, respectively. We used temperature-dependent <italic>tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> and ubiquitously-expressing <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> driver to selectively induce <italic>dADCK1</italic> RNAi at 30°C, and their thoraces were dissected and observed.

<title><italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown increases ROS level and apoptosis</title>
<p>During ATP production in the mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced but the level of ROS production is well-controlled under normal circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref034">34</xref>]. Thus, mitochondrial damage affects both ATP and ROS production in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref035">35</xref>]. We raised adult flies at 30°C and observed the survival rate in order to determine if there were any changes in ROS level due to defective mitochondria. We confirmed that the <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies died earlier than the control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). When the ROS scavenger <italic>Drosophila</italic> superoxide dismutase 1 (<italic>dSOD1</italic>) and 2 (<italic>dSOD2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref036">36</xref>] were over-expressed in the <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies, the survival rate was partially recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To confirm the changes in ROS level due to <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown, we performed dihydroethidium (DHE) staining in the thorax muscle. As a result, <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown at 30°C showed increased DHE staining compared to the <italic>dADCK1</italic> RNAi flies at 18°C or the control flies at 30°C, and the increased ROS level of <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies at 30°C was highly suppressed by over-expression of dSOD1 or dSOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next we examined the increased apoptosis upon <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown by observing the survival rate of the flies at 30°C.

However, when p35, the baculovirus inhibitor for caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref037">37</xref>], was expressed in the <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies, the characteristically low survival rate of <italic>dADCK1</italic> knockdown flies was partially recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether these mitochondrial morphologies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be observed also in human cells, siRNA was applied to knockdown <italic>ADCK1</italic> in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As a result, the mitochondrial length was increased and the number of mitochondrial cristae was decreased by <italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5C–5E</xref>), suggesting the elevated mitochondrial fusion and cristae abnormality in <italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown cells. In contrast with the knockdown results, when ADCK1 was over-expressed, mitochondrial abnormality was also obvious in TEM analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). The cells with ADCK1 over-expression resulted in mitochondrial fission with reduced mitochondrial length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Moreover, ADCK1 over-expression caused severe destruction in cristae structure and thus resulted in abnormal circular shapes, clearly different from that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Lastly, the mitochondrial clustering phenotype was observed once again (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). These experimental observations led us to conclude the regulatory role of ADCK1 in mitochondrial fusion/fission and its critical role in formation of mitochondrial cristae structures.</p>

<title>YME1L1 is a critical target of ADCK1</title>
<p>Through earlier experiments, we demonstrated that the decrease in locomotive activity may be induced by mitochondrial malfunction from <italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g003">3</xref>). Particularly, mitochondrial anomalies in structure and function may result from affecting proteins related to mitochondrial fusion/fission or formation of cristae structure. Hence, we have conducted a screening experiment to find genes that alters the phenotypes of <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression. First, we extracted 1,730 protein-coding genes existing in human mitochondria from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. From these listed genes, we obtained genes related to the phenotypes of <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression or knockdown, such as mitochondrial fusion/fission, cristae structure maintenance, ROS production and apoptosis. Finally, we established 101 candidate genes that were orthologous to the genes of fruit fly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The RNAi lines of these final candidate genes were acquired from <italic>Drosophila</italic> stock centers to cross with the muscle-specific <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression fly (<italic>mef2&gt;dADCK1</italic>). The descendant flies were then examined if they could rescue the developmental lethality seen characteristically in the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression fly. After this genetic screen, the RNAi lines that rescued the developmental defects were again crossed with another muscle-specific <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression fly (<italic>mhc&gt;dADCK1</italic>). The descendant flies were once again observed if they could alter the mitochondrial fission or clustering phenotype seen in the adult thorax of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression fly. As a result, we found out that dYME1L1 could change the phenotypes of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression fly among other candidates.</p>
<p>We previously showed that the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression flies showed lethal phenotype in the pupa stage. Interestingly, the flies over-expressing <italic>dADCK1</italic> with simultaneous <italic>dYME1L1</italic> knockdown successfully survived into adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), implicating that dYME1L1 is a target of dADCK1. We further wanted to know if such relationship between dADCK1 and dYME1L1 is applicable to the locomotive activity. By observing walking trajectory and speed, we confirmed that the locomotive activity of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expressing adult flies dropped significantly compared to the controls. In this circumstance, the locomotive activity of the flies over-expressing <italic>dADCK1</italic> with simultaneous <italic>dYME1L1</italic> knockdown was similar to that of the <italic>dYME1L1</italic> knockdown flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>), suggesting that dADCK1 exists upstream of dYME1L1.</p>

Moreover, we observed increased fission and clustering in the mitochondria of the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Excitingly, these defective mitochondrial structures in the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression fly were recovered close to normal by <italic>dYME1L1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), further confirming that dYME1L1 is a crucial target of dADCK1.</p>

<title>IMMT functions downstream of ADCK1</title>
<p>The defects in mitochondrial cristae structure due to the over-expression of ADCK1 was shown in the previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Hence, by analyzing interactions among the proteins under ADCK family, we aimed to discover proteins maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure while also interacting with ADCK1 and YME1L1. When human ADCK family proteins were phylogenetically analyzed using multiple sequence alignments, we were able to classify them into 3 groups of evolutionarily closer genes: <italic>ADCK1</italic> and <italic>ADCK5</italic>, <italic>ADCK3</italic> and <italic>ADCK4</italic>, and <italic>ADCK2</italic>. Notably, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>dADCK1</italic> and <italic>CG7616</italic> (henceforth, <italic>dADCK5</italic>) were evolutionarily closer than <italic>CG32649</italic> (henceforth, <italic>dADCK3/4</italic>), which was consistent with the analysis of the human ADCK proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). When the human ADCK family genes were over-expressed, we observed that only ADCK1 and ADCK5 showed an increase in mitochondrial fission and clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Similarly, when <italic>Drosophila</italic> ADCK family proteins were over-expressed in human cells, only dADCK1 and dADCK5 exhibited abnormal mitochondria phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). Therefore, we created a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the ADCK family proteins to find a common protein that interacts with ADCK1 and ADCK5. This led us to discover that ADCK1 and ADCK5 selectively interact with IMMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Next, we tried to find a protein that interacts with ADCK1 and IMMT as well. As a result, we discovered that YME1 interacts with both MCP2, the orthologue of ADCK1, and MIC60, the orthologue of IMMT, in yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Consistent with these bioinformatic results, previous research showed that YEM1L1, the human homolog of YME1, controls IMMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to identify whether ADCK1 and IMMT genetically interact with each other, we expressed IMMT upon knockdown or over-expression of ADCK1 and determined their interactions using immunoblot analyses. When we over-expressed IMMT together with <italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown, we observed increased protein levels of IMMT compared to the sole over-expression of IMMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Consistently, once IMMT and ADCK1 were over-expressed simultaneously, we observed that the protein level of IMMT was decreased depending on the level of ADCK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). From this observation, we confirmed the antagonistic relationship between ADCK1 and IMMT. Furthermore, we confirmed that the fly over-expressing both dADCK1 and dIMMT developed normally into the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). As the over-expression of dIMMT rescued the pupal lethality induced by dADCK1 over-expression, dIMMT could be a downstream target of dADCK1 just as dYME1L1. To further validate this finding, we analyzed the locomotor activity of the flies with dADCK1 over-expression, dIMMT over-expression or both using <italic>mhc-Gal4</italic> driver. The locomotive activity of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression flies was significantly decreased. However, the flies with simultaneous over-expression of dADCK1 and dIMMT displayed a similar outcome to that of the flies over-expressing dIMMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>). Finally, by observing the muscle structure and mitochondria morphology in the thorax of adult flies, we discovered that simultaneous over-expression of dADCK1 and dIMMT partially rescued the phenotypes of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expressing flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Consummating these experimental data, we confirmed that IMMT functions downstream of ADCK1.</p>

<title>OPA1 is another downstream target of ADCK1</title>
<p>The increased mitochondrial fusion/fission due to the knockdown or the over-expression of ADCK1 was shown in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Moreover, we confirmed that <italic>dYME1L1</italic> knockdown rescued the phenotypes of the <italic>ADCK1</italic> over-expression fly, such as developmental lethality, locomotive defects and mitochondrial abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, we predicted that ADCK1 and YME1L1 would interact with other regulatory proteins to control mitochondrial fusion and fission. Through our effort to screen the interactions between ADCK1 and the proteins that are involved in mitochondrial fusion or fission in HeLa cells, we discovered that OPA1 rescues both the mitochondria clustering and increased fission phenotypes induced by ADCK1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Other proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion, MFN1 and MFN2, or proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, FIS1 and DNM1L (also known as DRP1), were also over-expressed with ADCK1. However, no significant changes were induced by them in the abnormal phenotypes of the ADCK1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s008">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>). Although we could confirm the genetic interaction of ADCK1 and the fusion protein OPA1, we could not identify a similar relationship between ADCK1 and fission proteins. For example, we studied whether the mitochondrial fission phenotypes of ADCK1 over-expression are dependent on DNM1L by expressing a dominant negative form of DNM1L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref038">38</xref>]. As a result, the increased fission phenotypes due to ADCK1 over-expression were not affected by the expression of the DNM1L protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we concluded that OPA1 is involved in the phenotypes resulting from ADCK1 over-expression. OPA1 is a well-known protein involved in mitochondrial fusion by interacting with YME1L1 in which YME1L1 regulates the balance between long form of OPA1 (L-OPA1) and short form of OPA1 (S-OPA1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, to identify whether ADCK1 affects the OPA1 protein processing by YME1L1, the ADCK1 and OPA1 were co-expressed and the cleavage pattern of OPA1 was analyzed through immunoblot analyses. The result demonstrated that the over-expression of both OPA1 and ADCK1 led to increased cleavage of L-OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). In addition, we observed that the transgenic flies over-expressing both dADCK1 and dOPA1 survived into adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Finally, simultaneous over-expression of dOPA1 partially rescued the locomotive defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>) and the mitochondrial anomalies in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g008">Fig 8G</xref>) of the <italic>dADCK1</italic> over-expression flies. Collectively, these results supported that dOPA1 is another downstream target of dADCK1.</p>

<title>Phenotypes induced by ADCK1 over-expression are independent of its kinase activity</title>
<p>The functions of ADCK1 discovered in our experiments were irrelevant to the kinase activity of the protein. Until now, ADCK1 was predicted to be a kinase, yet there were no available reports to confirm it. In our experiment, we engineered kinase-dead mutant forms of ADCK1 with substitutions of the key amino acids related to the phosphotransferase activity of ADCK1, such as A164G, K183I, D315A, and D338N mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s009">S9A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref001">1</xref>]. Over-expression of each mutant as well as the triple-mutation-containing form (K183I-D315A-D338N; 3KD) of ADCK1 still induced the same phenotypes similar to ADCK1 wild type, and thus we concluded that the phenotypes induced by ADCK1 are kinase-independent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). Moreover, no significant differences were detected between ADCK1 wild type and 3KD in the biochemical experiment testing for their inhibition on IMMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). However, as the endogenous kinase might have affected the assay with the ADCK1 kinase-dead mutant, we performed an experiment of over-expressing the kinase-dead form of ADCK1 in <italic>ADCK1</italic> knocked down HeLa cells by expressing siRNA for <italic>ADCK1</italic> and were able to obtain the identical conclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s009">S9D Fig</xref>). Based on these results, we again confirmed that ADCK1 regulates mitochondria in a kinase activity-independent manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we firstly identified the functions of ADCK1. By observing how over-expression of ADCK1 led to destruction of cristae structure and anomaly in mitochondrial functions, we discovered that ADCK1 maintains the cristae structure of the mitochondria by controlling IMMT. Moreover, we found that ADCK1 also involves in mitochondrial fusion/fission, since <italic>ADCK1</italic> knockdown increased fusion whereas its over-expression increased mitochondrial fission through OPA1. Furthermore, the regulation of IMMT and OPA1 by ADCK1 was critical in mitochondrial functions such as ATP production, ROS generation, and cell apoptosis. Secondly, we have discovered the ADCK1-dependent signaling pathway by using bioinformatics, fruit fly genetics and mammalian cell biology. Using PPI network analyses, comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis, we predicted new interactions among specific mitochondrial proteins and ADCK1 and demonstrated their epistasis. As a result, we have revealed that ADCK1 controls IMMT and OPA1 through YME1L1. Thirdly, we observed the importance of ADCK1 in maintaining structures and functions of the muscular system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The flies with ADCK1 deficiency displayed developmental defects, abnormal wing structures, flight disabilities and decreased locomotive activities. Moreover, when we monitored changes in mitochondrial fusion/fission and cristae structure upon ADCK1 misexpression in the thorax muscles of flies, we found that the ADCK1 pathway is critical for the muscle-related abnormalities induced by mitochondrial dysfunctions.</p>
<p>The ADCK family has evolutionarily conserved AarF domains and is expected to function as serine/threonine or tyrosine kinase. Especially, the protein family was predicted to be related to ubiquinone biosynthesis. In addition, the ADCK family was predicted to be located at the inner or outer membrane of the mitochondria due to its transmembrane domain and mitochondrial targeting sequences. Until now, only ADCK3 and ADCK4 had been studied among the ADCK family and their involvement in ubiquinone biosynthesis has been validated. However, their role as kinases lacks evidence. In this study, we have initiated an investigation on the function of ADCK1, revealing its essential role in the regulation of mitochondrial functions and structures in fruit flies and mammal cells. Through phylogenetic and PPI network analysis, we differentiated ADCK1 and ADCK5 from ADCK3 and ADCK4, and further proved their difference by observing mitochondrial phenotypes in over-expression experiments performed in mammal cells. Separate from ADCK3 and ADCK4 that involve in ubiquinone biosynthesis, we found that the ADCK1 plays specific roles in mitochondrial fusion/fission and cristae maintenance. Although we have not thoroughly examined ADCK5, we predict that its function will be similar to that of ADCK1.</p>
<p>Through this study, we have confirmed that ADCK1 pathway is pivotal in controlling the functions and morphologies of mitochondria. To find the downstream target of ADCK1 among mitochondrial proteins listed from text mining, we performed RNAi-based genetic screenings to identify novel interactors that alter the over-expression phenotypes of ADCK1. In consequence, we found that YME1L1 genetically interacts with ADCK1. The fly genetics result proved that ADCK1 works in the direction of activating YME1L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6</xref>). As ADCK1 was originally predicted to be a kinase, we had expected that ADCK1 would affect the activity of YME1L1 by phosphorylation. However, we discovered that the phenotypes induced by ADCK1 were independent of its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Although we could not experimentally validate how ADCK1 regulates YME1L1, its mechanism can be predicted from earlier studies and our experimental results. YME1L1 and OMA1 are mitochondrial proteases that work antagonistically in cleaving OPA1 to control mitochondrial fusion/fission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref040">40</xref>]. ADCK1 may operate as an energy sensor that activates YME1L1 when ATP is abundant or activates OMA1 in shortage of ATP, consequently controlling mitochondrial structures and functions depending on ATP availability in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref024">24</xref>]. Overall, we propose the presence of the ADCK1-dependent signaling pathway composed of ADCK1-YME1L1- IMMT/OPA1 to control central functions of mitochondria, such as fusion/fission, cristae remodeling, production of ATP and ROS, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008184.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we propose that further research will be needed to find out whether ADCK1 pathway regulates mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. We identified that fission occurred in the mitochondria between a normal and an abnormal section to recover normal mitochondria from the damaged ones with defective cristae structures upon <italic>ADCK1</italic> over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008184.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). The separated abnormal section of mitochondria after mitochondrial fission will be eliminated through mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, the connection between ADCK1 and the mitophagy-controlling signaling molecules, such as ULK1, PINK1a nd Parkin that induce mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008184.ref044">44</xref>], should be studied in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study revealed that ADCK1 plays critical roles in maintaining mitochondrial functions and structures. As malfunctioning of the ADCK1 pathway was confirmed to induce muscular dysfunctions, our research will be of help in finding the mechanism of pathogenesis and treatments for mitochondria-related muscular diseases.</p>

<title>Protein-protein interaction network analysis</title>
<p>The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for the ADCK family proteins were constructed. The interacting proteins were extracted from interactome database, BioGRID and IntAct. The Cytoscape 3 was used to construct, visualize and analyze the networks. Based on the obtained data from each interactome database, we developed PPI networks. By integrating all the networks generated, the entire human protein-scale network was constructed. Next, the neighborhood nodes that interact with ADCK1 were extracted into a small network. Each member of the ADCK families underwent similar interaction network constructions. Finally, all ADCK family protein networks were combined to form the ADCK family protein interaction network. The yeast homolog PPI networks of ADCK1 and IMMT were developed in an identical manner. The orthologues of the ADCK1 and IMMT were extracted from HomoloGene in the NCBI and Pan-taxonomic compara in the Ensembl.</p>
