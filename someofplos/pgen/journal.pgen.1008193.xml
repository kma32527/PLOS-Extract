<abstract>
<p>Mechanisms for highly efficient chromosome-associated equal segregation, and for maintenance of steady state copy number, are at the heart of the evolutionary success of the 2-micron plasmid as a stable multi-copy extra-chromosomal selfish DNA element present in the yeast nucleus. The Flp site-specific recombination system housed by the plasmid, which is central to plasmid copy number maintenance, is regulated at multiple levels. Transcription of the <italic>FLP</italic> gene is fine-tuned by the repressor function of the plasmid-coded partitioning proteins Rep1 and Rep2 and their antagonist Raf1, which is also plasmid-coded. In addition, the Flp protein is regulated by the host’s post-translational modification machinery. Utilizing a Flp-SUMO fusion protein, which functionally mimics naturally sumoylated Flp, we demonstrate that the modification signals ubiquitination of Flp, followed by its proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, reduced binding affinity and cooperativity of the modified Flp decrease its association with the plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> (Flp recombination target) sites, and/or increase its dissociation from them. The resulting attenuation of strand cleavage and recombination events safeguards against runaway increase in plasmid copy number, which is deleterious to the host—and indirectly—to the plasmid. These results have broader relevance to potential mechanisms by which selfish genomes minimize fitness conflicts with host genomes by holding in check the extra genetic load they pose.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Plasmids of budding yeasts, exemplified by the 2-micron plasmid of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and mammalian papilloma and gammaherpes viruses typify eukaryotic extra-chromosomal selfish DNA elements. The plasmid and the viral episomes, despite the long evolutionary divergence of their hosts, share striking similarities in lifestyles. These include the ability to segregate to daughter cells by hitchhiking on chromosomes and to switch from cell cycle regulated replication to iterative replication for copy number maintenance. While selfish elements, including those integrated into chromosomes, rely on their hosts’ genetic potential for long-term survival, their genetic load is carefully regulated to minimize fitness conflicts with the hosts. Our study focuses on the Flp site-specific recombinase, which is central to the copy number control of the 2-micron plasmid and whose steady state levels are regulated through transcriptional control by plasmid coded proteins and through post-translational modification by the host’s sumoylation machinery. We demonstrate that sumoylation, in addition, attenuates the catalytic activity of Flp by diminishing its DNA binding affinity and inter-monomer cooperativity, providing another layer of protection against runaway increase in plasmid copy number. Population control by self-imposed and host-mediated mechanisms is likely a general strategy among selfish elements to ensure nearly conflict-free coexistence with host genomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The yeast 2-micron plasmid, nearly ubiquitous among <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeast strains, is a highly optimized extrachromosomal selfish DNA element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref004">4</xref>]. The plasmid resides in the nucleus, offers no apparent fitness advantage to its host, and does not impose any significant disadvantage at its normal copy number of 40–60 molecules per haploid chromosome set. The compact plasmid genome (~6.3 kbp) is organized into two functional modules, one devoted to stable propagation (the plasmid partitioning system) and the other to copy number maintenance (the plasmid amplification system).</p>
<p>The partitioning system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref007">7</xref>], comprised of the plasmid-coded Rep1 and Rep2 proteins together with a <italic>cis</italic>-acting locus <italic>STB</italic>, promotes nearly equal segregation of plasmid molecules duplicated by the host replication machinery into mother and daughter cells. Current evidence is consistent with a ‘hitchhiking model’ in which the plasmid utilizes chromosomes as a vehicle for segregation by physically associating with them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref011">11</xref>]. In this respect, the plasmid resembles the episomes of mammalian papilloma and gammaherpes viruses that also resort to chromosome-tethering for stable maintenance during prolonged periods of latent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref020">20</xref>]. It is possible that selfish genomes inhabiting evolutionarily distant hosts have independently converged on the common strategy of chromosome-coupled segregation as a means for self-preservation.</p>
<p>The plasmid amplification system, consisting of the plasmid-coded Flp site-specific recombinase and its target <italic>FRT</italic> sites arranged in head-to-head orientation within the plasmid genome, counteracts any reduction in copy number resulting from rare missegregation events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref022">22</xref>]. Amplification is thought to be triggered by a Flp-mediated recombination event coordinated with bi-directional plasmid replication—DNA inversion within a plasmid monomer or resolution within a plasmid dimer—that reconfigures the mode of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref023">23</xref>]. A second recombination event can restore normal fork movement, and terminate amplification. The amplified plasmid concatemer may be resolved into monomers by Flp or by the host’s homologous recombination machinery. Positive and negative transcriptional regulation of <italic>FLP</italic> by plasmid-coded proteins—the putative Rep1-Rep2 repressor and its antagonist Raf1—ensures a prompt amplification response when needed without causing a runaway increase in plasmid copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, self-imposed moderation of selfishness is an integral element in the survival strategy of the yeast plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref029">29</xref>]. Interestingly, Raf1 appears to play a dual role in plasmid physiology, contributing to both plasmid stability and copy number control. In addition to blocking the assembly of the Rep1-Rep2 repressor complex, Raf1 is involved in promoting the organization of the Rep1-Rep2-<italic>STB</italic> partitioning complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

<title>Amplification of the 2-micron plasmid by the action of the plasmid coded Flp site-specific recombinase may occur by more than one mechanism.</title>
<p>Three possible modes of plasmid amplification are illustrated in <bold>A</bold>-<bold>C</bold>. In <bold>A</bold>, site-specific recombination between the head-to-head Flp target sites (<italic>FRT</italic>s; thin arrows) of a replicating plasmid monomer sets up a pair of replication forks (thick arrowheads) that chase each other along the circular template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref021">21</xref>]. In <bold>B</bold>, site-specific recombination between two head-to-tail target sites in a replicating plasmid dimer generates two interconnected uni-directionally replicating circular monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref023">23</xref>]. In <bold>C</bold>, the double strand break arising from a Flp-induced single strand nick within an <italic>FRT</italic> site of a replicating plasmid triggers break induced replication (BIR) by strand invasion of a second plasmid circle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. The circular knob indicates Flp covalently linked to the 3’-phosphate terminus of the cleaved strand. The unifying feature in <bold>A</bold>-<bold>C</bold> is the establishment of non-terminating uni-directional replication of circular DNA molecules as a result of a successful (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) or an aborted (<bold>C</bold>) site-specific recombination event. Plasmid amplification by the schemes in <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> may be regulated by a second recombination event to restore replication termination. Amplification by the scheme in <bold>C</bold> is more difficult to regulate, and likely involves the resolution of branched DNA intermediates formed by the encounter between two BIR forks or between a BIR fork and a replication fork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref053">53</xref>] (see also the schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The post-translational protein modification machinery of the host also contributes to the regulation of 2-micron plasmid stability and copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. Impaired sumoylation of Rep1 and Rep2 interferes with their <italic>STB</italic>-association, and adversely affects plasmid segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref032">32</xref>]. Deficient SUMO conjugation to Flp raises its steady-state levels, leading to hyper-amplification of the plasmid. The resulting increase in plasmid load causes cell cycle delays and reduced replicative life-span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref035">35</xref>]. The 2-micron plasmid exemplifies the collaborative roles of self-regulation and host-mediated regulation in the coexistence of a selfish DNA element and its host genome with minimal mutual conflicts between them.</p>
<p>High plasmid copy number and attendant cell death phenotypes are produced by a variety of mutations in protein components associated with SUMO conjugation and deconjugation steps, and with ubiquitin-dependent degradation of sumoylated proteins. These mutations map to E3 ligases (<italic>siz1Δ</italic>, <italic>siz2Δ</italic>), the SUMO maturase/deconjugase (<italic>ulp1</italic> or <italic>nib1</italic>), a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (<italic>slx5Δ</italic>, <italic>slx8Δ</italic>) and certain NPC (nuclear pore complex) proteins required for normal cellular localization of Ulp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref038">38</xref>]. These mutants exhibit a marked differential killing effect on yeast strains harboring the 2-micron plasmid [Cir<sup>+</sup>] versus those lacking the plasmid [Cir<sup>0</sup>]. The misregulated amplification of plasmid DNA likely stems from enhanced single strand nicks at the plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> sites due to elevated Flp levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. Conversion of the nick into a double strand break by encountering an advancing replication fork can trigger strand invasion by the broken end into an intact circular plasmid, to be followed by break-induced replication (BIR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In principle, BIR in the circular template may persist through multiple rounds, producing large plasmid concatemers. BIR-mediated aberrant amplification is supported by the significant reduction in a high molecular weight DNA form of the plasmid in the absence of Pol32 or of Rad proteins required for known BIR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. The reaction is formally analogous to the alternative (telomerase-independent) pathway for lengthening of telomeres <italic>via</italic> telomere mini-circles as templates, which occurs in yeast, many transformed cell lines and in certain human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>We wished to address whether, in addition to lowering Flp levels, the SUMO modification of Flp may also modulate its DNA recognition and/or catalytic properties. To circumvent the technical challenges posed by the low level of the <italic>in vivo</italic> modification, we utilized a Flp-SUMO fusion protein in which SUMO residues 1–96 are joined in frame to the carboxyl-terminus of Flp. By demonstrating the nearly identical behavior Flp-SUMO and physiologically sumoylated Flp in a variety of <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental contexts, we validated the utility of the fusion protein in directly probing the effects of SUMO modification on the physicochemical interactions of Flp with the <italic>FRT</italic> site. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays using purified Flp and Flp-SUMO revealed that Flp-SUMO binds <italic>FRT</italic> less efficiently than Flp and with weaker cooperativity, and is preferentially excluded from <italic>FRT</italic> in the presence of Flp. Consequently, the fusion protein is less active in <italic>FRT</italic> x <italic>FRT</italic> recombination than Flp, and the lower activity is reflected in both the strand cleavage and strand joining steps of recombination. The <italic>in vitro</italic> results are corroborated by an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay for DNA damage induced by Flp and Flp-SUMO at <italic>FRT</italic> sites, consistent with the lower occupancy of these sites (or accelerated exit from them) by the fusion protein.</p>
<p>The present results, in conjunction with previously published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>], suggest a tripartite mechanism for the copy number control of the 2-micron plasmid involving gene expression, protein turnover and protein activity. The first is imposed by the plasmid itself, while the other two are instituted by the host. Collectively, they provide a paradigm for the bilateral interactions through which selfish DNA elements and their host organisms strike a fine balance between the fitness advantage gained by such an element from high copy number and the fitness cost incurred by the host—and thus indirectly by the element—from the extra genetic load.</p>

<title>Construction of yeast plasmids</title>
<p>The yeast plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) used for genetic assays were constructed by a strategy analogous to that described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref041">41</xref>]. The rationale is to generate two requisite linear DNA fragments <italic>in vitro</italic> by PCR amplification, and allow them to self-assemble the desired circular plasmid <italic>in vivo</italic> by homologous recombination/repair. Recombination is facilitated by overlapping sequences that these fragments carry at their ends. A suitable marker (<italic>ADE2</italic>) contained in one of the fragments permits the selection of plasmid-containing cells. We used a constant DNA fragment corresponding to the A-form of the plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref042">42</xref>] that included, in sequential order, the 2-micron plasmid <italic>RAF1</italic> gene, <italic>ADE2</italic> inserted into the plasmid HpaI site, <italic>STB</italic>, <italic>ORI</italic>, a copy of the inverted repeat, and the <italic>REP2</italic> gene. The other variable fragment included the <italic>REP1</italic> gene, the second copy of the inverted repeat, and the <italic>FLP</italic> gene with the incorporated modifications. Sequences adjoining <italic>REP1</italic> and <italic>RAF1</italic> provided homology at one end. Homology at the other end came from sequences adjacent to <italic>FLP</italic> and <italic>REP2</italic>. An equimolar mixture of the constant fragment with one of the variable fragments was used to transform an <italic>ade2</italic> [Cir<sup>0</sup>] yeast strain to adenine prototrophy. DNA samples isolated from a subset of the transformants were analyzed by PCR to identify those that contained the correct plasmid. Critical regions of the plasmid, including the modified <italic>FLP</italic> locus and the recombination junction regions, were further verified by DNA sequencing. Once a parental strain harboring the correct plasmid was established, subsequent transfer of the plasmid to other recipient strains was performed by transformation using isolated total DNA.</p>

<title>Engineering yeast chromosomes</title>
<p>Integration of exogenous DNA cassettes into a specific chromosome locale was accomplished by one of three methods based on homology-dependent double strand break repair: (1) using a linearized integrative plasmid cut within the region of homology, (2) using PCR-amplified DNA fragments with flanking homology, or (3) using the CRISPR (Cas9-sgRNA) technology. The first two methods required selection of a marker included in the incoming/editing DNA; no selection was required for the third method. All constructs were authenticated by DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>Analyses of colony morphology and plasmid loss</title>
<p>Overnight cultures were prepared from purified single transformant colonies containing individual 2-micron circle-derived plasmids by growing them selectively (in medium lacking adenine) at 30°C. These cultures were diluted in YEPD medium (n = 0; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml) and grown for 10 generations (n = 10) at 30°C. Aliquots were plated out from n = 0 and n = 10 cultures on YEPD medium. Nibbled and mini-colonies were counted after incubating the plates for 5 days at 26°C. A founder cell that had lost the plasmid, and the plasmid-borne <italic>ADE2</italic> marker, gave rise to a fully red (non-sectored) smooth colony. Such colonies were excluded from the total population in calculating the fraction of nibbled colonies. Plasmid loss rate per generation ‘I’ (for instability) was estimated from plates incubated at 30°C based on fully red and total colony counts. I = (1/10) x [ln (f<sub>0</sub>/f<sub>10</sub>)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref046">46</xref>], where f<sub>0</sub> and f<sub>10</sub> are the fractions of plasmid containing cells (yielding colonies other than the fully red ones) at n = 0 and n = 10, respectively. The sample size for the individual estimates of plasmid loss rate and the fraction of nibbled or mini-colonies was a minimum of 800 colonies.

Image analysis and quantitation of band intensities were performed using the software Quantity One (Bio-Rad; version 4.5.1). For recombination, strand cleavage and strand joining assays, the extent of reaction was estimated as the ratio of the intensity of product band(s) to the sum of the intensities of substrate and product bands. For DNA binding, the ratios of the bound C-I and C-II complexes to the sum of C-I, C-II and unbound DNA were determined. Protein bands were quantitated against actin as the internal control.

<title>Substitution of Flp-SUMO fusion for Flp suppresses Flp-induced cell lethality in a <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain</title>
<p>Impairment in the regulation of Flp-mediated amplification leads to high 2-micron plasmid copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref052">52</xref>], which induces characteristic nibbling at colony edges. This phenotype, which is more conspicuous at 20°C than at 30°C, is due to differences in plasmid copy number in individual cell lineages, resulting in variable growth inhibition and cell mortality among them. Loss of plasmid restores normal growth and smooth edges. Over time, plasmid-free [Cir<sup>0</sup>] cells tend to rise in the population. Thus, colony morphology and plasmid loss rates are reliable reporters of the mean plasmid load carried by cells, and indirectly of the Flp level/activity in them.</p>
<p>The steady-state level of sumoylated Flp in a wild type strain is ~10% of total Flp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>]. The predominant site of SUMO conjugation, mediated by Siz1 and Siz2, is Lys-375 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>] located &lt; 50 amino acids upstream of the carboxyl-terminus (Ile-423). Replacement of Lys-375 by arginine partially recapitulates the effects of <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> in a wild type background, yielding ~4-fold increase in Flp, ~2-fold higher plasmid copy number, and consistently more abnormal colonies on plates incubated at 20°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>]. Given the relative proximity of Lys-375 and Ile-423, we suspected that Flp containing the SUMO moiety (amino acids 1–96) as a carboxyl-terminal extension is likely to functionally mimic Flp(K375-SUMO). If so, Flp-SUMO may justifiably be utilized as a surrogate for Flp(K375-SUMO) in addressing potential differences between native and modified Flp in their relative stability <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as their DNA recognition and catalytic properties <italic>in vivo</italic> and/or <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is nearly impossible to study exclusively the naturally sumoylated Flp in a cell, as it would be diluted out by the excess unmodified version. In addition, the extent of the modification (~10%) makes it technically quite challenging to obtain sufficient quantities of Flp(K375-SUMO) for <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses.</p>
<p>In order to test whether Flp-SUMO can redress the effects of <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> on colony morphology, we transformed [Cir<sup>0</sup>] strains with 2-micron plasmid derivatives engineered to express Flp or Flp-SUMO under the control of the native <italic>FLP</italic>-promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Except for manipulations of the <italic>FLP</italic> locus and an insertion of the <italic>ADE2</italic> marker, the reporter plasmids retained the overall organization of the native 2-micron plasmid genome. Note that the expressed Flp, Flp-SUMO and their variants contained the HA-His8 epitope tag at their carboxyl-termini. For simplicity, these proteins as well as the plasmids expressing them are referred to without mentioning the tag.</p>
<p>The large fraction of nibbled colonies (&gt; 75% at 26°C) in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain containing p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp was substantially reduced (~1%) when the strain harbored p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s007">S3 Table</xref>). The enlarged images of colonies shown above <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s007">S3 Table</xref> highlight the difference between smooth and nibbled edges. The frequency of mini-colonies in the population, signifying highly retarded cell growth or extensive cell death, also showed a corresponding reduction (from ~18% to ~3%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s007">S3 Table</xref>). The nibbled- and mini-colony phenotypes were consistent with a ~5-fold increase in the mean copy number of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp in <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). For comparison, the increase in the native 2-micron plasmid copy number in the mutant strain was ~10-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). As Flp-SUMO is recombination-competent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), the lack of nibbling in <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> harboring p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO was not due to Flp-SUMO being inactive in generating <italic>FRT</italic>-nicks, which are intermediates in the recombination reaction (and potential initiators of BIR).</p>

The variant is inactive in recombination. The presence of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L), contrary to expectation, produced few nibbled (1–2%) or mini-colonies (~3%) either in the wild type or in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain at 26°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s007">S3 Table</xref>). Presumably, sumoylation of Flp(H305L) at Lys-375 in the wild type strain was sufficient to suppress excessive <italic>FRT</italic>-nicking. The lack of nibbling even in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain was likely due to high p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L) missegregation, signified by the relative abundance of red (<italic>ade2</italic>) and red-sectored colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) (see also plasmid loss rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). As a result, mother cultures (n = 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2</xref>) would be enriched in cells with low copy numbers of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO as well as plasmid-free cells capable of resuming growth when provided with adenine. Such cells would be further enriched during non-selective growth (from n = 0 to n = 10) due to their fitness advantage. In fact, overexpression of Flp(H305L) in [Cir<sup>+</sup>] cells is a convenient method for rapidly curing them of the endogenous 2-micron plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>In sum, the aberrant cell growth typical of under-sumoylation of Flp is alleviated by the expression of Flp-SUMO from the native <italic>FLP</italic>-promoter. The lack of anticipated nibbling in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain from Flp(H305L) expression is the result of the high rate of plasmid loss induced by this Flp variant.</p>

<p>The p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp plasmid showed a significantly higher loss rate in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; left pair of histograms). By contrast, there was a modest improvement in the stability of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO in the mutant compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; middle pair of histograms). The lower basal stability of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO than p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp in the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; green histograms of the left and middle pairs) might result from the larger size of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO, the particular modification of the <italic>FLP</italic> locus, or from potential additional sumoylation at Lys-375 (which would be ameliorated by <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic>). Consistent with the expected increase in steady state DNA damage at <italic>FRT</italic> and the attendant plasmid hyper-amplification, p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L) was more unstable than p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp in the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; green histograms of the left and right pairs). The instability of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L) was worsened by <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; right pair of histograms), suggesting that Flp(H305L), analogous to Flp, is also downregulated via sumoylation.</p>
<p>The comparable loss rates of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L) and p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp in the wild type and the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strains, respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; orange histogram of the left pair and green histogram of the right pair) might appear to suggest that normal sumoylation of Flp(H305L) and strongly reduced sumoylation of Flp are more or less equivalent with respect to the amount of strand nicks that the two proteins produce at <italic>FRT</italic>. However, unlike Flp, Flp(H305L) cannot resolve an amplified plasmid concatemer by recombination, nor can it counter plasmid missegregation by recombination-mediated amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). These factors may aggravate the instability of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L) in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain.</p>
<p>The plasmid stability results demonstrate that the increased formation and expansion of plasmid-free cells triggered by <italic>FRT</italic>-nicks in a <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> host is strongly suppressed when this strain expresses Flp-SUMO instead of Flp or Flp(H305L).</p>

Consistent with the mechanism diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, the formation of amplified high molecular weight plasmid DNA is dependent on strand cleavage by Flp, and requires Pol32 as well as Rad proteins involved in BIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. The initial D-loop intermediate of BIR formed by strand invasion of homologous DNA may be processed into a replication fork. Alternatively, it may mature into a Holliday junction by convergence with a replication fork from the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; left). The coalescence of two D-loops expanding in opposite directions would generate a double Holliday junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; right). The organization of the two <italic>FRT</italic> sites and the location of the bi-directional replication origin within the 2-micron plasmid provide opportunities for a Flp-mediated BIR D-loop to meet a replication fork, or a second such D-loop, approaching it head-on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As the Flp-induced single strand nicks may occur at one or both of the plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> sites, and on either DNA strand within a site, head-to-tail configuration of two D-loops or a D-loop and a replication fork is also possible.

<p>The resolution of specialized DNA structures such as Holliday junctions and D-loops in yeast require Yen1 and/or Mus81-Mms4 activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref053">53</xref>]. Induction of Flp(H305L) in a strain containing an <italic>FRT</italic> site inserted between two strong replication origins in a chromosome results in poor viability in the <italic>yen1Δ mus81Δ</italic> background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref053">53</xref>]. We utilized isogenic [Cir<sup>0</sup>] and [Cir<sup>+</sup>] strains harboring an identical chromosomal insertion of <italic>FRT</italic> to test whether the presence of additional copies of plasmid-borne <italic>FRT</italic> sites would aggravate the Flp(H305L)—<italic>yen1Δ</italic> or the Flp(H305L)-<italic>mus81Δ</italic> effect, and whether cell survival can be improved by replacing Flp(H305L) by Flp(H305L)-SUMO.</p>
<p>In the [Cir<sup>0</sup>] strain, <italic>mus81Δ</italic> caused a decrease in colony forming units upon Flp(H305L) induction, with <italic>yen1Δ</italic> and <italic>yen1Δ mus81Δ</italic> displaying a stronger effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The loss of viable colonies from each single mutation as well as the double mutation was magnified in the [Cir<sup>+</sup>] strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Expression of Flp(H305L)-SUMO in place of Flp(H305L) restored cell survival in the single mutants to nearly the same level as in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The palliative response to Flp(H305L)-SUMO, though not as strong, was evident in the double mutant as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of Mus81 or Yen1 or both, the branched intermediates of Flp(H305L)-induced BIR (three or four-way DNA junctions) appear to accumulate, to the detriment of the cell. The apparent reduction of these intermediates in the presence of Flp(H305L)-SUMO is consistent with an abatement in the formation of unsealed strand nicks at <italic>FRT</italic> that precedes the BIR events. Furthermore, these results corroborate the previous inference that the DNA damage induced by Flp(H305L) at plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> sites may be masked by accelerated plasmid loss from cells.</p>

<title>The p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO plasmid causes cell lethality, and is destabilized, in the absence of Slx5 or Slx8</title>
<p>The Slx5-Slx8 STUbL (sumo targeted ubiquitin ligase) regulates a wide range of cellular functions in yeast that include gene expression, quality control of nuclear proteins, DNA damage repair, and chromosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref062">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref066">66</xref>]. The coupling to ubiquitin-proteasome systems <italic>via</italic> Slx5-Slx8-mediated recognition of conjugated SUMO, or native surface features that mimic SUMO, may bring about not only the degradation of particular target proteins but also the functional re-localization of multi-subunit protein machines. Examples include proteolysis of the Mot1 transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref067">67</xref>] or the Matα2 repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref068">68</xref>], and the relocation of double strand DNA breaks in G1 cells to repair centers stationed at the nuclear periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref069">69</xref>]. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of sumoylated Flp appears to be one important mechanism for the post-translational regulation of Flp. The levels of Flp, including its SUMO-conjugated form, are increased in <italic>slx5Δ</italic> and <italic>slx8Δ</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>].

<p>The loss of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO was more rapid in the <italic>slx5Δ</italic> and <italic>slx8Δ</italic> strains than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) or the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) strains. The <italic>slx5Δ</italic> or <italic>slx8Δ</italic> mutation caused instability of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), the plasmid loss rates being comparable to that in the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>A key point underscored by these findings is that both <italic>slx5Δ</italic> and <italic>slx8Δ</italic>, but not <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic>, display the phenotypes of aberrant p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO amplification (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g004">4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s007">S3 Table</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>slx8Δ</italic> phenocopies <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> closely when they contain p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g004">4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s007">S3 Table</xref>). The trend is similar for <italic>slx5Δ</italic> albeit less striking than <italic>slx8Δ</italic>. Some of the quantitative differences among individual mutants may be reconciled by the involvement of the ubiquitin and SUMO pathways in the pleiotropic regulation of a variety of cellular processes.</p>
<p>The phenotypic responses of the mutants to p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp or p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO suggest that normal regulation of Flp requires sumoylated Flp to be ubiquitinated and channeled to the proteasome for degradation. Furthermore, SUMO conjugated physiologically by Siz1-Siz2 (principally to Lys-375) within Flp and SUMO attached artificially to the Flp carboxyl-terminus are functionally interchangeable in recognition by the Slx5-Slx8 STUbL. As a result, Flp becomes deleterious in <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic>, <italic>slx5Δ</italic> and <italic>slx8Δ</italic>; Flp-SUMO is harmful only in the latter two. Corroborating these interpretations, the half-life of Flp-SUMO was higher in <italic>slx5Δ</italic> compared to that in the wild type or the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> mutant, while Flp-SUMO degradation was almost completely blocked by <italic>slx8Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). The turnover of Flp-SUMO in the wild type and <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> was suppressed by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Flp-SUMO has weaker recombinase activity than Flp <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In principle, sumoylation may not only control the steady state levels of Flp <italic>in vivo</italic> but may also modulate its recognition of the <italic>FRT</italic> site and/or its active site functions.

In order to probe the effects of sumoylation on Flp activities, we utilized <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using purified Flp and Flp-SUMO. Based on their very similar <italic>in vivo</italic> responses to multiple mutations in the SUMO/ubiquitin pathways, Flp-SUMO is presumed to be an authentic substitute for Flp(K375-SUMO) <italic>in vitro</italic> as well. This premise is also supported by structural considerations.

<p>In a time-course deletion reaction between two head-to-tail <italic>FRT</italic> sites, Flp-SUMO was approximately 60% as active as Flp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>).

<title>Flp has higher <italic>FRT</italic> binding efficiency and binding cooperativity than Flp-SUMO</title>

Stepwise association of individual Flp monomers to the two binding elements (arrows oriented head-to-head) of an <italic>FRT</italic> site is diagrammed schematically at the top. The binding reactions contained 0.05 pmol of the DNA containing one <italic>FRT</italic> site (labeled as ‘S’), equivalent to 0.1 pmol Flp-binding element, and the indicated amounts of Flp or Flp-SUMO. The binding mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min, and the unbound and bound DNA were fractionated by electrophoresis in native 5% polyacrylamide gels. The DNA-protein complexes corresponding to the occupancy of one binding element and both binding elements are called C-I and C-II, respectively. The subscripts ‘F’ and ‘FS’ refer to Flp and Flp-SUMO, respectively.</p>

<p>The disparity in <italic>FRT</italic> binding and cooperativity between Flp and Flp-SUMO was also highlighted by binding reactions containing a mixture of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Even at 1:3 molar ratio, Flp surpassed Flp-SUMO in <italic>FRT</italic> occupancy, as indicated by the strong reduction of the C-II complex formed by Flp-SUMO and the appearance of the Flp C-I and C-II complexes (lane 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). At this ratio, the C-I complexes formed by the two proteins were roughly equal. The plot of C-I ratios underestimates the advantage of Flp over Flp-SUMO in <italic>FRT</italic> binding as it does not capture the much stronger cooperativity of Flp in C-I → C-II conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). The band corresponding to the heterodimeric C-II complex, expected to migrate just above the Flp C-II complex, was not well resolved from it. At equimolar or higher Flp to Flp-SUMO ratios (lanes 4–6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), the C-I and C-II complexes were predominantly the Flp-bound forms.</p>
<p>Extrapolation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding results to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation suggests that sumoylation of Flp would diminish its binding to the 2-micron plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> sites. In addition, or conversely, sumoylation of <italic>FRT</italic>-bound Flp might accelerate the dissociation of the modified protein from DNA. Either or both of these mechanisms would provide a safeguard against potentially detrimental strand cleavage events at <italic>FRT</italic>.</p>

<title>Flp-SUMO is attenuated in strand cleavage</title>
<p>The strongly conserved catalytic hexad cluster of the tyrosine site-specific recombinase family (to which Flp belongs), including the invariant tyrosine nucleophile, is represented in Flp by Arg-191, Lys-223, His-305, Arg-308, Trp-330 and Tyr-343. In the shared active site for strand cleavage, Tyr-343 from one Flp monomer is donated to the pro-active site of the second neighboring Flp monomer, which provides the other five catalytic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref059">59</xref>]. Strand joining in the cleaved intermediate, harboring a 3’-O-phosphotyrosyl bond, is promoted by one Flp monomer utilizing the 5’-hydroxyl group from DNA as the nucleophile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref071">71</xref>]. In order to appraise whether sumoylation affects the chemical competence of the Flp active site, we assayed Flp and Flp-SUMO in strand cleavage and strand joining reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Reactions were performed using half-site substrates containing a single Flp binding element and one scissile phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref074">74</xref>]. Interactions between two Flp monomers, each bound to a half-site, permits the assembly of the shared active site required for strand cleavage by the Tyr-343 nucleophile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref050">50</xref>]. The half-sites are suitably configured, as described below, to avoid interference from the joining reaction during cleavage assays and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p>
<p>In the strand cleavage substrate, the scissile phosphate is followed by a truncated 3 nt segment from the strand exchange region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The full 8 nt complement of the exchange region in the opposite strand ends in 5’-phosphate, which prevents strand joining by a hydroxyl group at this position. Furthermore, diffusion of the unstably hydrogen bonded trinucleotide product of cleavage away from the reaction center minimizes cleavage reversal.</p>

The 5’-<sup>32</sup>P label on the strand containing ‘P’ is shown by the asterisk. The 5’-hydroxyl group on the complementary strand is blocked by phosphorylation. Each reaction, containing 0.05 pmol half-site plus the indicated amounts of Flp or Flp-SUMO, was incubated for 30 min at 30°C, and was analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The cleavage products formed by Flp and Flp-SUMO are labeled as CP<sub>F</sub> and CP<sub>FS</sub>, respectively. In the plots of the product yields from three separate experiments with each protein, the results with native Flp (lacking the HA-His8 tag) are also included. <bold>B</bold>. In the schematic diagram of the strand joining substrate (5’-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled; asterisk), the tyrosyl group attached to the scissile phosphate mimics the strand-cleaved recombination intermediate. The free 5’-hydroxyl group on the non-radioactive strand attacks the phosphotyrosyl bond in a ‘pseudo-joining’ reaction to give a hairpin product. The reactions were performed under the conditions employed for cleavage, and were analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The hairpin products formed by Flp and Flp-SUMO are identical, and are labeled as ‘HP’.</p>

<p>In the strand joining substrate, the scissile phosphate is covalently linked to a tyrosyl moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) to mimic the phosphotyrosyl bridge between Flp and DNA formed during strand cleavage. The hairpin product of the joining reaction is refractory to cleavage, as it cannot support the Flp-Flp interactions required for active site assembly in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>
<p>Flp-SUMO was less active than Flp in strand cleavage as well as strand joining. The half-maximal reaction required a ~3-fold higher amount of Flp-SUMO for both steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). Flp-SUMO did catch up with Flp in its V<sub>max</sub> for joining, and required a ~3-fold higher protein amount. However, at a ~5-fold higher amount, Flp-SUMO was close to (but still below) saturation cleavage by Flp. Thus, the SUMO attachment reduces the catalytic activity of Flp, the adverse effect on strand cleavage being stronger than that on strand joining.</p>
<p>Collectively, the binding and activity assays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">8</xref>) suggest that the differences in the catalytic efficiencies of Flp and Flp-SUMO can be accounted for primarily by reduced <italic>FRT</italic> binding affinity and cooperativity imposed by the modification, perhaps with some impairment of active site function in addition. The latter possibility was tested more directly by strand cleavage complementation and strand joining assays using cleavage-incompetent Flp mutants (described below).</p>

<title>Flp-SUMO is less competent than Flp in the phosphate activation step of strand cleavage, but not so in the tyrosine donation step</title>
<p>The two steps of single strand exchange during Flp recombination involves the assembly of the shared cleavage pocket (and <italic>trans</italic>-donation of Tyr-343) within individual <italic>FRT</italic> sites or between synapsed partner <italic>FRT</italic> sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref059">59</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9A</xref>).

For example, Flp(Y343F) bound to a half-<italic>FRT</italic> site can activate its scissile phosphate, which may then be cleaved by Tyr-343 from Flp(R191A) bound to a second half-<italic>FRT</italic> site. The individual mutants themselves are inactive in cleavage. We took advantage of catalytically complementing Flp and Flp-SUMO partners to ask whether Flp-SUMO is affected in the phosphate activation step or in the tyrosine donation step of strand cleavage.</p>

<title>Flp-SUMO is attenuated at the phosphate activation step of strand cleavage but not at the Tyr-343 nucleophile donation step.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>. Strand cleavage complementation by neighboring Flp monomers is schematically illustrated in the context of the recombination synapse. The four Flp monomers bound to the synapsed <italic>FRT</italic> sites assemble two active sites for strand cleavage at a time. Two monomers activate the scissile phosphates (green dots), to be cleaved by Tyr-343 nucleophiles received from the other two monomers. The scissile phosphates refractory to cleavage are shown as red dots. The Holliday junction formed by the first strand cleavage/exchange step isomerizes to switch the Tyr-343 donors to recipients and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The ensuing second strand cleavage/exchange step completes recombination. The <italic>FRT</italic> sites are oriented by marking them left (L) to right (R). <bold>B</bold>. The schematic diagram at the top shows the delivery of Tyr-343 from Flp(R191A) to cleave the half-site bound by Flp(Y343F). The indicated proteins were pre-bound separately to the 5’-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled half-site substrate (S), and mixed together to assay cleavage. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">Fig 8</xref>. The cleavage product formed by Flp(R191A) and Flp(R191A)-SUMO are indicated as CP<sub>F</sub> and CP<sub>FS</sub>, respectively. The normalized cleavage yields from three separate assays are plotted as histograms with the output from the Flp(R191A)-Flp(Y343F) reaction as 1.0 <bold>C</bold>. The strand joining reaction in a half-site mediated by a bound Flp(Y343F) monomer is schematically diagrammed at top. The presence of a half-site bound by Flp(R191A) may potentially modulate the joining efficiency of Flp(Y343F) via monomer-monomer interactions. Flp(R191A) itself has no joining activity. The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled half-site was bound separately by the mutants, and then mixed. The hairpin product (HP) and the unreacted substrate (S) were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In the histogram plots representing three independent assays, the strand joining efficiency is normalized against a value of 1.0 for the Flp(Y343F) reaction containing Flp(R191A).</p>

<p>The reactions were done by pre-binding the 5’-end labelled half-site separately with each one of a pair of complementing mutants, and mixing them in the presence of an excess unlabeled <italic>FRT</italic> to soak up unbound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). With Flp(R191A) as the tyrosine donor, the cleavage output was higher (~1.6-fold) with Flp(Y343F) than with Flp(Y343F)-SUMO as its partner (lanes 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). A similar difference in cleavage (~1.5-fold) was noted between Flp(Y343F) and Flp(Y343F)-SUMO when the tyrosine donor was Flp(R191A)-SUMO (lanes 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Flp(R191A)-SUMO was fully competent at tyrosine donation, yielding better cleavage than Flp(R191A) when partnered with Flp(Y343F) (~1.5-fold higher; lanes 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) or with Flp(Y343F)-SUMO (~1.6-fold higher; lanes 2 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). The relative cleavage efficiencies are shown as histogram plots with a value of 1.0 assigned for the Flp(R191A)-Flp(Y343F) pair.</p>
<p>Thus, SUMO attachment to Flp diminishes its ability to activate an adjacent scissile phosphate, and consequently causes a decrease in the probability of its cleavage. However, Flp-SUMO is more active in Tyr-343 donation for cleavage of an activated scissile phosphate. The two opposing effects would more or less cancel out. Taken together, <italic>FRT</italic> binding, <italic>FRT</italic> cleavage and cleavage complementation data suggest that weakening the cleavage potential <italic>per se</italic> of Flp by sumoylation is unlikely to play a significant role in protecting <italic>FRT</italic> against strand nicks <italic>in vivo</italic>. More prominent is the reduced <italic>FRT</italic> binding affinity and cooperativity resulting from the modification. Note that these effects would have been minimized in the complementation assays, as they utilized pre-bound half-sites.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Flp and Flp-SUMO are equally efficient in the strand joining step</title>
<p>The strand joining reaction, executed by a single Flp monomer, does not require the active site Tyr-343 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref075">75</xref>]. Flp and Flp(Y343F) are equally efficient in this reaction. We tested strand joining in half-site substrates pre-bound by Flp(Y343F) or Flp(Y343F)-SUMO, thereby avoiding the obfuscating effects on DNA binding.</p>
<p>A half-site bound by the Y343F mutant was mixed with one bound by the R191A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), exactly as in cleavage complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). As the mutant pair may engage in the interactions responsible for the assembly of the shared active site, the native conditions under which joining occurs are recapitulated. Furthermore, this experimental design makes it possible to test whether the joining activity of a given Y343F mutant protein is differentially affected by whether the partner R191A mutant contains SUMO or not.</p>
<p>Flp(Y343F) and Flp(Y343F)-SUMO gave equal amounts of the hairpin product when the reaction also contained the Flp(R191A)-bound half-site (lanes 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) or the half-site bound by Flp(R191A)-SUMO (lanes 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). The histogram plots show the relative joining efficiencies for each protein pair normalized against a value of 1.0 for Flp(Y343F) in the presence of Flp(R191A).</p>
<p>Comparable joining activities of native Flp and Flp-SUMO would suggest that enhanced strand joining (or cleavage reversal) by SUMO-modified Flp is probably not a contributing factor in lowering the steady state levels of <italic>FRT</italic> nicks <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Fewer strand nicks at plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> sites by Flp-SUMO compared to Flp in <italic>siz1Δ siz2 Δ</italic> cells are consistent with lower Flp-SUMO occupancy of these sites</title>
<p>The 2-micron plasmid molecules are organized <italic>in vivo</italic> into nucleosome-beaded mini-chromatin circles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref076">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref078">78</xref>].

DNase I sensitivity assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref079">79</xref>] suggest that <italic>FRT</italic> sites in the 2-micron plasmid are relatively nucleosome-free. In order to verify that the <italic>in vitro</italic> differences between Flp and Flp-SUMO are valid <italic>in vivo</italic>, we estimated the amount of strand nicks at <italic>FRT</italic> elicited by a relatively brief but sustained burst of induction of each protein in a cell biological assay. This assay, though indirect, avoids potential problems in quantitating <italic>FRT</italic> nicks by alkaline gel electrophoresis posed by variabilities in the extraction of DNA covalently linked to Flp.</p>
<p>The experimental [Cir<sup>0</sup>] strains, expressing <italic>RAD52</italic>-YFP, contained the p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp plasmid, which has two <italic>FRT</italic> sites per molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and a copy number similar to that of the 2-micron plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Flp or Flp-SUMO was expressed in this strain from the same chromosome locale (<italic>TRP1</italic>; Chromosome IV) under <italic>GAL</italic> promoter control. The small background level of Flp expressed by its native promoter from p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp does not interfere with the assay, as it would be swamped out by the galactose-induced levels of Flp or Flp-SUMO. Strand nicks formed at <italic>FRT</italic> were visualized indirectly as Rad52-YFP foci associated with the double strand breaks that such nicks give rise to upon DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref080">80</xref>].</p>
<p>In the wild type strain, the percentage of cells containing Rad52-YFP foci were low (~6% or lower; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>) with or without induction of Flp or Flp-SUMO. The foci in uninduced (glucose- grown) cells represent background DNA damage plus any damage at plasmid <italic>FRT</italic> sites due to Flp expressed from p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp. The percentage of foci-containing cells was higher in the glucose-grown <italic>siz1Δ</italic> siz2<italic>Δ</italic> strain, (~12 to ~18%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>). Presumably, this increase signifies general DNA repair deficiency caused by the mutations combined with increased <italic>FRT</italic> strand nicks due to deficient sumoylation of the plasmid-expressed Flp. Induction of Flp by galactose raised the fraction of foci-containing cells from ~18% to ~29% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), signifying a further increase in the frequency of strand nicks at <italic>FRT</italic>. By contrast, there was no such increase upon similar induction of Flp-SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g010">Fig 10B</xref>).

In a strain lacking galactose inducible Flp or Flp-SUMO, but containing the p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp plasmid, the fractions of Rad52 foci containing cells were not significantly different in glucose- versus galactose-grown <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g010">Fig 10C</xref>).

<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses of a Flp-SUMO fusion protein presented here broaden our current understanding of Flp regulation, and provide a comprehensive model for the copy number control of the 2-micron plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11A–11D</xref>). Transcriptional regulation of the <italic>FLP</italic> gene and turnover of post-translationally modified Flp protein balance, at the primary level, the readiness for normal plasmid amplification against the potential risk of aberrant amplification. A secondary layer of fine-tuning to this control is provided through the modulation of target DNA recognition by the modified Flp and of its cooperativity in the context of a dimer required for strand cleavage and a tetramer required for recombination. The model, further elaborated below, has general implications for the mechanisms by which extra-chromosomal selfish DNA elements ensure their evolutionary success by refraining from overburdening their hosts’ metabolic potential.</p>

<p>As the equal segregation efficiency of the 2-micron plasmid is high, the need for plasmid amplification would be quite infrequent at steady state growth conditions. Indeed, analogous to chromosomes, nearly all of the plasmid molecules in a cell population replicate once, and only once, per cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref081">81</xref>]. We do not understand the details of how the negative control of <italic>FLP</italic> expression or of Flp activity is relieved in a cell with a deficit in plasmid copy number caused by missegregation, when this low probability event does occur. The reduced Rep1-Rep2 repressor levels determined by the expression of <italic>REP1</italic> in proportion to plasmid copy number (Rep1 + Rep2 ⇄ [Rep1-Rep2]), together with Raf1-mediated antagonism of the repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref027">27</xref>] under this condition, may provide the solution—at least in part. In principle, the increased output of Flp may outpace the post-translational modification system at the level of SUMO conjugation to Flp and/or of SUMO recycling among modified and unmodified Flp molecules. Needless to say that the opposing controls of repression/inactivation versus induction/activation will have to be tightly coordinated in order for Flp to perform its physiological function optimally.</p>

<title>Flp-SUMO is an authentic substitute for Flp(K375-SUMO)</title>
<p>An important advantage of Flp-SUMO is that it permits direct comparison with unmodified Flp in the DNA binding and cleavage properties of the two purified proteins. We have not utilized <italic>in vitro</italic> SUMO conjugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref082">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref083">83</xref>] to Flp because of uncertainties in the extent of modification and the potential for conjugation at semi-consensus or non-consensus lysine residues. Structural considerations suggest that the folded SUMO domain linked to Lys-375 or to Ile-423 would be spaced approximately equally from the body of Flp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s008">S4 Table</xref>). Furthermore, Flp-SUMO mirrors Flp(Lys-375-SUMO) <italic>in vivo</italic> in that both require Slx5-Slx8 for their normal regulation, while Siz1-Siz2 can be bypassed in the case of Flp-SUMO but not Flp. Equally compelling is the concordance between the reduced <italic>in vitro FRT</italic> binding/cleavage by Flp-SUMO (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g008">8</xref>) and the inferred extents of <italic>in vivo FRT</italic> DNA damage effected by unmodified Flp versus natively modified Flp or Flp-SUMO (Flp &gt;&gt; Flp-SUMO in <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> and Flp(K375-SUMO) = Flp-SUMO in wild type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Extrapolating the interpretations from Flp-SUMO to Flp(K375-SUMO) is therefore justified on multiple grounds.</p>

<title>Flp-SUMO mimics Flp(K375-SUMO) in blocking BIR-induced hyper-amplification of the 2-micron plasmid</title>
<p>The adverse physiological effects of gross undersumoylation of Flp (<italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic>)—retarded growth, premature cell death and increased plasmid loss—are consistent with BIR-induced hyper-amplification of <italic>FRT</italic>-containing plasmids. These phenotypes are strongly ameliorated by switching from Flp to Flp-SUMO expression. According to prior genetic and biochemical work, BIR is triggered by Flp-mediated strand nicks at <italic>FRT</italic> in conjunction with plasmid replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. Mutations in BIR pathways suppress unregulated plasmid amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. High rates of plasmid loss may occasionally mask the typical BIR phenotypes—as was observed with the hyper-cleaving variant Flp(H305L)—because of the growth advantage of plasmid-cured cells. However, induction of Flp(H305L) leads to cell death when resolution of the branched DNA intermediates of BIR is impaired by <italic>yen1Δ</italic>, <italic>mus81Δ</italic> or <italic>yen1Δ mus81Δ</italic>. Cell killing by Flp(H305L), which correlates with <italic>FRT</italic> copy number, is strongly curbed when these mutants express Flp(H305L)-SUMO instead. The salvaging effects of SUMO fusion to Flp are dependent on the Slx5-Slx8 STUbL, suggesting that SUMO modification of Flp is followed by ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11B</xref>). The half-lives of Flp-SUMO in the wild type and mutant strains, and in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, are consistent with this scenario. Natively sumoylated Flp has also been shown to be regulated by Slx5-Slx8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. The cumulative results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for SUMO recognition in Flp(K375-SUMO) and downstream processing are shared by Flp-SUMO as well.</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>Normal SUMO conjugation and artificial SUMO fusion exert similar biological effects despite the stoichiometric difference in modification</title>
<p>There are precedents for SUMO and ubiquitin fusion proteins satisfying the functional roles of their naturally modified counterparts. Examples in yeast include the recombination protein Rad52 as well as transcriptional regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref084">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref087">87</xref>]. The properties of Flp-SUMO revealed in our studies <italic>vis a vis</italic> the <italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic> and <italic>slx5Δ</italic> or <italic>slx8Δ</italic> host strains are in general conformity with the behavior of other biologically active SUMO fusion proteins.</p>
<p>While sumoylation may signal protein degradation in certain instances, it may act as a safeguard against degradation in others. The opposing functions may be reconciled if the SUMO-acceptor lysine is also the target for ubiquitination by an STUbL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref088">88</xref>]. In one case, the addition of ubiquitin may occur in concert with the removal of SUMO by Ulp1. In the other, the pre-existing SUMO may sterically block the action of a ubiquitin ligase. The apparent deregulation of Flp by interfering with either SUMO conjugation (<italic>siz1Δ siz2Δ</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>] or deconjugation (<italic>ulp1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref034">34</xref>] would fit into the first model. It is not known whether Lys-375 of Flp is the site for both sumoylation and ubiquitination under native conditions. If it is, the functional similarity between Flp and Flp-SUMO suggests that SUMO can activate Slx5-Slx8 in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic> during ubiquitination.</p>
<p>In spite of the large difference in stoichiometry between SUMO conjugation at Lys-375 (~10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>] and SUMO fusion at Ile-423 (100%), the modifications are nearly indistinguishable in their biological roles. Dynamic modification of Lys-375 by deconjugation and reutilization of the SUMO moiety, targeted modification of <italic>FRT</italic>-bound Flp or selective exclusion of modified Flp from <italic>FRT</italic> may overcome the limitations of substoichiometric modification. Deregulation of Flp by <italic>ulp1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref034">34</xref>] would be consistent with the dynamic nature of SUMO conjugated to Lys-375. These general principles—the catalytic nature of the modification, its compartmentalization, and/or its dominance in dimeric or oligomeric protein assemblies—may explain similar biological effects produced by substoichiometric modification of native proteins and stoichiometric modification of the corresponding engineered fusion proteins.</p>

<title>SUMO conjugation lowers <italic>FRT</italic>-association and <italic>FRT</italic>-cleavage by Flp</title>
<p>As revealed by <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses, Flp-SUMO has weaker affinity for <italic>FRT</italic> than Flp, and is less cooperative in <italic>FRT</italic>-binding. Furthermore, the underrepresentation of <italic>FRT</italic>-bound Flp-SUMO in binding reactions with mixtures of Flp and Flp-SUMO suggests negative cooperativity between the two. As strand cleavage requires the collaboration of two Flp monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref059">59</xref>], the <italic>in vivo</italic> implications of negative cooperativity are significant in the context of a single <italic>FRT</italic> site or a pair of synapsed <italic>FRT</italic> sites. The reduced association or enhanced dissociation of a sumoylated Flp monomer would protect <italic>FRT</italic> from strand cleavage, and the potential initiation of BIR, even if it were stably bound by an unmodified Flp monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11C</xref>). Similar dissociation within four recombinase monomers bound to a pair of synapsed <italic>FRT</italic> sites would cause these sites to disengage from each other. Normal plasmid amplification by Flp-mediated reconfiguration of replication forks can thus be regulated as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11D</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several examples for the modulation of the DNA binding affinity of proteins by SUMO or ubiquitin conjugation, in particular proteins associated with DNA damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref089">89</xref>]. The modification promotes protein dissociation from DNA in most instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref090">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref095">95</xref>], although the reverse trend has also been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref096">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref098">98</xref>].The properties of Flp-SUMO follow the general theme of fine-tuning DNA-protein interactions through post-translational modification. However, this is the first time that this phenomenon has been demonstrated in the regulation of a site-specific DNA recombinase.</p>

<title>Self- and host-imposed controls regulate the population of selfish genomes</title>
<p>As an extrachromosomal element, the 2-micron plasmid derives its evolutionary fitness from its high transmission fidelity during cell division, and its ability to restore copy number in case of a glitch during a segregation event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref002">2</xref>]. The steady state plasmid copy number of 40–60 molecules in a haploid nucleus is an optimized maximum value. Higher copy numbers reduce the fitness of the host, and indirectly harm the plasmid. Central to copy number maintenance is the regulation of Flp through modulation of gene expression by plasmid-coded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref027">27</xref>] and through post-translational modification by the host’s SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation machineries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11B–11D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>]. The post-translational control is two-pronged. As suggested by previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref033">33</xref>], and confirmed by the present study utilizing Flp-SUMO, proteasome-mediated turnover of Flp, sequentially modified by SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation, lessens the probability of unsealed strand nicks at <italic>FRT</italic> and unwarranted increase in plasmid copy number via BIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11B</xref>). At another level, as suggested by the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> properties of Flp-SUMO, the lower propensity of SUMO-conjugated Flp to stay associated with <italic>FRT</italic> protects it from excessive strand nicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11C</xref>). By controlling the level and activity of Flp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11A–11D</xref>), SUMO conjugation would also prevent hyper-amplification of the plasmid by <italic>FRT</italic> x <italic>FRT</italic> recombination coupled to plasmid replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008193.g011">Fig 11D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, safeguards against plasmid overpopulation through moderation of selfishness exercised by the plasmid itself and through preventive measures implemented by the host guarantee the mutual compatibility between a dependent genome and its guardian genome over evolutionary time.</p>

<title>General characteristics of plasmids expressing Flp or modified forms of Flp are outlined.</title>
<p>The plasmid p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp, schematically diagrammed at the top, was a derivative of the 2-micron plasmid containing an insertion of the <italic>ADE2</italic> gene at the unique HpaI site within the plasmid genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref056">56</xref>]. In addition, the plasmid was engineered to express a version of Flp fused to an HA-His8 epitope at its carboxyl-terminus. Except for these modifications, the rest of the plasmid backbone was the same as that of the native 2-micron circle. The 599 bp inverted repeat sequences, within which the <italic>FRT</italic> sites are embedded, are shown by the horizontal parallel lines. The Flp-<italic>FRT</italic> recombination system and the Rep1-Rep2-<italic>STB</italic> partitioning system were functional in this multi-copy plasmid. In the parent form of p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp utilized for the present study, the 2-micron plasmid backbone was in the A-form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref042">42</xref>]. Flp-mediated recombination in yeast between the head-to-head <italic>FRT</italic> sites of the plasmid could generate the B-form, and promote A → B and B → A interconversions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008193.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO, the <italic>FLP</italic> gene was modified to express a Flp-SUMO hybrid protein in which the mature form of SUMO (amino acids 1–96) was fused to the carboxyl-terminus of Flp via a short peptide linker: Ala-Ser-Gly<sub>4</sub>-Ser. The fusion protein harbored at its carboxyl-terminus the same HA-His8 tag as that fused to Flp. In the p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L) and p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp(H305L)-SUMO plasmid derivatives, the active site His-305 in Flp was replaced by leucine. The variants containing the H305L substitution were competent in strand cleavage but were strongly defective in strand joining. The Flp and SUMO moieties are color coded by green and yellow, respectively.</p>

Since p<italic>ADE2</italic>-Flp-SUMO contains a 599 bp long inverted repeat sequence, each with an embedded <italic>FRT</italic> site, a strand break within one <italic>FRT</italic> may be repaired by using the second intact copy of the repeat as template. Resolution of a potential Holliday junction intermediate of repair in the crossover mode would produce the B-form plasmid from the parental A-form.

<title>Relative dispositions of Lys-375 and the carboxyl-terminus of Flp with respect to the catalytic hexad residues of the active site are displayed.</title>
<p>The distances between α-carbon atoms assembled in panel <bold>A</bold> are for a Flp monomer (bound adjacent to a cleaved scissile phosphate). In this structure (PDB, 1M6X), the polypeptide chain ends with Arg-422; Ile-423 is not visible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref070">70</xref>]. Similar distances arranged in panel <bold>B</bold> are for a Flp monomer (bound adjacent to an uncleaved scissile phosphate). The carboxyl-terminal I-423 is visible in this structure (PDB, 1FLO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008193.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
