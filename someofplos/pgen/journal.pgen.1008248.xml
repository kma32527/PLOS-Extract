<abstract>
<p>The localization of mRNAs encoding secreted/membrane proteins (mSMPs) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) likely facilitates the co-translational translocation of secreted proteins. However, studies have shown that mSMP recruitment to the ER in eukaryotes can occur in a manner that is independent of the ribosome, translational control, and the signal recognition particle, although the mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we identify a <italic>cis-</italic>acting RNA sequence motif that enhances mSMP localization to the ER and appears to increase mRNA stability, and both the synthesis and secretion of secretome proteins. Termed SECReTE, for <underline>s</underline>ecretion-<underline>e</underline>nhancing <underline><italic>c</italic></underline><italic>is</italic> <underline>re</underline>gulatory <underline>t</underline>argeting <underline>e</underline>lement, this motif is enriched in mRNAs encoding secretome proteins translated on the ER in eukaryotes and on the inner membrane of prokaryotes. SECReTE consists of ≥10 nucleotide triplet repeats enriched with pyrimidine (C/U) every third base (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>NNY</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> = any nucleotide, <italic>Y</italic> = pyrimidine) and can be present in the untranslated as well as the coding regions of the mRNA. Synonymous mutations that elevate the SECReTE count in a given mRNA (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>HSP150</italic>, and <italic>CCW12</italic>) lead to an increase in protein secretion in yeast, while a reduction in count led to less secretion and physiological defects. Moreover, the addition of SECReTE to the 3’UTR of an mRNA for an exogenously expressed protein (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. GFP) led to its increased secretion from yeast cells. Thus, SECReTE constitutes a novel RNA motif that facilitates ER-localized mRNA translation and protein secretion.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Proteins destined for secretion from the cell, including soluble secreted and membrane proteins (SMPs), are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) either directly upon translation on the ER surface or post-translationally, as in the case of type II membrane proteins. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that mRNAs encoding SMPs (mSMPs) are also enriched on the ER, yet how they target this organelle is less clear. The signal recognition particle (SRP), which recognizes N-terminal hydrophobic signals of nascent polypeptides and targets them to an ER-localized receptor, was proposed to mediate the co-translational ER targeting of mRNA. However, more recent studies show that SRP inactivation, as well as the inhibition of translation, do not prevent targeting. Thus, how mSMPs reach the ER and whether the process is translation-independent remain open. Here we identify a <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence element in mSMPs that appears to facilitate mRNA stability and localization to the ER and, more importantly, enhances protein secretion. This motif, entitled “SECReTE” (<underline>s</underline>ecretion-<underline>e</underline>nhancing <underline><italic>c</italic></underline><italic>is</italic> <underline>re</underline>gulatory <underline>t</underline>argeting <underline>e</underline>lement) is enriched in nearly all mSMPs in eukaryotes and its addition or removal from mRNAs results in either enhanced or reduced protein secretion, respectively. Thus, SECReTE is a RNA sequence motif that regulates protein translation and secretion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>mRNA targeting and localized translation is an important mechanism that provides spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis. The delivery of mRNA to specific subcellular compartments has a major role in the establishment of polarity in various organisms and cell types, and was shown to be crucial for the proper function of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref002">2</xref>]. Interestingly, the localization of mRNA is often governed by <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements (“zipcodes”) embedded within the mRNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref002">2</xref>]. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) recognize such sequences and act together with molecular motors to direct the mRNA to its final destination.</p>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of synthesis of secreted and membrane (SMP; secretome) proteins. Moreover, mRNAs encoding for SMPs (mSMPs) are thought to localize to the ER membrane by a distinct translation-dependent mechanism, termed the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref005">5</xref>]. According to this model, protein translation begins in the cytoplasm and when SMPs undergo translation, a signal peptide present at their amino terminus emerges from the exit channel of translating ribosome and is recognized by the SRP. The SRP then is recruited to its receptor on the ER membrane and translocation of ribosome-mRNA-nascent polypeptide chain complex from the cytoplasm to the ER occurs. There, translating ribosomes interact with the translocon to enable co-translational protein translocation and mRNA anchoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref007">7</xref>]. Thus, the SRP model describes mSMPs as components with no active role in the ER translocation process.</p>
<p>However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that there are additional pathways for the delivery of mRNAs to the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref009">9</xref>]. First, attenuation of the SRP pathway did not result in lethality of yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref010">10</xref>] and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref011">11</xref>], and did not have a significant effect upon membrane protein synthesis and global mRNA distribution between the cytoplasm and the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref011">11</xref>]. Second, genome-wide analyses of the distribution of mSMPs between cytosolic polysomes and ER-bound polysomes demonstrated a significant overlap in the composition of the mRNA in the two fractions and also showed that cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs are broadly represented on the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref016">16</xref>]. This means that mRNAs lacking an encoded signal sequence or transmembrane domain can also localize to the ER. In agreement with these findings, removal of the signal sequence and the inhibition of translation did not disrupt mSMP localization to the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref018">18</xref>]. Third, subsets of secretome proteins are known to localize to the ER in an SRP-independent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref020">20</xref>]. These proteins are thought to translocate into the ER after translation in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref021">21</xref>]. In a study that utilized a technique for a specific pull-down of ER-bound ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref022">22</xref>], it was found that there is no significant difference in the enrichment of mRNAs encoding SRP-dependent proteins in comparison to mRNAs encoding SRP-independent proteins on ER membranes. In addition, a subset of ribosomes managed to reach the ER before the emergence of the signal sequence. A possible explanation for these observations could be that mRNAs reach the ER before the ribosomes in an SRP-independent mechanism. If mRNA targeting to the ER does not begin until signal peptide emergence, membrane-bound ribosomes should not be translating portions of the transcript upstream of the signal peptide. However, this was not the case, as translating membrane-bound ribosomes were found to be evenly distributed across entire transcripts in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref023">23</xref>]. While it is possible that pre-signal sequence-encoding transcripts could arise from translating polysomes, altogether the various findings strongly suggest a scenario whereby mRNAs can localize to the ER prior to translation initiation. Lastly, a recent study demonstrated that conditional SRP depletion from yeast does not necessarily block the co-translational ER targeting of mRNA, especially of those transcripts encoding predicted SRP-independent proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref024">24</xref>]. Thus, mRNA targeting to the ER likely involves different and, perhaps, multiple paths.</p>
<p>Although it has been difficult to identify <italic>cis</italic>-elements within mRNA that direct it to the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref028">28</xref>], specific sequence characteristics of mSMPs have been identified. For example, sequence analysis of the region encoding the signal sequence revealed a low usage of adenine to create no-A stretches within this sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref029">29</xref>]. Additionally, mRNAs encoding membrane proteins have a high degree of uracil enrichment, as well as pyrimidine usage, in comparison to mRNAs encoding cytosolic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref031">31</xref>]. These findings raise the possibility that the motif resides in a general, more diffuse, fashion within the nucleotide composition of the mRNA molecule.</p>
<p>By examining the sequences of transmembrane domain (TMD)-containing regions in mRNAs, we have now identified high content stretches of pyrimidine (C and U) repeats every third base (<italic>NNY</italic>, <italic>N–</italic>any nucleotide, <italic>Y</italic>–pyrimidine) that can be ≥10 nucleotide triplets in length. Analysis of the transcriptomes of several eukaryotic organisms (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>), revealed that this sequence pattern is significantly over-represented in mRNAs encoding for secretome proteins, that typically localize to the ER. The location of the motif is not restricted to the coding region but can be present in the untranslated regions (UTRs). Although we originally found the motif by analyzing the sequences of TMDs in secreted membrane proteins, in fact it is enriched at a higher level in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins that lack TMDs. We utilized both computational and experimental tools to establish the existence and significance of this motif. Computational analysis verified that mSMPs are the group most enriched with the motif, while synonymous mutations that either elevated or decreased motif strength (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. number of consecutive pyrimidine repeats) in mRNAs encoding yeast invertase, <italic>SUC2</italic>, as well as cell wall proteins, <italic>CCW12</italic> and <italic>HSP150</italic>, enhanced or reduced protein synthesis and secretion, respectively. This motif, which appears to facilitate mRNA stability, localization and translation at the ER, we have named the <underline>s</underline>ecretion-<underline>e</underline>nhancing <underline><italic>c</italic></underline><italic>is</italic> <underline>re</underline>gulatory <underline>t</underline>argeting <underline>e</underline>lement (SECReTE). Importantly, we show that SECReTE is enriched in secretome-encoding transcripts in all organisms examined, from prokaryotes to both lower and higher eukaryotes. This suggests that SECReTE may have a conserved role in the translational control of mRNAs either as a targeting motif or in other processes such as translation efficiency, mRNA processing (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., polyadenylation, capping, splicing), mRNA decay, and secondary structure, <italic>etc</italic>. We propose that SECReTE is important, not only to understand how mRNAs may reach the ER in eukaryotes, but may have practical applications in the field of biotechnology.</p>

<title>Identification of a pyrimidine repeat motif in mRNAs encoding yeast secretome proteins</title>
<p>RNA codons for the major hydrophobic residues (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine) are enriched in uracil in their second position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref031">31</xref>], although others like proline, alanine, serine and threonine, which can also be found in TMDs, contain cytosine at this position. We speculated, therefore, that triplet repeats of the form, <italic>NYN</italic> (where <italic>N =</italic> any nucleotide and <italic>Y</italic> = pyrimidine—U or C), might be common to proteins destined for translation at the ER (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. secreted and membrane proteins). We further speculated that uninterrupted repeats of this nature might be indicative of an RNA localization motif that could, potentially, exist in any frame. Thus, we examined mRNAs encoding yeast secretome proteins for the presence of consecutive pyrimidine repeats every third nucleotide (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>YNN</italic>, <italic>NYN</italic>, or <italic>NNY</italic>) in both the coding and UTR regions, using computational analysis.</p>
<p>We first determined how many such repetitive nucleotide triplets might best differentiate mSMPs from non-mSMPs (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. other nuclear-encoded mRNAs). For that, the number of consecutive triplet repeats along an mRNA transcript was scored according to a defined threshold (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 repeats). For a random motif we expected to see a linear correlation between the probability of its appearance(s) in a gene with gene length, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. We examined SECReTE lengths between 5 and 15 (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. nucleotide triplet lengths of 5,7,10,12, and 15) and indeed observed a direct correlation between SECReTE count and gene length for SECReTE5 and SECReTE7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, the dependency on gene length becomes significantly weakened for SECReTE10 and above, where motif occurrence at ≥10 triplets correlates poorly with gene length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This implies the presence of ≥10 consecutive repeats is not a random phenomenon and may be important.</p>

<p>If SECReTE repeats ≥10 (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. termed here as “SECReTE10”) play a role in protein secretion, we expect them to be more abundant in mRNAs encoding secretome proteins, as defined according to Ast <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref019">19</xref>]. To test this possibility, we divided the complete yeast genome into two gene sets: secretome and non-secretome, and calculated the fraction of transcripts that contain at least one instance of SECReTE per gene in each gene set. We found transcripts coding for secretome proteins are enriched with SECReTE motifs of length &gt;7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), in comparison to transcripts encoding non-secretome proteins. To test the motif length that gives the most significant separation between secretome and non-secretome transcripts, we evaluated the different thresholds for their ability to classify mSMPs using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. <italic>Bona fide</italic> secretome protein-encoding transcripts were used as a true positive set and non-secretome protein-encoding transcripts were defined as true negatives.

SECReTE10 and above) maximally differentiated (in terms of ROC area under the curve) secretome transcripts from non-secretome transcripts. As the occurrence SECReTE10 did not show a dependency upon gene length and gave the most significant separation between secretome and non-secretome transcripts, we used it as the threshold by which to define motif presence in subsequent analyses. Previous studies have used high throughput analyses to quantify the level of enrichment of transcripts on yeast ER-bound ribosomes and ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref023">23</xref>]. By comparing the cumulative distribution of the ER enrichment value of SECReTE10-containing transcripts to transcripts lacking SECReTE10, we could verify that a higher fraction of SECReTE10-containing transcripts is indeed enriched on ER-bound ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>) and ER membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1C Fig</xref>). In contrast, SECReTE10-containing transcripts are not enriched on mitochondrial ribosomes, in comparison to transcripts lacking SECReTE10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1D Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we checked for the presence of SECReTE10 in mRNAs coding for TMD-containing proteins and soluble secreted proteins separately. As expected, more transcripts encoding TMD-containing secretome proteins contain SECReTE10 (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. ≥1 SECReTE10) in the second position (<italic>NYN</italic>) than transcripts that encode soluble secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). However, the fraction of transcripts coding for soluble secreted proteins that contain at least one SECReTE10 in the third position (<italic>NNY</italic>) is even higher. This provides compelling evidence for SECReTE10 enrichment in transcripts that is independent of encoded TMD regions. Correspondingly, when we removed the TMD sequences from mRNAs encoding membrane proteins, we found that these transcripts were no longer enriched with the <italic>NYN</italic>-based form of SECReTE10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, SECReTE10 remained abundant at the third position, <italic>NNY</italic>, after TMD removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Thus, TMD sequences contribute to <italic>NYN-</italic>based SECReTE abundance. Finally, we note that the removal of TMD sequences from genes encoding secretome and non-secretome proteins did not alter the overall enrichment of SECReTE in those secretome messages versus non-secretome messages, nor did it change the threshold for differentiating between these groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As contiguous stretches of codons for hydrophobic amino acids (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. TMDs) foster SECReTE abundance, we also examined whether the removal of signal sequence coding regions (SSCRs), which encode signal peptides, from secretome genes had an effect upon the computational analysis of the SECReTE score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). However, the results indicate that no significant change in the overall fraction of secretome genes bearing SECReTE is incurred upon SSCR removal and this is not altered by TMD presence or motif position (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">2B</xref>). Thus, SSCRs do not contribute extensively to SECReTE abundance.</p>
<p>Since SRP depletion does not block the co-translational ER targeting of mRNAs encoding predicted SRP-independent proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref024">24</xref>], we examined whether SRP-independent transcripts on yeast ER-bound ribosomes are more enriched with SECReTE10 than SRP-dependent ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s007">S2A–S2D Fig</xref>). Using this dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref024">24</xref>], we found that both SRP-dependent and -independent transcripts contain SECReTE10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s007">S2B Fig</xref>). However, SRP-dependent (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. TMD-containing) transcripts essentially bear only the <italic>NYN-</italic>based motif, whereas both <italic>NYN-</italic> and <italic>NNY-</italic>based motifs appear in SRP-independent transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s007">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). Moreover, the subset of mRNAs that remain ER-bound after SRP depletion all appear to be enriched in <italic>NNY-</italic>based SECReTE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s007">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>SECReTE is the principal repetitive sequence motif in secretome transcripts</title>
<p>Repetitive nucleotide triplet sequence elements [<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>NNX</italic>; where <italic>X</italic> = is any of five other dinucleotide combinations: K (T/G), M (C/A), R (A/G), S (G/C), or W (A/T)] other than <italic>NNY</italic> might exist in secretome transcripts and distinguish them from non-secretome transcripts. Thus, we examined for the presence of ≥10 uninterrupted <italic>NNX</italic> repeats in the coding sequences of secretome and non-secretome proteins. Examination of the yeast genome did not reveal any significant repetitive <italic>NNX</italic>-based triplet repeats in mSMPs, except for that seen for pyrimidine (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>NNY</italic>). Moreover, this did not change upon removal of the TMD sequences from the analysis, indicating that concatenation of the regions flanking the TMD does not create SECReTE motifs <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s008">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). In contrast, we did find that R (purine) and W repeats are enriched in the third position of a large fraction of non-secretome transcripts, especially after TMD removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s008">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). This indicates that SECReTE is the principal, if not sole, nucleotide triplet motif of ≥10 repeats in the secretome protein-encoding genes of yeast, although a repetitive <italic>NNR</italic> motif could be identified in the third position of a subset of the non-secretome genes. No additional motifs in either the first or second positions (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>XNN</italic>, <italic>NXN</italic>) were identified in non-secretome genes.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the distribution of SECReTE in the different regions (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. 5’UTR, CDS, 3’UTR) of yeast genes. We found that the large majority (&gt;90%) of SECReTE motifs (8211 out of 9003) are present in the CDS regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4A Fig</xref>, left), however, the overall distribution is biased to the 5’ and 3’UTRs, when normalized for the mean length of these smaller regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4A Fig</xref>, right). Secretome transcripts (1144) contained ~35% of the total SECReTE motifs, an amount proportionally larger than that of non-secretome transcripts (4760), although the motif is more or less evenly represented in both the CDS and separate UTR regions after normalization for length. Mapping of motif distribution along the entire gene length (after normalization) revealed a uniform distribution in TMD-containing transcripts, but also showed that a number of transcripts encoding soluble proteins (~60) have a preference for SECReTE at the 5’ end, as this distribution could be eliminated upon SSCR removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4B Fig</xref>). Thus, despite the fact the SSCRs do not highly contribute to overall SECReTE abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), this does not exclude the possibility that the motif cannot be present therein. Examination of both <italic>NYN-</italic> and <italic>NNY-</italic>based SECReTE motifs in the coding regions showed that both contribute to motif presence at the 5’ end of the same subset of transcripts encoding soluble secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>When comparing SECReTE motifs residing in the CDS to those in the UTRs, we found that CDS motifs tend to consist of <italic>RRY</italic> repeats rather than <italic>NNY-</italic>based repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4C Fig</xref>). On the other hand, UTR-residing SECReTE motifs are statistically more pyrimidine-rich and, thus, are biased towards the <italic>NNY</italic> pattern of repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4C Fig</xref>). Next, we checked if the UTRs of the secretome transcripts are enriched with pyrimidines in general. Indeed, we found that secretome transcripts have a slightly higher Y content in their UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4D Fig</xref>), however, this enrichment disappears after removal of the SECReTE-containing UTRs from the analysis (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 43 and 99 transcripts for the 5’ and 3’UTRs, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4E Fig</xref>). This implies that SECReTE motifs contribute to the pyrimidine-enrichment of UTRs in secretome transcripts.</p>

<title>SECReTE abundance is not dependent upon codon usage</title>
<p>There is a possibility that SECReTE enrichment results from codon usage of the transcript. To check this possibility, we performed permutation test analysis. In this case, each gene sequence was randomly shuffled (1000 times), while codon usage remained constant. We then calculated the Z-score (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. number of standard deviations from the mean) of SECReTE10 for each gene to evaluate the probability of the signal to appear randomly. By looking at Z-score distribution in secretome and non-secretome genes, it can be concluded that SECReTE enrichment in mSMPs is not a random consequence of codon usage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s010">S5A Fig</xref>). This conclusion is valid for mSMPs encoding both membrane and soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s010">S5B Fig</xref>). We also conducted the analysis for each nucleotide position of the codon separately (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. for the <italic>YNN</italic>, <italic>NYN</italic>, and <italic>NNY</italic> versions of the motif). For that, we calculated the fraction of genes with a significant Z-score (≥1.96) for each position separately.

This finding is not dependent on the presence of TMDs, since the fraction of genes with a significant Z-score was larger for both soluble and TMD-containing secretome transcripts, rather than for soluble and TMD-containing non-secretome transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s010">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell wall, signal peptide- and TMD-containing yeast proteins in yeast are enriched with SECReTE</title>
<p>To determine those gene categories that are overrepresented with SECReTE-containing genes, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted. When genes that contain at least one occurrence of SECReTE10 in any of its <italic>YNN-</italic>, <italic>NYN-</italic> or <italic>NNY-</italic>based forms were searched for GO enrichment (using all yeast genes as a background), unsurprisingly, membrane proteins were found to have a high enrichment score (fold enrichment = 1.67) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The most SECReTE-enriched gene category was that comprising cell wall proteins (fold enrichment = 1.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). When 15 <italic>NNY</italic> repeats served as a threshold, the fold-change enrichment of the cell wall protein category increased to 4.8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To further characterize the mRNAs enriched with SECReTE, we divided the secretome and non-secretome into subgroups and calculated the fraction of transcripts containing SECReTE10 in each category. In agreement with the GO analysis, more than 90% of mRNAs coding for cell wall proteins possess SECReTE10 (and above) motifs and the cell wall proteins were the most SECReTE-rich overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Interestingly, this group also comprised the principal set of transcripts that remain associated with ER-bound ribosomes after SRP depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s007">S2E and S2F Fig</xref>). In addition, we found that 86% of mRNAs of proteins encoding both TMD and signal-sequence (SS) regions, as well as 84% of TMD-encoding secretome mRNAs, contain SECReTE10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Of these, mRNAs encoding tail-anchored (TA) proteins contain the lowest number of transcripts with SECReTE10 in the secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). TA proteins are known to translocate to the ER through an alternative pathway (GET) after being translated in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref034">34</xref>], and their transcripts are not enriched on ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref023">23</xref>] either before or after SRP depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref024">24</xref>]. This implies that SECReTE is more abundant in mRNAs undergoing translation on the ER. In contrast, transcripts for non-secretome proteins (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. mitochondrial and cytonuclear) have the lowest abundance of SECReTE elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>Since SECReTE is highly enriched in mRNAs coding for cell wall proteins, we wanted to check if it could be discovered using an unbiased motif search tool. For that, we analyzed the mRNA sequences of cell wall proteins using MEME to identify enriched mRNA motifs. The most significant result obtained highly resembled the SECReTE10 repeat with either U or C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Importantly, we did not detect a protein motif within this mRNA motif, eliminating the possibility that the SECReTE element is dependent on a specific protein sequence.</p>

<title>SECReTE enrichment in secretome transcripts occurs in both prokaryotes and higher eukaryotes</title>
<p>Conservation or convergence in evolution are often strong indications of functional significance. To check whether SECReTE enrichment in mSMPs is found in additional organisms (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. humans and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>) we analyzed other genomes. In humans, as in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, SECReTE10 gave the most significant separation between RNAs encoding secretome and non-secretome proteins, based on ROC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). After verifying that SECReTE10 does not correlate with gene length, SECReTE10 served as a threshold to define presence of the SECReTE motif. As in yeast, SECReTE is enriched in the second and third codon positions of secretome transcripts, in comparison to non-secretome transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Also, a larger fraction of secretome transcripts that lack TMDs contain the <italic>NNY-</italic>based SECReTE, as compared to non-secretome transcripts bearing TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Thus, the SECReTE motif is present in higher organisms. A list of all SECReTE10 and higher motifs found in human genes is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s004">S4 Table</xref>. Interestingly, unlike yeast, we found that a disproportionally large majority of motifs (29753 out of 52,047) are present in the UTRs instead of being in the CDS, especially after normalization for length, and this phenomenon is observed for both secretome and non-secretome transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s011">S6A Fig</xref>). Therefore, in contrast to yeast, the UTRs and especially the 3’UTR are preferential sites for SECReTE location in human transcripts. Like yeast, however, <italic>RRY</italic> enrichment is observed for SECReTE motifs in the CDS regions, while high pyrimidine content is observed in the UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s011">S6B Fig</xref>). Therefore, although both yeast and human share the same SECReTE motifs, their distribution over gene region appears different. Interestingly, human transcripts encoding glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are equivalent to cell wall proteins, were found to be highly enriched with SECReTE. In fact, a SECReTE-like motif was previously shown to confer the translation-independent localization of a transcript encoding human GPI-anchored protein, placental alkaline phosphatase, to the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref035">35</xref>] In contrast, tail-anchored genes, as well as mitochondrial and cytonuclear genes, have a low SECReTE abundance as seen in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Finally, we also detected a high abundance of SECReTE10 in genes encoding secretome proteins from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, in comparison to those encoding non-secretome proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).

<p>We next asked whether SECReTE is conserved evolutionarily via inheritance. To differentiate between conservation and possible convergence we analyzed the genome of the fission yeast, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, for the presence and position of SECReTE in secretome and non-secretome transcripts. As found for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, SECReTE is enriched (in both <italic>NYN-</italic> and <italic>NNY-</italic>based forms) in a larger fraction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> mSMPs that lack TMDs, as compared those containing TMDs or to non-secretome transcripts that either bear or lack TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Next, we aligned orthologous genes encoding secretome proteins from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to those of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> (457 genes total), and examined whether SECReTE is found in the same (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. aligned) position within the gene. We found that the coordinates of SECReTE motifs in the large majority (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 393 out of 457) of ortholog pairs were non-aligned. This might imply that the majority of SECReTE motifs arose through convergent evolution, although we cannot rule out drift of the motif after species divergence. Nonetheless, it is clear that SECReTE is present in all species examined by us, from prokarya to eukarya, the latter including yeasts and mammals.</p>

<title>Design of mutations in SECReTE to examine the effects upon protein secretion</title>
<p>To further understand the significance of SECReTE and validate its importance to yeast cell physiology, we examined its relevance by elevating or decreasing the signal in selected genes. Three representative genes were chosen, based on their relatively short gene length, a detectable phenotype upon their deletion, and their function in different physiological pathways. These genes included: <italic>SUC2</italic>, which encodes a soluble secreted periplasmic enzyme; <italic>HSP150</italic>, which encodes a soluble media protein; and <italic>CCW12</italic>, which encodes a GPI-anchored cell wall protein. The overall SECReTE signal of the genes was increased by substituting any A or G found in the third codon position with a T or C, respectively, thereby enriching SECReTE presence along the entire gene [(+)SECReTE]. The reverse substitution, converting T to A or C to G, decreased the overall SECReTE signal [(-)SECReTE]. We note that we added or removed only <italic>NNY-</italic>based triplet motifs, in order not to change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. The number of motifs present in each gene before and after SECReTE addition/reduction is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s005">S5 Table</xref>. Thus, in the case of <italic>HSP150</italic> several <italic>NYN-</italic>based SECReTE motifs remain in the (-)SECReTE mutant. Changes in the stability of the mRNA secondary structure (free energy) and the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref032">32</xref>] were kept to within a similar range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s005">S5 Table</xref>). SECReTE mutations in <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>HSP150</italic>, and <italic>CCW12</italic> are shown along the length of the gene, using a minimum threshold of either 1 <italic>NNY</italic> repeats or 10 <italic>NNY</italic> repeats, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s012">S7 Fig</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s012">S7A–S7C Fig</xref>; upper and lower parts, respectively).</p>

<title>SECReTE mutations in <italic>SUC2</italic> alter invertase secretion</title>
<p><italic>SUC2</italic> codes for different forms of invertase translated from two distinct mRNAs, short and long, which differ only at their 5’ ends. While the longer mRNA codes for a secreted protein that contains a signal sequence, the signal sequence is omitted from the short isoform, which codes for a cytoplasmic protein. Secreted Suc2 expression is subjected to glucose repression; however, under inducing conditions (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., glucose depletion), Suc2 is trafficked through the secretory pathway to the periplasmic space of the cell. There, it catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose, this enzymatic activity being responsible for the ability of yeast to utilize sucrose as a carbon source and can be measured by a biochemical assay (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. invertase activity), both inside and outside of the cell. The effect of SECReTE mutations on Suc2 function was tested by examining the ability of mutants to grow on sucrose-containing media by drop-test. Interestingly, the growth rate of <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE on sucrose plates was decreased, while the <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE mutant exhibited better growth in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), even though no growth change was detected on YPD plates. These findings suggest that SECReTE strength affects the secretion of Suc2. These changes in Suc2 secretion could result from changes in <italic>SUC2</italic> transcription, Suc2 production, and/or altered rates of secretion. To distinguish between possibilities, WT cells, <italic>suc2Δ</italic>, and <italic>SUC2</italic> SECReTE mutants were subjected to invertase assays. The invertase assay enables the quantification of secreted Suc2, as well as internal Suc2, by calculating the amount of glucose produced from sucrose. As expected, under glucose repressing conditions (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 2% glucose) the levels of both secreted and internal Suc2 were very low. When cells were grown on media containing low glucose (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 0.05% glucose) to promote the expression of the secreted enzyme, secreted Suc2 levels were altered due to changes in SECReTE. Corresponding to the drop-test results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), a significant decrease in secreted invertase was detected with <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells, while a significant increase was detected with <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE cells, in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE cells were found to secrete nearly 2-fold (92.2±9.2%, <italic>p &lt;</italic>0.016) more invertase than <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells, while no Suc2 secretion was detected from <italic>suc2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, secreted). If SECReTE mutations affect the efficiency of Suc2 secretion, but not its synthesis, then Suc2 should accumulate in <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells corresponding to the difference secreted from <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE cells. However, this was not the case as the internal amount of Suc2 decreased in <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells and slightly increased in <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, internal). These findings suggest that SECReTE alterations in <italic>SUC2</italic> might affect the level of protein production. We next examined the rate of invertase secretion for WT, <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE, and <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells shifted to low glucose medium for varying amounts of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The results show that the average maximal rate of secretion from <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE cells is slightly higher than for WT cells (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. 0.479±0.016 vs. 0.432±0.013 units per min per O.D.<sub>600</sub> unit of cells; ±standard deviation, n = 3 experiments), and was significantly (62.4±7.8%; <italic>p &lt;</italic>0.0001) higher than of <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells (0.295±0.022 units/min per O.D.<sub>600</sub> unit of cells; ±standard deviation, n = 3 experiments). In contrast, the time required to achieve half-maximal secretion between <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE and <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE cells was relatively unchanged under the experimental conditions (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. ~74 min; R<sup>2</sup> values = &gt;94). Thus, the presence of SECReTE affects not only invertase production and overall secretion, but also its rate of secretion from yeast.</p>

<title>SECReTE mutations alter Hsp150 secretion and cell wall stability</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to study the importance of SECReTE in <italic>HSP150</italic>. Hsp150 is a component of the outer cell wall and while the exact function of Hsp150 is unknown, it is required for cell wall stability and resistance to cell wall-perturbing agents, such as Calcofluor White (CFW) and Congo Red (CR). While <italic>hsp150Δ</italic> cells are more sensitive to cell wall stress, the overproduction of Hsp150 increases cell wall integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref036">36</xref>]. Hsp150 is secreted efficiently into the growth media and its expression is increased upon heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref038">38</xref>]. The effect of modifying SECReTE in <italic>HSP150</italic> was examined via drop-test by testing the sensitivity of <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE and <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells to added CFW, in comparison to WT and <italic>hsp150Δ</italic> cells. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5D</xref> while the <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE strain was more sensitive to CFW as compared to WT cells, the <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE strain was more resistant to CFW. As expected, <italic>hsp150Δ</italic> cells are the most susceptible to CFW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). <italic>HSP150</italic> strains were also subjected to Western blot analysis to measure levels of the mutant proteins. Since <italic>HSP150</italic> secretion is elevated upon heat-shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref038">38</xref>], cells were shifted to 37°C before protein extraction. Protein was extracted from both the growth medium and cells to detect both external and internal protein levels, respectively. The amount of Hsp150 secreted to the medium was decreased in <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE cells and elevated in <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells, in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Similar to Suc2, the internal amount of Hsp150 was decreased in <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE cells, relative to WT cells, and showed a greater reduction than that seen in the external form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), despite the fact that several <italic>NYN-</italic>based motifs remain in the gene.

As seen with <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), we found that the <italic>CCW12</italic>(-)SECReTE mutation rendered cells sensitive to cell wall perturbation, in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>SECReTE addition affects secretion of an exogenous naïve protein</title>
<p>The ability of SECReTE addition to improve the secretion of an exogenous protein would not only be substantial evidence for its importance, but also could be a useful, low-cost, industrial tool to improve the secretion of recombinant proteins without changing protein sequence. To test that, we employed a <italic>GFP</italic> transcript construct bearing the encoded signal sequence (SS) of Gas1 (<italic>SSGAS</italic>; SSGas1) at the 5’ end. SSGas1 addition enables the secretion of GFP protein to the medium, although its secretion was not as efficient in comparison to other SS-fused GFP proteins, such as SSKar2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). To potentially improve the secretion of <italic>SSGAS-GFP</italic>, we added an altered 3’UTR sequence of <italic>GAS1</italic> that contained SECReTE [<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. in which all A’s and G’s were replaced with T’s and C’s, respectively; SSGAS-GFP-GAS1<sup>3’UTR</sup>(+)SECReTE]. We then tested the effect of SECReTE addition upon the secretion of GFP into the media. We found that the addition of SECReTE to the 3’UTR of <italic>SSGAS</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> improved the secretion of GFP secretion into the media, in comparison to SSGAS-GFP, and was similar to that of SSKar2-GFP construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). GFP expression without the signal sequence was unable to be secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>The effect of SECReTE mutations on mRNA levels</title>
<p>As protein levels may be altered by (-)SECReTE and (+)SECReTE mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5B, 5E and 5G</xref>), we examined whether changes in gene transcription or mRNA stability are involved. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was employed to check whether mRNA levels of <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>HSP150</italic>, and <italic>CCW12</italic> are affected by SECReTE strength. We found that <italic>SUC2</italic>(–)SECReTE mRNA levels were almost 30% lower than in <italic>SUC2</italic> WT cells, while <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE levels were ~50% higher than WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8A Fig</xref>). This change in mRNA levels might contribute to the ability of <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE mutant to increase protein production and, therefore, grow better on sucrose-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of SECReTE mutation on <italic>HSP150</italic> mRNA levels was also studied. We found that the mRNA level of <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE was similar to WT, while that of <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE was slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8B Fig</xref>). Thus, the change in Hsp150 protein levels and sensitivity to CFW due to SECReTE alteration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>) is not entirely explained by changes in mRNA levels. SECReTE mutations in <italic>CCW12</italic>(-)SECReTE did not cause a significant change in its mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8C Fig</xref>), therefore, the increased sensitivity of <italic>CCW12</italic>(-)SECReTE to HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) is probably not due to a decrease in <italic>CCW12</italic> mRNA.</p>

<title>The addition of SECReTE motifs increases mRNA localization to the ER</title>
<p>To test whether SECReTE has a role in dictating mRNA localization, we visualized the <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>HSP150</italic> mRNAs by single-molecule FISH (smFISH) using specific fluorescent probes and tested the influence of SECReTE alteration on the level of mRNA co-localization with the ER. We used Sec63-GFP as an ER marker and calculated the percentage of mRNA granules (spots) per cell that co-localized with cortical and perinuclear ER (cER and nER, respectively) or were not localized to the ER. We note that probes to the native gene sequences were used to measure the level of mRNA localization in WT cells as well as in (+)SECReTE or (-)SECReTE cells. The number of FISH spots per cell was variable for both mRNAs, with (-)SECReTE cells having less spots than WT cells, while (+)SECReTE cells had more spots per cell than WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9A Fig</xref>). This largely reflects the results obtained by qRT-PCR for <italic>SUC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8A Fig</xref>), however, we cannot discount the possibility that SECReTE alterations lessen the level of mRNA hybridization with the probe set and, thus, underestimate RNA localization to some degree.</p>
<p>We found that the level of co-localization between <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE mRNA granules and Sec63-GFP was significantly less in comparison to <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE mRNA granules (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 56.7±1.5% vs. 74.1±1.7% co-localization, respectively; <italic>p =</italic> 2.0E-13) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">6A, 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9B</xref>), while being similar to native <italic>SUC2</italic> (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 56.3±2.4% ER co-localization). This finding suggests that the number of SECReTE motifs influences mRNA localization to the ER, in addition to enhancing secretion.

<p>We next examined the level of <italic>HSP150</italic> mRNA localization to the ER in <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE or <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE cells. We found that as with <italic>SUC2</italic>, the addition of SECReTE motifs increased the level of ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9C Fig</xref>) from 63.7±2.0% to 77.9±1.6% over native <italic>HSP150</italic> localization (<italic>p =</italic> 7.0E-8). In contrast, no change in the level of <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE mRNA co-localization was observed (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 64.0±1.6%), which perhaps reflects presence of the <italic>NYN-</italic>based motifs that could not be mutated without altering the amino acid sequence. Overall, however, both sets of results show that SECReTE addition to an mRNA increases the pattern of ER localization. To substantiate the smFISH results for <italic>SUC2</italic>, we also performed the subcellular fractionation of cells expressing native <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE, or <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE to obtain crude membrane (containing ER) and cytosolic fractions and quantified the distribution of mRNA using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).

<title>Identification of potential SECReTE-binding proteins</title>
<p>To further elucidate the role of SECReTE it is essential to identify its binding partners, presumably RBPs. Large-scale approaches were previously used to identify mRNAs that are bound &gt;40 known RBPs in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref043">43</xref>]. To obtain a list of potential SECReTE-binding proteins (SBPs) we searched the datasets for RBPs that bind mRNAs highly enriched with SECReTE. For each RBP, we calculated what fraction of its bound transcripts contain SECReTE10. RBPs found to bind large fractions of SECReTE10-containing mRNAs included Bfr1, Whi3, Puf1, Puf2, Scp160, and Khd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), and were all previously shown to bind mSMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref043">43</xref>]. To test which of these candidates bind SECReTE, each of the genes these RBPs was deleted in either WT or <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells. We hypothesized that the deletion of a genuine SBP might confer hypersensitivity to CFW and eliminate the growth rate differences between WT and <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells observed on CFW-containing plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).

One possible explanation for this lack of effect is that these RBPs either do not bind <italic>HSP150</italic> or that they are redundant with other SBPs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The correct sorting of proteins within the cell is crucial for cellular organization and normal function. While the information for protein localization can reside within the protein sequence (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. protein targeting sequences), the spatial localization of an mRNA may also be important for protein proper targeting cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, mSMPs localize to the surface of the ER independently of translation and that localization requires elements within the transcript that are presumably recognized by an ER-localized RBP (see reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref044">44</xref>]). It was shown previously that ER-targeted TMD-containing proteins are highly enriched with amino acids containing uracil-rich codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref031">31</xref>] and, thus, their ORFs are enriched with pyrimidines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref027">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, mRNAs coding for secretome proteins that do not contain TMDs were also found to be enriched on ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref045">45</xref>]. Therefore, an additional mechanism or element appears necessary to confer mSMP localization. Here, we identify features that characterize all mSMPs, either encoding a TMD or not, and discovered a repetitive motif consisting of ≥10 consecutive <italic>NNY</italic> repeats. This motif, termed SECReTE, is not restricted to transcripts coding for TMD-containing proteins, but can be found in higher abundance in all secretome transcripts, from prokaryotes (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>) to yeast (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>) to humans (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">4</xref>). By analyzing the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> genome it was discovered that SECReTE tends to be positioned differently than in orthologous <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> genes encoding secretome proteins. This implies that SECReTE enrichment in mSMPs may have evolved in a number of different ways (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. conservation, drift, or convergence). Correspondingly, we found that SECReTE is preferentially located in the 3’UTR of human transcripts, while being present mainly in the CDS of budding yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s011">S6A</xref> Figs). The idea that SECReTE motifs are present throughout evolution likely emphasizes its significance and functionality.</p>
<p>To better characterize SECReTE, we first determined the number of <italic>NNY</italic> repeats that can serve as a threshold to verify its presence and found that ten (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. SECReTE10) constitute a genuine motif, rather than a random occurrence, and enabled significant separation between secretome and non-secretome mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Importantly, no other repetitive motif was identified in secretome transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s008">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). SECReTE abundance was calculated separately for each position of the codon and while being barely present in the first position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <italic>YNN</italic>), it was highly represented in the second and third positions in mSMPs (<italic>NYN</italic> and <italic>NNY</italic>, respectively), in comparison to non-mSMPs. Interestingly, the SECReTE10-containing fraction of transcripts coding for soluble secreted proteins is larger than that of mRNAs encoding secreted membrane proteins, suggesting that SECReTE enrichment is not merely due to the high fraction of TMD-containing genes in the secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Importantly, when encoded TMD sequences were removed from the analysis, SECReTE10 was found to be more abundant in the third position of the codon (<italic>NNY</italic>) in secretome transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, no significant change in SECReTE abundance was observed upon removal of the SSCR regions from the computational analysis of secretome genes that encode signal peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, it is the TMD regions that contribute to <italic>NYN-</italic>based SECReTE motif enrichment.</p>
<p>By analyzing the ribosome profiling datasets of both Jan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref022">22</xref>] and Chartron <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref023">23</xref>], we verified that a higher fraction of SECReTE10-containing transcripts is enriched on ER-bound ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1A Fig</xref>) and in polysomes extracted from the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1B Fig</xref>), as well as in the membrane fraction itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1C Fig</xref>). In contrast, transcripts with SECReTE10 were not enriched on mitochondria-bound ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s006">S1D Fig</xref>). Moreover, analysis of a recent dataset by Costa <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref024">24</xref>] revealed that conditional SRP depletion strongly affects the association of predicted SRP-dependent (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. TMD-containing) transcripts with ER-bound ribosomes, but had less effect upon SRP-independent transcripts that are more enriched with <italic>NNY-</italic>based SECReTE motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s007">S2 Fig</xref>). Permutation analysis confirmed that SECReTE enrichment in mSMPs is not arbitrary and demonstrated that it is independent of codon composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s010">S5 Fig</xref>). Altogether, SECReTE motifs can be found in both TMD-containing and -lacking transcripts, whereby <italic>NYN-</italic>based motifs are contributed principally by the TMD regions of SRP-dependent secretome proteins. In contrast, <italic>NNY-</italic>based SECReTE motifs are enriched in soluble/SRP-independent secretome proteins. Finally, we note that SECReTE motifs are equally distributed to UTRs in the case of yeast and preferentially in the case humans, after normalization for gene length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s009">S4A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s011">S6A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Although SECReTE10 enables the classification of mSMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), the separation between secretome and non-secretome is not absolute and mRNAs coding for non-secretome proteins may also contain SECReTE sequences. While this might suggest that the motif is not completely defined, it might also imply that SECReTE plays a role in non-secretome mRNAs, perhaps in ER localization. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether mRNAs encoding cytosolic proteins localize to the ER and undergo translation by ER-associated ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref047">47</xref>]. The idea that ER can support the translation of both secretory and cytosolic proteins was initially proposed by Nicchitta and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref048">48</xref>]. Furthermore, they suggested that since translation initiation can start before the emergence of the signal sequence, ER-bound ribosomes would not distinguish between mRNAs and, therefore, mRNAs encoding cytosolic proteins can tether to ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref044">44</xref>]. The fact that a large fraction of mRNAs encoding cytosolic proteins also contain SECReTE raises the possibility that their targeting to the ER is intentional and that this motif plays a role in it, even if the protein is not destined for secretion. Thus, SECReTE presence could be an organizing principle for transcript localization to the ER, while the presence or absence of an ER translocation signal (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. signal peptide, TMD, GPI anchor) in the polypeptide is the determinant for either secretion or cytosolic localization, respectively.</p>
<p>Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes encoding cell wall proteins are the most enriched with SECReTE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). In contrast, TA-protein encoding transcripts show less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), perhaps since they are not enriched on ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref023">23</xref>] and their translation products translocate to the ER only after full translation in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref034">34</xref>]. This finding implies that SECReTE is more abundant in mRNAs that are meant to be translated on (or near) the ER. Importantly, SECReTE was also identified with an unbiased method for motif discovery using the MEME server to find common sequence elements in cell wall genes. This parallel methodology supports our original identification of SECReTE and its importance is further enhanced by the discovery that it is present from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As in yeast, human mSMPs are more enriched with SECReTE than non-secretome transcripts and this is independent of TMD presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Unlike yeast, however, human transcripts contain much larger UTR sequences and SECReTE elements appear to be more abundant therein, both in number and distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s011">S6A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The physiological relevance of SECReTE was explored by altering its enrichment in three mSMPs: <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>HSP150</italic>, and <italic>CCW12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s012">S7 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8 Fig</xref>, &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9 Fig</xref>). Although the amino acid sequences were not altered by motif mutation, the functionality of these genes was. <italic>SUC2</italic> SECReTE mutants exhibited altered growth rates on sucrose-containing medium in comparison to WT cells, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. reduced growth when motif score (number) was decreased and better growth when motif score was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Moreover, either the decrease or increase of motif score corresponded directly with a decrease or increase in invertase synthesis, invertase secretion, and the rate of secretion, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). <italic>HSP150</italic> SECReTE mutants also behaved differently, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>HSP150</italic>(-)SECReTE cells exhibited higher sensitivity to CFW in comparison to WT cells, while <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells were more resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Similarly, <italic>CCW12</italic>(-)SECReTE cells exhibited hypersensitivity to HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). These findings strengthen the notion that SECReTE may play an important role in regulating the amount of protein secreted from cells. This idea was verified using an exogenous substrate, SSGAS-GFP, whose secretion was significantly enhanced upon addition of the <italic>GAS1</italic> 3’UTR containing the SECReTE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). The number of SECReTE motifs not only increased protein production and secretion, it also enhanced the localization of <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>HSP150</italic> transcripts to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9B and S9C Fig</xref>). Thus, it would seem clear that SECReTE motifs enhance mRNA localization to the ER and subsequent secretome protein production and secretion, although the mechanism is not entirely known. It may be that SECReTE abundance helps stabilize secretome mRNAs as observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9A Fig</xref>), perhaps by increasing their localization to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9B and S9C Fig</xref>), and through this mechanism yields higher amounts of protein translation and secretion. Higher levels of translation may promote the elevated rate of secretion afforded by (+)SECReTE mutations, although further work is necessary to fully resolve the function(s) of SECReTE.</p>
<p>Although SECReTE is present throughout evolution, it is not a strict sequence-based motif since a wide variety of pyrimidine-rich sequences fit its demands. This variability might allow for the preferential binding of specific mSMPs (or non-secretome-encoding mRNAs that contain SECReTE elements) to different SBPs under different conditions, depending upon secretory needs of the cells. While it is generally assumed that mRNA localization is required for local translation and proper positioning of the translated protein, SBP binding post-export may provide spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA stability and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref050">50</xref>]. Moreover, additional features within secretome mRNAs may also influence both protein synthesis and secretion. For example, Palazzo <italic>et al</italic> (2007) previously showed that the low usage of adenine residues created no-A stretches within the signal sequence of SSCR-encoding proteins and the addition of adenines could affect nuclear export of the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, multiple <italic>cis</italic> RNA elements appear to impinge upon the translational control of secreted proteins.</p>
<p>Correct mRNA localization is not redundant to protein localization, but is yet another level of regulation that affects protein production. Supportive of this model is Puf3, an RBP that targets its associated mRNAs to the surface of the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref051">51</xref>]. In addition to its mitochondrial targeting role, Puf3 binding regulates the translational fate of mRNAs. Specifically, Puf3 binding leads to mRNA decay and repressed translation on high glucose, but becomes phosphorylated and promotes translation under low glucose conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref053">53</xref>]. Interestingly, alterations in <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>HSP150</italic> SECReTE motifs also support this model, as mutations altered the amount of secreted protein, but not necessarily the ratio between secreted and non-secreted protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>). As Suc2 and Hsp150 both contain a signal peptide, SECReTE alteration does not necessarily affect protein targeting, but only mRNA targeting. Yet, if localizing mRNAs to the ER is important for conferring efficient translation, either through mRNA stabilization or the regulation of protein production, then SECReTE presence and strength (in terms of length or number) is expected to fill such a regulatory role. If SECReTE affects mRNA stabilization, this might well explain why we observed a decrease in <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE mRNA levels and an increase in <italic>SUC2</italic>(+)SECReTE mRNA levels, in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8A Fig</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9A Fig</xref>). Moreover, we found that SECReTE abundance in <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>HSP150</italic> led to enhanced ER localization and membrane association (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9B</xref>), suggesting that ER localization and mRNA stability are likely to be interconnected. Taken together, our results suggest that SECReTE abundance affects the localization, stability, and translation of secretome mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s013">S8 Fig</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s014">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>If SECReTE is a <italic>cis</italic> regulatory element, the question is who are its <italic>trans</italic>-acting partners? Large-scale approaches have been used to identify mRNAs that interact with known RBPs in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref043">43</xref>]. These analyses enabled the identification of Bfr1, Whi3, Puf1, Puf2, Scp160, and Khd1 as potential SBPs, based upon their ability to interact with known SECReTE-containing transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). As a means of verification, we first deleted individual RBPs and determined whether this alleviated the growth differences between WT and <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells on CFW-containing medium, as might be expected upon the removal of a <italic>bona fide</italic> SBP. While the deletion of <italic>PUF1</italic>, <italic>PUF2</italic>, or <italic>SHE2</italic> did not alter the increased resistance of <italic>HSP150</italic>(+)SECReTE cells to CFW, those of <italic>KHD1</italic> and <italic>WHI3</italic> did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g007">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s015">S10 Fig</xref>). This suggests that they may be SBPs and several indications support the idea that Whi3 and Khd1 serve in this regard. For example, Whi3 possesses an RNA recognition motif and was already identified as preferentially binding mSMPs, including <italic>HSP150</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref054">54</xref>]. Whi3 also binds <italic>CLN3</italic> mRNA and is important for the efficient retention of Cln3 at the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref055">55</xref>], as well as to destabilize <italic>CLN3</italic> and other mRNA targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref054">54</xref>]. In addition, the <italic>whi3</italic> deletion mutant is sensitive to cell wall perturbing agents, such as CFW and congo-Red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref041">41</xref>], and is synthetic lethal with the deletion of <italic>CCW12</italic> in a synthetic genetic analysis screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, Whi3 is an attractive candidate SBP. The same can be said for Khd1, which interacts with hundreds of transcripts including many mSMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref042">42</xref>], and contains 3 K homology (KH) RNA-binding domains suggested to cooperatively recognize triplets of C/U-rich sequence elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref056">56</xref>]. These transcripts include <italic>CCW12</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref042">42</xref>] and, correspondingly, Khd1 plays a role in the cell wall integrity signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref057">57</xref>]. However, Khd1 is not essential and is best known for its association with <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA and is required for both its translational repression and efficient localization to the bud tip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref058">58</xref>]. <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA, as well as mRNAs encoding polarity and secretion factors (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>SRO7</italic>), are physically bound to cortical ER and both are delivered to the bud tip via the same mechanism involving She2, She3, and Myo4/She1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref060">60</xref>]. Importantly, both <italic>ASH1</italic> and <italic>SRO7</italic> have SECReTE10 motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008248.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Thus, Khd1 interactions with SECReTE-containing mRNAs might potentiate their targeting to the ER, although this remains to be proven. Further work is required to identify SBPs and determine their role in protein secretion.</p>
<p>Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, SECReTE binding to ER-associated SBPs is likely to enhance transcript interactions with the ER and, thereby, increase mRNA stabilization, with the result being either increased translation efficiency and/or number of mRNAs translated on ER-bound ribosomes (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008248.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Our model supports the idea that mRNA plays an active role in its own targeting and this does not necessarily contradict the importance of co-translational localization, but rather provides another level of regulation. Thus, we believe that SECReTE plays an important physiological role in the fine-tuning of cellular secretion.</p>

<p>Being both a unicellular and eukaryotic organism, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is advantageous for the production of recombinant proteins as it grows quickly, is easy to culture, and secretes post-translationally modified proteins into the extracellular medium, which can facilitate their purification.

Deletion strains using the <italic>NAT</italic> antibiotic resistance gene in WT (BY4741) cells were created using standard LiOAc transformation procedures and with nourseothricin (100μg/ml) for selection on synthetic solid medium. For the creation of SECReTE mutant strains, SECReTE gene fragments were designed with the appropriate modifications, from the first to the last mutated base, and synthesized either as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, USA) or cloned into a pUC57-AMP vector (Bio Basic Inc.). Both (-)SECReTE and (+)SECReTE strains were generated. <italic>SUC2</italic>(-)SECReTE, <italic>SUC2</italic> (+)SECReTE and <italic>CCW12</italic>(-)SECReTE strains were constructed in the BY4741 background genome using the <italic>delitto perfetto</italic> method for genomic oligonucleotide recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref064">64</xref>], in which the CORE cassette from pGKSU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008248.ref064">64</xref>] was integrated first into the genomic region corresponding to site of the SECReTE gene fragment.

<title>Assignment of SECReTE and permutation analysis</title>
<p>To calculate the SECReTE count for each gene, the length of an uninterrupted run of <italic>NNY</italic> triplet repeats was counted separately for each of the three different codon positions (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>YNN</italic>, <italic>NYN</italic>, <italic>NNY</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is any nucleotide and <italic>Y</italic> is a pyrimidine) for every gene. A SECReTE motif defined by the number of <italic>NNY</italic> triplet repeats where the threshold is ≥10 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref>). Note that a gene may have more than one SECReTE motif along its length, each potentially in a different frame (relative to the coding sequence). The SECReTE count is defined as the number of SECReTE motifs present in a transcript.</p>
<p>For permutation analysis, the codon order of each gene sequence was randomly shuffled 1,000 times to evaluate the statistical significance of the SECReTE count in random sequences with unchanged codon usage. A <italic>Z</italic> score was calculated for each motif according to the formula: <italic>Z</italic> = (Observed–mean)/STD. Observed is the length of the motif in the real gene sequence. Mean is the average SECReTE length for all shuffled sequences of the gene. STD is the standard deviation of the SECReTE length from all shuffled sequences of the gene.</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>Calculation of RRY motif scores</title>
<p>In order to differentiate between SECReTE motifs that follow an <italic>NNY</italic> pattern and those that are simply pyrimidine-rich, an <italic>RRY [R</italic> (purine); G or A)] score was calculated for each defined motif. Since poly-Y conforms to <italic>NNY</italic>, <italic>RRY</italic> was used instead. The score is calculated for every motif by representing each nucleotide of the motif that follows the <italic>RRY</italic> pattern as ‘1’ and each nucleotide that defies this pattern as ‘0’, and taking the average score over the entire length of the motif. The score is calculated for all three possible frames and the maximal score between them is taken for each motif.
