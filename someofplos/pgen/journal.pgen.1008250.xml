<abstract>
<p>Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous disease of significant mortality and with limited treatment options. Recent genomic analysis of HNSCC tumors has identified several distinct molecular classes, of which the mesenchymal subtype is associated with Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and shown to correlate with poor survival and drug resistance. Here, we utilize an integrated approach to characterize the molecular function of ETS1, an oncogenic transcription factor specifically enriched in Mesenchymal tumors. To identify the global ETS1 cistrome, we have performed integrated analysis of RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and epigenomic datasets in SCC25, a representative ETS1<sup>high</sup> mesenchymal HNSCC cell line. Our studies implicate ETS1 as a crucial regulator of broader oncogenic processes and specifically Mesenchymal phenotypes, such as EMT and cellular invasion. We found that ETS1 preferentially binds cancer specific regulator elements, in particular Super-Enhancers of key EMT genes, highlighting its role as a master regulator. Finally, we show evidence that ETS1 plays a crucial role in regulating the TGF-β pathway in Mesenchymal cell lines and in leading-edge cells in primary HNSCC tumors that are endowed with partial-EMT features. Collectively our study highlights ETS1 as a key regulator of TGF-β associated EMT and reveals new avenues for sub-type specific therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The expression of the transcriptional regulator, E26 transformation-specific 1 (ETS1), is elevated in many epithelial cancers and portends aggressive tumor behavior and poor survival. Within these carcinomas, ETS1 function has been shown to be associated with a wide range of cellular responses that include increased proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance. Here we focus on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) and discover that higher expression of ETS1 is specifically more pronounced in the mesenchymal subtypes of HNSCC, which represent tumors with enriched expression of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and inflammation. By using genomic and epigenomic strategies, we have identified the global targets of ETS1 in a preclinical Mesenchymal HNSCC cell model and determined the crucial gene network that is most dependent upon its function. We further validate this ETS1-driven gene expression signature within several HNSCC patient derived datasets and conclude that ETS1 acts as a crucial regulator of the TGFβ signaling cascade to drive EMT. Our findings reinforce the challenges of epithelial tumor heterogeneity and offer insights into molecular underpinning of a specific subtype that can be mined for cancer vulnerability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer world-wide, with an annual incidence of roughly 600,000 cases; 50,000 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States alone[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref002">2</xref>]. HNSCC carries a 5-year mortality rate of nearly 50%, making it a leading cause of cancer-related death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref003">3</xref>]. The major etiologies of this cancer are related to tobacco and alcohol consumption as well as infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has emerged in the past two decades as a prominent risk factor leading to a substantial proportion of HNSCCs diagnosed each year[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref008">8</xref>]. Common treatment regimens for HNSCC include surgery, radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, in the past 15 years, survival has not improved significantly, especially in patients with advanced and recurrent disease, which highlights the need for better understanding of the disease and personalized therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>A challenging aspect of HNSCC biology is that it is inherently a diverse disease, comprised of tumors from distinct anatomical locations spanning the entire upper aerodigestive tract[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, HNSCC presents with enormous variability in patient prognosis as well as response to therapy, which may denote an underlying molecular heterogeneity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref011">11</xref>]. Indeed, recent genomic sequencing studies of HNSCC have revealed this complex heterogeneity, and importantly also highlighted the lack of consensus and actionable driver mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref016">16</xref>]. Initial grouping of HNSCC patients based on the unsupervised clustering of global gene expression revealed four major subtypes that were designated as Basal, Mesenchymal, Classical and Atypical[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref018">18</xref>]. However, the generation of new datasets, particularly those enriched in epigenomic features and the application of advanced bioinformatics tools for meta-analysis have begun to offer us a more detailed view of the various HNSCC molecular subtypes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref021">21</xref>]. Importantly, it is becoming clear that each subtype of HNSCC possess a distinct pattern of gene expression that sets it apart in terms of the underlying biology, key drivers and potentially actionable targets.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the emerging nuances of the clustering profiles of HNSCC, the Mesenchymal subtype of HNSCC remains a persistent entity across various datasets and warrants further investigation due to its aggressive behavior. As implied in its name, the mesenchymal subtype of tumors show enriched expression of key drivers of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and those associated with functional pathways of cell motility and angiogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref024">24</xref>]. Of note, HNSCC tumors characterized by elevated levels of classical EMT markers exhibit high rates of distant metastasis and shorter metastasis-free survival[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref026">26</xref>]. The distinct dysregulated gene expression programs which control phenotypes of the various subtypes of HNSCC, including the ETS1<sup>high</sup> mesenchymal, are likely to be driven by specific transcriptional regulators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref027">27</xref>]. However, our current knowledge of the identity of such factors and understanding of their mechanisms of action remain sparse.</p>
<p>Here, we have utilized a comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic approach to uncover a novel regulator of the Mesenchymal subtype of HNSCC. We show that ETS1, an oncogenic transcription factor (TF) and prototypic member of the ETS family of TFs, is preferentially expressed in Mesenchymal HNSCC across several large-scale transcriptomic datasets. We comprehensively probed the molecular function of ETS1 within a Mesenchymal HNSCC cell-line model, SCC25, by first identifying its direct target genes using a combination of ChIP-Seq analysis, and RNA-Seq analysis. Our studies uncovered a core ETS1 driven Mesenchymal gene signature, which identifies select genes that are highly correlative with the EMT process. Significantly, we observed that one major role of ETS1 could be in driving and maintaining the Mesenchymal state of HNSCC through the TGF-β signaling cascade. Our findings have likely relevance for human HNSCC tumors as exemplified by an enriched ETS1 gene signature in subpopulations of cells exhibiting a partial-EMT state that have been uncovered by recent single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>ETS1 is overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and associated with poor survival</title>
<p>Although an oncogenic role of ETS1 in HNSCC has been previously reported, such studies have been limited in scope predominantly to immunostaining of tumors from a relatively small number of patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, here, we examined available transcriptomic datasets to re-assess the ETS1 expression profile in various stages of HNSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref033">33</xref>]. Our analysis revealed that across multiple microarray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) and RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) based datasets, ETS1 mRNA levels were consistently high in tumors compared to normal tissues and interestingly, showed increasing expression as tumors progressed from dysplastic to carcinoma states. The tumor-enriched expression of ETS1 was most strikingly discernible in the RNA-Seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), where ETS1 levels were higher in ~80% of the patient tumor samples compared to matched normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The high levels of ETS1 was associated with poor prognosis as evident from Kaplan-Meier analysis of a cohort of 97 HNSCC patients, which showed that patients with high ETS1 expression had a statistically significant overall worse outcome than patients with low expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). While patients with low ETS1 expression had a median overall survival time of 61 months, the median overall survival time of patients with high levels of ETS1 expression was reduced to 34 months. Furthermore, ETS1 expression in these patients was shown to significantly correlate with higher clinical stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) with higher levels specifically associated with the late stages (III/IV) of cancer.</p>

<title>ETS1 is enriched in the mesenchymal subtype of HNSCC and is a core component of the EMT signature</title>
<p>The molecular heterogeneity of HNSCC is clearly evident by the four major gene expression subtypes that have been derived from clustering analysis of both microarray and RNA-Seq datasets generated from tumor patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref033">33</xref>]. We sought to both confirm these findings as well as generate an improved subtype specific gene-signature by performing differential gene expression analysis (DEG) on the updated and much larger TCGA RNA-Seq dataset of 504 HNSCC tumors. Hierarchical clustering analysis based on the mRNA expression level of the most highly expressed subtype-specific genes reaffirmed the existence of the four defined subtypes—Atypical (26.2%), Basal (30.6%), Classical (17.6%), and Mesenchymal (25.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As expected, these subtypes were associated with biological functional pathways and processes characteristic of their distinct molecular and cellular attributes. Indeed, gene ontology enrichment analysis of the Mesenchymal (MS) subtype tumors highlighted several processes associated with EMT such as the remodeling of the ECM, cellular locomotion, cellular differentiation in addition to EMT itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s011">S1 Table</xref>, MSigDB Biological Processes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref035">35</xref>]. In contrast, examination of the ontology enrichments for the other three intrinsic subtypes yielded results that matched closely to the original findings from the subtype analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a significant enrichment of ETS1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) in the MS subtype whereas a closely related family member, ETS2 did not show any sub-type specific expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine how well ETS1 expression correlates with EMT, we next used a recently devised robust EMT scoring method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref037">37</xref>]to assess and rank each MS subtype tumor based on their level of EMT. As illustrated in a heatmap highlighting the range of EMT and the expression levels of selected subset of key EMT-related markers, tumors with the highest EMT score were also associated with the highest levels of ETS1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Notably, examination of the distribution of the EMT score across the 4 subtypes of HNSCC clearly showed the MS subtype to have much higher level of enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To validate the findings from this analysis, we examined the respective protein levels of EMT-related genes in HNSCC tumors derived from the TCGA Reverse Phase Protein Array dataset (RPPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref038">38</xref>]. We observed similar overall trends in the protein and mRNA transcript levels of the genes shared between the RPPA and RNA-Seq datasets, as well as strong correlation of ETS1 protein with EMT Score, in agreement with the ETS1 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s002">S2B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>One challenge of working with the available TCGA datasets is the confounding effects of tumor purity on the correlating and clustering analysis of global gene expression. To address this limitation, we next examined RNA-Seq data from 38 HNSCC Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref039">39</xref>]. We reasoned that the PDX datasets are likely to offer a more tumor-centric analysis due to the fact that the human stromal component of PDX models is often lost in early passages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref040">40</xref>] and that the mouse stromal contribution can be eliminated during downstream RNA-Seq processing. Interestingly, even with a relatively small sample size, gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) in the HNSCC PDXs mirrored the established distribution of the HNSCC subtypes (21% Atypical, 26.3% Basal, 13.2% Classical and 39.5% Mesenchymal) and importantly, ETS1 expression was preferentially enriched in Mesenchymal subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) similar to TCGA datasets. Taken together, our analysis across multiple platforms revealed that ETS1 expression is preferentially enriched in the Mesenchymal subtype of HNSCC and it is highly correlated with the EMT score of tumors.</p>

<title>Mapping the genomic targets of ETS1 in SCC25, a prototypic MS subtype of HNSCC cell line</title>
<p>For follow up studies to our observations from tumor datasets and to identify a suitable cell line for downstream function analysis, we next performed RNA-Seq analysis of eight representative HNSCC cell lines. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles of the HNSCC cells allowed us to categorize them based on the intrinsic subtype classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), with two of the tongue-derived SCC cell lines, SCC4 and SCC25 matching the MS subtype. The SCC25 cell line, in particular exhibited the highest level of expression of ETS1 mRNA and importantly, the most enriched EMT score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). The transcriptomic data based findings were corroborated by Western blot analysis with anti-ETS1 antibodies which confirmed relatively higher levels of ETS1 protein in the SCC25, compared to other cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The observation that the HNSCC cell lines retain subtype-specific gene expression profiles prompted us to further validate this in additional publicly available datasets. Similar analysis of RNA-Seq data of HNSCC cells generated by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Project as well as those from a recently published study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref042">42</xref>] yielded similar results, whereupon cell lines of a specific subtype clustered together and segregated into four distinct molecular groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The SCC25 cell line again showed high levels of ETS1 and a EMT-high mesenchymal gene expression program in these two broad datasets and hence was chosen for downstream analysis of ETS1 function.</p>

<p>To examine the molecular mechanisms of ETS1 function, we next identified its global DNA-binding sites in SCC25 cells by ChIP-Seq experiments using two different anti-ETS1 antibodies. By using the ENCODE recommended IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate) method for data analysis, we identified 26,760 ETS1 genomic-bound sites that showed a high correlation among the ChIP-Seq replicates of three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s012">S2 Table</xref>). As expected, de novo motif analysis using MEME revealed the core ETS DNA-Binding motif as the most enriched motif in the ETS1-bound sites. This was further verified by TOMTOM based motif comparison, which revealed that the ChIP-Seq derived motif was nearly identical to the ETS1 DNA-Binding Motif (p = 7.36e-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The distribution of the ETS1 peaks relative to transcription start sites (TSS) showed that ETS1 preferentially bound to distal regulatory regions with the majority of sites being classified as intragenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>ETS1 binding in context of the epigenomic landscape of SCC25 and its preferential targeting of Super-Enhancers</title>
<p>We investigated the ETS1-genomic interactions in the chromatin context by analyzing the histone modification profile around each individual ETS1 binding site, using H3K27Ac, H3K27Me3, H3K4Me1, and H3K4Me3 ChIP-Seq data from the SCC25 cell line. This cohort of histone marks, in various combinations can be used to identify active enhancers (H3K27Ac<sup>High</sup>:H3K4Me1<sup>High</sup>), active promoters (H3K27Ac<sup>High</sup>:H3K4Me3<sup>High</sup>) and poised enhancers (H3K27Me3<sup>High</sup>:H3K4Me1<sup>High</sup>:H3K27Ac<sup>Low</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref044">44</xref>]. By calculating the normalized levels of histone modification ChIP-Seq signal at each ETS1 bound genomic region and performing k-Means clustering of differentially enriched epigenetic profiles, we identified three clusters of ETS1 binding. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s013">S3 Table</xref>). While most of the ETS1 binding overlapped with active regulatory elements characterized by the tell-tale histone modification features of enhancers and promoters, a third distinct cluster of ETS1 binding was found to exhibit epigenetic features of bivalent and poised chromatin domains. Notably, these 3 clusters of ETS1 bound genomic regions were associated with genes associated with different enriched biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The top enriched pathways for genes in the cluster 1 was for the maintenance of stem and epidermal cell differentiation, whereas genes associated with cluster 2 were associated with house-keeping functions such as transcriptional initiation as well as chromatin organization. Interestingly, cluster 3 represented genes involved in the negative regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, as exemplified by the enrichment of genes involved in the inhibition of Notch signaling pathway. The interesting observation that ETS1 shows a contrasting bias of enriched binding to promoters for house-keeping genes and to distal enhancers that are likely to drive tissue-specific gene expression programs is consistent with previous ETS1 ChIP-seq results from other cell types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref045">45</xref>]. Overall, this analysis suggested a global role of ETS1 as a transcriptional regulator of the cellular stem and differentiation state of SCC25 cells in particular, and by extension possibly other epithelial cancer cells in general.</p>
<p>The dynamic interaction of ETS1 with distinct chromatin states prompted us to next examine Super-Enhancers (SEs) that are typically populated by master TFs and have the highest content of the active chromatin mark H3K27ac[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref048">48</xref>]. We generated the SE landscape of SCC25 by implementing the Rose algorithm with the H3K27Ac ChIP-Seq data and identified 965 such regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s014">S4 Table</xref>). As expected, several SEs are associated with master regulators and critical components of epithelial development and differentiation, such as EGFR and TP63, in agreement with the squamous origin of the SCC25 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Additional SE-marked genes included those related to stem cell biology and EMT, such as SOX9 and Vimentin and importantly, ETS1 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, in keeping with the functional importance of SEs, SE-associated genes exhibit higher median expression compared to those associated with Typical Enhancers (TEs) and show enrichment of signaling pathways and processes linked to oncogenic hallmarks such as angiogenesis and the p38 MAPK signaling, in addition to pathways associated with EMT, such as PDGF and WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify potential TFs that might preferentially bind to SEs, we next performed motif enrichment analysis of nucleosome free regions (NFRs) within the SCC25 SEs. By using the motif enrichment tool AME and querying the JASPAR motif database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref049">49</xref>], we found that the ETS motif was one of the most-enriched motif based on multiple hypothesis adjusted p-value, along with AP-1, a known co-factor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref050">50</xref>] of ETS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Indeed, compared to TEs, where only a quarter were bound by ETS1, almost all SEs (98%) were occupied by ETS1, with dense ETS1 binding of an average of nearly 5 times per SE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). This preferential association of ETS1 to SEs is further evident when the average ETS1 ChIP-Seq signal per NFR was compared between SEs and TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest preferred binding of ETS1 in the SEs of SCC25 as a mode to regulate various important cellular facets of HNSCC.</p>

<title>Loss of ETS1 Inhibits SCC25 and SCC4 cellular growth and invasion</title>
<p>In order to investigate the functional relevance of ETS1 and to identify its target genes, we next undertook knockdown (kd) studies. Towards this end, we used a lentiviral based system to generate SCC25 cells that stably express previously validated ETS1-targeting shRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref051">51</xref>] or a control, non-targeting shRNA (shCON). Efficient and specific knockdown of ETS1 was achieved by two independent shRNAs, sh2 and sh3, as evident by western blot analysis which showed robust loss of ETS1 expression but no effect on closely related ETS2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Based on results obtained from several independent experiments, ETS1kd by sh3 was more robust and consistent, in agreement with published results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref051">51</xref>]. Hence for most of the subsequent studies, SCC25 stable cells with sh3-mediated knockdown were utilized and independent verification of key findings were performed by ETS1kd by sh2, wherever necessary. Reduced ETS1 expression and/or overexpression of ETS1 in other cell lines, including prostate and breast cancer cells have been previously shown to influence cell growth and migration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref055">55</xref>]. To examine if ETS1 behaved similarly in SCC25 cells, we examined the effect of the loss of ETS1 using a MTT proliferation assay. A significant reduction in percent cell growth was observed in the cells expressing the ETS1kd compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To follow-up on these observations, we assessed the requirement of ETS1 for the SCC25 cells to migrate and invade in both 2D and 3D cell culture model systems. We first used the wound healing scratch assay to assess the ability of a confluent mono-layer of the stably transfected SCC25 cells to invade into identical denuded, cell-free areas within a cell culture plate. To negate the confounding effects of the cell proliferation defects upon loss of ETS1, we performed the wounding experiment after treating the cells with mitomycin, a proven cell growth inhibitor. Loss of ETS1 greatly inhibited the ability of SCC25 cells to migrate into the cell-free zone since after 48 hours, while the control cells completely closed the wound, the ETS1-depleted cells managed to invade only ~20% (sh3) or 40% (sh2) of the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Next, we tested the ability of ETS1-depleted SCC25 cells to invade through 3D matrix by using the Boyden chamber invasion assay. The control SCC25 cells had nearly 7 times more cells invade as compared to the SCC25-ETS1kd cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). To confirm these findings, we next decided to perform similar independent experiments with the SCC4 cell line, which is not only mesenchymal in its gene expression traits but also has high expression of ETS1. Stable SCC4 cells were established for ETS1 knockdown by shRNAs, sh2 and sh3 as in SCC25 cell line. The effects of loss of ETS1 was more pronounced in SCC4 cell line such that the cells infected with the more potent sh3 were severely growth arrested and could not be propagated long term in culture easily. However, MTT proliferation and wound healing scratch assays with SCC4 control and ETS1sh2kd cells recapitulated the findings of SCC25 cells with loss of ETS1 leading to inhibition of cell growth and migratory capacity, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results confirmed previous findings and supported the notion that ETS1 plays an important role in the growth, proliferation and migratory potential of the HNSCC mesenchymal cells.</p>

<title>Loss of ETS1-induced gene Expression leads to disrupted TGFB signaling</title>
<p>As a means to identify ETS1 targets, we next performed RNA-Seq experiments to profile the global transcriptomic changes that are unleashed upon loss of ETS1. For these studies, we employed both siRNA transfected SCC25 cells and the previously described shRNA transduced SCC25 stable cell lines to examine the short and long term effects of ETS1 loss, respectively. As to be expected from prolonged loss of ETS1, shRNA mediated ETSkd resulted in a significant alteration in the mRNA landscape of the SCC25 cells with 6727 genes showing statistically meaningful changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s015">S5 Table</xref>). In contrast, the changes associated with the siRNA mediated knockdown were modest, resulting in 786 genes with significant up or down regulation despite the marked reduction in the levels of ETS1 transcripts in the ETS1-siRNA treated cells. Interestingly, there was a 67% overlap in Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) profile between the two experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s015">S5 Table</xref>). This raised the possibility that some of the effects of loss of ETS1 are transitory in nature–indeed there were 243 genes that were altered only in the siRNA experiment. This cohort of DEGs that were exclusive to the siRNA-mediated knockdown of ETS1 were involved in PI3K signaling, as well as processes that have been associated with EMT in cancer such as inflammation and FGF signaling. A number of altered genes also included members of the WNT and Notch signaling cascades, which are involved in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency and have also been linked to EMT and cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the long-term effects of constitutive loss of ETS1 are likely to be pronounced, we followed up on a larger cohort of genes that showed differential gene expression in response to the shRNA mediated knockdown of ETS1. We found that a high percentage of the significantly altered genes (5991 out of 6727) were also direct targets of ETS1 based on ChIP-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s015">S5 Table</xref>). To facilitate further analysis, we focused on genes that change at least 2-fold in expression, and identified 1038 such transcriptional targets of ETS1. We first used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Regulator Effects tool to match significantly altered genes with their associated biological phenotypes. Interestingly, the analysis highlighted a number of predicted biological effects due to loss of ETS1, such as tumor cell migration and invasion, cell cycle progression and tumor growth, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Next, we correlated the function of ETS1 to known upstream transcriptional regulators as well as the signaling cascades under their control using the IPA Upstream Regulator tool. Interestingly, we observed that the one major subset of ETS1-driven DEGs, consisting of 233 genes were significantly associated with the activation of TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The link between TGF-β signaling and its role in inducing EMT has been established across numerous cancer models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref058">58</xref>]. Our findings suggested that ETS1 could function as a driver of the mesenchymal phenotype of the SCC25 cells by acting as a regulator of TGF-β signaling. We further validated ETS1/TGF-β link by examining the enrichment of ETS1 direct targets in established gene-signatures related to TGF-β activation in cancer. We observed a significant overlap of 188 ETS1 target genes, with 118 of those displaying perfect correlation with the DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s016">S6 Table</xref>, p = 4.0e-28, Fisher’s exact test) when compared with a comprehensive EMT gene signature that has been recently developed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref059">59</xref>].</p>

<p>Given the likelihood that ETS1 could be driving and maintaining the mesenchymal gene expression program of SCC25 through the regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, we next examined the activation status of Smad2, the major receptor-activated Smad downstream of TGF-β signaling. For this purpose, the stably transfected control and the ETS1 sh2 and sh3 transduced SCC25 cells were stimulated with 1ng/ml and 5ng/ml of TGF-β1 for 1, 3 and 24 hours and examined by western blot analysis. Interestingly, we observed a dramatic decrease in overall levels of p-Smad2 in the ETS1kd cells as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Additionally, we observed a decrease in the overall phosphorylation levels of p-Smad2 over time, which was not observed in the control cells; the shCON cells maintained high levels of p-Smad2 after TGF-β1 stimulation in all durations of treatment. Similar effects of TGF-β signaling, specifically the reduced levels of p-Smad2 in the ETS1kd as compared to the control cells were also observed for SCC4 cells, particularly after 24 hours of TGF-β treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). These findings suggest ETS1 plays a role in maintaining the overall activation state of the TGF-β signaling pathway.</p>
<p>The strong association of ETS1 function with TGF-β induced EMT pathway prompted us to further validate this relationship with an independent gene-signature aimed at quantifying the EMT status of a tumor. Towards this end, we utilized a EMT signature that has been derived from the common molecular EMT features of several epithelial cancer types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref060">60</xref>] and found a significant overlap with the SCC25 ETS1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s017">S7 Table</xref>, 143/315, p = 1.49e-9 Fisher’s Exact Test). As evident from the heatmap, a number of key EMT related genes, such as VIM, AXL and SNAIL2 were downregulated after knockdown of ETS1. In contrast, genes representing the reverse state of Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition (MET) were upregulated, implying a potential repressive role for ETS1 in keeping the epithelial state of SCC25 suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). We independently confirmed the altered expression of the protein levels of some of these EMT/MET associated genes by western blot analysis of both the SCC25 and SCC4 control and ETS1sh2 and sh3 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008250.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>ETS1 directs a mesenchymal gene expression program in HNSCC</title>
<p>The strong association of ETS1 with the MS subtype of HNSCC tumors prompted us to compare the mesenchymal specific gene signature derived from the TCGA RNA-Seq dataset with the ETS1 target genes in SCC25. There was a significant overlap between the two sets of gene lists (p = 1.84e-5, Fisher’s Exact Test) resulting in the identification of a core ETS1 driven 169 Mesenchymal gene signature (ETS1 MGS, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s018">S8 Table</xref>). Interestingly, nearly 18% of these genes were found to associated with a SE and included AXL, a known regulator of cancer associated EMT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref061">61</xref>]. Spurred by these findings, we decided to test whether the ETS1 MGS could act as an independent means of classifying HNSCC, especially as the core ETS1 MGS did not include any of the classical EMT markers. After classifying each tumor as EMT-High, EMT-Mid and EMT-Low, based on the distribution of EMT Scores, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA) to measure and visualize the variance in gene expression within TCGA HNSCC Tumors as a function of the ETS1 MGS. The resulting PCA plot displayed a striking degree of variability between the different tumors, however; the centroids of each group of tumors appeared as clearly separated entities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Indeed, the first two principal components were associated with the total expression of the ETS1 MGS, which in turn was highly correlated with the distribution of EMT scores within the tumors. This finding indicated that the ETS1 MGS was able to cluster HNSCC based upon an intrinsic Mesenchymal gene expression program.</p>
<p>As a final test of a possible functional role of ETS1 as a regulator of EMT in tumorigenesis, we probed the scRNA-Seq datasets of HNSCC that have been described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref028">28</xref>]. In this study, a sub-population of cells were identified that were defined by a partial-EMT (p-EMT) gene-expression program, and enrichment for TGF-β signaling. To identify a possible association of ETS1 with the p-EMT signature, we examined the enriched genes identified in these cell populations to see if they are also represented in the ETS1 MGS. Interestingly, we observed a significant overlap between the ETS1 MS Signature derived from our study and the top 100 genes enriched in p-EMT cells (p-value = 7.144e-12, hypergeometric test) as well as a significant overlap with the non-negative factorization analysis derived p-EMT gene signatures (p = 2.514e-21, hypergeometric test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008250.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Taken together these findings are highly suggestive of a potential role of ETS1 in maintaining the EMT state in HNSCC, possibly as a master regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The complex heterogeneity of HNSCC, similar to cancers from other anatomical locations, is clearly evident in the distinct gene expression profile of its subtypes. To better understand this heterogeneity, it is important to dissect the complex molecular circuitry that governs the dysregulated transcriptional networks in a given subtype. One powerful approach towards this end is to identify and characterize the master TFs which are likely to drive, maintain and elicit the tell-tale characteristics of a given tumor subtype. Among such oncogenic TFs, the ETS family of proteins are emerging as crucial mediators of tumorigenesis. Indeed, ETS factors are aberrantly activated in cancer by a slew of molecular mechanisms that include chromosomal translocation, overexpression, or post-translational modifications[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref062">62</xref>]. These ETS driven alterations in turn induce dysregulated gene expression programs that are likely to be essential in various facets of tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>As a prototypic and founding member of the ETS family, ETS1 has been widely studied and implicated in a variety of solid tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref063">63</xref>]. Overall, data from such studies have often linked ETS1 expression to advanced state of epithelial cancers with poorer differentiation, higher invasive activity and angiogenesis, an increased risk to metastasis and a higher tendency to acquire drug resistance–all hallmark features of cancer. Despite such clear associations, the molecular attributes of ETS1, in particular its target gene repertoire and function in context of a defined tumor subtype remains ill-understood. Here we have comprehensively examined ETS1 in HNSCC, where we find ETS1 to be specifically enriched in expression across cell lines, human tumors and PDXs representing the mesenchymal subtype and associated with poor tumor outcome. To gain mechanistic insights into its function, we have undertaken genomic and epigenomic based identification and analysis of the ETS1-dependent cistrome in the SCC25 cell line, which has revealed several interesting findings.</p>
<p>Foremost, we uncovered that the direct and indirect target genes of ETS1 are quite extensive and impinge upon virtually all key aspects of tumorigenesis. Our findings are in some ways different from similar studies performed in prostate cancer cells, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref053">53</xref>] where the number of ETS1 bound elements are significantly smaller compared to those in the SCC25 cells. We suspect that this might be in part due to the robust nature of our ChIP experiments, having utilized two independent antibodies. Our ETS1-genomic interactions are further strengthened by the overlay of active histone marks, which has allowed us to gain exciting insights into the ETS1-chromatin interactions and the distinct clusters of regulatory elements that are bound by ETS1. Importantly, the proclivity of ETS1 to be enriched for binding in the Super-Enhancer regions and for itself to be regulated by a SCC25 Super-Enhancer is broadly suggestive of its crucial function and specifically the existence of a potential feed-forward loop. It is worth noting that similar enrichment of ETS motifs and the binding of ETS2 have been reported in Super-Enhancers identified in other contexts, such as skin SCC and nasopharyngeal cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref065">65</xref>]. The remarkable structural and functional similarity of ETS1 and ETS2 hints at an interesting crosstalk and possible redundant interplay between these closely related TFs in HNSCC subtypes. Recent studies however suggest that ETS1 and ETS2 can also direct gene expression programs in opposite directions allowing these TFs to switch between oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions in cell-type specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref066">66</xref>]–whether similar mechanisms are at play in HNSCC begs further investigation.</p>
<p>We have performed extensive examination of the ETS1 target genes by integrating RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq experiments. These studies have reaffirmed the notion that ETS1 casts a wide net in regulating the transcriptional network of cancer cells, affecting virtually all key hallmarks of cancer. Prominent among these ETS1-dependent processes and pathways are cell proliferation and migration, angiogenesis, inflammation and in keeping with the mesenchymal nature of the SCC25 cells, EMT. Interestingly, many of these processes are also affected in our previously described transgenic mouse model of ETS1 overexpression in squamous epithelium that leads to dysplasia and inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref068">68</xref>]. In this context, it is also worth noting that although ETS1 has not firmly secured its place alongside the classical EMT-TFs, prevailing evidence from past literature and our present study illustrate its growing and pervasive role in Type I (developmental), Type II (inflammation and wounding) and Type III (neoplasia) EMT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref063">63</xref>]. Indeed, a recent pan cancer survey of EMT markers across the TCGA has revealed ETS1 to be one of the highest ranked TF which showed significant EMT correlations within multiple tumor types that span various histological or cellular backgrounds[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref069">69</xref>].</p>
<p>We posit that our findings on the ETS1-TGF-β-EMT axis in SCC25 and SCC4 cells are considerably strengthened by similar trends in cells with partial-EMT that are localized to the leading edge of primary HNSCC tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref028">28</xref>]. These associations might have implications for a range of other solid tumors, some of which are also endowed with mesenchymal features, such as Claudin-low breast cancer. Our findings are also supported by results from studies on CD90(+) tumor initiating cell population from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where the deregulation of an ETS1/MMP signaling pathway and EMT figure prominently[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref070">70</xref>]. Taken together our discovery of ETS1 as a biomarker of mesenchymal HNSCC and a master regulator of key EMT genes offers promising new avenues for targeted therapeutic possibilities that are tumor subtype specific. This includes possible re-purposing of clinically approved drugs such as Dasatinib, which has been shown to target ETS1 for proteasomal degradation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref051">51</xref>].</p>

Briefly, to check for self-consistency, each bam file was randomly split into two parts with approximately equal number of reads to create pseudo-replicates. Then pooled data files were generated from all of the actual replicates by using the merge function in SAMtools v1.3. MACS2 v2.1.0 peak-calling software was used to call peaks from all three types of files (original replicates, pseudo-replicates and pooled files) under low statistical stringency (P-value: 5e-2) using a merged input as control[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref080">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008250.ref082">82</xref>].

A causal network, which construct relationships between the changes in gene expression after knockdown of ETS1 and the downstream phenotypic and molecular changes occurring in SCC25, was created using the Regulator Effect tool under default parameters.</p>

<title>Principal component analysis of the TCGA HNSC dataset using the ETS1 mesenchymal signature</title>
<p>The expression of the ETS1 Mesenchymal Signature within the TCGA HNSC Dataset was used as input for PCA analysis. Each tumor’s EMT score was calculated and Fisher-Transformed. Tumors were classified as EMT High, Neutral or Low, based on the distribution of EMT scores, with Low being defined in the first quartile, High as the third and Neutral as in between.</p>
