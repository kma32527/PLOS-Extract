<abstract>
<p>Red light promotes germination after activating phytochrome phyB, which destabilizes the germination repressor PIF1. Early upon seed imbibition, canopy light, unfavorable for photosynthesis, represses germination by stabilizing PIF1 after inactivating phyB. Paradoxically, later upon imbibition, canopy light stimulates germination after activating phytochrome phyA. phyA-mediated germination is poorly understood and, intriguingly, is inefficient, compared to phyB-mediated germination, raising the question of its physiological significance. A genetic screen identified <italic>polyamine uptake transporter 2</italic> (<italic>put2</italic>) mutants that overaccumulate polyamines, a class of antioxidant polycations implicated in numerous cellular functions, which we found promote phyA-mediated germination. In WT seeds, our data suggest that canopy light represses polyamines accumulation through PIF1 while red light promotes polyamines accumulation. We show that canopy light also downregulates PIF1 levels, through phyA; however, PIF1 reaccumulates rapidly, which limits phyA-mediated germination. High polyamines levels in decaying seeds bypass PIF1 repression of germination and stimulate phyA-mediated germination, suggesting an adaptive mechanism promoting survival when viability is compromised.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Canopy light, unfavorable for photosynthesis, elicits paradoxical responses in seeds. Depending on the timing of irradiation upon seed imbibition, canopy light can either block or promote germination. The promotion effect is mediated by the light sensor phyA and, intriguingly, it is poorly efficient when compared to that of red light, which is favorable for photosynthesis. Why would germination be stimulated by canopy light, which is not favorable for young seedling photosynthesis? We show that phyA-mediated germination is greatly enhanced in decaying seeds, which overaccumulate polyamines, a class of antioxidant molecules that promote germination. We propose an adaptive rationale for phyA-mediated germination: in decaying seeds it becomes advantageous to germinate even under canopy light as a last chance for seedling survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Seeds are capsules maintaining the plant embryo in a resistant state and promoting plant dispersal. To successfully produce a seedling, seeds are able to remain viable over time and block their germination under potentially fatal conditions for the seedling.</p>
<p>However, over time seeds irremediably accumulate oxidative events, which eventually will compromise their viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref002">2</xref>]. Seeds limit oxidative damage through antioxidants or physical barriers limiting oxygen access to the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref005">5</xref>]. Polyamines (PAs) are small polycations ubiquitously present in all living organisms where they regulate numerous fundamental cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation and post-translational modification, cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref008">8</xref>]. However, how PAs perform these functions is poorly understood. In response to oxidative stress PA levels rise and protect cells by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by increasing antioxidant enzymes activity in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref013">13</xref>]. However, whether PAs accumulate in Arabidopsis seeds after oxidative stress is unknown.</p>
<p>Arabidopsis seeds control their germination after perceiving abiotic parameters in their environment. This triggers signaling responses leading to opposite level changes of abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA), two hormones that repress and promote germination, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The quality of light perceived by the light receptor phytochromes phyB and phyA exerts a profound influence on seed germination. Phytochromes control the abundance of the transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (PIF1), a key germination repressor regulating ABA and GA levels in seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref014">14</xref>]. Red (R) light, favorable for photosynthesis, promotes germination while canopy light, enriched in far red (FR) light, represses germination. Early upon seed imbibition, a R pulse photoconverts phyB into its active P<sub>fr</sub>B form that interacts with PIF1 and promote its destruction, thus promoting germination. In contrast, a pulse of FR light photoconverts phyB into its inactive P<sub>r</sub>B form, which leads to PIF1 stabilization, thus preventing germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Paradoxically, a second FR light pulse applied later on upon imbibition promotes germination by activating phyA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref018">18</xref>]. Intriguingly, unlike R light, FR light promotes germination inefficiently and erratically among seed batches. This low efficiency was linked to limiting phyA levels and strong ABA-dependent responses early upon seed imbibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref017">17</xref>]. However, regulation of endogenous PIF1 levels by FR light through phyA has not been reported. phyA-mediated germination was interpreted as a last chance to form a seedling despite the presence of unfavorable canopy light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref019">19</xref>]. Yet, its low efficiency suggests that its physiological significance is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Here we found that recessive mutations in <italic>POLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER 2</italic> (<italic>PUT2</italic>) enhance phyA-mediated germination. <italic>put2</italic> seeds overaccumulate PAs and we show that PAs stimulate phyA-mediated germination. In WT seeds, our data suggest that upon phyB inactivation after an early FR pulse, PIF1 represses PAs accumulation. phyB activation by R light promotes PIF1 downregulation and PAs accumulation. Upon phyA activation by a second FR pulse, PIF1 is downregulated but, surprisingly, increase in PAs accumulation does not take place. We propose that this differential regulation of PAs levels arises from the duration of PIF1 extinction time, which is longer after R than after FR light irradiation. Accelerated aging procedures stimulated PAs accumulation and markedly enhanced phyA-mediated germination without downregulating PIF1 levels. Our results suggest that decaying seeds bypass PIF1-dependent repression of PAs accumulation to enhance phyA-mediated germination even under unfavorable canopy light conditions.</p>

<p>Hereafter a “FR assay” refers to the procedure where seeds are irradiated with a single far red (FR) pulse early upon imbibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In a “FR/Nh/FR assay” seeds are irradiated with two FR pulses separated by an N hour (h) time interval, typically 48 hours (N = 48) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In a “FR/R assay” seeds are irradiated with a FR pulse early upon imbibition immediately followed by a red (R) light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>POLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER 2</italic> (<italic>PUT2</italic>) in a genetic screen for mutants with enhanced phyA-mediated germination responses</title>
<p>To better understand why phyA-mediated germination is limited in seeds, we sought to identify negative regulators of phyA signaling by screening for mutants displaying enhanced phyA-dependent seed germination responses. We generated a transgenic line carrying a firefly <italic>LUCIFERASE</italic> (<italic>LUC</italic>) reporter gene under the control of <italic>GA3ox1</italic> promoter sequences (<italic>pGA3ox1</italic>::<italic>LUC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref020">20</xref>]. High <italic>GA3ox1</italic> expression is characteristic of seeds undergoing germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>pGA3ox1</italic>::<italic>LUC</italic> seeds were mutagenized using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS).</p>
<p>FR/12h/FR assays lead to lower phyA-dependent germination relative to FR/48h/FR assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref017">17</xref>]. Thus, to identify negative regulators of phyA-dependent germination, we screened for <italic>pGA3ox1</italic>::<italic>LUC</italic> mutant seeds displaying high LUC bioluminescence and germination in a FR/12h/FR assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s001">S1A Fig</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> for details). Mutants identified in this manner were propagated and the resulting seed progeny was further studied. This led to identify 5 recessive and independent mutants, named <italic>fr/fr germination 1</italic>–<italic>5</italic> (<italic>ffg1</italic>-<italic>ffg5</italic>) having enhanced germination in a FR/12h/FR assay relative to the parental non-mutagenized <italic>pGA3ox1</italic>::<italic>LUC</italic> (Parent.) line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s001">S1B–S1D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, among these mutants, we found two mutants (<italic>ffg4</italic> and <italic>ffg5</italic>) having high germination percentage in a FR assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). <italic>ffg4</italic> had a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 370 in <italic>PIF1</italic>/<italic>PIL5</italic> (At2g20180), which resulted in the substitution of Trp-94 with a Stop codon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). <italic>ffg5</italic> had a mutation at the splicing site of the third intron of the ABA biosynthetic gene <italic>ABA1</italic> (At5g67030) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). <italic>PIF1</italic>/<italic>PIL5</italic> and ABA were previously shown to negatively regulate phyB signaling and were therefore not further studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>We also identified three independent recessive mutants that did not germinate in a FR assay but showed enhanced phyA-mediated germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>).

<title><italic>put2</italic> mutant seeds have high polyamine levels</title>
<p>PUT2 belongs to the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) transporter superfamily, which has four homologs in Arabidopsis: PUT1, PUT3, PUT4 and PUT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref028">28</xref>].

<p>PUT2, PUT1 and PUT3 were shown to transport polyamines (PAs) in yeast and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref030">30</xref>]. This suggested that enhanced phyA-mediated seed germination of <italic>put2</italic> seeds could result from defects in PAs cellular distribution or metabolism in seeds. The most abundant PAs in plants are putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm). Di-amine Put is made from arginine and is essential for plant survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref031">31</xref>]. Two spermidine synthases (SPDS1 and 2) are responsible for tri-amine Spd synthesis from Put, and spermine synthase (SPMS) is responsible for tetra-amine Spm synthesis from Spd. Spd, but not Spm, is essential for plant survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>We measured free Put, Spd and Spm accumulation in seeds exposed to a FR assay 24h after FR light irradiation. In WT seeds, overall PAs levels, i.e. the sum of Put, Spd and Spm levels, were variable between seed batches ranging from about 600 nmol per gram of seed dry weight (nmol/g DW) to 1,800 nmol/g DW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). In every WT seed batch, Spd was the most abundant PA followed by Put and Spm. Overall PAs levels and the relative amounts of Put, Spd and Spm in <italic>put1</italic>, <italic>put3</italic>, <italic>put4</italic> and <italic>put5</italic> mutant seeds were similar to WT seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In contrast, overall PAs levels in <italic>put2-3</italic> mutant seeds were systematically markedly higher relative to WT seeds among different seed batches, mostly due to higher Spd and Spm levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). In dry seeds, higher PAs levels were also specifically observed in <italic>put2-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). Similar results were obtained with <italic>put2-1</italic>, <italic>put2-2</italic> and <italic>par1-1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s006">S6D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These observations therefore suggest that high PAs levels could be responsible for the enhanced phyA-mediated seed germination in <italic>put2</italic> mutant seeds, i.e. that PAs are positive regulators of phyA signaling in seeds.</p>

<title>High PA levels are associated with enhanced phyA-mediated seed germination</title>
<p>To further study the role of PAs in regulating phyA signaling in seeds, we considered assessing phyA-mediated responses in absence of endogenous PAs. However, PAs regulate fundamental cellular processes and mutations preventing PA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis are lethal, which makes this task challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Instead, we considered identifying seeds with higher PAs levels. Five polyamine oxidases in Arabidopsis (PAO1-PAO5) catabolize PAs by converting Spm to Spd and Spd to Put [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref034">34</xref>]. Previous reports showed that <italic>pao1</italic>—<italic>pao5</italic> single mutants accumulate higher individual or overall PAs levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref035">35</xref>]. However, in some cases, as with <italic>pao4</italic> mutants, lower levels in individual PAs were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref036">36</xref>]. PAs levels in <italic>pao1</italic>—<italic>pao5</italic> single mutant seeds were not previously reported. We observed moderately higher, i.e. less than twofold, overall PAs levels in <italic>pao1</italic>—<italic>pao5</italic> seeds relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>PAO1 and PAO5 are localized in the cytosol whereas PAO2, PAO3 and PAO4 are localized in the peroxisome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref034">34</xref>]. We measured PAs levels in <italic>pao1pao5</italic> and <italic>pao2pao4</italic> double mutants, defective in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal PAO activity, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref037">37</xref>]. We found more than twofold higher PAs levels in <italic>pao2pao4</italic> double mutants whereas <italic>pao1pao5</italic> double mutants had moderately higher, i.e. less than twofold, PAs levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Strikingly, only <italic>pao2pao4</italic> double mutant seed germination was markedly enhanced in a FR/48h/FR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3F–3H</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that addition of individual PAs in the germination plates enhanced phyA-mediated germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these observations support the hypothesis that PAs are positive regulators of phyA-mediated seed germination.</p>

<p>Whether oxidative stress promotes PAs accumulation in seeds was not previously investigated. To address this question, we subjected WT seeds to a controlled deterioration treatment (CDT), which promotes oxidative stress and artificially accelerates seed aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref040">40</xref>]. Increased oxidative stress upon seed exposure to CDT was verified by measuring superoxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> levels in seeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Next, seeds that had undergone CDT were exposed to a FR/48h/FR assay and PAs levels were measured 24h after the second FR light pulse. As anticipated, PAs levels increased after exposure to 6 days of CDT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). The increase in PAs levels was not as pronounced as in <italic>put2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous results, seeds exposed to white light or a FR/R assay decreased their seed germination percentage from 100% to 90% after exposure to CDT, indicating that seeds that had been exposed to CDT started to lose their viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref041">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s008">S8A, S8B and S8C Fig</xref>). In contrast, the germination percentage in a FR/48h/FR assay markedly increased from 12% to 67% after exposure to CDT, i.e. nearer to the germination percentage observed in a FR/R assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). A similar trend was obtained with independent seed batches exposed to CDT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s008">S8B and S8C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these data further strengthen the notion that high endogenous PAs levels in seeds enhance phyA-mediated germination.</p>
<p>We next sought to better understand 1) what makes phyA-mediated germination less efficient than phyB-mediated germination and 2) whether this low efficiency reflects how PA levels are regulated by light in seeds. These questions were addressed by studying the role of PIF1, a key light regulated germination repressor, in regulating endogenous PAs levels. We first monitored endogenous PIF1 accumulation in seeds exposed to light treatments conducive of phyA-mediated germination, which was not previously reported.</p>

<p>The phyA-mediated germination percentage of WT seeds exposed to a FR/12h/FR, and FR/48h/FR was 0% and 2%, respectively, whereas in seeds exposed to a FR/96h/FR assay it jumped to 37% despite de modest increase in phyA levels between 48h and 96h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This is consistent with previous results showing that phyA levels and the percentage of phyA-mediated germination are not linearly correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref017">17</xref>]. In contrast, and as expected, close to 100% phyB-mediated germination was observed in WT seeds exposed to a FR/R assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>We monitored endogenous PIF1 accumulation in seeds exposed to the different above FR/Nh/FR assays (N = 12, 48, 96), conducive of phyA-mediated germination. Irrespective of the time of its application, the second FR pulse did not affect markedly phyA protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, the second FR pulse triggered, within one hour, rapid PIF1 downregulation in all assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As expected, endogenous PIF1 downregulation was not observed in <italic>phyA</italic> mutant seeds but observed in <italic>phyBCDE</italic> mutant seeds, showing that PIF1 downregulation is driven by phyA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, and surprisingly, FR and R light are similarly able to downregulate PIF1 levels even though they do not stimulate germination with the same efficiency. We therefore wondered whether the duration of PIF1 extinction time could be different after R and later FR light irradiation. Indeed, the duration of PIF1 extinction time was about 12h longer after a R pulse than after a second FR pulse in both a FR48hFR assay or a FR96hFR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether these observations show that phyA levels in seeds are not limiting to promote PIF1 downregulation in response to a second FR light pulse applied at different times upon imbibition. They rather suggest that phyA-mediated germination is inefficient, at least in part, due to the short duration of PIF1 extinction following FR irradiation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, publicly available data indicate that expression of four polyamine biosynthesis genes is higher in <italic>pif1</italic> mutant seeds relative to WT seeds exposed to a FR assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref044">44</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s010">S10A–S10D Fig</xref>).

This suggested that PIF1 represses PAs accumulation in seeds exposed to a FR assay.</p>
<p>To evaluate this possibility, we measured PAs levels in WT and <italic>pif1</italic> seeds exposed to a FR assay. Consistent with this hypothesis, PAs levels were higher in <italic>pif1</italic> mutant seeds relative to WT seeds exposed to FR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). These data are consistent with the view that PIF1 represses PAs accumulation in seeds after an early FR light pulse.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether PAs levels increase under conditions conducive of phyA-mediated germination. Unlike WT seeds exposed to a R pulse, PAs levels did not change after a second FR pulse relative to seeds exposed to a single FR pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggest that the short duration of PIF1 extinction upon a second FR light pulse irradiation does not permit the elevation of PAs levels in seeds. As a result, low PAs levels would contribute to the low efficiency of phyA-mediated germination (see model below).</p>

<title>Model for phyA-mediated germination in young and decaying seeds.</title>
<p>(Left panel) In younger seeds a second FR pulse late upon seed imbibition (2<sup>nd</sup> FR) promotes PIF1 downregulation after activating phyA. However, PIF1 extinction time is short (asterisk), which maintains low PA levels and renders phyA-mediated germination less efficient. (Right panel) In decaying seeds, PIF1 extinction time after a second FR pulse remains short (asterisk). However, accumulation of oxidative damage (red symbol) leads to high PA levels thus bypassing PIF1 repression of PA accumulation. In turn, high PA levels enhance phyA-mediated germination. PAs could inhibit PIF1-dependent repression of germination or, alternatively, could promote phyA-mediated germination independently of PIF1 (putative “X” pathway). As seeds age, dry seeds decay due to accumulation of oxidative events, which compromises their capacity to form a viable seedling upon imbibition. In decaying seeds, oxidative stress promotes high PAs levels that could protect cells through their antioxidant activity while in parallel enhancing phyA-mediated seed germination as a last chance to survive even under unfavorable canopy light.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we sought to better understand how seed germination is promoted by canopy light through phyA. We focused on understanding why this process is poorly efficient and its physiological relevance.</p>
<p>Downstream phyA signaling components in seeds are poorly characterized. Their identification and study is rendered difficult by the fact that observing phyA-mediated germination requires first blocking germination through phyB inactivation. In the case of <italic>pif1</italic> mutants, which fully germinate after an early FR pulse, germination mediated by phyA cannot be observed. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that PIF1 represses germination downstream of phyA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we found that <italic>put2</italic> mutants are specifically enhanced in phyA-mediated germination (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g002">2</xref>), which was not previously reported. <italic>PUT2</italic> encodes a PAs transporter and we showed that among other mutants deficient in homologous transporters only <italic>put2</italic> mutants accumulate high PAs levels in seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Similarly, mutants deficient in PAs catabolism or WT seeds exposed to CDT increased PAs levels in seeds and enhanced phyA-mediated germination (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g004">4</xref>). Thus, our study provides correlative evidence suggesting that increased PAs levels in seeds positively regulate phyA-mediated germination.</p>
<p>High PAs accumulation in <italic>put2</italic> seeds could result from inappropriate distribution of PAs in cells. PUT2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and the chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref045">45</xref>]. A <italic>put2</italic> mutant cell sensing low PAs accumulation in the Golgi or chloroplast might respond with increased PAs synthesis as a compensatory mechanism. <italic>put2</italic> had increased Spd and Spm levels whereas WT seeds exposed to CDT and <italic>pao2pao4</italic> mutants had mainly higher Spd levels. Furthermore, PUT2 preferentially transports Spd in yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref029">29</xref>]. This could suggest that Spd is important to enhance phyA-mediated germination. However, exogenous application of Put, Spd and Spm similarly promoted phyA-mediated germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Thus, our study does not pinpoint a particular individual PA specifically promoting phyA-mediated germination. Understanding the role of an individual PAs in phyA signaling using genetic approaches is difficult since, to our best knowledge, there are no reported PA biosynthesis mutants accumulating a single PA.</p>
<p>It remains to be understood how PAs promote phyA signaling in seeds. L-arginine is a precursor of Put and S-adenosylmethionine is a precursor of Spd and Spm. However, they are also precursors of nitric oxide (NO) and ethylene, respectively. Indeed, enhanced PAs accumulation was linked to an increase in NO levels and associated with both an increase and decrease in ethylene signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref048">48</xref>]. NO and ethylene repress ABA responses in seeds and therefore PAs could enhance germination by repressing ABA signaling through NO or ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref049">49</xref>]. Against this possibility, we found that <italic>put2</italic> mutants have normal ABA responses in seeds, consistent with a previous report showing that <italic>par1</italic> mutants have normal ABA responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref024">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008292.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). PAs are involved in a wide range of fundamental cellular processes including DNA replication, transcription, translation and post-translational modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref007">7</xref>]. PAs were also speculated to participate in abiotic stress signaling in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref050">50</xref>]. In all cases, the mechanism by which PAs act is poorly understood as they are difficult to study due to their ubiquitous presence in cells and their essential function for survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data suggest that endogenous PAs accumulation is repressed by PIF1 in WT seeds exposed to an early FR pulse. This indicates that PAs biosynthesis is regulated downstream of PIF1. The biological significance of the regulation of PA biosynthesis gene expression and PAs levels in seeds by light remains to be understood. On the other hand, PAs levels were higher in <italic>put2</italic> mutants or in WT seeds exposed to CDT and the resulting increase in phyA-mediated germination took place without changes in PIF1 levels. Therefore, this suggests that PAs levels can be regulated independently of PIF1 to regulate phyA-mediated germination. PAs could promote phyA-mediated germination downstream of PIF1. However, transcriptomic studies have suggested that phyA activation by FR also triggers gene expression changes independently of PIF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, PAs could promote phyA-mediated germination in a PIF1-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g008">Fig 8</xref>; see putative “X” pathway in the model).</p>
<p>PAs levels in seeds increased in response to R light but not in response to a second FR light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g006">Fig 6</xref>). We propose that this is due to the short PIF1 extinction time following FR irradiation. This shorter time was not due to limiting phyA levels since it remained unchanged in WT seeds exposed to a FR/96h/FR assay or in <italic>put2</italic> seeds exposed to a FR/48h/FR assay, which had higher phyA levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g007">7</xref>). Therefore, PIF1 reaccumulation is differently regulated after R and FR light irradiation, respectively. The underlying mechanism accounting for this differential regulation remains to be identified. It also is unknown why <italic>put2</italic> mutants accumulate higher phyA levels at later time points upon seed imbibition.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that PAs act as antioxidants in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref051">51</xref>]. Seed oxidation is an unavoidable process compromising seed viability in the dry seed state. It is therefore expected that seeds have evolved adaptive mechanisms to sense oxidative damage and adapt their behavior such as their control of seed germination. In newly produced seeds, the first level of germination control is that of primary seed dormancy, a trait whereby germination is blocked even under favorable conditions. Dormancy prevents germination out of season. Seeds lose dormancy during a period of dry storage called dry after-ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref002">2</xref>]. Seed oxidation is known to accelerate the release of seed dormancy during after-ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref001">1</xref>]. Dormancy was shown to inhibit R- and phyB-mediated germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref052">52</xref>] and therefore it is expected that oxidation promotes phyB-mediated germination. However, the oxidation events that release dormancy are not sufficient to promote germination mediated by phyA: 18-month-old WT seeds, which have fully lost dormancy and fully germinated after a R pulse, germinated at less than 5% in a FR/48h/FR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results therefore suggest that there are two levels of seed germination regulation through oxidative stress. Younger and still viable seeds, with moderate levels of oxidative damage, have an advantage to repress their germinating under canopy light, which is unfavorable for photosynthesis. As seeds age however, they decay as a result of continuous accumulation of oxidative damage, which compromises their capacity to form a viable seedling. It would then become advantageous to germinate under a broader range of light wavelengths, including canopy light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref019">19</xref>]. In this context, increased PA levels upon seed imbibition could serve a dual function: protect the decaying seed from the oxidative damage that accumulated during dry after-ripening while promoting in parallel phyA-mediated germination under unfavorable light cues such as canopy light. This would represent a mechanism providing a last chance for plant survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008292.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<p>All genotypes tested in each experiment were grown together under the same conditions and seeds were harvested the same day and allowed to after-ripen at room temperature for at least one month. For the germination assays, seeds were surface sterilized and 50–60 seeds of each genotype were sown on MS medium (Sigma) containing 0.8% (w/v) agar without seed stratification. For the germination assays in presence of polyamines, individual polyamines (Sigma) were added to the germination medium.

In a FR/Nh/FR assay, seeds were irradiated with a first FR pulse (3.69 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) for 5 min and further irradiated with a second FR pulse (3.69 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> or as indicated in each experiment) for 5 min after N (e.g. 12, 48 and 96) hours of dark incubation.

Standards of polyamines as well as the other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich chemical company (St. Louis, MO, USA). Free PAs were isolated and derivatized by slightly modified method of previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref058">58</xref>]. A 250 mL of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to a 5 mg of lyophilized seeds and homogenized using ZrO<sub>2</sub> beads (3 mm) in mixer-mill for 5 min at 27 Hz. Sample was then sonicated for 10 min at 25 °C, and after centrifugation at 12,400 × g for 5 min, supernatant was quantitatively transferred into another vial.</p>
<p>A 500 μL of 2M NaOH was added following with 2.5 μL of benzoyl chloride (in methanol 50:50, v:v), and after vortexing for 5 sec reaction mixtures are left for 40 min at 25 °C. A 500 μL of saturated NaCl was added and benzoylated polyamines were extracted with 2 × 500 μL of diethyl ether. Ether was evaporated and dry samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis.</p>
<p>All samples were dissolved in 50 μL of mobile phase (45% methanol in 15 mM formic acid, pH 3.0), sonicated for 15 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,400 × g prior to the analysis. Diaminohexane (DAH) was used as internal standard.</p>
<p>Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was performed on UltiMate<sup>™</sup> 3000 liquid chromatographic system consisting of binary pumps, an autosampler and a column thermostat coupled to a TSQ Quantum Access Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p>
<p>Chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (50 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm particle size) column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with appropriate pre-column kept at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of aqueous solutions of 15 mM formic acid adjusted pH 3.0 with ammonium hydroxide (Solvent A) and methanol (Solvent B). The analytes were separated using a binary gradient starting at 45% of B for 2.7 min, then increase to 57% for 0.3 min, isocratic at 57% for next 2.5 min, increase to 100% B for next 0.1 min, isocratic at 100% B for next 1 min, and decrease to 45% B for next 0.1 min. Finally, the equilibration to the initial conditions took 2.3 min. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min and the injection volume 5 μL. Benzoylated PAs were detected in positive ionization mode electrospray ionization (ESI+). The selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions for benzoylated putrescine (Put) were 297 &gt; 105, and 297 &gt; 176 at 20 eV collision energy (CE), for spermidine (Spd) 458 &gt; 175, and 458 &gt; 233 at 25 eV CE, and for spermine (Spm) 619 &gt; 162, 619 &gt; 337, and 619 &gt; 497 at 30 eV CE. The spray voltage was set to 3 kV, the vaporizer temperature to 350 °C, and the ion transfer tube temperature to 320 °C, respectively.</p>

<title>Controlled deterioration treatment (CDT)</title>
<p>CDT was performed as described in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref004">4</xref>]. Briefly, Col-0 dry seeds were stored in a closed container during the time period indicated in each experiment. The container was maintained at 37 °C and its interior had around 82% of relative humidity imposed by the presence of a saturated salt (KCl). Then, seeds were dried back at 30% relative humidity (room temperature) and stored at -80 °C until they were used for superoxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> levels measurements, germination assays or protein gel blots analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Determination of superoxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> levels</title>
<p>The levels of superoxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> were determined based on its ability to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) to blue formazan as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref060">60</xref>]. Dry seeds (0.035g) were grinded in 1.3 mL of incubation solution (10 mM K-phosphate buffer pH 7.8, 10 mM NaN3, 0.05% NBT). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, grinded tissue was collected at the bottom of the tube by centrifugation (8000 x g, 5 min, room temperature). Supernatant was diluted 10 x in incubation buffer, heated 85 °C for 15 min and then cooled on ice. Absorbance at 580 nm was measured by spectrophotometer to quantify NBT levels.</p>

<title>Antibody production and protein gel blot analysis</title>
<p>PIF1 recombinant proteins were prepared using PIF1-HIS DNA (pET21a) provided by Enamul Huq (University of Texas at Austin, USA), and induced and purified using a commercial kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham). Polyclonal anti-PIF1 was obtained from rabbits immunized with PIF1 recombinant protein. PIF1 antibodies were further affinity-purified using PIF1 recombinant protein immobilized on nitrocellulose filters as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref061">61</xref>]. FR or R light irradiated WT and mutant seeds were harvested under green safety light at the time indicated in each experiment. 20 seeds were homogenized with homogenization buffer (0.0625 M Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 1% [w/v] SDS, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 0.01% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol), and total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Amersham). PIF1 and UGPase proteins were detected using 1:500 dilution of anti-PIF1 or 1:10,000 dilution of anti-UGPase (Agrisera), and anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked whole antibody (GE healthcare) in a 1:10,000 dilution was used as a secondary antibody. PHYA proteins were detected using 1:5,000 dilution of anti-phyA (kindly provided by Akira Nagatani; Kyoto University, Japan) and the anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked whole antibody (GE healthcare) in a 1:10,000 dilution was used as a secondary antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008292.ref017">17</xref>]. Quantification of band intensity was performed using imageJ.</p>
