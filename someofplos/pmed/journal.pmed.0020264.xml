				<article-title>ADMA in Vascular Disease: More than a Marker?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <sec id="st1">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis that accumulates in a wide range of diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction and enhanced atherosclerosis. Clinical studies implicate plasma ADMA as a major novel cardiovascular risk factor, but the mechanisms by which low concentrations of ADMA produce adverse effects on the cardiovascular system are unclear.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>We treated human coronary artery endothelial cells with pathophysiological concentrations of ADMA and assessed the effects on gene expression using U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix). Changes in several genes, including bone morphogenetic protein 2 inducible kinase <italic>(BMP2K),</italic> SMA-related protein 5 <italic>(Smad5),</italic> bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A, and protein arginine methyltransferase 3 <italic>(PRMT3;</italic> also known as <italic>HRMT1L3),</italic> were confirmed by Northern blotting, quantitative PCR, and in some instances Western blotting analysis to detect changes in protein expression. To determine whether these changes also occurred in vivo, tissue from gene deletion mice with raised ADMA levels was examined. More than 50 genes were significantly altered in endothelial cells after treatment with pathophysiological concentrations of ADMA (2 μM). We detected specific patterns of changes that identify pathways involved in processes relevant to cardiovascular risk and pulmonary hypertension. Changes in <italic>BMP2K</italic> and <italic>PRMT3</italic> were confirmed at mRNA and protein levels, in vitro and in vivo.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st3">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Pathophysiological concentrations of ADMA are sufficient to elicit significant changes in coronary artery endothelial cell gene expression. Changes in bone morphogenetic protein signalling, and in enzymes involved in arginine methylation, may be particularly relevant to understanding the pathophysiological significance of raised ADMA levels. This study identifies the mechanisms by which increased ADMA may contribute to common cardiovascular diseases and thereby indicates possible targets for therapies.</p>

        <title>Patient Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Diseases of the circulation system are common and cause many deaths. Medical conditions associated with damage to the blood vessels include heart failure, high blood pressure, stroke, and kidney failure. The lining of the blood vessels plays an active role in maintaining their health. A substance called asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is found naturally in the vessel lining, both in healthy people and in people with vascular disease, but in the latter it is present at higher levels. Thus raised ADMA may be a marker of vascular disease. This means it could be used to help identify people with a circulation problem. However, it has not been clear whether ADMA actually causes any damage, i.e., whether it is more than just a marker.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers are trying to find out whether elevated ADMA levels can cause vascular disease. In this study, they treated cells from blood vessel linings with levels of ADMA equal to those found in people with vascular disease and measured how gene activity changed in response. They found that a number of genes were more active when the cells were exposed to the elevated ADMA levels. Some of these were interesting because other studies suggest that they might be involved in lung, heart, and kidney disease.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Do the Results Mean for Patients?</title>
          <p>This area of research is still at an exploratory stage. Additional studies need to examine which function (if any) the genes that respond to elevated ADMA levels play in vascular disease. If they do play active roles, drugs that inhibit them might help to prevent or treat vascular disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of all nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b01">1</xref>]. It is synthesised by the action of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), and following proteolysis, free ADMA is released into the cell cytosol and thence into plasma. Circulating concentrations of ADMA are increased in patients with renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b01">1</xref>], pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, hypercholesterolemia or a wide range of other cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b02">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b06">6</xref>]. In patients with end-stage renal failure, the plasma levels of ADMA predict mortality and cardiovascular outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b07">7</xref>], and in a cohort of otherwise healthy Finnish men, those with the highest levels of ADMA had an increased risk of acute coronary events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b08">8</xref>]. Increased circulating ADMA in pregnant women predicts an increased risk of pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b09">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite these clinical observations and the increasing excitement surrounding the use of ADMA as a risk marker for vascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b07">7</xref>], it is still not clear whether ADMA has a causal role in pathophysiology. It has been argued that the concentration of ADMA in plasma is too low to be an effective inhibitor of NOS, and that the usual concentrations of arginine in cells should overcome any inhibitory effects of ADMA on NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b10">10</xref>]. In order to determine how ADMA might exert effects on endothelial cells and produce pathology, we assessed the effects of ADMA on gene expression in human coronary endothelial cells.</p>

        <p>Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were purchased from Promocell and grown according to the manufacturer's instructions. HCAEC in 75-cm<sup>2</sup> flasks at 70% confluency (passage 3 or 4) were treated for 24 h with complete media supplemented with asymmetric dimethylarginine (N<sup>G</sup>N<sup>G</sup>-dimethyl-L-arginine; ADMA; 0, 2, or 100 μM; Merck Biosciences, United Kingdom). This was repeated on three separate occasions with different batches of cells. RNA from each study was used as described below for GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States) analysis. Our strategy for the GeneChip and subsequent analysis is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020264-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

        <p>ADMA-treated HCAEC from T75 flasks were harvested in 7.5 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States), and total RNA was extracted; cDNA and subsequent cRNA synthesis were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b11">11</xref>]. The quality of the biotin-labelled cRNA transcripts was determined using a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, California, United States). Purified cRNA (15 μg) was fragmented and hybridised to human U133A GeneChips according to Affymetrix standard protocols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.affymetrix.com</ext-link>).

Genes were excluded if the signal strength did not significantly exceed background values and if expression did not reach a threshold value for reliable detection (based on the relaxed Affymetrix MAS 5.0 probability of detection (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b12">12</xref>]) in each of the three separate studies. Finally, genes were excluded if the level of expression did not vary by more than 1.7-fold between ADMA-treated (2 or 100 μM) compared with untreated control HCAEC. The remaining genes were subjected to nonparametric Welch <italic>t</italic>-tests and are reported with their respective fold changes and <italic>p</italic>-values.

        <title>Effects of ADMA upon HCAEC Viability</title>
        <p>Basal levels of ADMA and SDMA in HCAEC media were 0.17 ± 0.01 μM and 0.22 ± 0.02 μM, respectively, and arginine levels exceeded 300 μM. No changes were observed in HCAEC viability over 72 h in the presence of either 2 or 100 μM ADMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020264-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>

        <title>Confirming Transcriptional Changes</title>
        <p>To determine the reliability of changes identified by GeneChip analysis, four genes were selected from those that showed a statistically significant change in either the 2 or 100 μM sample compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020264-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). These were <italic>SCAMP1, Calreticulin, (RpL27)</italic> and <italic>RpS11.</italic> In studies on a different batch of HCAEC, Northern blotting confirmed that expression of these genes changed in response to ADMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020264-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of NOSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b01">1</xref>] and there is an association between increased plasma levels of ADMA and renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b01">1</xref>], pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b05">5</xref>], preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b09">9</xref>], and the progression of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b19">19</xref>]. Whilst the concentration of ADMA in plasma of healthy adults varies between 0.4 and 1 μM, it may increase to 1.45–4.0 μM with certain diseases, and this increase is thought to be causally involved in pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b20">20</xref>]. In the present study we detected substantial changes in gene expression in HCAEC after 24 h of exposure to concentrations of ADMA similar to those reported in pathophysiological states. Furthermore, we identified specific pathways of gene activation that give insight into the mechanisms by which ADMA may contribute to disease. Surprisingly, some of these changes appear to be independent of blockade of the L-arginine:nitric oxide (NO) pathway.</p>

        <title>Low Concentrations of ADMA Alter Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Acute administration of ADMA to healthy individuals elicits a transient fall in heart rate and cardiac output and increases blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b02">2</xref>], but little is known of the potential longer-term effects of raised ADMA. Zoccali et al. reported that a 1-μM increment in ADMA above the upper limits for healthy individuals was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b07">7</xref>], and levels around 2 μM seem to be associated with a number of diverse cardiovascular pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b08">8</xref>]. In the current study, HCAEC were treated with 2 or 100 μM ADMA. We repeated GeneChip analysis in three separate studies and observed reproducible changes in the expression of a subset of genes in response to low- and high -dose ADMA. Because there is always a possibility of false positives being identified on arrays, we tested the reproducibility of the GeneChip approach by selecting four genes significantly upregulated by ADMA treatment. In a separate series of studies we confirmed an increase in mRNA levels by Northern blotting at both concentrations of ADMA. Thus it is clear that pathophysiological concentrations of ADMA (2 μM) affect endothelial cell gene expression even in the presence of very high arginine concentrations (&gt;300 μM). Endogenous ADMA is metabolised by DDAH, and DDAH activity is the major determinant of plasma ADMA concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b02">2</xref>]. To determine whether the effects we saw in vitro would be reproduced in vivo we examined DDAH1 knockout mice. At least one of the gene changes we saw in vitro also occurs in vivo since DDAH1 heterozygous knockout mice have increased concentrations of ADMA in plasma and showed upregulation of <italic>BMP2K</italic> in several tissues.</p>
        <p>ADMA inhibits NOSs with an IC<sub>50</sub> of about 5 μM, the precise potency depending on the prevailing concentration of arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b21">21</xref>]. It is known that adding endogenous NO to endothelial cells alters gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b23">23</xref>] and that inhibitors of endogenous NO generation can alter expression of specific genes, at least under conditions of endothelial cell activation with cytokines. To determine whether the effects we observed could be accounted for by inhibition of NOS, we treated cells with a highly potent NOS inhibitor (L-NIO) and with SDMA, an endogenous dimethylarginine that has no effect on NOS but which can block arginine transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b16">16</xref>]. Neither SDMA nor L-NIO replicated the effects of ADMA on gene expression. We have not undertaken a full GeneChip analysis of responses to L-NIO, so we do not know how much overlap there would be between the effects of L-NIO and ADMA, but of those genes examined we saw a discordance between responses to the two inhibitors. This raises the intriguing possibility that some of the actions of ADMA may be independent of effects of NO, possibly due to other actions such as the ability of ADMA to increase superoxide generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b25">25</xref>]. Other authors have reported differences in efficacy of ADMA in cell culture systems compared to other NOS inhibitors that have more potent effects on isolated NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b26">26</xref>], and further studies will be required to identify to what extent NO-independent effects contribute to the overall action of ADMA. Interestingly, a NOS-independent effect of ADMA on angiotensin-converting enzyme has recently been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b25">25</xref>]. NOS-independent effects of ADMA may explain why, in some situations where ADMA concentrations are raised, L-arginine does not restore normal endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b27">27</xref>] and why ADMA can exert effects, even in the presence of high endogenous arginine concentrations.</p>

        <title>Patterns of Gene Change</title>
        <p>Mapping genes changed by ADMA to identify global changes in biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b15">15</xref>], indicated that ADMA treatment may have significant effects on genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. The full biological significance of the range of genes affected is not yet known, but our data demonstrate the potential for elevated ADMA to affect endothelial (and likely other cellular) function in disease. In the present study, we focussed on two pathways of potential importance—BMP pathways and PRMTs.</p>

        <title>BMP Pathways and ADMA</title>
        <p>Analysis of the U133A GeneChips revealed that <italic>BMP2K</italic> was induced more than 2-fold in response to either 2 or 100 μM ADMA. The increase in gene expression was mirrored by an increase in BMP2K protein, and the effect was also seen in our high-ADMA mouse model. By relaxing parameters (to exclude false negatives) a search for other genes involved in BMP signalling revealed that <italic>Smad5</italic> and <italic>BMPR1A</italic> were also amongst the transcripts increased by GeneChip analysis, and these changes were confirmed by Northern blotting. The finding of changes in the BMP signalling pathway is important since the ADMA/DDAH pathway seems to be involved in animal models of pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b29">29</xref>], and mutations in the BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2) are associated with familial pulmonary hypertension in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b30">30</xref>].</p>
        <p>The changes in BMP pathways may also be important in understanding some of the effects of renal failure. ADMA accumulates in renal failure and fulfils many of the criteria of a uraemic toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b18">18</xref>]. In addition to effects on cardiovascular risk, ADMA may contribute to renal osteodystrophy, a process in which BMPs have been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b31">31</xref>]. Indeed an earlier study that showed that ADMA reduces osteoblast differentiation and decreases osteocalcin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b32">32</xref>]. The present study confirms osteocalcin as a gene downregulated by ADMA, and since activation of <italic>BMP2K</italic> attenuates osteocalcin expression and reduces osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b33">33</xref>], it is possible that the effects of ADMA on osteocalcin may be secondary to induction of <italic>BMP2K</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020264-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Whatever the mechanisms, identification of a link between ADMA and BMP pathways may be relevant to the increased vascular calcification seen in renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b31">31</xref>].</p>

        <title>ADMA and Arginine Methylation</title>
        <p>We observed that <italic>PRMT3</italic> gene expression was elevated following exposure to ADMA; this was confirmed by Q-PCR, and PRMT3 protein expression also increased. This is the first report that ADMA may alter the expression of enzymes involved in its own synthesis. There are presently five known PRMTs that asymmetrically methylate arginine residues and two (PRMT5 and PRMT7) that symmetrically methylate arginine residues. PRMT3 has a wide tissue distribution, is expressed in highly vascular tissues, including heart and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b17">17</xref>], and expression may be increased by oxidised-LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b34">34</xref>]. Our observations indicate that ADMA can induce a similar increase in PRMT3 expression.</p>
        <p>The roles of methylation of arginine residues in proteins are not yet well defined, but studies of PRMT3 in fission yeast have shown that it associates with proteins involved in the translational machinery and that the S2 ribosomal protein, a component of the yeast 40S ribosome, is a specific substrate for PRMT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b35">35</xref>]. PRMT3 is the only PRMT known to interact with the translational machinery, and it is interesting that we have found several genes, including ribosomal proteins <italic>RpS11</italic> and <italic>RpL27,</italic> involved in translational control, that were also altered in response to ADMA treatment. Amongst the genes changed greater than 1.7-fold in response to ADMA was methionine adenosyltransferase II α, which catalyses the production of S-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor for the PRMT reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020264-b36">36</xref>]. The role of ADMA in regulating arginine methylation in protein deserves further study.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Increased circulating concentrations of ADMA have been reported in cardiovascular and other disorders, and intracellular concentrations may vary independently of circulating levels. In the present study we have demonstrated that relatively small changes in the concentration of ADMA affect gene expression in endothelial cells. Identification of pathways regulated by ADMA may aid our understanding of how ADMA contributes to a wide range of pathologies. Two pathways of specific interest have been identified—BMP signalling and enzymes involved in arginine methylation. The effects on BMP signalling may be particularly important in renal disease and in the link between raised ADMA and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
