          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Experimental animal data show that protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is feasible. For an effective immune prophylaxis in humans, broad coverage of different strains of SARS-CoV and control of potential neutralization escape variants will be required. Combinations of virus-neutralizing, noncompeting mAbs may have these properties.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Human mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets. We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus. In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318–510) harboring this mutation was abolished. We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS patient for antibodies complementary to CR3014. A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3. No escape variants could be generated with CR3022. The mixture of both mAbs showed neutralization of SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain. Dose reduction indices of 4.5 and 20.5 were observed for CR3014 and CR3022, respectively, at 100% neutralization. Because enhancement of SARS-CoV infection by subneutralizing antibody concentrations is of concern, we show here that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS-CoV into a productive one.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The combination of two noncompeting human mAbs CR3014 and CR3022 potentially controls immune escape and extends the breadth of protection. At the same time, synergy between CR3014 and CR3022 may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>Late in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in the Guangdong province of China. In February 2003, an infected doctor from the province carried this new viral threat to human health to Hong Kong. Here, people staying in the same hotel caught the disease and took it to other countries. SARS was on the move, hitching lifts with international travellers. Because the virus responsible for SARS—SARS-CoV—spread by close person-to-person contact and killed 10% of the people it infected, health experts feared a world-wide epidemic. This was avoided by the World Health Organization issuing a global alert and warning against unnecessary travel to affected areas and by public-health officials isolating patients and their close contacts. By July 2003, the first SARS epidemic was over. 8,098 people had been infected; 774 people had died. Since then, sporadic cases of SARS have been contained locally.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>The first epidemic of SARS was caused by an animal virus that became adapted to spread between people. There is no reason this process won't be repeated. If it is, stringent quarantine measures could again prevent a global epidemic, but at considerable economic cost. What is needed is a way to prevent SARS developing in healthy people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV and to treat sick people so that they are less infectious and can fight the virus. In this study, researchers have been investigating “passive immunization” as a way to limit SARS epidemics. In passive immunization, short-term protection against illness is achieved by injecting antibodies—proteins that recognize specific molecules (called antigens) on foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses and prevent those organisms from causing disease. Antibodies for passive immunization can be isolated from blood taken from people who have had SARS, or they can be manufactured as so-called “human monoclonal antibodies” in a laboratory. One of these human monoclonal antibodies—CR3014—had been previously made and shown to prevent lung damage in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV and to stop the infected animals from infecting others. But for effective disease prevention in people, a single monoclonal antibody might not be enough. There are strains of SARS-CoV that CR3014 does not recognize and therefore cannot act against. Also, the virus can alter the antigen recognized by CR3014 when it is grown at a low antibody concentration, producing so-called escape variants; if this happens CR3014 can no longer prevent these escape variants from killing human cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers tested how well a combination of two monoclonal antibodies controlled SARS-CoV killing of human cells. First, they showed that CR3014 escape variants all had the same small change in a part of the virus surface that interacts with human cells. CR3014 blocked this interaction in the parent SARS-CoV strain but not in the escape variants. They then made a new monoclonal antibody—CR3022—that prevented both the parent SARS-CoV stain and the CR3014 escape viruses from killing human cells. The two antibodies bound to neighboring parts of the virus surface, and both of them could bind at the same time. CR3022 also bound to surfaces of SARS-CoV strains to which CR3014 does not bind. And when they tried, the researchers could not generate any viral escape variants to which CR3022 was unable to bind. Finally, the effect of the two antibodies together on inhibition of SARS-CoV killing of human cells was more than the sum of their individual effects.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>A combination of two (or more) human monoclonal antibodies that recognize different parts of the SARS-CoV surface that interacts with human cells might be a good way to immunize people passively against SARS-CoV. It might minimize the possibility of escape variants arising, broaden the range of virus strains against which protection is provided, and reduce the amount of antibody needed for effective protection. Before the approach is tried in people, it will have to be tested in animals—results from experiments done on human cells in dishes are not always replicated in whole animals or people. If the approach passes further tests, the hope is that passive immunization of people with SARS and their close contacts might reduce disease severity in infected people and reduce viral spread as effectively as dramatic quarantine measures.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that spread in 2003 and 2004 from the Guangdong province of southern China to 32 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America, resulting in over 8,000 cases and 774 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b002">2</xref>]. The main epidemic was stopped in late 2003 through internationally coordinated public health measures including early isolation of SARS patients and quarantine of contacts, at considerable economic costs to the affected countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b005">5</xref>]. In 2003 and 2004 a number of isolated SARS cases occurred again in China and other Asian countries; some of these cases were linked to laboratory or unknown exposure, but others were community acquired and associated with exposure to the live game animal restaurant trade in Guangdong province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b006">6</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b007">7</xref>]. SARS-CoV-like viruses almost identical to a patient's isolate were found in palm civet cats investigated during the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b007">7</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of approximately 100 SARS-CoV isolates from humans and civet cats collected from 2002 to 2004 revealed that SARS is a zoonotic disease that is evolving in palm civet and human hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b009">9</xref>]. Furthermore, presumably asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses has repeatedly occurred in wild animal handlers in Guangdong province several years before the SARS epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b009">9</xref>]. Recently, bats have been identified as an important natural reservoir of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b010">10</xref>]. It is therefore unlikely that the mass culling of civets cats performed in southern China is sufficient to prevent further spillover of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like viruses to the human population.

      <p>In the search for a vaccine against SARS, neutralizing antibodies have been raised successfully in experimental animals through immunization with whole killed virus or recombinant vaccine constructs expressing the SARS-CoV glycoprotein spike (S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b013">13</xref>]. Correspondingly, studies of the immune responses in SARS patients have shown that the appearance of neutralizing antibodies coincides with a decrease of virus titers in serum, urine, stool, and nasopharyngeal secretions; in addition the beneficial effect of convalescent plasma in SARS patients has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b016">16</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV generated through experimental vaccination or monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology have repeatedly been shown in passive transfer experiments to protect mice from infection by reduction of viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b011">11</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b020">20</xref>]. In addition, the human mAb CR3014, generated by phage display, completely prevented lung pathology in the ferret model of SARS-CoV infection and abolished shedding of the virus in pharyngeal secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b021">21</xref>]. CR3014 was shown to block interaction of the S1 subunit of the S protein with its cellular receptor ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b022">22</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Because passive immunization using polyclonal sera has been reported to curb outbreaks of hepatitis A virus and to prevent infection with varicella-zoster virus, mAb prophylaxis may be an effective means of controlling a SARS outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b023">23</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b024">24</xref>]. To this end, it is important that a mAb product offer sufficient breadth of protection against all relevant strains of SARS-CoV and prevent the selection of neutralization escape variants in the patient. In this study we therefore address both of these issues and present the characteristics of a combination of CR3014 with a new SARS-CoV neutralizing human mAb that was isolated from a convalescent patient. Because antibody-dependent enhancement of viral replication has been observed in macrophages for one member of the coronavirus family (feline infectious peritonitis virus), we also investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs with SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b025">25</xref>]. Infection of primary human macrophages with SARS-CoV has been reported to result in abortive infection with no infectious virus progeny produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b026">26</xref>]. We therefore studied whether virus infection in the presence of serial dilutions of CR3014 or serum from a convalescent SARS patient leads to productive virus infection.

        <p>Serial dilutions ranging from 10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup> of SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849 were incubated in the presence of a constant amount of CR3014 (20 μg/ml) or CR3022 (60 μg/ml), for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> before addition to wells containing FRhK-4 cells. The virus-mAb mixture was incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, then the virus was removed and the cells were washed twice with medium. Finally, cells were incubated for 2 d in the presence of the above concentrations of mAb in 0.5 ml of medium. Supernatant of cells incubated with highest virus dilution showing CPE, containing the potential escape viruses, was harvested and stored at 4 °C until further use. Virus samples were freeze-thawed once, serial dilutions were prepared in medium and added to wells containing FRhK-4 cells, and the dilutions incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in the presence of mAb. Wells were then overlaid with agarose containing mAbs at the above concentration and incubated for 3–5 d at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Individual escape virus plaques were picked using a Pasteur pipette and freeze-thawed once, and the escape viruses were amplified on FRhK-4 cells. To identify possible mutations in the SARS-CoV spike protein of each of the escape viruses, the nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV S open reading frame (ORF) was determined. Viral RNA of each of the escape viruses and wild-type SARS-CoV virus was isolated and converted into cDNA by standard RT-PCR. Subsequently, the cDNA was used for nucleotide sequencing of the SARS-CoV S ORF in order to identify mutations. Secondly, the neutralization index was determined for each of the escape viruses. Therefore, each escape virus and wild-type SARS-CoV (100 TCID<sub>50</sub>) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with mAb at the above concentration before addition to FRhK-4 cells. The virus was allowed to attach to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, after which the inoculum was removed and cells were washed twice with medium before being replenished with medium containing mAb. After a 2 d incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> the medium was harvested and the TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml of each virus was determined. The neutralization index was determined by subtracting the number of infectious virus particles (expressed as log TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) produced in FRhK-4 cell cultures infected with virus in the presence of mAb from the number of infectious virus particles (log TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) produced in FRhK-4 cell cultures infected with virus alone. An index lower than 2.5 was considered evidence of escape.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results show that SARS-CoV can be neutralized synergistically by human mAbs targeting the receptor-binding domain of the virus. The combination of two mAbs expanded the breadth of protection and controlled potential immune escape variants while reducing the total antibody concentration required to neutralize the virus. In view of the proven efficacy of passive prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection in animal models using single mAbs, our data provide a rationale to develop cocktails of mAbs for human SARS prophylaxis.</p>
      <p>Although the SARS epidemic of 2003 was successfully contained, the risk of its re-emergence remains from its natural animal reservoir, from intermediate hosts such as civet cats in live animal markets, or from laboratory associated infections. The re-emergence and community spread of SARS in Beijing in February 2004 required the quarantine of large numbers of contacts; the social and economic consequences of such measures are considerable. The availability of prophylactic and therapeutic measures against SARS-CoV would greatly assist the control of any future re-emergence of the virus, and their development therefore remains a high priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b032">32</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>With respect to vaccine development, considerable progress has been made in understanding the immune response against the virus and defining correlates of protection. Patients with high viral loads and shedding of SARS-CoV in pharyngeal secretions have elevated mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b033">33</xref>]. Correspondingly, the development of neutralizing antibody titers correlates with a decrease of virus titers in serum, urine, stool, and nasopharyngeal secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b015">15</xref>]. Progress has also been made in understanding the target of the neutralizing immune response through immunization with whole killed SARS-CoV and recombinant vectors expressing the S glycoprotein and other structural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b013">13</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies seem to be predominantly directed against a domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein, defined by amino acids 318–510, which is responsible for interaction of the virus with its cellular receptor ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b037">37</xref>]. Mapping of this RBD using a panel of mouse mAbs has led to the identification of six distinct neutralizing epitopes, which are all conformation-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b038">38</xref>]. The neutralizing potency of the mAb correlated directly with their ability to block the RBD-ACE2 interaction in recombinant assays; however, several neutralizing mAbs were also identified that bind to two distinct epitopes of the RBD without inhibiting the interaction with ACE2.
			</p>
      <p>The concept of using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV for passive immunization to control both development of severe disease and transmission from human to human of the virus is based on several observations. The use of convalescent serum in SARS patients was reported to be associated with possible benefit and in any event was not associated with adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b014">14</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b016">16</xref>]
				<italic>.</italic> In consequence, commercial production of SARS antiserum from human donors has been initiated in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b039">39</xref>]. Passive transfer of immune serum generated through immunization of animals with whole killed virus or vector-expressed full-length S or S fragments has reduced viral replication in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b011">11</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b018">18</xref>]. Human mAbs have been generated through phage display, immortalization of human B-cells from SARS-patients, or immunization of transgenic mice, and were shown to display protective efficacy in the mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b017">17</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b019">19</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b020">20</xref>]. In addition, the human mAb CR3014 reduced SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected ferrets, completely prevented the development of lung lesions, and abolished viral shedding in the pharyngeal secretions of the animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b021">21</xref>]. Because SARS-CoV is spread by the respiratory and the fecal-oral route, the observation that passive immunization is successful in controlling outbreaks of hepatitis A virus and protecting against varicella-zoster and respiratory syncytial virus infection argues for the feasibility of an emergency immune prophylaxis during a SARS outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b023">23</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b024">24</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b040">40</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Monoclonal antibody prophylaxis against SARS must meet certain criteria to be effective. The breadth of protection of a single mAb may not be sufficient to protect against all clinically relevant strains of the virus, and it has been suggested that genotyping of SARS-CoV in case of a new outbreak may be required to select for optimally neutralizing mAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b019">19</xref>]. A comprehensive analysis of the variability of approximately 100 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV isolates obtained from human patients and civet cats between 2002 and 2004 revealed that the S glycoprotein, especially the RBD, is under strong positive selective pressure during the transition from animal-to-animal to human-to-human transmission, because of differences in the ACE2 receptors of civet cats and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b007">7</xref>]. The highest variability of the RBD is observed within the group of SARS-CoV-like viruses isolated from animals, with no data as yet available concerning the receptor specificity of the newly discovered bat-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b010">10</xref>]. Interestingly, patients infected with SARS-CoV-like viruses had a milder course of disease and did not transmit the viruses to other persons, presumably because of insufficient adaptation of the civet cat virus RBD to human ACE2, which is required for productive infection of human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b019">19</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b041">41</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b042">42</xref>]. The RBD of SARS-CoV isolates from the next SARS epidemic will therefore likely be very similar to the isolates from 2003. The RBD of human SARS-CoV isolates is highly conserved and alignment of 114 sequences published in GenBank revealed only eight different S sequences not identical to the FM1 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b022">22</xref>]. Of all human isolates SARS-CoV-like isolate GD03T0013, which was obtained from a patient in 2003, shows the highest RBD divergence and closest relatedness to civet cat strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b007">7</xref>]. Human mAb CR3014 binds well to recombinantly expressed RBDs representing seven of the RBD variants, including GD03T0013, but less to a variant with a N479S mutation found in human isolate BJ302 cl.2, and not at all to an RBD derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like isolate SZ3. Antibody CR3022, derived by phage display from a convalescent SARS patient, binds well to the latter two variants in addition to the others. A combination of CR3014 and CR3022 may therefore offer sufficient protection not only against SARS-CoV strains but also against SARS-CoV-like viruses originating from civet cats.
			</p>
      <p>Viral replication in the presence of a mAb, especially at subneutralizing concentrations, carries the risk of selecting neutralization escape variants. We therefore analyzed escape variants of SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849 generated under selective pressure of CR3014 or CR3022, which was unsuccessful for the latter. All CR3014 escape variants had the same single amino acid exchange in the RBD (P462L), which has not been reported in any SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like virus to date. This variant was successfully neutralized with CR3022, extending the breadth of protection of this antibody combination from naturally occurring variants also to possible CR3014 immune escapes. A similar strategy was previously pursued to develop a mAb product for postexposure prophylaxis of rabies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b043">43</xref>]. Because neutralization escape in vitro may not accurately reflect the in vivo situation, the CR3014/CR3022 combination needs to be tested at subneutralizing concentrations in animal models of SARS-CoV infection.
			</p>
      <p>Further investigation of the CR3014/CR3022 combination revealed that the antibodies neutralize wild-type SARS-CoV synergistically in vitro, with DRIs of about four and 20 for the two mAbs, respectively. Synergism of neutralizing mAbs has not yet been reported for SARS-CoV, but was observed for combinations of two, three, or four mAbs directed against different epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, leading to a two- to ten-fold increase of neutralization titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b030">30</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b044">44</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b045">45</xref>]. Mechanistically, cooperative binding of mAbs may induce conformational changes in the antigen thereby altering affinities (allosteric effect), lead to intermolecular interaction of bivalent antibodies, or result in interaction of the Fc regions of antibodies brought into close contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b046">46</xref>]. As determined by ELISA, CR3014 and CR3022 bind simultaneously to the RBD of the S1 subunit of the glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV. However, measuring separate, sequential, and simultaneous binding of the mAbs in Biacore did not reveal enhanced affinity of the antibody mixture over the individual affinities, especially for CR3022. Another possible explanation for synergism could be increased breadth of protection against different quasispecies of a viral isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b030">30</xref>]. Heterogeneous sequences have been detected through direct sequencing of SARS-CoV RNA recovered from single patient samples, and adaptive mutations induced by repeated cell culture passage have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b049">49</xref>]. It should therefore be formally investigated whether SARS-CoV quasispecies formation in cell culture may influence the outcome of virus neutralization assays. Lastly, CR3022 could interfere with binding of the S1 subunit to a known or unknown coreceptor of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b050">50</xref>]. The mechanism by which the two mAbs neutralize SARS-CoV synergistically therefore remains presently elusive.
			</p>
      <p>It was previously shown that CR3014 protects ferrets from challenge with SARS-CoV at a dose of 10 mg/kg by completely preventing lung pathology and abolishing shedding of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b021">21</xref>]. This antibody dose compares well with the required dosage of Palivizumab (15 mg/kg), which protects at-risk infants from infection with respiratory syncytial virus and is currently the only licensed antiviral monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b040">40</xref>]. However, the required amount of CR3014 for protecting a standard 70 kg adult is relatively high, and it would be desirable to use a lower dose for economic reasons. Furthermore, the even lower potency of CR3022 precludes its use as a stand-alone prophylaxis. Therefore, the observed four- to twenty-fold dose reduction of the individual mAbs in the CR3014/CR3022 mixture may hold an attractive option to reduce the total antibody dose required for neutralizing the virus in vivo while at the same time expanding the breadth of protection.
			</p>
      <p>In this study, we also addressed the potential problem of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is a well-recognized phenomenon observed in infections with another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus. Both immunization and passive transfer of antibody was shown to mediate this phenomenon and mAbs have been used to map neutralizing and enhancing epitopes on the spike glycoprotein of feline infectious peritonitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b025">25</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b051">51</xref>]. There is no direct evidence of ADE linked to SARS-CoV infection in humans to date, and infection of human macrophages with SARS-CoV was previously shown to be abortive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b025">25</xref>]. However, it was recently shown, in a viral pseudotype assay expressing the full-length spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-like viruses, that these cannot be neutralized with either homologous or heterologous mouse immune sera, and that both the sera and human mAbs neutralizing SARS-CoV enhance infectivity of the pseudotype for the human adenocarcinoma cells used as indicator system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b034">34</xref>]. Given that ADE in feline infectious peritonitis virus infection is mediated by increased macrophage uptake of virus in the presence of neutralizing antibody, we performed human macrophage infectivity assays in the presence of CR3014 and human convalescent serum. In this type of assay, ADE of Dengue and Ross River virus infection has previously been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b052">52</xref>]. The addition of varying concentrations of CR3014 or convalescent SARS serum to SARS CoV did not convert the abortive infection into a productive one, reducing the likelihood that ADE will be observed in vivo after passive immunization.
			</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we propose that a combination of neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV has the potential to control SARS-CoV infection with a high level of efficacy and safety, and possibly at reduced economic cost. Isolation of suspected SARS cases and quarantine of exposed contacts have proved effective in controlling epidemics. However, the direct and indirect costs involved in quarantine measures are very substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030237-b004">4</xref>]. Monoclonal antibody prophylaxis (ring vaccination) in case of a SARS outbreak may prove more cost effective.
