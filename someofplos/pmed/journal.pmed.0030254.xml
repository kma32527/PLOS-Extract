				<article-title>A New Mouse Model to Study Acquired Lymphedema</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <sec id="st1">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Sustained lymph stagnation engenders a pathological response that is complex and not well characterized. Tissue inflammation in lymphedema may reflect either an active or passive consequence of impaired immune traffic.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>We studied an experimental model of acute post-surgical lymphedema in the tails of female hairless, immunocompetent SKH-1 mice. We performed in vivo imaging of impaired immune traffic in experimental, murine acquired lymphatic insufficiency. We demonstrated impaired mobilization of immunocompetent cells from the lymphedematous region. These findings correlated with histopathological alterations and large-scale transcriptional profiling results. We found intense inflammatory changes in the dermis and the subdermis. The molecular pattern in the RNA extracted from the whole tissue was dominated by the upregulation of genes related to acute inflammation, immune response, complement activation, wound healing, fibrosis, and oxidative stress response.</p>

        <sec id="st3">
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>We have characterized a mouse model of acute, acquired lymphedema using in vivo functional imaging and histopathological correlation. The model closely simulates the volume response, histopathology, and lymphoscintigraphic characteristics of human acquired lymphedema, and the response is accompanied by an increase in the number and size of microlymphatic structures in the lymphedematous cutaneous tissues. Molecular characterization through clustering of genes with known functions provides insights into processes and signaling pathways that compose the acute tissue response to lymph stagnation. Further study of genes identified through this effort will continue to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and lead to potential therapeutic strategies for lymphatic vascular insufficiency.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>Lymphedema is the term used to describe the swelling that can occur after surgery, especially after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer, when the lymph vessels that carry protein-rich interstitial fluid from the tissues to the heart are damaged. Lymphedema can be extremely unpleasant and is very hard to treat; treatments that are currently used include those aimed to help massage the flow of lymph back to the chest. Lymphedema seems to be more than just accumulation of lymph, however, as changes also occur in the tissue surrounding the damaged lymph vessels. Currently, very little is known at the most basic level about what exactly these changes are, although they appear to be similar to an inflammatory process. One way of studying such a disease process in humans is to make an animal model that mimics the human condition and study the changes that occur there. For lymphedema, such a model can be made in the mouse tail by cutting lymph vessels there.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>The authors wanted to look closely at what happens in the tissues surrounding damaged lymph vessels to try to understand better what these changes are. They also wanted to study the movement of the cells that are normally carried in the lymph.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The mouse model that the authors developed closely simulates the characteristics of human acquired lymphedema. In the mouse tails that had had their lymph vessels damaged, the authors were able to show that the tails were swollen compared with those of normal animals and of animals that hadhad sham (pretend) surgery. In the animals with lymphedema, many small lymph vessels were seen, as the lymph was unable to flow away normally. The area affected by the lymphedema had the appearance often seen in inflamed tissue, and analysis of genes from the same area to see how active, or “expressed,” they were showed changes that are often seen in, for example, acute inflammation and wound healing. The authors also showed that when these animals were injected with immune cells marked with a light marker, they were less able to remove the cells from the circulation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These results show that the response to lymph stagnation is complex, but looks similar to that seen in acute inflammation. These results and this model may be useful in suggesting, and at a later date perhaps testing, treatments for lymphedema. One difference, however, between this mouse model and the condition in humans is that whereas lymphedema in humans is a rather chronic condition, here the researchers were only able to look at the changes over a short period of time. In a related Perspective article, Peter Carmeliet and colleagues further discuss the clinical relevance of these findings (

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Acquired lymphedema is a common, important, and often devastating consequence of successful surgical and adjuvant therapy of breast cancer and other malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b002">2</xref>]. The biology of regional lymphatic vascular insufficiency (lymphedema) is complex and, as yet, poorly understood. Consequently, there is a paucity of effective treatment strategies in patients with lymphedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b002">2</xref>]. There is an obvious need for better molecular characterization of this disease process to elucidate the pathobiology of lymphatic vascular insufficiency.
			</p>
      <p>The tissue response to lymph stagnation is rather complex. The profound structural and functional abnormalities in the lymphedematous tissues reflect a multicellular response to impaired extracellular fluid mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b003">3</xref>]. It has been suggested that lymphedema provokes an inflammatory tissue response in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b004">4</xref>]. While it is conceivable that the inflammatory nature of the tissue response to lymph stagnation reflects either the active or passive consequences of impaired immune traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b005">5</xref>], direct experimental confirmation is lacking.
			</p>
      <p>Transcriptional profiling has been utilized in the molecular characterization of isolated lymphatic endothelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b006">6</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b007">7</xref>], but the molecular end-organ response to lymph stagnation remains unaddressed and poorly understood. While lymphatic and blood vessel responses to injury might be predictable, an elucidation of whole tissue response to disease is likely to provide more relevant insights into the important interactions between the tissue matrix and the resident, heterogeneous cellular populations that likely compose the target-organ response to persistent lymph stagnation.
			</p>
      <p>To investigate tissue responses to lymphatic vascular insufficiency, we have undertaken dynamic, in vivo imaging of the impaired immune traffic in a murine model of acquired lymphatic insufficiency that is intended to simulate, in part, the lymphatic dysfunction of post-surgical lymphedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b008">8</xref>]. These observations were correlated with an assessment of the cutaneous histopathology in the lymphedema tissue. Furthermore, to investigate the molecular mechanisms of tissue response to lymphatic vascular insufficiency, we have undertaken a large-scale transcriptional profiling of the lymphedema tissue utilizing a comprehensive mouse cDNA microarray containing 42,300 features, representing over 25,000 unique genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b009">9</xref>]. The patterns of gene expression in lymphedema were contrasted with those observed in normal and surgical sham controls.

        <title>Creation of Experimental Lymphedema</title>
        <p>Post-surgical lymphedema was experimentally created in the tails of female hairless, immunocompetent SKH-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Boston, Massachusetts, United States). Prior to surgery, the mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 0.07 cc of a solution containing ketamine, xylazine, and saline. For each intervention, the skin of the tail was circumferentially incised proximally, at a point 16 mm distal to its base. The major lymphatic trunks were identified through subcutaneous injection of methylene blue distal to the surgical incision, followed by controlled, limited cautery ablation of these structures. In surgical controls (sham animals), skin incision alone was performed, with methylene blue injection but without lymphatic cautery. The normal control animals did not undergo any surgical manipulation. All animal subjects were sacrificed on day 14 of observation. After sacrifice, 0.5-gm sections of the tail were harvested for paraffin embedding and RNA extraction.</p>

        <title>Tail Volume Quantitation</title>
        <p>Tail volume was quantitated in each animal subject immediately prior to sacrifice. Volumetric assessment was performed with a manually adjusted caliper, with serial measurement of the tail circumference at 5-mm intervals along its axis. The tail volume was quantitated with the truncated cone formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b010">10</xref>].

        <title>Histology</title>
        <p>Immediately following sacrifice, 0.5-gm sections of the tail were harvested for histological analysis and RNA extraction. Sections extended from a point 4 mm proximal to the surgical incision to 8 mm beyond it. For examination of the responses remote from the point of injury, sections were harvested 4 cm distal to the surgical site. The specimens were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. After paraffin embedding, 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States). For visualization of histiocytes/mast cells, the sections were stained with a 1% toluidine blue solution (LabChem, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States) diluted in 1% NaCl. After deparaffinization in xylene, sections were rehydrated though a series of graded alcohol steps starting with 100% EtOH and ending in 50% EtOH. Slides remained in toluidine blue for 2 min and were then dehydrated through graded alcohol washes and covered with Cytoseal (Richard-Allan Scientific).</p>

        <title>LYVE-1 Immunohistochemical Staining</title>
        <p>Paraffin sections 5 μm thick were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, pretreated with target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, California, United States) in a pressure cooker, and incubated in a peroxidase block for 10 min. Sections were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-LYVE-1 antibody (1:200, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, New York, United States) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature and detection with DAB for 4 min (Envision System Kit, Dako). Tissue sections were counterstained with Gill 1 hematoxylin (Richard-Allan Scientific) for 15 s, then dehydrated in graded ethanol and coverslipped with CoverSafe (American Master*Tech Scientific, Lodi, California, United States).</p>

The single-cell suspensions from mouse spleens consisted of different hematopoietic lineages: ̃40% were CD19+ B cells, ̃20% were CD4+ T cells, ̃10%–15% were CD8+ T cells, 3% were NK1.1+ NK cells, and the rest were GR.1+ granulocytes, Mac-1+ macrophages, CD11c+ dendritic cells, and rarer cell populations. A total of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes (&gt;97% CD45+) in PBS were injected in a volume of 20 ml into the tail interstitium, 1 cm caudal to the site of surgery, in both lymphedema mice and surgical shams. Normal mice were injected at the corresponding level of the tail. Injections were performed on post-surgical day 7. Thereafter,

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have characterized a mouse model of lymphedema using in vivo functional imaging and histopathological correlation. This model of acute, acquired lymph stagnation closely simulates the volume response, histopathology, and lymphoscintigraphic characteristics of human acquired lymphedema. LYVE-1 immunohistochemistry demonstrates that this acute impairment of lymph transport is accompanied by an increase in the number and size of microlymphatic structures in the lymphedematous cutaneous tissues.</p>
      <p>We have also undertaken molecular characterization of the disease process through comprehensive transcriptional profiling of the murine lymphedematous tail skin. We have identified a set of genes and molecular pathways that play a role in the unique biology of this cutaneous response to lymph stasis (lymphedema). Recognition of this molecular response pattern is likely to enhance our comprehension of the pathogenesis and biology of lymphedema.</p>
      <p>The model has been elaborated to simulate the regional, acquired lymph stagnation that can arise after trauma, surgery, and cancer therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b008">8</xref>]. Despite apparent rapid healing of the external cutaneous wound, the model features a stable, persistent edematous increase in the volume of the tail, accompanied by a profound inflammatory response; neither edema nor inflammation is seen in surgical controls.
			</p>
      <p>The cutaneous inflammatory response observed in this model replicates clinical descriptions of human acquired lymphedema, where there is frequently evidence of concomitant chronic inflammation, and regional immune responses are distorted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b002">2</xref>]. Architectural changes in the skin and subcutaneous tissues are often profound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b003">3</xref>]. Chronic lymph stasis typically stimulates an increase in the number of fibroblasts, adipocytes, and keratinocytes in the skin. Mononuclear cells (chiefly macrophages) often demarcate the chronic inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b003">3</xref>]. In affected tissues, there is an increase in collagen deposition, accompanied by adipose and connective tissue overgrowth in the edematous regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b026">26</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>In the current study, the molecular expression profile of lymphedema, observed in parallel with the histopathology and the dynamic immune traffic imaging, suggests that the deranged immune traffic plays at least a passive, if not an active, role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In normal immune traffic, mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes from the tissues enter the afferent lymph vessels and the lymph nodes to elicit primary immune responses before reentering the vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b005">5</xref>]. It is conceivable that, in chronic lymphedema, the impairment of lymphocyte and Langerhans cell trafficking from skin to regional lymph nodes leads to inefficient clearance of foreign antigens, and provides the substrate for chronic inflammatory changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b004">4</xref>]. The complex biology of lymphedema is still quite poorly understood. Although it has been conjectured that inflammation may indeed trigger various forms of lymphangiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b027">27</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b028">28</xref>], the physiological sensors, signaling mechanisms, and cause-and-effect relationships that initiate post-natal lymphangiogenesis remain to be elucidated.
			</p>
      <p>Transcriptional profiling has been utilized to identify genes activated in disease states and to refine targets for molecular therapy. Microarray technology has been applied to the elucidation of endothelial biology in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b009">9</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b029">29</xref>], as well as to the investigation of gene expression patterns in cutaneous diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b030">30</xref>] and in a wide array of non-neoplastic diseases that entail inflammatory or immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b031">31</xref>]. This approach is particularly attractive for the problem of acquired lymphedema, where the heterogeneous cellular composition of the tissues exposed to lymph stagnation presupposes a very complex, interdependent pattern of gene expression. While the characteristic expression profiles of isolated lymphatic endothelia have previously been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b006">6</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b007">7</xref>], the current investigation represents the first in-depth molecular examination of the end-organ response to lymph stagnation. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the cellular material under investigation, the approach of high-throughput transcriptional profiling and statistical gene ontology analysis has disclosed discernable patterns of gene expression that appear to be representative of the disorder under scrutiny.
			</p>
      <p>Transcriptional profiling can provide not only a gene-by-gene view of physiological alterations in a diseased state, but also a statistically rigorous identification of the biological processes that are induced or repressed in disease. This provides a much broader and more comprehensive view of the disease process as a whole than does a simple gene list, making generation of hypotheses about mechanisms more informed. Based on GO functional annotations for each gene on the array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b032">32</xref>], we used Fisher's exact test statistical analysis to identify functional processes that are significantly induced and repressed in this disease model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030254-t007">Table 7</xref>). The results of this analysis were quite interesting, illustrating that whole panels of genes involved in the immune response, stress response, and complement activation are induced in lymphedema when compared to controls. Among the most interesting of the upregulated genes involved in these processes are many encoding proteins that reflect the inflammatory process. Calgranulin B, highly upregulated in this experimental model, belongs to a family of small calcium-binding proteins that are highly expressed in neutrophil and monocyte cytosol. These molecules are found at high levels in the extracellular milieu during inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b033">33</xref>]. Calgranulins are potent stimulators of neutrophils and likely are involved in neutrophil migration to inflammatory sites. The levels of several of these proteins are markedly elevated in psoriasis, among other conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b034">34</xref>]. Tenascin C is strongly induced by various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and its de novo expression is a reliable molecular marker for acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b035">35</xref>]. Peptidylprolyl isomerase B, also known as cyclophilin B, induces chemotaxis and integrin-mediated adhesion of T cells to the extracellular matrix in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b036">36</xref>]. Basigin is also involved in inflammatory processes and is proposed to be a receptor of cyclophilin A. Stromal cell-derived factor 1, also known as CXCL12, is a highly efficacious lymphocyte chemoattractant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b037">37</xref>]. Platelet factor 4, also known as CXCL4, is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and fibroblasts. In addition to its putative role in inflammation, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Upregulation of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein suggests a role for leukotrienes in this acute inflammatory response; glutathione peroxidase may play an ancillary role. CD63 antigen can be interpreted as a marker of basophil activation and of degranulated neutrophils and monocytes. Legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase central to Class II major histocompatiblity complex presentation of microbial antigens, is a potential molecular marker of macrophage differentiation and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b038">38</xref>]. Follistatin is an activin antagonist implicated in wound repair; activin is an important participant in inflammation, repair, and cytoprotection in various organs, but its induction is restricted to certain types of inflammation and its release is dependent upon the inflammatory setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b039">39</xref>]. Nuclear factor kappa B is a transcription factor critical to the expression of a variety of chronic inflammatory disease states. The downregulation of gelsolin in this model is notable, inasmuch as hemostatic, inflammatory, and fibroblast responses are blunted in mice lacking gelsolin. Expression of nascent polypeptide-associated complex regulates formation of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein oligomers and modulates FADD-mediated signaling; FADD protein is a critical mediator of signal transduction pathways activated by several members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor gene superfamily. Cathepsins are distinct intracellular acidic proteases that actively participate in the mechanism of antigen processing; conversely, the stefins are inhibitors of these cathepsins.
			</p>
      <p>The immune response process is also statistically significantly induced in the lymphedema group versus controls. Proteins such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated proteins are associated with activated T cell function and enhance TGF-β release by T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b040">40</xref>]. Leukocyte (or lymphocyte) specific protein 1 (LSP1) is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of neutrophil motility, chemotaxis, adhesion, and B lymphocyte apoptosis mediated by membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b041">41</xref>]. Beta-2 microglobulin is a major histocompatibility complex protein that presents peptide antigens on cell surfaces for recognition by T cell receptors. Lipocalin has recently been shown to participate in the response to bacterial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b042">42</xref>]. Galactose binding lectin is a participant in the acute phase response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b043">43</xref>]. Granulin is a high-molecular-weight secreted mitogen that is abundantly expressed in rapidly cycling epithelial cells and in the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b044">44</xref>]. High affinity Fc receptor for IgE is a key molecule in triggering the allergic reaction; it might be considered to be a mast-cell-specific protein. Interferon gamma has an important role in activating macrophages in host defenses.
			</p>
      <p>One of the most interesting findings of our study is that lymphedema mirrors many of the mechanisms of the inflammatory state, in the absence of a potent inflammatory stimulus. One would not necessarily hypothesize, a priori, that this would be the case, since the only difference between lymphedematous animals and the controls (both normals and surgical shams) was the presence of acute, acquired lymphatic stasis, with no additional inflammatory stimulus; thus, lymphatic stasis induces many of the same mechanisms as inflammatory stimuli. This important observation is novel and has led us to pursue follow-up investigation intended to determine the efficacy of inhibitors of the inflammatory pathways in reversing the pathologic responses of the tissues that are seen in lymphedema.</p>
      <p>The apparent absence of lymphatic markers in this transcriptional profile suggests that, in principle, the findings might not be specific for lymphedema. However, in parallel work performed in the same animal model, we have identified several lymphatic markers including, most importantly, upregulation of VEGF-C (but not VEGF-A) and VEGFR-3. Therapeutic induction of a lymphangiogenic response through administration of exogenous, recombinant human VEGF-C produces both an amelioration of edema and a downregulation of both of these markers of the lymphatic vascular response to acquired vascular insufficiency (unpublished data). Finally, as seen in 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030254-g003">Figure 3</xref>, LYVE-1 staining demonstrates specific lymphatic vascular changes in this model, including an increase in lymphatic microvascular size and density, in response to induced lymphatic vascular disruption. None of the morphological, histochemical, or gene expression changes referred to here are observed in animals that are subjected to surgery in the absence of induction of specific lymphatic injury (surgical controls), as described in this paper. Thus, it reasonable to state that the histological and molecular responses reflect lymph stagnation and not the more nonspecific responses of wound healing after surgical injury.
			</p>
      <p>The cellular response to stress is another process that undergoes statistically significant induction during lymph stagnation. Among the stresses that can trigger this response are the elaboration of pathophysiological signals such as cytokines and eicosanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b045">45</xref>]. The expression of a variety of heat shock proteins is upregulated in our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b045">45</xref>]. Additional evidence for the oxidative stress in lymphatic dysfunction is provided by the upregulation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b046">46</xref>]; it is a downstream effector of the potent anti-inflammatory interleukin IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b047">47</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Upregulation of gene expression related to wound repair, and importantly, to fibrosis is also prominently seen. During wound repair granulin promotes granulation and neovascularization, and regulates inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b048">48</xref>]. The expression of fibulins is induced in the setting of injury, in response to various stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b049">49</xref>]. Biglycan (BGN) has been implicated in the regulation of matrix assembly, cellular adhesion, migration, and TGF-β activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b050">50</xref>]. Endoglin (CD 105) is a type III TGF-β1 receptor. It modulates the function of TGF-β1 by binding to and modulating signal transduction by the major type I and II TGF-β1 receptors. Lysyl oxidase plays a critical role in the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices. Alpha 2 actin has been identified as a marker of myofibroblast differentiation; all fibrocontractive diseases characterized by fibrosis entail the presence of myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b051">51</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>In addition to inflammatory/immune and stress responses, we have observed a gene expression profile that reflects alterations in the angiogenic response
				<bold>.</bold> Specifically, hypoxia inducible factor 1α has a key role in the cellular response to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Alterations in the complement and 
				<italic>Wnt</italic> pathways may also contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of the skin response to lymph stasis.
			</p>
      <p>The observed differences between the lymphedematous animals and the surgical controls are noteworthy. In the absence of any observed delay in wound healing, overt infection, or inflammation, the gene expression profile in lymphedema, but not in surgical controls, is characterized by a remarkable induction of whole biological processes via coordinate upregulation of their component genes. These observations underscore the interpretation that lymphedema is a pathological process that is much more complex than a simple disorder of fluid homeostasis. Indeed, these gene expression profiles superficially resemble those of other recently elucidated inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b031">31</xref>], psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b052">52</xref>], and even atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b053">53</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b054">54</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>The differentially expressed genes in our study likely arise from a number of different cell types, including not only the cellular components of the inflammatory response, but also other involved cell types such as keratinocytes, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. We feel that it is important to study the gene expression of cells within the complex cellular milieu of the damaged end organ in lymphedema, because precisely the genes we are interested in are those whose transcription results from cell–cell or cell–interstitial fluid interactions. When one removes cells from the milieu, there are immediate changes in transcription that are not reflective of the disease state. We are, of course, interested in defining the cellular compartments that are expressing specific genes, and this topic is the focus of ongoing research in our laboratory that will be published in the future.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have used an animal model of lymphedema that shares many clinical and histopathological features with human lymphedema to identify the biological processes and genes that underlie these features. The fact that inflammatory and immune processes are significantly induced suggests that these observations will provide a useful avenue for the investigation of novel pharmacologic strategies for lymphatic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b002">2</xref>]. This approach is particularly attractive in light of the observed parallels with other systemic inflammatory disease states for which effective therapies already exist. Ultimately, such therapies must successfully diminish the impact of the soft tissue fibrosis and adipose deposition that characterize the late disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030254-b002">2</xref>]; in this regard, it is interesting to contemplate that expression of several such genes is detectably altered in this model, long before architectural evidence of the tissue abnormality is present. This identification of such genes provides an avenue for future investigation and, specifically, provides early insights into the elaboration of molecular therapeutics for this disease. Our purpose here has been to establish an animal model that can be used in two ways: first, to generate new hypotheses about unsuspected genes and pathways that are involved in lymphedema and, second, to eventually test potential pharmacologic and therapeutic interventions for their efficacy in vivo. We recognize that not all interventions that show promise in animal models translate effectively into treatments for human disease, but such in vivo testing is an essential prerequisite to human application and testing, and the establishment of a good, relatively inexpensive animal model is a very important step in allowing more high-throughput analysis of putative therapeutic interventions. These studies contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of lymphedema. Further characterization of the genes and molecular pathways identified through this effort will likely provide insights into potential novel strategies for molecular therapies.
