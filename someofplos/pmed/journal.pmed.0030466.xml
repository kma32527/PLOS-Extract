          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is still a leading cause of death worldwide. Almost a third of the world's population is infected with TB bacilli, and each year approximately 8 million people develop active TB and 2 million die as a result. Today's TB treatment, which dates back to the 1970s, is long and burdensome, requiring at least 6 mo of multidrug chemotherapy. The situation is further compounded by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and by the infection's lethal synergy with HIV/AIDS. Global health and philanthropic organizations are now pleading for new drug interventions that can address these unmet needs in TB treatment.</p>

          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Here we report OPC-67683, a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative that was screened to help combat the unmet needs in TB treatment. The compound is a mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor found to be free of mutagenicity and to possess highly potent activity against TB, including MDR-TB, as shown by its exceptionally low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.006–0.024 μg/ml in vitro and highly effective therapeutic activity at low doses in vivo. Additionally, the results of the post-antibiotic effect of OPC-67683 on intracellular <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> showed the agent to be highly and dose-dependently active also against intracellular <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> H37Rv after a 4-h pulsed exposure, and this activity at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was similar to that of the first-line drug rifampicin (RFP) at a concentration of 3 μg/ml. The combination of OPC-67683 with RFP and pyrazinamide (PZA) exhibited a remarkably quicker eradication (by at least 2 mo) of viable TB bacilli in the lung in comparison with the standard regimen consisting of RFP, isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EB), and PZA. Furthermore, OPC-67683 was not affected by nor did it affect the activity of liver microsome enzymes, suggesting the possibility for OPC-67683 to be used in combination with drugs, including anti-retrovirals, that induce or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>One-third of the world's population is infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</italic> the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). Most infected people are healthy—the bacteria can remain latent for years, hidden within cells in the body. However, every year 8 million people develop active TB, a chronic disease that usually affects the lungs, and 2 million people die. For most of the second half of the 20th century, TB was in decline because of the powerful antibiotics that were developed from the 1940s onwards. The standard treatment for TB—four antibiotics that have to be taken several times a week for at least six months to flush out any latent <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> bacteria—was introduced in the late 1970s and saved many lives. Recently, however, efforts to eradicate TB have been set back by the HIV/AIDS epidemic—people with damaged immune systems are very susceptible to TB—and the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>The treatment for TB is long and unpleasant, and patients who develop MDR-TB have to be treated with second-line drugs that are less effective, more expensive, and more toxic. In addition, for people infected with both HIV and TB, some antiretroviral and anti-TB drugs cannot be used at the same time. Many drugs are either activated or removed by enzymes in the liver, so combinations of these two classes of drugs sometimes alter liver function in a way that causes clinical problems. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new, effective anti-TB drugs that attack <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> in a different way than do existing drugs. Such drugs should ideally be active against MDR <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content>, work quickly at low doses, be active against latent bacteria, and have minimal effects on the liver so that they can be used in patients co-infected with HIV. In this study, the researchers investigated a chemical called OPC-67683.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers identified a compound that inhibited the production of mycolic acid—an essential component of the cell wall of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>—and they tested its ability to kill the organism. They then tested in detail its ability to inhibit bacterial growth in dishes of antibiotic-sensitive and MDR <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and isolates from patients. OPC-67683 inhibited the growth of all these bugs at lower concentrations than the four antibiotics used in the standard TB treatment. It also killed bacteria hidden within human cells as well as or better than these drugs. Next, the researchers treated mice infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> with OPC-67683. They found that it reduced the number of bacteria in the lungs of both normal and immunocompromised mice at lower concentrations than the standard drugs. Furthermore, when combined with two of the standard drugs, it reduced the time taken to clear bacteria from the lungs by the standard drug regimen by two months. Finally, the researchers showed that OPC-67683 had no effects on the liver enzymes that metabolize antiretrovirals, and, conversely, that the activity of OPC-67683 was not affected by liver enzymes. Thus, this agent is unlikely to cause clinical problems or lose its efficacy in HIV patients who are receiving antiretroviral drugs.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These results from laboratory and animal experiments suggest that OPC-67683 could possibly fulfill the criteria for a new anti-TB drug. OPC-67683 is active against MDR-TB. It is also active against intracellular TB, which the authors postulate could be a positive link with the effective treatment of latent TB, and it works quickly in animals when combined with existing anti-TB drugs. Importantly, it also disables <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> in a unique way and does not appear to have any major effects on the liver that might stop it from being used in combination with antiretrovirals. All these preclinical characteristics now need to be checked in people—many drugs do well in preclinical studies but fail in patients. These clinical studies need to be expedited given the upsurge in TB, and, write the researchers, OPC-67683 needs to be tested in combination with both conventional drugs and other new drugs so that the best regimen of new drugs for the treatment of TB can be found as soon as possible.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is still a leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b001">1</xref>]. Almost a third of the world's population is infected with TB bacilli, and each year approximately 8 million people develop active TB and 2 million die as a result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b002">2</xref>]. Today's TB treatment, which dates back to the 1970s, is long and burdensome, requiring at least 6 mo of multidrug chemotherapy, typically consisting of rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EB), and pyrazinamide (PZA) given under clinically observed conditions. The situation is further complicated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and by the infection's lethal synergy with HIV/AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b006">6</xref>]. Patients with MDR-TB must be treated with a combination containing second-line drugs that are less effective, more expensive, and more toxic. TB's lethal synergy with HIV/AIDS puts HIV-positive individuals with latent tubercle bacilli infection (LTBI) at a 30× to 50× greater risk of developing active TB, giving rise to TB as the number one killer among patients with AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b006">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>The pharmaceutical industry, however, has generally shown little interest in developing new, more effective drugs to address these needs, and, as a result, no new anti-TB agent with a novel mechanism of action has been launched since the introduction of RFP in 1966. Consequently, global health and philanthropic organizations are now pleading for new chemotherapy interventions that can shorten the total duration of therapy, provide improved efficacy against MDR-TB, safely treat patients co-infected with HIV/AIDS, and target LTBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>We initiated a program to screen for potent anti-TB agents that have a new structure and mechanism able to inhibit the biosynthesis of mycolic acid, and found nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivatives to exhibit such activity. Nitro-heterocyclic compounds, including various 5- and 2-nitroimidazoles and 5-nitrofurans, are known to be effective against a variety of protozoan and bacterial infections in humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b008">8</xref>]. These compounds, however, are also known to commonly possess mutagenicity. CGI-17341 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030466-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a nitroimidazooxazole derivative, has been reported to have anti-tubercular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b010">10</xref>], but the compound was not developed because of its mutagenic properties. We focused our search on new nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazoles with anti-tubercular activity that had no mutagenicity by performing the bacterial reverse mutation (BRM) test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b011">11</xref>]. About 95% of the compounds we screened earlier that had mono- or di-alkyl substituents at 2-position were mutagenic. However, after introducing heteroatoms to the substituent, we were able to successfully decrease the mutagenicity rate to 16%. Among the non-mutagenic derivatives, we found OPC-67683 to have potent anti-TB activity. We then further evaluated OPC-67683 to determine whether the compound could help address the unmet needs of TB treatment.</p>

        <p>After mixing OPC-67683 with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. bovis</named-content> BCG Tokyo, we identified only one main metabolite, and this metabolite eluted faster than OPC-67683. No metabolites, however, were observed after mixing OPC-67683 with an experimentally obtained OPC-67683-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. bovis</named-content> BCG Tokyo strain. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030466-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. The supernatant was analyzed using LC-MS/MS to determine the structure of the identified metabolite. We found the mass number of the identified metabolite to be 490 and predicted this structure to be a desnitro-imidazooxazole. We then synthesized a desnitro-imidazooxazole and performed a product ion scan with the identified metabolite and the newly synthesized compound. We observed product ions in 200, 352, 378, and 406 m/z in each experiment. Structural analysis of the main metabolite indicated that the structure was a desnitro-imidazooxazole possessing the same substituent as that of OPC-67683.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>With the several disadvantages to the current TB drug regimen, there are a number of expectations for a new anti-TB drug. An ideal new drug should be safe and able to shorten the treatment duration, be effective against MDR-TB, treat TB patients co-infected with HIV, and effectively address LTBI. We have performed our TB research program with these expectations in mind.</p>
      <p>To shorten the duration of treatment, we focused our search on finding more powerful anti-TB agents, as history has shown that the introduction of more potent drugs can effectively reduce the required duration of treatment, as was the case with RFP and PZA. For improved efficacy against MDR-TB, we screened for compounds with a new structure and mechanism of action. Furthermore, to target LTBI, we focused on compounds with activity against intracellular <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content>.</p>
      <p>Mycobacteria are well known to be wax-rich bacteria, and a main component of the wax is mycolic acid, which is detected only in mycobacteria and not in gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria or in mammalian cells. Genome research of tubercle bacilli has verified this lipid richness, showing there to be almost 250 distinct enzymes involved in the lipid metabolism of tubercle bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b030">30</xref>]. In view of the important role of mycolic acid in mycobacteria, we searched for a compound that could inhibit mycolic acid synthesis and demonstrate potent anti-TB activity in vitro. We found OPC-67683 to have both inhibitory activity on mycolic acid biosynthesis and potent in vitro activity against <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content>, as indicated by its low MIC range across many strains, including MDR-TB. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of OPC-67683 for mycolic acid subclasses were lower than those of INH, and these results correlated well with the in vitro anti-tubercular activity of OPC-67683 and INH. The anti-tubercular activity of nitro-imidazooxazole derivatives correlated well with their inhibitory activity against mycolic acid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b011">11</xref>]. We therefore concluded that the inhibitory activity of OPC-67683 against mycolic acid synthesis was a mechanism of action attributable to killing mycobacteria at least as potently as INH.</p>
      <p>As <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> can grow not only facultatively but also as intracellular organisms that survive and multiply in macrophages of the infected host, we consider it important that a compound is also able to kill intracellular TB and that such activity should correlate with a shortened treatment duration and could be an important factor in the treatment of LTBI. We therefore examined the killing activity against intracellular TB in macrophage-derived THP-1 cells. Among the tested compounds, OPC-67683 demonstrated the most potent killing activity. The killing activity of OPC-67683 at 0.1 μg/ml was similar to that of RFP at 3 μg/ml and was superior to that of INH and PA-824. The intracellular potency of antibiotics is commonly evaluated in vitro using continuous exposure rather than in animal models due to their often-rapid elimination, depending on the plasma half-life. OPC-67683 was able to demonstrate potent in vitro killing ability even at short exposure times. These results indicate that OPC-67683 would likely exert strong antibiotic activity against intracellular TB in patients even at short exposure times, which could be an advantage in intermittent treatment.</p>
      <p>PA-824 has been reported to be a prodrug metabolized to its active form by mycobacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b031">31</xref>]. Recently, Manjunatha et al reported that Rv3547 acts as the catalytic enzyme for PA-824, but the role of Rv3547 within mycobacterium is not yet clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b032">32</xref>]. Similarly, OPC-67683 also requires metabolic activation by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> in order for the anti-TB activity to be exerted. Experimentally isolated OPC-67683-resistant mycobacterium did not metabolize the compound. We confirmed a mutation in the Rv3547 gene among the resistant organisms, indicating Rv3547 to be a key enzyme involved in activating OPC-67683, as it was for PA-824 (unpublished data). According to Manjunatha et al, the metabolites of PA-824 have not yet been identified. With OPC-67683, however, the main metabolite produced in the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> was identified as a non-active desnitro-imidazooxazole. This result suggests that Rv3547 possesses a reduction potency of the nitro residue and that an intermediate between OPC-67683 and the desnitro-imidazooxazole could be the active form. After mixing radioactive OPC-67683 with viable mycobacterium, nearly 20% of the radioactive substances were not recovered. In contrast, after treating OPC-67683-resistant mycobacterium, nearly 100% of radioactivity was recovered. The action mechanism of metronidazole derivatives against <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">H. pylori</named-content> has been reported to be due to the production of a radical intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b033">33</xref>]. This information suggests the possibility that a radical intermediate that appears as the intermediate for the metabolism of a nitro residue covalently binds to the target molecule. If this hypothesis is correct, it could well explain the strong post-antibiotic effect seen with OPC-67683 against intracellular mycobacterium, a property considered necessary to kill latent TB.</p>
      <p>The therapeutic efficacy of OPC-67683 was evaluated in vivo in an experimental chronic TB mouse model. In this model, OPC-67683 exhibited the most potent anti-tubercular activity in comparison with the reference compounds. The viable bacterial counts in the lung were markedly reduced dose-dependently by OPC-67683 at 0.313 mg/kg and higher. A 95% reduction in bacterial load was achieved at 0.625 mg/kg. Furthermore, the efficacy of OPC-67683 in a TB model established using immunodeficient mice was similar to that seen using standard mice.</p>
      <p>Treatment of TB requires combination therapy not only to shorten the treatment duration but also to prevent the development of resistance. The effects of OPC-67683 in combination with currently used TB drugs were therefore evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. OPC-67683 did not exert antagonistic effects in any of the tested combinations, and produced partial synergistic or synergistic effects when combined with RFP or EB in vitro. A combination regimen containing OPC-67683, RFP, and PZA produced a steady rapid reduction in bacterial load over the first 3 mo. These results suggest that a new regimen containing OPC-67683 could possibly be effective in shortening the clinical treatment duration.</p>
      <p>Multiple-drug therapy is a common clinical practice, particularly in patients with concomitant diseases or conditions. However, whenever two or more drugs are administered concurrently, the possibility of drug interactions exists. Many drug interactions are clinically caused by inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYPs, leading to decreased metabolic clearance and increased exposure to the inhibited drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b036">36</xref>]. Rifamycin derivatives such as RFP usually induce CYP3A4 enzymes, remarkably reducing the bioavailability of the drug itself as well as other CYP-intermediated drugs, including protease inhibitors, which are indispensable in the treatment of HIV/AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b037">37</xref>]. It is therefore important that a new TB drug does not induce nor is affected by metabolic enzymes. With this in mind, we studied the interactions between OPC-67683 and metabolic enzymes. Our results showed that OPC-67683 was hardly metabolized when exposed to human and animal liver microsomes and did not have inductive, stimulatory, or inhibitory effects on CYP enzyme activities at concentrations up to 100 μM, indicating that OPC-67683, at the expected therapeutic concentrations, would not be expected to cause clinically significant interactions with other CYP-metabolized drugs, such as rifamycin derivatives. These results, together with data supporting non-compromised anti-TB activity in immunodeficient animals, suggest that OPC-67683 could be useful in treating TB patients who are also co-infected with HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p>We conclude that OPC-67683 possesses qualities that could help address the unmet needs in TB chemotherapy, i.e., the need for shortened treatment duration, effectiveness against MDR-TB, ability to be used safely in HIV/AIDS patients, and the treatment of LTBI. An early Phase II clinical study to confirm the efficacy in patients is now ongoing.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development is aiming to establish an entirely new regimen containing the best combination of new drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030466-b038">38</xref>]. Development and integration of these drugs into the regimen individually would normally be done in series, taking at least six years for each drug. We therefore attach importance to including an evaluation of the effects of OPC-67683 in combination with not only conventional drugs but also new drugs as early as possible in order to contribute data necessary for establishing the best regimen needed to address the unmet needs in TB treatment.</p>
