          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The global spread of multidrug–resistant malaria parasites has led to an urgent need for new chemotherapeutic agents. Drug discovery is primarily directed to the asexual blood stages, and few drugs that are effective against the obligatory liver stages, from which the pathogenic blood infection is initiated, have become available since primaquine was deployed in the 1950s.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Using bioassay-guided fractionation based on the parasite's hepatic stage, we have isolated a novel morphinan alkaloid, tazopsine, from a plant traditionally used against malaria in Madagascar. This compound and readily obtained semisynthetic derivatives were tested for inhibitory activity against liver stage development in vitro <italic>(P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. yoelii)</italic> and in vivo <italic>(P. yoelii)</italic>. Tazopsine fully inhibited the development of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> (50% inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>] 3.1 μM, therapeutic index [TI] 14) and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> (IC<sub>50</sub> 4.2 μM, TI 7) hepatic parasites in cultured primary hepatocytes, with inhibition being most pronounced during the early developmental stages. One derivative, <italic>N</italic>-cyclopentyl-tazopsine (NCP-tazopsine), with similar inhibitory activity was selected for its lower toxicity (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.3 μM, TI 46, and IC<sub>50</sub> 42.4 μM, TI 60, on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> hepatic stages in vitro, respectively). Oral administration of NCP-tazopsine completely protected mice from a sporozoite challenge. Unlike the parent molecule, the derivative was uniquely active against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hepatic stages.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>A readily obtained semisynthetic derivative of a plant-derived compound, tazopsine, has been shown to be specifically active against the liver stage, but inactive against the blood forms of the malaria parasite. This unique specificity in an antimalarial drug severely restricts the pressure for the selection of drug resistance to a parasite stage limited both in numbers and duration, thus allowing researchers to envisage the incorporation of a true causal prophylactic in malaria control programs.</p>

            <title>Background.</title>
            <p>The parasite that causes malaria has quickly developed resistance to many of the drugs that are commonly used to treat this disease. As a result, new drugs and drug combinations are needed. In some parts of the world where antimalarial drugs are failing due to resistance, or are not available to everyone, people often turn to traditional herbal remedies instead. These traditional plant remedies can be a useful starting point for development of new drugs, but the process of developing effective new drugs from plant remedies is long and complicated. An important initial step is to isolate and identify the active compounds from plants and then see how well these compounds perform against malaria parasites in laboratory tests. If the tests are successful, such compounds could then progress to experiments in animals and possibly eventually human trials. One plant used widely in Madagascar for treatment of malaria is <italic>Strychnopsis thouarsii;</italic> the traditional remedy consists of the plant stem bark boiled in water.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="sb1b">
            <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
            <p>The group of researchers doing this study wanted to discover candidates for new malaria drugs. They therefore wanted to find out which molecular compounds in the stem bark of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. thouarsii</named-content> contained antimalarial activity, and what particular stage of the malaria parasite's life cycle these compounds had an effect on. The researchers suspected that the agents in this plant bark had some activity against the “liver stage” of malaria infection in humans. This is the first stage of infection, after a person has been bitten by a malaria-infected mosquito, and before blood cells are invaded by malaria parasites (which then causes the disease symptoms). Very few drugs currently in existence have an effect on the “liver stage” of infection, but activity at this stage would be tremendously useful because it could mean a drug is better for prevention of malaria than others in existence.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="sb1c">
            <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
            <p>First, the researchers wanted to take the traditional herbal remedy—of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. thouarsii</named-content> bark boiled in water—and find out precisely which molecule in that remedy was responsible for the antimalarial activity. They therefore used a method called chromatography to progressively separate the herbal extract into its distinct components. At each stage of separation, the extract was checked for activity against malaria using a laboratory test. Inactive extracts were disregarded, and the active component then taken on to a further separation round. After many rounds of separation and testing, the researchers got down to a single, apparently new, molecule that was active against malaria in the laboratory test, and this molecule was named tazopsine (in the Malagasy language the word Tazo refers to malaria). In order to find out how effective the molecule was at killing malaria parasites, the researchers took human or mouse liver cells cultured in the laboratory, infected them with malaria parasites (either the malaria parasite that normally infects humans, or a related species that infects mice), and then added tazopsine at different concentrations. The compound completely killed the malaria parasites even at very low concentrations, and had activity against malaria infecting either liver cells or red blood cells. Tazopsine was then given to mice injected with a species of the malaria parasite. The compound protected most mice against malaria infection when it was used at a dosage level lower than the toxic dose. The researchers then tried making a series of different variants of tazopsine in the hope that some variants would be less toxic, but equally active as, the original compound. They found one variant, named NCP-tazopsine, that was much less toxic but just as active as tazopsine, but only against the malaria infecting liver cells.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="sb1d">
            <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
            <p>In these experiments a new molecule, tazopsine, was discovered from a Malagasy plant, and it was found to be active against liver-stage malaria parasites, in laboratory experiments and in mice. This molecule or variants of it could in future become candidate antimalarial drugs in humans. However, much work would need to be done before testing could get to that stage. Different variants of molecules related to tazopsine would need to be tested to find one that has low toxicity, and these variants would need to be fully evaluated in animals to see how they are handled in the body before any trials could begin in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Malaria re-emerged abruptly in the highlands of Madagascar in the mid-1980s and was associated with large-scale mortality and morbidity in the nonimmune inhabitants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b001">1</xref>]. Shortage of antimalarial drugs, mainly chloroquine, led the population to rely on traditional herbal remedies. In a subsequent large-scale ethnobotanical survey, 229 plant species, of which 30% are endemic to Madagascar, were reported to possess antimalarial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b002">2</xref>], although the manner in which they are administered was not recorded. One of the endemic plants, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Strychnopsis thouarsii</named-content> (Menispermaceae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b004">4</xref>], was selected for further investigations, because it is the sole ingredient of a widely used remedy reputed to provide protection specifically against malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>The traditional decoction, prepared simply by boiling <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. thouarsii</named-content> stem bark in water, showed only weak activity in vitro against the FcB1 strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> erythrocytic stages (50% inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>] 34.0 ± 9.4 μg/ml). Given that some medicinal preparations are also used as a preventive (for example, during epidemics), we hypothesized that this particular remedy, and others that are similarly poorly active against the blood stage parasites, might actually be active against the initial pre-erythrocytic (PE) phase of the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b006">6</xref>]. This phase represents the invasion of hepatocytes by the sporozoites inoculated by the mosquito and the full development of the hepatic parasites from which the pathogenic erythrocytic phase originates. Full inhibition of the PE stages of the infection provides true causal prophylaxis whereby the blood stage infection and its associated clinical manifestations would be totally prevented. For <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. vivax</named-content> and <italic>P. ovale,</italic> in which dormant hepatic forms, the hypnozoites, can give rise to relapses in humans, drugs active against hypnozoites would provide a radical cure of the infection. In drug discovery programs, routine screening for anti-PE stage activity is seldom carried out, partly because these stages are clinically silent, but mainly because access to PE parasites is costly and restricted to a few laboratories. We aimed to establish whether the traditional remedy prepared from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. thouarsii</named-content> contained agents active against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hepatic stages, and if so, to isolate them and explore their suitability as future lead compounds.</p>

Parasite inhibition was observed in the exposed cultures (IC<sub>50</sub> 8.5 ± 0.7 μg/ml), with hepatic forms completely eliminated at concentrations of 20 μg/ml or greater. Toxicity, as assessed by red neutral incorporation into the uninfected primary hepatocytes, was absent at the highest concentrations tested (100 μg/ml). In order to identify the compound(s) responsible for this activity, we conducted a bioassay-guided fractionation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0030513-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The activity resided in the methanolic, but not the ethanolic extract (consistent with a highly polar compound), with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 12.5 ± 3.5 μg/ml. Successive chromatographic separations, monitored by the in vitro <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> liver stage inhibition assays, led to the isolation of a pure active compound that we named tazopsine which represented the major constituent of the dry material obtained from the traditional decoction (10.3% w/w) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0030513-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <p>Examination of cultures subjected to suboptimal inhibitory concentrations revealed that tazopsine inhibited growth because the surviving hepatic parasites were significantly smaller than those observed in control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g002">2</xref>C).

In parallel experiments, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> hepatic stages were similarly found to be most susceptible to inhibition during the early stage of trophozoite development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). For both parasite species, the inhibitory effect was found to be dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It should be pointed out that hepatic stages of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> differ in the time required for maturation into forms containing invasive merozoites.

Nonetheless, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> model has been extensively used for biological, immunological, and chemotherapeutical investigations; and to a large extent, similar findings were observed when the corresponding studies were carried out using <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b018">18</xref>].</p>

        <p>The toxicity of tazopsine in mice and on cultured human cells was of concern. We, therefore, synthesized a series of derivatives from tazopsine, and those still found active against cultured <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 50 μM), were tested for toxicity. Of the seven substituents of tazopsine, four were targeted because they were amenable to functionalization by classical alkylation: the three hydroxyl groups at positions 4, 6, and 7, and the secondary amine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Whereas alkylation of the three hydroxyl groups led to a complete loss of activity, inhibition of liver stages was retained by seven of the ten semisynthesized <italic>N</italic>-alkylated derivatives. Their IC<sub>50</sub> values, determined using the hepatic <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> inhibition assay, ranged from 3.3 μM to 24 μM. NCP-tazopsine had the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (3.3 ± 0.05 μM) and the lowest toxicity to cultured primary mouse hepatocytes (TC<sub>50</sub> 150.5 ± 9.5 μM). These values are a significant improvement on tazopsine, yielding a TI of 46 for NCP-tazopsine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Dose-dependent inhibition of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> hepatic stages was also obtained with NCP-tazopsine, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 42.4 μM and a TC<sub>50</sub> for primary human hepatocytes of 2,549.6 ± 307.6 μM, resulting in a TI of 60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), again a more adequate value than that of tazopsine. Furthermore, NCP-tazopsine did not have any detectable effect on the multiplication in vitro–cultured erythrocytic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (both the 3D7 and the FCR3 lines) up to concentrations of 600 μM. By way of comparison, the activity of primaquine, the only drug licensed for use against the parasite's hepatic forms, has been determined in parallel in the same model systems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030513-t001">Table 1</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> for primaquine is close to 1 μM for both parasite species, and although it is significantly more active than NCP-tazopsine on <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> similar therapeutic indices were observed with the two molecules for this parasite species.</p>

        <p>Oral administration of NCP-tazopsine up to doses of 400 mg/kg for 4 d was not found to be toxic to mice. When mice treated with daily 200 mg/kg doses over 4 d were challenged with 10,000 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> sporozoites, none of the mice developed a blood stage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). At subdoses of 100 mg/kg for 4 d, 60% of the mice challenged were protected from infection, and the prepatent period of the nonprotected mice was extended by 2 d over controls, indicating a substantial reduction in the number of liver parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b019">19</xref>]. Administration of the drug NCP-tazopsine at this fully protective dose to animals inoculated with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content>–infected blood had no effect on blood stage parasite multiplication (unpublished data). Analysis of female <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. stephensi</named-content> mosquitoes fed on treated and untreated mice, revealed that NCP-tazopsine had no effect on the transmissibility of the parasite (unpublished data). These observations confirmed that NCP-tazopsine is only active against the hepatic phase of the life cycle. This result was further confirmed through quantification by real-time PCR, performed on RNA purified from the livers of another group of mice challenged with a massive sporozoite dose (120,000 parasites) and treated with NCP-tazopsine. As compared to controls, parasite loads at 42 h PI in the animals treated with the fully protective dose were reduced by 99.98%, and those at the suboptimal dose by 98.58% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030513-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have described a naturally occurring morphinan, tazopsine, that can be readily isolated in high yields (0.56% w/w) from the stem bark of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. thouarsii</named-content>. This compound represents a novel class of antimalarial drugs and possesses outstanding inhibitory activity against the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hepatic stages (Patents: Priority Europe No 04 291 055.4 April 22 2004; International Patent Application 21 April 2005 No PCT/EP 2005/005239). Tazopsine represents one of the first plant-derived molecules to be chemically characterized with activity against the parasite's hepatic stage.</p>
      <p>Exposure to tazopsine prevented the in vitro development of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> and <italic>P. yoelii,</italic> although with relatively low therapeutic indices. The semisynthetic derivative NCP-tazopsine, prepared through simple amino alkylation, showed substantially improved therapeutic indices in vitro and fully protected mice against a large sporozoite challenge when administered orally. The IC<sub>50</sub> values and the therapeutic indices of NCP-tazopsine do not differ substantially from those of the licensed primaquine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030513-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is noteworthy that the few chemical modifications of tazopsine attempted to date have led to a compound, NCP-tazopsine, with significantly reduced toxicity and which have lost activity against <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> blood stages in vitro. It is likely that further derivatizations, to which tazopsine is readily amenable, would generate one or more compounds with improved pharmacological characteristics. Other morphinans, such as the opioids morphine, codeine, and thebaine, were not found to be inhibitory when tested against the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> liver stages (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM). Indeed these morphinans differed from tazopsine and NCP-tazopsine mainly by the inverse absolute configuration of asymmetric carbons on the piperidine ring. It would thus seem that the known targets of morphine-related compounds are not implicated in the mechanism of action of tazopsine and NCP-tazopsine, which remains at present speculative. Classical biochemical and pharmacological investigations of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stages are severely hampered by the nonavailability of purified infected hepatocytes.</p>
      <p>The urgent need to counter the emergence and global spread of drug-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> parasites has favored the search for novel blood schizontocides to the detriment of causal prophylactic agents. Furthermore, given the logistic obstacles to screening compounds for activity against the hepatic stage, namely the simultaneous availability of primary hepatocytes and sporozoites, only a minor fraction of the compounds screened for anti–asexual-stage activity are assayed against the infected hepatocyte. Consequently, there is a limited number of drugs effective against the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stage parasite. The deployment of primaquine, the only drug specifically developed to inhibit the liver infection, has been curtailed by the associated toxicity, poor compliance, and increased risk of hemolysis when administered to persons with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This latter problem will also affect the two related synthetic 8-aminoquinolines, bulaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b020">20</xref>] and tafenoquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b021">21</xref>], presently undergoing clinical trials. Antifolates and atovaquone, primarily used in combination to treat the blood stage infection, were also shown to be active against the infected hepatocyte. However, the high prevalence of resistant parasites to the former, and the ease with which resistance arises to the latter, limit the prophylactic usefulness of these drugs. Quinine, chloroquine, mefloquine, and artemisinin-based compounds, have little or no efficacy against the hepatic parasite. Experimental compounds belonging to other chemical classes, e.g., antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b022">22</xref>], antihistaminics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b023">23</xref>], or anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b024">24</xref>] have been reported to have activity against the PE stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Most of these were tested only on rodent malaria parasites and in which they were also active against the blood stages. Two quinoline esters prevented relapse of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. cynomolgi</named-content> in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b025">25</xref>], as did two imidazolidinedione compounds prepared from the antifolate chlorproguanil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b026">26</xref>]. Although the first had additional activity against blood stage parasites, the two imidazolidinedione molecules proved not to inhibit the erythrocytic stages of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> in mice nor those of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b027">27</xref>]. The hepatic stage specificity of the imidazolidinediones and NCP-tazopsine places these lead molecules from two distinct chemical classes into a novel category of antimalarial compounds with true causal prophylactic activity.</p>
      <p>Although tazopsine constitutes a suitable lead candidate for further optimization, there are a number of issues that would need to be addressed before it reaches the status of a drug candidate. Toxicity is a very important parameter since a drug aimed for prophylactic use will by definition be administered over long periods of time. Two aspects of the results are of some encouragement in this context. Derivatives, such as NCP-tazopsine, that retain inhibitory activity yet have significantly reduced toxicity as compared to the parent compound tazopsine, were readily obtained. The recent development of high-throughput screening of drug activity on <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hepatic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b028">28</xref>] should enhance lead optimization, and provide candidates for pharmaceutical optimization (adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion [ADME]). Full protection from an in vivo challenge was afforded by oral administration of NCP-tazopsine, although it remains to be demonstrated that a similar route of intake will be equally effective in primates. As compared to blood schizontocides in which inhibitory activity is observed in the low nM range, the μM concentrations of tazopsine and NCP-tazopsine required for the inhibitory activity of hepatic stages in vitro were relatively modest. The equivalent values for primaquine (0.64 μM and 0.8 μM for the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> liver stages in vitro), were also close to 1 μM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030513-t001">Table 1</xref>). These high concentrations, relative to blood schizontocides, might reflect the fact that the target of the drug is found within the cells of the liver, a metabolically complex and active organ in part devoted to detoxification.</p>
      <p>Historically, a primary aim of antimalarial drug research has been to develop a true causal prophylactic. These efforts were much diminished by the introduction of the remarkably successful chloroquine after the second World War, although the high rate of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. vivax</named-content> relapses in military personnel returning to the United States from Korea in the early 1950s led to primaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b029">29</xref>], a drug still primarily used to effect the radical cure of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. vivax</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. ovale</named-content> by preventing relapses due to hypnozoites. The fact that all antimalarials used to date with true prophylactic activity also inhibit the erythrocytic stages precludes any consideration of mass administration. This is because exposure of blood stage parasites, in which cyclical multiplication leads to high parasite loads and the persistence of millions of parasites in the human host for many weeks or months, to subcurative drug concentrations exerts substantial pressure that would lead to the selection and dissemination of drug-resistant parasites. This exposure to selective drug pressure constitutes a major impediment to efforts aimed at developing novel causal prophylactic compounds. A drug active solely against the liver stages would exert only marginal selective pressure, since a single infective bite leads to an average of a few dozen hepatic stage parasites that usually persist for less than 2 wk, during which they undergo a single multiplicative expansion. The deployment of such a drug would be especially valuable in containing the spread of the disease in areas of emerging or epidemic malaria, and in residents subjected to seasonal transmission. It would be the ideal choice for transient visitors to endemic areas, such as displaced populations, tourists, and the military. In populations residing in areas of higher endemicity, the drug would help reduce the effective dose of infectious sporozoites, even if deployment is suboptimal. The consequences of modest reductions in hepatic stage parasite numbers might have disproportionate beneficial consequences on malaria morbidity, as suggested by the results of one of the Phase IIb trials of the anti-PE vaccine RTS,S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030513-b031">31</xref>]. Moreover, administration of this type of drug would not impede natural boosting of immune responses against PE or erythrocytic stage parasites.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the discovery of molecules with exclusive action against the hepatic phase of the life cycle lays the foundations to re-evaluate causal prophylaxis as a tool that can be incorporated in control strategies and enhance global efforts to reduce the major burden exacted by malaria.</p>

We are indebted to Thierry Houpert, Khemaïs Farhati, and Eliane Giboyeau for the provision of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. yoelii</named-content>–infected mosquitoes. This paper is dedicated to François Frappier, who tragically died while the work was in progress.</p>
