          <title>Background</title>
          <p>In multiple sclerosis, inflammation can successfully be prevented, while promoting repair is still a major challenge. Microglial cells, the resident phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), are hematopoietic-derived myeloid cells and express the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), an innate immune receptor. Myeloid cells are an accessible source for ex vivo gene therapy. We investigated whether myeloid precursor cells genetically modified to express TREM2 affect the disease course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>EAE was induced in mice by immunization with a myelin autoantigen. Intravenous application of TREM2-transduced bone marrow–derived myeloid precursor cells at the EAE peak led to an amelioration of clinical symptoms, reduction in axonal damage, and prevention of further demyelination. TREM2-transduced myeloid cells applied intravenously migrated into the inflammatory spinal cord lesions of EAE-diseased mice, showed increased lysosomal and phagocytic activity, cleared degenerated myelin, and created an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu within the CNS.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Intravenously applied bone marrow–derived and TREM2-tranduced myeloid precursor cells limit tissue destruction and facilitate repair within the murine CNS by clearance of cellular debris during EAE.

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS; the brain and spinal cord) in which communications within the brain are disrupted. In healthy individuals, the brain controls the body by sending electrical messages along nerve fibers. Like electrical wires, these fibers have to be insulated to allow the efficient transfer of electrical impulses. This insulation is provided by myelin, a fatty tissue that surrounds the nerve fibers. In patients with MS, patchy myelin loss, inflammation, and scarring (sclerosis) disrupt nerve transmissions, causing weakness or paralysis of the limbs, balance and coordination problems, and numerous other symptoms. The damage to the myelin (which increases over time) is caused by the patient's immune system, but what triggers this abnormal behavior is unclear. There is no cure for MS, but drugs that modulate the immune system (for example, interferons and steroids) can slow its progression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>Any treatment for MS needs to limit tissue destruction by the immune system and to promote the repair of the damaged myelin and nerve fibers. Although researchers have identified some agents that promote nerve repair, it is difficult to get them into the CNS, which is protected by an impermeable barrier. However, some cell types can migrate into the CNS so it might be possible to adapt them as delivery vehicles for therapeutic agents. In this study, the researchers investigated whether bone marrow–derived myeloid precursor cells (a source of several immune system cell types) might be useful for the treatment of MS, both as delivery vehicles and as a source of cells that can resolve inflammation and clear cellular debris from sites of myelin destruction; this clearance has to occur before nerves and myelin can be repaired. Myeloid precursor cells, the researchers reasoned, might satisfy both these requirements because they naturally migrate into the CNS where some turn into microglia, immune system cells that engulf and digest cellular debris.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers isolated myeloid precursor cells from mouse bone marrow and induced the expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2, a protein made by microglia) in them using a viral vector. They injected these TREM2-expressing cells into the veins of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, an animal model of MS) and examined their migration into the spinal cord, their effect on EAE symptoms, and their effect on cell debris clearance and inflammatory responses in spinal cord lesions. Neither TREM2-expressing nor control myeloid precursor cells migrated into the spinal cord when injected into healthy mice or into animals just beginning to show the symptoms of EAE. However, both cell types migrated into the spinal cord when injected into animals when EAE symptoms were at their peak. The injection of TREM2-expressing myeloid precursor cells (but not control myeloid precursor cells) at this time reduced EAE symptoms and nerve damage, and halted myelin loss. It also increased the clearance of cell debris and myelin fragments and created an anti-inflammatory environment in the spinal cord lesions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These findings indicate that the intravenous injection of bone marrow–derived myeloid precursor cells engineered to express TREM2 can reduce clinical symptoms and induce recovery in mice with EAE. Whether the TREM2-expressing myeloid precursor cells act locally in the CNS or indirectly via other immune system cells is not clear yet. In addition, the findings need to be replicated in more animals before this approach is tested in people. Nevertheless, the intravenous injection of cells of this type could provide a two-pronged approach to the treatment of MS (and other neuroinflammatory diseases). First, bone marrow–derived myeloid precursor cells that have been engineered to express TREM2 could help to treat MS by clearing tissue debris and reducing inflammation in spinal cord lesions. Second, the same cells could be used to deliver agents to the lesions that promote nerve repair. Importantly, these results suggest that TREM2-expressing myeloid precursor cells might have the potential to treat MS after the onset of clinical symptoms, an important consideration for a chronic disease that often indicates relapses by new clinical symptoms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hematopoietic-derived myeloid cells physiologically migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) not only during development, but also in adulthood, and become resident perivascular macrophages and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b003">3</xref>]. Data suggest that there is a continuous and lifelong turnover of perivascular brain macrophages replenished by bone marrow–derived cells. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that bone marrow cells are recruited to sites of axonal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b005">5</xref>] or to beta-amyloid depositions in Alzheimer disease animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b007">7</xref>] to become functional microglia-like cells. The exact cellular subtype of myeloid precursors developing into microglia is not known, but parenchymal microglial cells have been reported to be phenotypically very similar to uncommitted myeloid precursors having “empty” major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, comparable cystein protease profiles, and the capacity to differentiate into dendritic-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b009">9</xref>]. Thus, bone marrow–derived myeloid cells (BM-MC) might reflect microglial precursors and may serve as a natural vehicle for CNS cell and gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Efficient removal of apoptotic cells and cellular debris by macrophages during acute injury or degenerative diseases is essential for repair of the damaged tissue, inflammation resolution, and disease recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b013">13</xref>]. Recently, we discovered in vitro that the microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) stimulates phagocytosis and down-regulates inflammatory signals in microglia via the signaling adaptor molecule DAP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b014">14</xref>]. Both clearance of tissue debris by phagocytosis and a protective cytokine milieu have been implicated as positive factors for tissue repair in multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the microglial cytokine milieu determines the outcome of the inflammatory process in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b018">18</xref>]. Therefore, clearance of cellular debris and resolution of inflammation are important for recovery and repair in neuroinflammatory diseases.</p>

        <title>Isolation and Flow Cytometry Analysis of Microglia Derived from the CNS</title>
        <p>Cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord of normal or EAE-diseased mice were isolated and homogenized. Homogenates were filtrated through a 40-μM nylon mesh in a 50-ml tube, diluted with PBS and centrifuged (1,500 rpm) at room temperature for 5 min. Microglia and macrophages were separated through a density gradient. The cells were suspended in 70% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.amershambiosciences.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.amershambiosciences.com</ext-link>) and overlaid with 37% and 30% gradient. The density gradient was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Myelin collected in the 30% Percoll layer was removed. The majority of microglia/macrophages were found in the interface of 37% and 70% Percoll. Cells were obtained from this interface and were washed from the Percoll with PBS. Cells were confirmed to be microglia/macrophages by flow cytometry analysis with specific biotinylated antibodies directed against CD11b (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bdbiosciences.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bdbiosciences.com</ext-link>) followed by streptavidin-PE (Dianova, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dianova.de" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dianova.de</ext-link>). For flow cytometry analysis, cells were incubated with a monoclonal rat anti-mouse TREM2 antibody (R&amp;D Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rndsystems.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.rndsystems.com</ext-link>) and visualized with goat anti-rat FITC (Dianova).</p>

        <title>Isolation and Culture of BM-MC</title>
        <p>Isolation of myeloid precursors was performed by a modified method published by Willenbring and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b019">19</xref>]. In detail, bone marrow cells were isolated from adult 6–8-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) from the medullary cavities of the tibia and femur of the hind limbs. Removal of erythrocytes was performed by lysis with hypotonic solution. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Pan Biotech, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pan-biotech.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pan-biotech.com</ext-link>) and 10 ng/ml of granulocyte macrophage–colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R&amp;D Systems) in 75-cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbo.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gbo.com</ext-link>). After 24 h, non-adherent cells were collected and re-seeded in fresh 75-cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks. Medium was changed after 5 d and BM-MC were collected for experiments after 10–11 d.</p>

In brief, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at indicated time points. After removal of the spinal cord and fixation in 4% buffered formalin, spinal cord was dissected and embedded in paraffin. After microwave pretreatment in 10 mM citric acid, the following antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis of the spinal cord tissue: monoclonal rat anti-mouse MAC3 (clone M3/84, dilution: 1:200, BD Biosciences Pharmingen) for macrophage staining, monoclonal rat anti-human/mouse CD3 (clone CD3–12, dilution: 1:200, Serotec Laboratories) for T cells, monoclonal mouse anti-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (clone 22C11, dilution: 1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, California, United States) for axonal degeneration, monoclonal mouse anti-SMI 32 (dilution: 1:200, Sternberger Monoclonals, Lutherville, Massachusetts, United States) for the detection of dephosphorylated neurofilament, and polyclonal rabbit anti-myelin basic protein (dMBP, AB5864, dilution 1:2000, Chemicon) for degraded MBP.

        <p>Inflammatory spinal cord lesions were defined in each animal on the basis of the MAC3 staining and were further analyzed by immunohistochemistry and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. The number of MAC3+ cells, CD3+ cells, APP and dMBP-positive deposits, SMI-positive axons, and the level of demyelination in LFB staining were quantified on three lumbal spinal cord sections in at least three mice per group using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (SIS Color View) attached to a computer with software for image analysis (AnalySIS; Soft Imaging System, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.soft-imaging.net" xlink:type="simple">http://www.soft-imaging.net</ext-link>).

        <title>Expression of TREM2 within the CNS</title>
        <p>TREM2 has been shown to be expressed on certain subtypes of myeloid cells, particularly osteoclasts, immature dendritic cells, and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b021">21</xref>]. To study the expression kinetics of TREM2 during EAE, we performed flow cytometry analysis of TREM2 on freshly isolated microglia and resident CNS cells identified by immmunostaining for CD11b. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated TREM2 expression on a minority of microglial cells under normal conditions in adult C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Next, we induced EAE by immunization with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35–55. At day 4 after onset of clinical symptoms of EAE, TREM2 was detected on approximately half of the CD11b+ cells in the spinal cord, the tissue region mostly affected by the inflammatory lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g001">1</xref>B). In detail, the percentage of TREM2 and CD11b+ cells in the spinal cord increased from 23.3% (standard error of the mean [SEM] 16.1) in the normal tissue to 58.8% (SEM 4.2) at day 4 after onset of clinical signs of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The up-regulation of TREM2 was detected mainly in the spinal cord, but not in the cortex and cerebellum, indicating that TREM2 expression is associated with the inflammatory lesions. The up-regulation of TREM2 on CD11b+ cells was not long lasting and returned back to almost normal levels at day 18 after onset of clinical EAE symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>

Increased phagocytosis of beads and apoptotic cells after TREM2 stimulation was completely neutralized by the ERK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that ERK signaling was involved in TREM2-mediated phagocytosis by BM-MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). TREM2 cross-linking antibodies stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in TREM2-transduced BM-MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g003">Figure 3</xref>), but did not modify cell surface expression of MHC class II, CD80, CD86, CD36, CCR7, and CD11c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0040124-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

Five independent experiments were performed, and each of them was done in quadruplicate.</p>
            <p>(B) Anti-inflammatory activity of TREM2 stimulation. Myeloid cells were transduced with TREM2 (open bars) or control GFP vector (filled bars). Myeloid cells were cultured on plates coated with TREM2 cross-linking antibodies (left graph). One hour later, cells were stimulated with LPS. Gene transcript levels for TNFα, IL-1β, NOS2, and IL-10 were quantified by real-time PCR after 48 h. TREM2-transduced myeloid cells showed reduced gene transcript levels of IL-1β and NOS2 and an increased level of IL-10. In addition, apoptotic cells derived from neuron-enriched cultures were added to myeloid cells (right graph). Gene transcript levels for TNFα, IL-1β, NOS2, and IL-10 were quantified by real-time PCR after 48 h. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

        <p>Next, we asked whether phagocytosis is associated with down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine gene transcription. Stimulation of TREM2-transduced BM-MC by solely TREM2-specific antibody did not modulate gene transcription of inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0040124-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, we studied the effect of TREM2 stimulation on LPS-treated BM-MC. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of several cytokines was performed 48 h after TREM2 cross-linking of TREM2-transduced BM-MC and control GFP vector–transduced BM-MC, which have been stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS. Interestingly, stimulation by TREM2 antibody 1 h before LPS treatment showed increased IL-10 (5.7-fold [1.3 SEM]) and decreased interleukin-1β (IL-1β; 0.5-fold [0.1 SEM]) gene transcription in TREM2-transduced BM-MC compared to control GFP vector–transduced BM-MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Moreover, we investigated gene transcript levels of cytokines in BM-MC cocultured for 48 h with apoptotic mixed neuron-enriched cultures. Gene transcripts of IL-1β and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) were decreased in TREM2-transduced BM-MC after challenge with apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Transduction by TREM2 enabled BM-MC to release a substantial amount of IL-10 after stimulation as determined by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). In detail, TREM2-transduced BM-MC released 130 pg/ml IL-10 (SEM 52) after stimulation with LPS- and TREM2-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p>

        <p>We also analyzed migration of TREM2 or control GFP vector–transduced BM-MC into the CNS after application in mice intravenously. In healthy mice, no GFP+ cells were detected on the microscopic level in the CNS tissue after injection of 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> BM-MC. Likewise, we failed to detect GFP-transduced BM-MC in the CNS of mice afflicted by EAE, when 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected intravenously at day 1 after appearance of the first clinical symptoms. Then, we injected 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> TREM2 or control GFP vector–transduced BM-MC intravenously into EAE-diseased mice at 4 d after onset of first clinical symptoms, at a time period reflecting the peak of the disease.

In detail, analysis of inflammatory perivascular EAE lesions at day 2 after cell therapy with TREM2-BM-MC demonstrated a density of 261 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> of invaded GFP+ cells (standard deviation [SD] 82). The majority (86%) of invaded TREM2-BM-MC was located within the perivascular area with a distance of less than 50 μm from the vessel wall. A substantial proportion (14%) of the invaded GFP+ cells was also detected within the spinal cord parenchyma.</p>

        <p>Invaded myeloid cells were round in shape and were clearly positive for the common hematopoietic surface marker CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), but not for the microglial typical marker Iba1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Myeloid cells applied intravenously migrated into the spinal cord lesions within 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), indicating that they did not home in to other organs before entering the nervous tissue.

Finally, we did not detect substantial numbers of GFP+ cells in the spinal cord at day 4 after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). At day 7, no GFP+ cells were detected in the spinal cord, indicating that they either underwent apoptosis or migrated away from the spinal cord. Next, flow cytometry analysis of GFP+ cells isolated from the spinal cord was performed. Myeloid cells transduced with TREM2 showed expression of TREM2 within the spinal cord tissue, while no TREM2 expression was detected on GFP-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

In total, 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> myeloid cells transduced either with TREM2 or with the control GFP vector, or with PBS alone, were injected intravenously in EAE-diseased mice at day 4 after disease onset. No difference in the number of infiltrating T cells (CD3) and macrophages (MAC3) into the nervous tissue was detected at day 2 after application of TREM2-transduced cells, GFP-transduced cells, or PBS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">5</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040124-t001">Table 1</xref>).

An increased number of cells showing Lamp2 staining was detected in the spinal cord of EAE-diseased mice at day 2 after treatment with TREM2-transduced myeloid cells (37.5 [SEM 4.2] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) compared to mice treated with GFP-transduced myeloid cells (11.0 [SEM 3.1] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) or vehicle control (7.7 [SEM 0.9] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">5</xref>B).

At day 2 after cell injection, spinal cords were removed, stained, and analyzed. Macrophages were labeled by MAC3 and T cells by CD3-specific antibodies. Cell therapy by myeloid precursors did not affect the spinal cord immune cell infiltrates. Furthermore, quantification of cells stained for degenerated MBP (dMBP) in the spinal cord of EAE-diseased mice at day 2 after injection was performed, and the amount of degenerated MBP was reduced by cell therapy with TREM2-transduced myeloid cells. Quantification of Lamp2-positive cells (LAMP2) in spinal cord lesions of EAE-diseased mice at day 2 after cell injection was performed. The number of Lamp2-positive cells showing phagocytic activity was increased by the intravenous injection of TREM2-BM-MC.

        <p>Next, we investigated in vivo the distribution of degenerated myelin basic protein (MBP) immunoreactivity, which has been phagocytosed and degraded in lysosomes by myeloid cells in inflammatory lesions. Degenerated MBP was detected with a specific antibody directed against an epitope unmasked during the process of myelin degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b022">22</xref>]. The number of cells immunostained for degenerated MBP in the spinal cord of EAE-diseased mice was reduced at day 2 after treatment with TREM2-transduced myeloid cells (34.5 [SEM 3.5] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) compared to mice treated with GFP-transduced myeloid cells (50.5 [SEM 1.5] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) or vehicle control (48.0 [SEM 9.0] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Finally, we analyzed whether increased phagocytosis by TREM2-transduced myeloid cells is also associated with an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu in the spinal cord lesions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis at day 2 after cell injection demonstrated a significant decrease of gene transcription of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interferon-γ (IFNγ), and IL-1β, and an increase of gene transcript of IL-10 (3.7-fold) in the spinal cord of the TREM2-BM-MC–injected EAE-diseased mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

Furthermore, a change in the spinal cord cytokine profile was later followed by a slightly decreased number of infiltrating immune cells. In detail, at day 14 after treatment, 180.7 (SEM 41.5) CD3+ cells/mm<sup>2</sup> and 146.7 (SEM 62.1) MAC3+ cells/mm<sup>2</sup> were counted in the spinal cord tissue of TREM2-BM-MC–treated animals, while 264.3 (SEM 54.8) CD3+ cells/mm<sup>2</sup> and 262.3 (SEM 30.8) MAC3+ cells/mm<sup>2</sup> were observed in GFP-BM-MC–treated mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040124-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Apart from its clinical effect, TREM2-transduced cells protected and supported repair of the spinal cord tissue. At day 14 after cell therapy with TREM2-transduced myeloid cells, a clear reduction of axonal damage and demyelination was detected as determined by immunostaining for APP, dephosphorylated neurofilament (SMI32), and staining of myelin (LFB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In detail, mice treated with 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> TREM2-transduced BM-MC showed, at day 14 after cell injection, fewer axonal APP-stained deposits per mm<sup>2</sup> (23.0 [SEM 4.6]) compared to either 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> GFP-transduced (41.6 [SEM 5.0]) or PBS-injected EAE-diseased mice (45.3 [SEM 16.0]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Likewise, the relative number of dephosphorylated axons was reduced to 6.8 (SEM 0.9) compared to either GFP-transduced (16.3 [SEM 1.6]) or PBS-injected EAE animals (16.5 [SEM 1.6]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040124-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have shown that intravenously applied TREM2-transduced myeloid precursors ameliorate clinical symptoms and induce recovery from EAE. The TREM2-transduced myeloid cells migrated into the CNS lesions, induced myelin debris clearance, and created an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu. The treated mice showed less axonal injury and reduced demyelination. The data demonstrate that TREM2+ myeloid cells are involved in tissue debris clearance and resolution of inflammation and suggest a novel approach to the therapy of neuroinflammatory disease.</p>
      <p>TREM2 on microglia fulfills an important function for CNS tissue homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations of TREM2 in humans result in inflammatory neurodegeneration, loss of myelin, basal ganglia calcification, and bone abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b025">25</xref>]. TREM2 is selectively expressed on immature dendritic cells, osteoclasts, and microglia, but not on monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b026">26</xref>]. TREM2 in osteoclasts is involved in resorption of bones, also requiring phagocytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b027">27</xref>]. In microglial cells, TREM2 promotes phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b014">14</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that TREM2 is expressed on macrophages infiltrating CNS tissue from the circulation, and that TREM2 acts to inhibit cytokine production by macrophages in response to several toll-like receptor ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b028">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we have demonstrated that the gene transfer of TREM2 in bone marrow myeloid precursor cells supports phagocytosis of beads and apoptotic neuronal cells and, in addition, shows strong anti-inflammatory activity. Both effects are required to promote the repair of injured CNS tissue by engulfing tissue debris and shutting off inflammatory processes. We injected the TREM2-transduced myeloid cells into the circulation of EAE-diseased mice and detected these cells in their spinal cord lesions as well as in the spleen, but failed to detect any change in the cytokine profile in the spleen and lymph nodes. Possibly, the ligand of TREM2, which appears to be a component of apoptotic neuronal cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b014">14</xref>], is not present in normal spleen and lymph nodes, but is located in the spinal cord tissue that has the lesion. The TREM2-transduced myeloid cells migrated into the spinal cord lesions within 2 h following intravenous application, showed increased lysosomal activity, cleared the myelin debris, and created an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu within the spinal cord. The invaded myeloid cells remained within the lesions for several days, but were not detected after 1 wk, indicating that they either evaded the lesions or underwent apoptosis or autophagy.</p>
      <p>Our data show that TREM2 on myeloid cells supports an essential function of the CNS tissue phagocytes. The phagocytic function of macrophages and microglia has been implicated in the removal of myelin debris during EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b029">29</xref>]. Particularly, macrophages appear to fulfill an important role in the clearance of tissue debris, since depletion of macrophages impairs CNS remyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b031">31</xref>]. Rapid clearance of myelin debris is required since components of the myelin such as Nogo prevent axonal regeneration and axonal remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b032">32</xref>]. Axonal remodeling has been shown to contribute to recovery and repair in EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b033">33</xref>]. Therefore, the reduced amount of demyelination and axonal damage after therapy with TREM2-transduced myeloid precursor cells might also be partially explained by improved remyelination and axonal remodeling via facilitated engulfment of myelin debris. Alternatively, reduced demyelination and less axonal injury after therapy with TREM2-transduced myeloid precursor cells could be a positive effect of the improved resolution of inflammation and the anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu, both limiting the inflammation-induced tissue damage.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, TREM2 of myeloid cells created an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu in the spinal cord of EAE-diseased mice. Particularly, the gene transcript level of TNFα was reduced, while that of IL-10 increased after application of TREM2-transduced myeloid precursor cells. Increased gene transcripts of IL-10 might be directly due to invaded TREM2-transduced myeloid precursors stimulated within the lesion sites, but we cannot exclude the possibility that TREM2-transduced myeloid precursors act indirectly via a secondary immune organ to stimulate a regulatory immune cell type migrating into the CNS. IL-10 has profound regulatory effects on the immune system and is vital for the recovery phase of EAE. Interestingly, IL-10 gene transcripts are increased in the CNS during the recovery phase of EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b034">34</xref>]. IL-10 is involved in the disease recovery and resolution of inflammation because remission is impaired in IL-10–deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b035">35</xref>]. Furthermore, the involvement of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells in the recovery from EAE can be narrowed to their production of IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b036">36</xref>]. Most importantly, exogenous administration of IL-10 is only truly effective at ameliorating EAE when targeted directly to the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b037">37</xref>]. Thus, IL-10 produced by the TREM2-transduced myeloid precursor cells during engulfment of myelin debris might favor recovery from EAE.</p>
      <p>The TREM2-transduced myeloid cells were applied during ongoing EAE at a time point when the antigen-priming inflammatory phase has been completed and the recovery phase started. No interference with immune cell infiltration was observed at day 2 after cell injection since EAE-diseased mice treated with TREM2-transduced myeloid cells showed the same amount of infiltrating T cells and macrophages as EAE animals injected with control GFP vector–transduced myeloid cells. However, at day 14 after cell injection, EAE-diseased mice treated with TREM2-transduced myeloid cells demonstrated a slightly reduced number of MAC3+ macrophages and CD3+ T cells within the inflammatory lesions, indicating that the cell therapy by TREM2-transduced myeloid cells promoted resolution of inflammatory cells. TREM2-transduced myeloid cells did not improve clinical symptoms of EAE, if applied at day 1 of clinical symptoms. We failed to detect the GFP-labeled cells within the CNS after application of cells at this early time point, indicating that migration of cells into the lesion side is required for therapeutic efficacy.</p>
      <p>EAE has been studied in DAP12-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b038">38</xref>], which might have impaired TREM2 signaling. While TREM2 of myeloid precursor cells improved ongoing disease by possibly acting locally within the CNS, DAP12-deficient animals failed to develop EAE due to impaired antigen priming during the inflammatory phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b038">38</xref>]. Furthermore, myeloid precursor cells used in our study failed to express MHC class II and costimulatory molecules required for antigen presentation to auto-reactive CD4+ T cells. In this respect, myeloid precursor cells were very similar to resting microglial cells, which lack MHC class II and CD86 expression under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>In EAE, auto-reactive CD4+ TH1 cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα initiating a CNS inflammatory reaction, which is then amplified within the CNS by microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b040">40</xref>]. The inflammatory phase is either promptly resolved by shutting off inflammation or deteriorates in a neurodegenerative phase, which involves axonal and neuronal injury. This secondary progressive neurodegenerative phase, particularly with axonal tissue loss, appears to be resistant to anti-inflammatory therapies and predicts the clinical outcome in MS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b042">42</xref>]. Most experimental approaches in EAE aim at skewing the cytokine profile of myelin-specific TH cells from TH1 to TH2 by altered peptide ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b044">44</xref>], hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (“statins”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b045">45</xref>], or DNA vaccination combined with gene delivery of interleukin-4 (IL-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b046">46</xref>]. Neuroprotective and repair-promoting strategies of EAE are relatively unexplored, most probably due to the limited capacity of protein therapeutics to pass the blood–brain barrier and enter the target tissue. Targeting of cells into the lesioned CNS offers the possibility of a site-directed cellular effect and local release of therapeutic proteins. Genetically modified myelin-specific CD4+ TH1 cells over-expressing the neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, have been applied intravenously to treat EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b047">47</xref>], but T cells were auto-reactive in nature and nerve growth factor also acted directly on immune cells such as monocytes.</p>
      <p>Recently, brain-derived neurospheres have been injected intravenously and have been successfully used for cell therapy of EAE inducing repair and immunomodulatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040124-b049">49</xref>], but these adult neural precursors are not a suitable cellular source for broad clinical applications. In contrast, bone marrow is an accessible source of myeloid precursor cells and, in addition, these cells can also be expanded to sufficient cell numbers from the peripheral blood of patients following bone marrow mobilization. To create a microglia-like phenotype, we transduced myeloid cells with the TREM2 receptor and treated EAE by intravenous cell injection.</p>
      <p>Thus, we conclude that TREM2-transduced myeloid precursor cells applied intravenously ameliorate EAE either locally inside the CNS or indirectly via another regulatory immune cell type by clearance of tissue debris and resolution of inflammation, thereby opening new avenues for cell therapy of inflammatory and degenerative CNS diseases.</p>
