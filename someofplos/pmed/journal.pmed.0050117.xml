				<article-title>How Might Cocaine Interfere with Brain Development?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <sec id="st1">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Prenatal exposure of the developing brain to cocaine causes morphological and behavioral abnormalities. Recent studies indicate that cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition and/or apoptosis in neural progenitor cells may play a pivotal role in causing these abnormalities. To understand the molecular mechanism through which cocaine inhibits cell proliferation in neural progenitors, we sought to identify the molecules that are responsible for mediating the effect of cocaine on cell cycle regulation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Microarray analysis followed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR was used to screen cocaine-responsive and cell cycle-related genes in a neural progenitor cell line where cocaine exposure caused a robust anti-proliferative effect by interfering with the G1-to-S transition. <italic>Cyclin A2</italic>, among genes related to the G1-to-S cell cycle transition, was most strongly down-regulated by cocaine. Down-regulation of cyclin A was also found in cocaine-treated human primary neural and A2B5+ progenitor cells, as well as in rat fetal brains exposed to cocaine in utero. Reversing cyclin A down-regulation by gene transfer counteracted the proliferation inhibition caused by cocaine. Further, we found that cocaine-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which involves N-oxidation of cocaine via cytochrome P450, promotes cyclin A down-regulation by causing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and expression of ATF4. In the developing rat brain, the P450 inhibitor cimetidine counteracted cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation as well as down-regulation of cyclin A.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st3">
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of cyclin A underlies cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition in neural progenitors. The down-regulation of cyclin A is initiated by N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine and consequent ER stress. Inhibition of cocaine N-oxidative metabolism by P450 inhibitors may provide a preventive strategy for counteracting the adverse effects of cocaine on fetal brain development.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>Every year, cocaine abuse by mothers during pregnancy exposes thousands of unborn infants (fetuses) to this powerful and addictive stimulant. Maternal cocaine abuse during early pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage; its use during late pregnancy slows the baby's growth and can trigger premature labor. Babies exposed to cocaine shortly before birth are often irritable and have disturbed sleep patterns. They can also be very sensitive to sound and touch and consequently hard to comfort. These problems usually resolve spontaneously within the first few weeks of life but some permanent birth defects are also associated with frequent cocaine abuse during pregnancy. In particular, babies exposed to cocaine before birth sometimes have small heads—an abnormality that generally indicates a small brain—and, although they usually have normal intelligence, the development of their thinking skills and language is often delayed, and they can have behavioral problems.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>Exposure to cocaine before birth clearly interferes with some aspects of brain development. More specifically, it reduces the number and position of neurons (the cells that transmit information in the form of electrical impulses around the body) within the brain. All neurons develop from neural progenitor cells, and previous research suggests that cocaine exposure before birth inhibits the proliferation of these cells in the developing brain. It would be useful to understand exactly how cocaine affects neural progenitor cells, because it might then be possible to prevent the drug's adverse effects on brain development. In this study, therefore, the researchers investigate the molecular mechanism that underlies cocaine's effect on neural progenitor cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>When the researchers investigated the effects of cocaine on AF5 cells (rat neural progenitor cells that grow indefinitely in the laboratory), they found that concentrations of cocaine similar to those measured in fetal brains after maternal drug exposure inhibited the proliferation of AF5 cells by blocking the “G1-to-S transition.” This is a stage that cells have to pass through between each round of cell division (the production of two daughter cells from one parent cell). Next, the researchers showed that cocaine-treated AF5 cells made much less cyclin A2, a protein that controls the G1-to-S transition, than untreated cells. Cocaine also decreased cyclin A2 levels in neural progenitor cells freshly isolated from human fetal brains and in fetal rat brains exposed to the drug while in their mother's womb. Treatment of AF5 cells with a cyclin A2 expression vector (a piece of DNA that directs the production of cyclin A2) counteracted the down-regulation of cyclin A2 and restored AF5 proliferation in the presence of cocaine. Other experiments indicate that the reduction of cyclin A2 by cocaine in AF5 cells involves the accumulation of “reactive oxygen species,” by-products of the breakdown of cocaine by a protein that is a member of a family of proteins called cytochrome P450. Finally, treatment of pregnant rats with cimetidine (which inhibits the action of cytochrome P450) counteracted both the inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation and the cyclin A2 down-regulation that cocaine exposure induced in the brains of their unborn pups.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These findings show that the cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation involves, at least in part, interfering with the production (that is, causing down-regulation) of cyclin A2. They also show that this down-regulation is induced by the breakdown of cocaine by cytochrome P450, and that in both a rat cell line and in fetal rats, the cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine (a drug that is already used clinically for stomach problems) can block the adverse effects of cocaine on the proliferation of neural progenitor cells. These findings need to be confirmed in animals more closely related to people than rats, and the long-term effects of cimetidine need to be investigated, in particular its effects on cocaine toxicity. Nevertheless these results raise the possibility that giving cimetidine or other drugs with similar effects to pregnant women who are addicted to cocaine might prevent some of the harm that their drug habit does to their unborn children, although it is not clear whether there is a dosage of cimetidine that might be both safe and adequate for this purpose.</p>

A variety of disorders of central nervous system (CNS) development, e.g., intrauterine growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b002">2</xref>]<bold>,</bold> interference with neuronal migration and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b003">3</xref>], and neurobehavioral deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b005">5</xref>], have been associated with prenatal exposure to cocaine. Adverse effects of cocaine on brain development have also been demonstrated in nonhuman primates. Prenatal cocaine exposure results in neurobehavioral deficits in subhuman primate infants or adolescents, including deficits in attention and motor maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b006">6</xref>]. At the cellular level, cocaine exposure induces neocortical cytoarchitectural abnormalities including a decrease in the number of cortical neurons and abnormal positioning of cortical neurons in the primate embryonic cerebral wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b008">8</xref>]. Notably, these abnormalities are found only when cocaine is administered during the second trimester (E40–E102), the period when proliferation of neural progenitors is most active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b009">9</xref>]. The specific actions of cocaine in the second trimester and the decrease of neuron numbers in the cortex suggest that cocaine may affect important cellular functions of neural progenitor cells.</p>
      <p>In vitro, cocaine has been shown to influence several cell biological functions such as cell survival and mitogenesis independent of its action on monoaminergic systems. One in vitro study showed that a single 30-min exposure to 1 μM cocaine results in late-onset (&gt;72 h) cell death in differentiated human neuronal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b010">10</xref>]. On the other hand, accumulating evidence highlights an inhibitory effect of cocaine on neural progenitor cell proliferation. Cocaine (1–100 μM, 7 d) was shown in an in vitro study to inhibit the proliferation of human neural precursor cells without producing a cytotoxic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>]. Cocaine has also been shown to cause genetic toxicity and disturbances in chromosome segregation during meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b013">13</xref>]. These findings suggest that cocaine may influence cell cycle control. Because the proliferation of neural progenitors is an important factor that eventually contributes to determining numbers of neurons and brain cytoarchitecture, clarifying the action of cocaine on cell cycle control might provide an avenue for understanding the mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced retardation of brain development.</p>
      <p>The aim of the present study is to clarify the effect of cocaine on proliferation of neural progenitors and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Both human and animal studies have demonstrated that cocaine can cross the placental barrier and enter the fetal brain rapidly after maternal cocaine use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b015">15</xref>]. Plasma cocaine concentrations after intranasal application of 1.5 mg/kg cocaine in human volunteers were between 0.4 and 1.6 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b016">16</xref>], while plasma cocaine concentrations are often considerably higher in tolerant abusers, reaching ∼13 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b017">17</xref>]. A previous study found that concentrations of cocaine in maternal rat brain are higher (3- to 4-fold) than in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b015">15</xref>], and cocaine concentrations in fetal brain are 50%–90% of those found in the maternal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b015">15</xref>], indicating that the high range of cocaine concentrations in the fetal brain may reach ∼20–47 μM. Moreover, cocaine concentrations up to 100 μM and higher have been reported in postmortem brains of chronic human cocaine users after acute intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b018">18</xref>]. Based on these reports, we considered the cocaine dose range from 1 to 100 μM to be comparable to the range of exposure of the fetal brain to cocaine. Therefore, we employed cocaine in this concentration range to investigate its effects on neural progenitor cell proliferation.</p>

        <p>The AF5 neural progenitor cell line was maintained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b019">19</xref>]. The AF5 cell line is homogenous and over long-term culture maintains growth stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b019">19</xref>], differentiation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b020">20</xref>], and an intact p53 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b021">21</xref>]. Notably, the total length of the cell cycle of AF5 cells (24 h) is close to that in the rodent ventricular zone (VZ) (18 h at E15 or later) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b022">22</xref>]. 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well were plated in 96-well plates for cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays, and 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates for immunostaining and reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement 24 h prior to use. Primary human fetal CNS cells (ScienCell Research Laboratories) were from ∼20-wk human fetal cerebral cortexes, obtained in accordance with principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki (Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association) and were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using the recommended human cell media obtained from ScienCell Research Laboratories, except that human neural progenitor cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1, Invitrogen) supplemented with N2 supplement (R &amp; D Systems), 20 ng/ml EGF (R &amp; D Systems), 20 ng/ml bFGF (R &amp; D Systems), 5 μg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich). Purity of respective types of CNS cells was evaluated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against specific cell markers. For evaluation of neural progenitors, neurospheres were first dissociated into single cells using papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) for 10 min at 37 °C, and plated onto laminin/poly-L-ornithine-coated slides. Once attached, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and evaluated by immunocytochemistry. A2B5 progenitor cells differ from neural progenitor cells in that they are committed to a glial cell lineage, eventually differentiating to type-2 astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, whereas neural progenitor cells can become both neurons and glial cells. The human neurons used in this study were MAP-2 positive, and immunoreactive for glutamate (44% ± 3%) and GABA (69% ± 5%), but not for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Cell Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Assays</title>
        <p>AF5 cells were treated with cocaine at various concentrations, and cell proliferation was measured using CyQUANT cell proliferation assay (Invitrogen). Cocaine-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from the cytosol into the medium after exposure of AF5 cells to various concentrations of cocaine for 24 h, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). For single-stranded DNA immunostaining, cells were fixed with methanol/PBS (6:1) for 24 h at −20 °C followed by incubation in formamide at 70 °C for 5 min. Fixed cells were immunostained with mouse anti-single-stranded DNA monoclonal antibodies (1:10, Chemicon) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch).

        <p>AF5 cultures were treated with 20 μM 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (BD Biosciences) in the presence/absence of cocaine for 24 h, fixed with 95% ethanol, and permeabilized with 2 N HCl. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were double-labeled with monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU (1:100, BD Biosciences) and polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (1:200, Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, secondary antibodies Alexa Flour 594 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Flour 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Invitrogen) were applied, and nuclei were labeled with DAPI. Data were obtained by dividing numbers of nuclei positive for BrdU or phospho-histone H3 by total numbers of nuclei.</p>

        <p>Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) received cocaine at early (E13 and E14), middle (E15 and E16), or late periods (E17 and E18) of neocortical neurogenesis. Rats received 20 mg/kg cocaine (intraperitoneally [IP]) twice at an interval of 12 h followed by 50 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich), IP, 24 h after the last injection of cocaine. Rats were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation 2 h after BrdU. Control animals received physiological saline.

        <title>Quantitation of Cocaine in the Fetal Rat Brain</title>
        <p>For measurements of cocaine concentrations, prefrontal cortex and peri-ventricular region were dissected from fetal rat brains at the early period of neurogenesis (E15). Tissues from all fetuses of each pregnant dam were pooled to become one individual sample. Detection and quantification of cocaine in fetal rat brain was accomplished utilizing a modification of a previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b025">25</xref>]. The method employed ultrasonic homogenization of brain tissue in pH 4.0 sodium acetate buffer followed by solid phase extraction. Extracts were derivatized with <italic>N</italic>,<italic>O</italic>-<italic>bis</italic>-[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). Cocaine was separated by capillary gas chromatography and simultaneously quantified by electron impact mass spectrometry in selected ion mode. The calibration curve for cocaine was linear to 15,000 ng/g of brain, and the limit of quantification was 50 ng/g. This method provided sufficient analytical sensitivity to allow quantification of cocaine in small amounts of tissue.</p>

        <p>Log-phase cultures of AF5 cells were treated with varying concentrations of cocaine (1–100 μM) for 24 h. The number of cells in each condition was then measured and compared to the number at the initiation of the treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, the number of AF5 cells in untreated cultures doubled in 24 h, while numbers of cells in cocaine-treated cultures were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner as compared to controls. When exposure of AF5 cells to 100 μM cocaine was extended to 6 d, the inhibitory effect was even more pronounced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Because cocaine substantially inhibited proliferation of AF5 cells after only 24 h exposure, we employed this exposure duration for subsequent experiments.</p>
        <p>The effect of cocaine was not due to an increase in cell death, as we did not observe a change in either extracellular LDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) or numbers of apoptotic nuclei immunoreactive for single-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

To further clarify the transition suppression, cell populations going through S phase were monitored by BrdU incorporation over 24 h.

        <p>To characterize the time course of cocaine-induced down-regulation of cyclin A, we treated AF5 cells with 100 μM cocaine for 6 d and found that the cyclin A protein level, as measured by Western blotting, had started to decrease by day 1, continued to decline at day 3, and finally resulted in an undetectable amount of cyclin A protein by day 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). These data show that cocaine-induced inhibition of AF5 cell proliferation is correlated with down-regulation of cyclin A.</p>

        <title>Cocaine Down-Regulates Cyclin A2 Expression and Inhibits Cell Cycle Progression in Fetal Rat Brains</title>
        <p>We next examined cyclin A expression in fetal rat brains exposed to cocaine in utero. Neocortical neurogenesis occurs within two proliferative strata of the embryonic cerebral wall, which is adjacent to the ventricle. Neocortical neurogenesis starts at E12 and ends at E19 in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b029">29</xref>]. During this process, the VZ appears first and is followed by the SVZ. To investigate the time-frame within which neocortical development is susceptible to prenatal cocaine exposure, we examined three different time periods: the early neurogenesis period from E13 to E15, the middle period of neurogenesis from E15 to E17, and the late neurogenesis period from E17 to E19. Pregnant animals received cocaine according to the injection schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, and the frontal cortex of developing fetuses was dissected as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>B.</p>
        <p>To examine cocaine concentrations in the fetal neocortex under our injection schedule and for comparison to our in vitro studies, tissue concentrations of cocaine were analyzed at the early period of neurogenesis after the second cocaine administration. Cocaine concentrations in fetal neocortex reached at least 30 μM (9,812 ng/g) 0.5 h after injection, dropped to ∼2 μM (median value of 594 ng/g) at 1 h, and gradually declined to ∼0.2 μM (median value of 63 ng/g) at 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, the injection schedule used produced exposure of fetal brains to maximum concentrations of cocaine within the range of doses that we found to inhibit proliferation of progenitor cells in vitro.</p>
        <p>Down-regulation of <italic>cyclin A2</italic> mRNA was seen in prefrontal cortex of the developing fetuses when cocaine was injected at either early or middle periods of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg004">S4</xref>A). C<italic>yclin A2</italic> mRNA was not, however, changed by injections during the late period of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg004">S4</xref>A). Similarly, cyclin A protein was also significantly decreased by cocaine in both early and middle neurogenesis periods, but not during the late period of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figures 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg004">S4</xref>B). This result suggests that cocaine down-regulates cyclin A expression only during earlier periods of neocortical neurogenesis that involve active proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the VZ.</p>
        <p>Since cocaine causes down-regulation of cyclin A in fetal brains, we also examined cell cycle progression of neural progenitors in the VZ and SVZ in fetal brains in utero exposed to cocaine. Pulse labeling with BrdU was used to quantify cortical progenitor cells that had entered S phase during a period of 2 h, whereas Ki67 immunocytochemistry was used to monitor the total fraction of progenitors that are in any phase of the cell cycle except for G<sub>0</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b030">30</xref>]. Cocaine decreased the number of BrdU-labeled progenitor cells in the VZ during both the early and middle neurogenesis periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figures 4</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">4</xref>G, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg004">S4</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg005">S5</xref>), suggesting that cocaine inhibits the proliferation of progenitor cells in the VZ.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the findings in the VZ, BrdU positive progenitor cells in the SVZ were not changed by cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figures 4</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">4</xref>H, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg004">S4</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg005">S5</xref>). Also, since cortical germinal zones in the late period of neurogenesis comprise SVZ only, cocaine did not change BrdU labeling during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figures 4</xref>H, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg004">S4</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg005">S5</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that cocaine promotes cyclin A down-regulation and cell proliferation inhibition both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

        <p>An increase in ATF4 protein occurred as early as 1 h after 100 μM cocaine exposure, and reached the maximal level at 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Cocaine at concentrations higher than 1 μM resulted in dose-dependent induction of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).

Indeed, we found that 10 μM cocaine significantly increased the phosphorylated form of eIF2α 0.5 h after exposure to cocaine, preceding induction of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Role of N-Oxidative Metabolism of Cocaine in Generation of ROS, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Induction of ATF4, Inhibition of Cyclin A, and Cell Proliferation</title>
        <p>The eIF2α-ATF4 pathway is activated by PERK, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b036">36</xref>]. The ER stress pathway has been shown to be activated by a variety of chemicals or pathological stress including oxidative ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b035">35</xref>]. Notably it has been demonstrated that the cytochrome P450 dependent N-oxidative pathway is responsible for generation of ROS and glutathione (GSH) depletion during cocaine biotransformation in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b037">37</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that ROS generation caused by the N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine may trigger activation of the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, we first examined whether cocaine induces ROS production in progenitor cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, 10 μM cocaine caused a significant increase in ROS 30 min after treatment. Cocaine at 100 μM caused ROS generation even earlier, with a significant increase 15 min after the exposure.</p>
        <p>Because the rise of cocaine concentrations over 10 μM lasts for less than 1 h in fetal brains after cocaine injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), AF5 cells were next treated with 30 μM cocaine for 30 min followed by incubation in cocaine-free medium for 2.5 h to examine ATF4 protein levels. We found that ATF4 was significantly up-regulated by this transient 30 min exposure to cocaine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, exposure to cocaine for a period of only 30 min can generate ROS sufficient to initiate ER stress, and result in up-regulation of ATF4 2.5 h later.</p>
        <p>Pretreatment with the cytochrome P450 inhibitors SKF-525A or cimetidine, drugs that have been shown to potently block N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine, completely blocked cocaine-induced ROS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>E), confirming that N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine is involved in ROS formation in AF5 cells. Further, ROS generation appears to be the source of cocaine-induced ER stress, as both SKF-525A and cimetidine also completely inhibited cocaine-induced ATF4 up-regulation and cyclin A down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">6</xref>G).</p>
        <p>Finally, we tested effects of SKF-525A and cimetidine on the inhibition of cell proliferation by cocaine. Both drugs significantly diminished cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition (100 μM for 24 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>H). On the other hand, the lipophilic free radical scavengers α-tocopherol and BHA and the iron chelator DFO (each 50 μM) did not prevent cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition (unpublished data). These data indicate that cytochrome P450-dependent ROS formation occurring during cocaine metabolism is responsible for both cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition and cyclin A down-regulation.</p>

        <title>Cimetidine Reverses Effects of Cocaine In Utero in a Rat Model</title>
        <p>To determine whether P450 inhibitors can block cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition in neural progenitor cells in the developing neocortex, pregnant rats at the early period of neurogenesis (E13–E15) were pretreated with 100 mg/kg cimetidine IP 1 h before each cocaine administration. Cimetidine is known to cross the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b040">40</xref>]. Cimetidine itself did not affect neural progenitor cell proliferation, survival, density, or fetal mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">Figures 7</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">7</xref>B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">S8</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">S8</xref>E). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">Figures 7</xref>A and S7A, pretreatment of pregnant rats with cimetidine resulted in recovery of the cocaine-induced decease in BrdU-positive progenitor cells in the VZ.

        <p>To determine whether the protection afforded by cimetidine was due to the recovery of cocaine-induced down-regulation of cyclin A and mediation by ER stress, the effects of cimetidine on expression of ATF4 and cyclin A were also measured in prefrontal cortex of cocaine-treated fetuses. Pretreatment of pregnant rats with cimetidine significantly inhibited the cocaine-induced up-regulation of ATF4 and the down-regulation of cyclin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">Figures 7</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">7</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>D). These results suggest that blockade of cocaine N-oxidative metabolism by the P450 inhibitor cimetidine reverses cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition of neural progenitor cells in the VZ through normalizing cocaine-induced oxidative ER stress and consequent cyclin A down-regulation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we found that (1) cocaine causes proliferation inhibition and cyclin A down-regulation in neural progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo; (2) restoring cyclin A reverses proliferation inhibition induced by cocaine; and (3) ROS-induced ER stress, activating the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, is involved in cyclin A down-regulation induced by cocaine. Thus, this study identifies ES stress-induced cyclin A down-regulation as an important molecular event involved in cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition in neural progenitor cells.

        <title>The Role of Cyclin A in Neural Progenitor Cells Exposed to Cocaine</title>
        <p>Using the AF5 neural progenitor cell line, we determined that cocaine treatment for 24 h causes proliferation inhibition at concentrations higher than 1 μM. Similar results were reported by Hu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>] showing that cocaine ranging 1–100 μM (7 d) suppresses growth of human neural precursor cells, as measured by thymidine incorporation. Nevertheless, this group also did not detect proliferation inhibition by 1 μM cocaine for 24 h, although a significant effect was produced by treatment with 1 μM cocaine for 5 d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>]. The findings of Hu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>] are therefore consistent with our data.</p>
        <p>Poon et al. <bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b010">10</xref>]</bold> found that 1 μM cocaine treatment for 30 min induced late-onset cell death (72 h later) in differentiated human neuronal progenitor cells. We did not observe cell death in cocaine (1–100 μM)-treated AF5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">1</xref>C) or in primary human fetal neural and A2B5+ progenitor cells (unpublished data) 24 h after treatment, although we did not examine cell death at later time points such as 72 h. In agreement with our findings, cocaine treatment (1 pM–100 μM) for 7 d did not induce cell death in undifferentiated human neural precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>]. Under certain conditions, cocaine can selectively induce cell death in neurons without affecting viability of other types of CNS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b041">41</xref>]. The differentiated neuronal progenitor cells employed by Poon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b010">10</xref>] may therefore be relatively more sensitive to an effect of cocaine in promoting cell death as compared to undifferentiated neural progenitor cells.</p>
        <p>Although cocaine has been shown to inhibit DNA synthesis as measured by thymidine incorporation in human neural precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>], the mode of action of cocaine on cell cycle progression has not previously been determined. We found that cocaine causes cell proliferation inhibition by interfering with the G1-to-S transition. Although one report suggested a disturbance in chromosome segregation induced by 2,500 μM cocaine treatment (14 or 24 h) of mouse oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b013">13</xref>], our flow cytometric and immunocytochemical analyses show that cocaine (10–100 μM) does not have any effect on the mitotic phase at least in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g001">1</xref>E). A cDNA microarray identified <italic>cyclin A2</italic> as a candidate molecule related to cocaine-mediated G1/S phase arrest. Cocaine causes specific down-regulation of cyclin A2 in AF5 cells, primary neural and A2B5+ progenitor cells, and fetal brains exposed to cocaine in utero. Further, compensating for cocaine-induced cyclin A down-regulation by gene transfer counteracted the growth-suppressing action of cocaine in AF5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Reversal of cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition by cyclin A transfection is not, in itself, proof that the effect of cocaine on neural progenitor cell proliferation is caused by down-regulation of cyclin A. Nevertheless, among known modulators of the G1-to-S transition, microarray analysis identified only <italic>cyclin A2</italic> as being down-regulated by cocaine. The cyclin A transfection results are consistent with the hypothesis that cocaine decreases proliferation via down-regulation of cyclin A. Moreover, the fact that the ROS-induced ER stress consequently promoted transcriptional down-regulation of cyclin A is further evidence that reductions in cyclin A signaling are responsible for decreased proliferation. These findings, taken together, suggest that cyclin A down-regulation constitutes at least one molecular mechanism by which cocaine causes dysfunction of neural progenitor cells.</p>
        <p>Cocaine-induced <italic>cyclin A2</italic> down-regulation was observed in human neural progenitor and A2B5+ progenitor cells, but not in human neurons and microglia. In contrast to progenitor cells, the <italic>cyclin A2</italic> transcript was increased by cocaine in human astrocytes. Although we do not know the mechanism underlying the proliferative effect of cocaine on astrocytes, it is worth noting that cellular stress inhibits proliferation in CNS progenitors, whereas it activates proliferation in astrocytes, leading to gliosis in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b042">42</xref>]. Cocaine thus has at least two pharmacological actions on cellular proliferation in a cell type-specific manner. Moreover, in utero cocaine exposure down-regulated cyclin A expression in progenitor cells in the VZ, but not in the progenitor cells in the SVZ. Although the reason for this specific mode of action is unknown, variations in expression and metabolic capacities of cytochrome P450s, plasma membrane permeability of cocaine, and variations in cellular stress response mechanisms could be involved. Future studies exploring the activity of cytochrome p450s and oxidative stress in different types of CNS cells will address this issue.</p>

        <title>Oxidative ER Stress in Cocaine-Induced Cyclin A Down-Regulation</title>
        <p>Screening of molecules that can regulate the promoter activity of <italic>cyclin A2</italic> demonstrated that ATF4 is specifically up-regulated by cocaine exposure; this effect of cocaine occurs 3 h prior to <italic>cyclin A2</italic> down-regulation. Upon ER stress such as ER oxidation, the ER sensor protein PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, subsequently promoting translational activation of ATF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b036">36</xref>]. ATF4 promotes not only up-regulation of genes involved in redox control (e.g., glutathione biosynthesis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b035">35</xref>], but also promotes down-regulation of cyclin A during G1-to-S progression, which can lead to cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b043">43</xref>]. Thus, ER oxidation is capable of causing cell cycle arrest via the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway.</p>
        <p>In addition to promoting dopamine auto-oxidation, cocaine can itself get through the cell membrane in its nonprotonated form, where it produces ROS via N-oxidative metabolism catalyzed by cytochrome P450 at the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b037">37</xref>]. Cocaine is first <italic>N</italic>-demethylated to norcocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b045">45</xref>], followed by oxidation to <italic>N</italic>-hydroxynorcocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b047">47</xref>] by cytochrome P450 and flavin-containing monooxygenases. <italic>N</italic>-hydroxynorcocaine is further converted to norcocaine nitroxide by one-electron oxidation, also through cytochrome P450 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b048">48</xref>]. Norcocaine nitroxide can be rapidly reduced to <italic>N</italic>-hydroxynorcocaine again by flavoproteins such as cytochrome P450 reductase and FAD-monooxygenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b048">48</xref>]. Redox cycling between norcocaine nitroxide and <italic>N</italic>-hydroxynorcocaine is responsible for generation of ROS such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b044">44</xref>]. In addition, depletion of NADPH, an essential cofactor for maintenance of reduced glutathione, during the futile redox cycling of <italic>N</italic>-hydroxynorcocaine/norcocaine nitroxide is able to disrupt the homeostatic effect of cellular glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b048">48</xref>], possibly also contributing to cellular oxidative stress.</p>
        <p>Indeed, we found that cocaine induces endogenous ROS accumulation as early as 15 min after treatment of AF5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Further, the P450 inhibitors SKF-525A and cimetidine, which have been shown to inhibit N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine, blocked cocaine-induced endogenous ROS generation, translational activation of ATF4, down-regulation of cyclin A, and proliferation inhibition in AF5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">6</xref>H). In contrast, lipophilic free radical scavengers and the iron chelator DFO did not block cocaine-induced inhibition of proliferation, suggesting that lipid peroxidation and iron-mediated ROS production (Fenton reaction) in mitochondria are not primarily involved in cocaine-induced ROS production in AF5 cells. We therefore conclude that cocaine biotransformation by microsomal cytochrome P450 is the source of cocaine-induced ROS generation, which promotes cell cycle arrest via ER stress-induced cyclin A down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g006">6</xref>H).</p>
        <p>In cultured human neural precursor cells, cocaine-induced (1–100 μM for 7 d) cell proliferation inhibition has been suggested to be related to increased expression of p21, a major transcriptional target of p53, as well as down-regulation of nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential DNA replication factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b011">11</xref>]. Activation of the p53-p21 pathway has been implicated in hyperoxia-induced inhibition of G1/S progression, through suppression of CDK activity and subsequent repression of <italic>cyclin A2</italic> transcription and inactivation of PCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b049">49</xref>]. Increased expression of p21 was not observed 24 h after exposure to cocaine in our study; however, we did detect an increase of p21 48 h after exposure to cocaine (unpublished data). These data suggest that the p53-p21 pathway may be involved in longer-term effects of cocaine, but not in the short-term action of cocaine that promotes down-regulation of cyclin A2 within 24 h.</p>
        <p>Cocaine has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis in rat fibroblasts, associated with cocaine-induced inhibition of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b028">28</xref>]. One of the cellular adaptive responses to oxidative ER stress is inhibition of translation, which may explain the inhibition of protein synthesis observed in cocaine-treated fibroblasts. Also, cocaine acts as a local anesthetic by inhibiting sodium influx into cells. An in vitro study, however, has shown that cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition in lymphocytes was not related to sodium channel blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b050">50</xref>].</p>

In addition, disruption of neural progenitor proliferation can result in microcephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b053">53</xref>], which has been reported in infants born to cocaine-abusing mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b003">3</xref>]. We demonstrated here that oxidative ER stress-mediated down-regulation of cyclin A contributes to cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the developing neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Because cell cycle duration is regulated mainly via G1 phase and/or the G1-to-S transition during embryonic neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b055">55</xref>], cocaine-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest mediated by down-regulation of cyclin A may have a substantial impact on proliferation of progenitor cells, as well as on ensuing migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
        <p>Cocaine inhibited proliferation of AF5 cells in concentrations as low as 10 μM for 24 h of exposure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, the concentrations of cocaine in the developing neocortex following the second IP administrations of 20 mg/kg cocaine peaked higher than 30 μM within 30 min. A short duration of exposure of the fetal brain to cocaine may in fact be deleterious since, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg006">Figure S6</xref>, exposure of AF5 cells to 30 μM cocaine for 30 min significantly up-regulated the expression of ATF4 at 3 h. Thus, exposure to 30 μM cocaine for 30 min is sufficient to increase endogenous ROS to a degree that activates the ATF4 signaling pathway. Therefore, it is conceivable that exposure to cocaine for fairly short durations could initiate the molecular mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation.</p>
        <p>Maternal cocaine exposure has been associated with uterine vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b056">56</xref>], which could cause low oxygenation of the developing fetal brain. A number of studies indicate, however, that cocaine-induced vasoconstriction is unlikely to mediate impairments in brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b059">59</xref>] as measured by brain structure and DNA synthesis. Also, Lidow and Rakic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b060">60</xref>] have shown that neurotransmitter receptors expressed in neural progenitor cells, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, and adrenergic receptors, are related to cell proliferation stimulation or inhibition in the developing primate occipital lobe. Therefore, it is possible that cocaine-induced accumulation of monoamine neurotransmitters and activation of corresponding receptors also contribute to the inhibition of cell cycle progression by cocaine, especially in vivo. Moreover, in addition to ROS induced by N-oxidation of cocaine, auto-oxidation of monoamines could contribute to ATF4-mediated cyclin A down-regulation in fetal brains. Nevertheless, our data demonstrated that cytochrome P450-dependent N-oxidation of cocaine promotes cyclin A2 down-regulation by causing ER stress, which constitutes at least one mechanism underlying cocaine-induced inhibition of ventricular progenitor cell proliferation in the developing neocortex.</p>

        <title>Possible Clinical Use of Cimetidine</title>
        <p>We have shown that pretreatment with the P450 inhibitor cimetidine effectively abolished both the cocaine-induced inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the VZ of the developing rat brain, and cyclin A down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">Figures 7</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">7</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>D). This effect of cimetidine appeared to be mediated by prevention of N-oxidative metabolism of cocaine and consequent ER stress, as cimetidine also prevented the cocaine-induced increase in ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">Figures 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>C). These effects of cimetidine in the developing rat brain were consistent with the efficacy of cimetidine in blocking effects of cocaine on the AF5 cell line in vitro.</p>
        <p>Cimetidine belongs to a class of drugs called histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and is often prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux diseases and peptic ulcer diseases. Cimetidine crosses the placenta by passive diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b038">38</xref>] and has been allocated to pregnancy category B by the FDA, which means that cimetidine is not expected to be harmful to the fetus. There are conflicting reports on anti-androgenic effects of cimetidine in animals exposed in utero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b064">64</xref>]; however, no anti-androgenic effects of cimetidine have so far been reported in human pregnancy.</p>
        <p>We demonstrated that giving cimetidine (100 mg/kg IP twice at an interval of 12 h) to pregnant rats at an early period of neurogenesis did not affect proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">Figures 7</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050117-g007">7</xref>B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg007">S7</xref>B), survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">Figure S8</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">S8</xref>B), or density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">Figure S8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">S8</xref>D) of neural progenitor cells in the VZ or SVZ. We also did not observe an increase in perinatal mortality in cimetidine-treated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050117-sg008">Figure S8</xref>E). The expression of histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptors in the cerebral cortex is very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b066">66</xref>]; therefore, H<sub>2</sub> receptor activity is not likely to be involved in the ability of cimetidine to decrease cocaine-induced changes in the fetal brain.</p>
        <p>The question naturally arises as to whether cimetidine or a similar drug could be employed to prevent the adverse effects of cocaine on brain development. Presumably, the manner in which this would be accomplished would be that women of child-bearing age with a history of cocaine abuse, and who are at risk for subsequent cocaine abuse, would be asked to take cimetidine as a prophylactic measure. Several issues would have to be addressed before this could be done. Most importantly, the possibility that cimetidine increases the systemic toxicity of cocaine, perhaps by interfering with cocaine metabolism and lengthening the half-life of cocaine, would have to be considered. Another question to be addressed is the half-life of the preventive drug used that would be necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of patient compliance; it is possible that a drug with a very long half-life, e.g., a depot preparation, would be needed. Also, although the mechanism that is described here appears to at least contribute to the developmental toxicity of cocaine, it is not necessarily the entire cause of cocaine's adverse effects on development. Thus, the long-term efficacy of cimetidine (or alternative drugs) on brain development and function, and efficacy in a second larger species, will also need to be examined.</p>

        <title>Limitations of This Study</title>
        <p>During neocorticogenesis, the two germinal compartments VZ and SVZ are composed of heterogeneous populations of neural progenitor cells. It is difficult to isolate, define, and examine specific sub-types of neural progenitor cells derived from primary fetal cortex. It is also problematic to examine regional cellular and molecular parameters in vivo in tissue sections derived from embryonic rat brains at different ages following intrauterine cocaine administration. The AF5 neural progenitor cell line used in this study may not have properties identical to those of cortical VZ progenitors; however, the AF5 cell line was able to reveal the molecular mechanisms (e.g., free radical-induced ER stress), which are involved in cocaine-induced proliferation inhibition of neural progenitor cells. The AF5 cell model not only allowed us to identify these molecular mechanisms, but also was remarkably predictive of the in vivo findings. Nevertheless, the expression and metabolic capacities of cytochrome P450 in neural progenitor cells of developing rodent and human brains are not identical, which to same extent limits extrapolation of our findings to cocaine-exposed human fetal brains.</p>
        <p>A second issue involves the dose of cimetidine that is required to prevent the effects of cocaine. The dose of cimetidine used to block the histamine H2 receptor in rodents is ∼2.5–10 mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b067">67</xref>]; however, doses of cimetidine up to 100 mg/kg are used to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b069">69</xref>]. We therefore used 100 mg/kg cimetidine for the present study. On a mg/kg basis, this dose is about ten times higher than the human therapeutic dose. Thus, it is not clear whether cimetidine, or any similar drug, would be effective in preventing the adverse effects of cocaine on neural progenitor cells in human cocaine abuse. It will therefore be essential to determine whether clinically relevant doses of cimetidine have the capacity to inhibit the adverse effects of exposure of the human fetus to cocaine, as well as whether there are other P450 inhibitors that are more effective.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which in utero cocaine exposure causes proliferation inhibition of neural progenitor cells is important for developing prevention and therapeutic strategies against long-lasting neurological and behavioral dysfunction caused by exposure of the developing fetus to cocaine. Future research might be focused on exploring the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in cellular functions such as differentiation and migration changed by cocaine in neural progenitor cells, determining the expression and metabolic capacity of cytochrome P450s in various subtypes of cortical and subcortical progenitor cells, and investigating whether oxidative ER stress is involved in other disorders that have been shown to be related to P450-dependent oxidative metabolism of cocaine, such as immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b072">72</xref>], hepatocyte injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b074">74</xref>], and cardiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050117-b075">75</xref>].</p>
