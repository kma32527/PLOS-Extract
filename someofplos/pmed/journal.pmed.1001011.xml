      <title/>
      <p>Among the many challenges facing institutional review boards (IRBs) is to predict
                whether the activities and interventions proposed in a clinical trial protocol are
                likely to yield net harm or net benefit for trial participants. IRBs take these
                questions very seriously, and never more so than in the review of first-in-human
                (FIH) trials, where interpreting findings about risks to humans from animal data
                requires a leap of faith, regardless of the quality of the available data.</p>
      <p>In their paper published this week in <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001011-Kimmelman1">[1]</xref>,
                “Predicting harms and benefits in translational trials: Ethics, evidence, and
                uncertainty,” Jonathan Kimmelman and Alex London argue that decision-makers
                (which, from the context of their paper, I assume to mean IRB members) pay
                insufficient attention to threats to validity in preclinical studies and consult too
                narrow a set of evidence, thereby unnecessarily limiting predictions about risks and
                potential benefits for humans that they might otherwise be able to make. They
                advocate greater attention to the quality of preclinical evidence and to research on
                related agents. These strategies are meant to reduce what they call the
                “misestimation” of risks or anticipated benefits, which they argue
                “threatens the integrity of the scientific enterprise, because it frustrates
                prudent allocation of research resources”<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001011-Kimmelman1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Kimmelman and London's proposal is likely to stimulate a great deal of
                constructive debate among clinical trialists, regulators, and other members of the
                research ethics community. In my brief comments here, I will attempt to open this
                debate by identifying a key aspect of their proposal that is likely to generate
                particular interest and perhaps even some controversy—that is, their framing
                of the problem in terms of how effectively decision-makers utilize evidence from
                preclinical or animal studies. Although IRB members often do not have deep grounding
                in the subtleties of research design and inferential statistics, it would be wrong
                to suggest that “misestimation” of risk and potential benefit arises
                solely from errors by IRB members (or other decision-makers).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Misestimates of Risk</title>
      <p>There is no doubt that IRB members may “misestimate” risk and benefit, in
                the sense that they may draw erroneous conclusions about the transferability of
                findings from animal studies to human studies. But it is equally likely that it may
                often be impossible (or infeasible) to determine when (if ever) the inferences
                arising from animal studies are truly valid, in the multiple senses suggested.
                Internal and construct validity, for example, both rely to some degree on the
                accuracy of the underlying theory, i.e., whether it properly accounts for the
                relevant mechanisms of action. To understand the dilemma, one need only consider the
                large number of drugs that are approved for use by regulatory authorities on the
                basis of some demonstration of efficacy and safety, but whose mechanisms of actions
                are still unknown or have been poorly understood for many years after approval
                (e.g., acetominophen, GABA). This issue becomes particularly important in light of
                Kimmelman and London's proposal to systematize the assessment of preclinical
                studies from reference classes of compounds as part of the routine due diligence of
                assessing risk and potential benefit in first in human trials.</p>
      <p>The most pressing problem is one of completeness, a specific dimension of construct
                validity: do the theory and data account for all the relevant elements or mechanisms
                that might contribute to benefit or harm in humans? This is the “black
                swan” or “unknown unknowns” problem in FIH trials: What molecular
                landmines lie beyond our current data or imagination?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3">
      <title>The Black Swan</title>
      <p>The widely reported TGN1412 trials in the UK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001011-Suntharalingam1">[2]</xref> may provide an
                instructive test case for Kimmelman and London's proposal. Six healthy
                volunteers were given the test agent, TGN1412 (an immune modulator), which triggered
                a cytokine storm and subsequent multiple organ failure, even at a fraction of the
                dose found to be safe in macaque monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001011-Suntharalingam1">[2]</xref>. Kimmelman and
                London's proposal could have been useful, in principle, in the TGN1412 trial in
                that it would have required reviewers to question whether the animal models truly
                are sufficiently similar to the relevant human systems to permit the right kind of
                conclusions about safety and potential benefits in humans. One theory about the
                TGN1412 trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001011-Fleming1">[3]</xref> is that the catastrophic effects were mediated by memory B
                cells, which may have been absent or under-developed in the laboratory animals. The
                animal data, therefore, would not have been complete in that critical sense. Whether
                or not this specific theory is correct, it serves well to illustrate that this is
                not an insight that arises from the animal data themselves. It is a deeper
                question—precisely the kind that Kimmelman and London are encouraging IRB
                members to ask, but one for which there may be no obvious trigger. The central
                shortcoming in construct validity is likely to remain a “black swan”
                until scrutiny or experience reveals it.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4">
      <title>A Valuable Proposal</title>
      <p>Kimmelman and London's proposal is valuable precisely because it encourages IRB
                members, and other reviewers, to engage with less-familiar challenges and guard
                against complacency in reviewing risk and benefit data from preclinical studies. But
                its true potential value likely lies in the extent to which it can forge agreement
                throughout the research enterprise on the need for more creative approaches to
                presenting and contextualizing preclinical evidence, and on broadening the base of
                responsibility for these difficult judgments.</p>
