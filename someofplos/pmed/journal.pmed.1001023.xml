          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ageing is associated with increased risk of poor health and functional
                        decline. Uncertainties about the health-related benefits of nutrition and
                        physical activity for older people have precluded their widespread
                        implementation. We investigated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
                        a national nutritional supplementation program and/or a physical activity
                        intervention among older people in Chile.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>We conducted a cluster randomized factorial trial among low to middle
                        socioeconomic status adults aged 65–67.9 years living in Santiago,
                        Chile. We randomized 28 clusters (health centers) into the study and
                        recruited 2,799 individuals in 2005 (∼100 per cluster). The
                        interventions were a daily micronutrient-rich nutritional supplement, or two
                        1-hour physical activity classes per week, or both interventions, or
                        neither, for 24 months. The primary outcomes, assessed blind to allocation,
                        were incidence of pneumonia over 24 months, and physical function assessed
                        by walking capacity 24 months after enrolment. Adherence was good for the
                        nutritional supplement (∼75%), and moderate for the physical
                        activity intervention (∼43%). Over 24 months the incidence rate
                        of pneumonia did not differ between intervention and control clusters (32.5
                        versus 32.6 per 1,000 person years respectively; risk
                        ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence interval
                        0.61–1.63; <italic>p</italic> = 0.99). In
                        intention-to-treat analysis, after 24 months there was a significant
                        difference in walking capacity between the intervention and control clusters
                        (mean difference 33.8 meters; 95% confidence interval
                        13.9–53.8; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The
                        overall cost of the physical activity intervention over 24 months was
                        US$164/participant; equivalent to US$4.84/extra meter walked.
                        The number of falls and fractures was balanced across physical activity
                        intervention arms and no serious adverse events were reported for either
                        intervention.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Chile's nutritional supplementation program for older people is not
                        effective in reducing the incidence of pneumonia. This trial suggests that
                        the provision of locally accessible physical activity classes in a
                        transition economy population can be a cost-effective means of enhancing
                        physical function in later life.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="s5a1">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>By 2050, about a quarter of the world's population will be aged 60 years
                        or over, with Asia and Latin America experiencing the most dramatic
                        increases in the proportion of older people. For example, in Chile, which
                        has recently undergone rapid demographic transition, the proportion of the
                        population aged 60 years or over has increased from 8% to 12%
                        over the past 25 years.</p>
          <p>Current global policy initiatives that promote healthy ageing include an
                        emphasis on adequate nutrient intakes, as longitudinal studies (conducted in
                        high-income countries) suggest that achieving nutritional sufficiency and
                        maintaining moderate levels of physical activity both decrease risk of
                        mortality by preserving immune function and lean body mass and so reduce the
                        numerous risk factors for disability and chronic disease in later life. Such
                        interventions may also decrease the risk of infection, particularly
                        pneumonia, a common cause of death in older people. However, older people in
                        low- and middle-income countries frequently have diets with insufficient
                        calories (energy) and/or micronutrients.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s5a2">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>Currently, there is no high-quality evidence to support the benefits of
                        improved nutrition and increased physical activity levels from low-income or
                        transition economies, where the ongoing demographic trends suggest that the
                        needs are greatest. National policies aimed at preserving health and
                        function in older people with interventions such as cash-transfers and
                        provision of “food baskets” are often used in Latin American
                        countries, such as Chile, but are rarely formally evaluated. Therefore, the
                        purpose of this study (the Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of a Nutritional
                        supplement and EXercise program for older people—CENEX) was to
                        evaluate Chile's national nutritional supplementation program and/or
                        physical exercise, to investigate whether this program prevented pneumonia
                        and physical functional decline in older people in Santiago, and also to
                        investigate whether these interventions were cost-effective.</p>

          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers randomly allocated 28 participating health centers in
                        Santiago, Chile, into one of four arms: (1) nutritional supplementation; (2)
                        nutritional supplementation+physical activity; (3) physical activity
                        alone; (4) control. From May to December 2005, 2,799 eligible adults aged
                        65–67.9 years and living in low to middle socioeconomic circumstances,
                        who attended each health center, were recruited into the study and received
                        the allocated intervention—daily micronutrient-rich nutritional
                        supplement, or two 1-hour physical activity classes per week, or both
                        interventions or neither—for 24 months. The researchers did not know
                        the allocation arm of each patient and over the course of the study assessed
                        the incidence of pneumonia (viral and bacterial as based on diagnosis at the
                        health center or hospital) and physical function was measured by walking
                        capacity (meters walked in 6 minutes). The researchers used administrative
                        records and interviews with staff and patients to estimate the
                        cost-effectiveness of the interventions.</p>
          <p>Participant retention in the study was 84%, although only
                        three-quarters of patients receiving the nutritional intervention and less
                        than half (43%) of patients in the physical activity intervention arm
                        adhered to their respective programs. Over 24 months, the incidence rate of
                        pneumonia did not differ between intervention and control groups (32.5
                        versus 32.6 per 1,000 person years, respectively), but at the end of the
                        study period, there was a significant difference in walking capacity between
                        the intervention and control clusters (mean difference 33.8 meters). The
                        number of falls and fractures in the study arms were similar. The overall
                        costs over 24 months were US$91.00 and US$163.70 per
                        participant for the nutritional supplement and physical activity
                        interventions, respectively. The cost of the physical activity intervention
                        per extra meter walked at 24 months was US$4.84.</p>

          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>The results of this trial suggest that there is little evidence to support
                        the effectiveness of Chile's national nutritional supplementation
                        program in reducing the incidence of pneumonia for 65.0–67.9 year
                        olds. Therefore, given Chile's high burden of infectious and
                        nutrition-related chronic diseases and the associated high health costs,
                        this program should not be considered as a priority preventive public health
                        intervention. However, the provision of locally available physical activity
                        classes to older people could be of clinical benefit, especially in urban
                        settings such as Santiago, although future challenges include increasing the
                        uptake of, and retention to, such programs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The United Nations estimates that by 2050, individuals aged 60 y or older will
                represent 22% of the world's population, or about 2 billion people, with
                the most dramatic increases in Asia and Latin America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-United1">[1]</xref>. Older people especially in low-
                and middle-income countries frequently consume diets that may be insufficient in
                terms of calorie content as well as poor in quality in terms of mineral and vitamin
                (or micronutrient) composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-World1">[2]</xref>. Current global policy initiatives are designed to promote
                healthy ageing and include an emphasis on securing adequate nutrient intakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-WHO1">[3]</xref>. Achieving
                nutritional sufficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Knoops1">[4]</xref> and maintaining moderate physical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Manini1">[5]</xref> have both been
                demonstrated to decrease the risk of mortality in longitudinal studies. The benefits
                of adequate nutrition, especially in terms of the micronutrient content of diets,
                may arise from preserving immune function and lean body mass, both of which decline
                with ageing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Haynes1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Rivlin1">[8]</xref>, while physical activity reduces numerous risk factors for
                disability and chronic diseases in later life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Department1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Current evidence from the few clinical trials in older people of micronutrient
                supplementation for the prevention of infection is largely negative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-ElKadiki1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Avenell1">[11]</xref>, but this
                evidence is derived exclusively from studies conducted in high-income settings
                (Northern Europe and North America). Evidence on the benefits of resistance training
                for the maintenance of physical function in later life comes exclusively from
                high-intensity, short-term interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Liu1">[12]</xref>. There is currently no
                high-quality evidence for either of these interventions in low-income or transition
                economies where the ongoing demographic trends suggest that the needs for such
                interventions are greatest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-United1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-World1">[2]</xref>. This is an important omission from the current evidence
                base because the impacts in low-income or transition economies of physical activity
                and nutritional interventions may differ from those in higher income countries,
                given the differences in baseline population health and in calorie and micronutrient
                intake sufficiency.</p>
      <p>Chile has undergone a rapid demographic transition and the proportion of the
                population aged ≥60 y has increased from 8% to 12% over the past 25
                y. Pneumonia is common among older people in Chile, with an estimated incidence rate
                among those aged ≥65 y of 73 per 1,000 person years (py), and is the leading
                cause of death among those over 80 y of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Ministerio1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Ministerio2">[15]</xref>. Low levels of physical
                activity are also common, and 96% of the ≥65 y Chilean population are
                sedentary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Ministerio3">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, vitamin and mineral dietary intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Atalah1">[17]</xref> and status
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Olivares1">[18]</xref> are
                known to be poor among older people in Chile. Since 1998, the government of Chile
                has distributed micronutrient fortified foods to all individuals ≥70 y,
                registered at primary health centers and enrolled in the Programme of Complementary
                Feeding for the Older Population (PACAM). In 2003, stakeholder groups proposed that
                the national program could be extended to people aged ≥65y and enhanced by the
                inclusion of a physical activity component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Dangour1">[19]</xref>. National policies aimed at
                preserving health and function in older people with interventions, such as
                cash-transfers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Gobierno1">[20]</xref> and provision of “food baskets” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Instituto1">[21]</xref>, are often
                used in Latin American countries but are rarely formally evaluated.</p>
      <p>The primary aim of this study, the Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of a Nutritional
                supplement and EXercise program for older people (or CENEX) study, was to evaluate
                formally whether Chile's national nutritional supplementation program and/or
                physical exercise prevented pneumonia and functional decline in older people in
                Santiago, and whether these interventions were cost-effective. There were two
                primary hypotheses for the CENEX study. First, that provision for 24 mo of a
                micronutrient-fortified nutritional supplement to adults aged 65.0–67.9 y
                would decrease the incidence of pneumonia, and second that provision for 24 mo of a
                community-based, twice-weekly resistance training exercise program to adults aged
                65.0–67.9 y would increase walking capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Dangour2">[22]</xref>.</p>

        <p>This is a 2×2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial of the effect
                    of a 2-y nutritional supplementation and/or physical activity program delivered

                    The age range was selected as it met the proposal to extend the national program
                    down to the ≥65-y age group and as it allowed individuals at the upper end of
                    the age range to join the existing national program (open to individuals aged
                    ≥70 y) once they had completed 24 mo in the study. Clusters were health

        <title>Recruitment</title>
        <p>At the start of the study, 20 of 33 potential health centers expressed interest.
                    The randomization sequence for study clusters was generated by members of the
                    study team and excluded any outcome assessors. The center names (clusters) were
                    put into a hat. The four treatment arms (nutritional supplementation,
                    nutritional supplementation+physical activity, physical activity, control)
                    were randomly numbered 1–4. As each name was drawn out of the hat by a
                    member of the study team, it was assigned to the next treatment number until
                    each arm contained five clusters. Concerns that lower than expected pneumonia
                    incidence rates would affect the trial's ability to detect an effect of
                    nutritional supplementation on pneumonia incidence resulted in a protocol
                    amendment 4 mo into the study. A further 12 health centers were approached to
                    join the study, eight of which were subsequently randomly assigned by drawing

                    exploratory per-protocol analyses were also conducted. Results are presented as
                    effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), accounting for the
                    clustered design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Huber1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-White1">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>All individuals were counted as “at risk” from their date of entry to
                    the study until they developed pneumonia, died, or completed the study after 2 y
                    (main sample) or 18 mo (supplementary sample). Individuals who died were
                    censored at date of death. Those who developed pneumonia were excluded from the
                    “at risk” group for 14 d after developing pneumonia, after which
                    they re-entered the “at risk” group. Rates in each arm and in each
                    center were calculated as the number of events divided by the person years at
                    risk. The number of occurrences of pneumonia in each study participant showed
                    significant over-dispersion compared to a Poisson distribution; a negative
                    binomial regression model was, therefore, used to estimate rate ratios. The
                    clustered design of the study was taken into account by the use of robust
                    standard errors for estimating the 95% CIs. Both pneumonia and ALRI were
                    considered to be events for the analysis of combined outcomes. All statistical
                    analyses were carried out in STATA version 10 and all statistical tests were
                    two-sided. Cost and effectiveness data were used to derive incremental

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized trial conducted in a transitional
                country setting designed to determine the cost-effectiveness of nutritional
                supplement and physical activity interventions among older people. We recruited
                2,799 participants aged 65.0–67.9 y from 28 health centers in low-middle
                socioeconomic municipalities in Santiago, Chile, and retained 84% of study
                participants over 24 mo of intervention. The results of the trial do not support the
                hypothesis of benefit, in terms of prevention of pneumonia, from micronutrient
                supplementation at the doses provided in Chile's ongoing national nutritional
                supplementation program for older people. The provision of physical activity classes
                improved physical function, assessed by a 34-m increase in walking capacity
                (approximately 8%) in adults aged 65–67 y, at a cost of US$4.84
                per additional meter walked.</p>
      <p>The strengths of this study include its large size, randomized design, and high level
                of participant retention. The willingness of the Chilean Ministry of Health to
                support the study provides important precedents for future evaluations and the
                potential for consequent evidence-based policy.</p>
      <p>There are also several weaknesses in the study. First, because of the design, the
                interventions were not masked to participants. However, physicians diagnosing the
                primary outcome for the nutritional intervention were not formally involved in the
                study nor were they aware of participants' involvement in the study or the
                interventions being provided. Similarly, fieldworkers collecting information on
                physical activity outcomes did not know the intervention being provided to
                particular participants or their compliance with the exercise regimen. Second,
                although this was a large study, the lack of effect detected on incidence of
                pneumonia might be partly due to insufficient statistical power. The revised sample
                size for the pneumonia outcome was based on incidence data over the first 4 mo of
                the study, but the observed coefficient of variation was considerably higher than
                originally estimated (0.51 versus 0.14). While a certain degree of intercluster
                variability in pneumonia rates is to be expected, the absolute size of this
                variability has not previously been assessed in Chile at the health center level.
                Furthermore, the study was conducted at a time when pneumonia rates were decreasing,
                and access to influenza immunization programs increasing, both of which factors
                might have influenced the intercluster variability. Also, our results could not
                exclude the possibility that a micronutrient supplementation program may benefit
                other measures of health (physical or mental) in older people. We are similarly not
                able to make any comment on the possible effect of the interventions on those
                individuals excluded at study entry. Third, recruitment of participants within the
                physical activity arms was slightly lower than in the other arms suggesting that
                participants may have been less motivated to join a study in which they were offered
                an exercise intervention. There were no obvious differences in the characteristics
                of the groups at baseline. Loss to follow up was slightly higher in the control arm,
                possibly reflecting fewer intervention-related contacts. Fourth, while adherence to
                the nutritional supplementation intervention was generally high and in accordance
                with national data, which suggest that more than 85% of individuals who
                receive these supplements from their health center report that they consume it on a
                regular basis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Servicio1">[40]</xref>, adherence to the physical activity intervention was
                relatively moderate, despite attempts to make the classes easily accessible and
                enjoyable. The enhanced effect on walking capacity among those adults with higher
                adherence suggests that greater adherence to the study protocol may have increased
                the size of the effect. And finally, the restricted and (relative to very elderly)
                youthful age range of the study participants, while appropriate for our study
                rationale, may have limited the potential impact of the interventions.</p>
      <p>This is the first large trial to investigate the effect of micronutrient supplements
                for the prevention of infection in older people outside high-income settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-ElKadiki1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Avenell1">[11]</xref>, to our
                knowledge, and the lack of any detected effect of supplementation extends the
                evidence base to include transition economies. The doses of the various
                micronutrients provided in the nutritional supplementation are similar to those
                provided in other published trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-ElKadiki1">[10]</xref>, and there is currently no
                evidence that larger safe doses would have a different effect. Previous trials on
                benefits of resistance training for older people have been small, brief, and to date
                have only been conducted in developed countries generally under fully supervised
                conditions. A recent Cochrane review comparing resistance training with a
                no-exercise control in older people (11 trials included; total in analysis
                    <italic>n</italic> = 325; mean age 63–84 y) found
                that resistance training resulted in a statistically significant 52-m increase in
                walking capacity over 6 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Liu1">[12]</xref>. The review also estimated (12 trials included; total in
                analysis <italic>n</italic> = 691, mean age 66–85 y) that
                resistance training resulted in a statistically significant 0.7-s decrease in TUG
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Liu1">[12]</xref>. We detected
                a 34-m benefit of physical activity classes on walking capacity and a 0.5-s benefit
                in the TUG test. Our findings extend the results from the Cochrane review in two
                important ways. First, the physical activity intervention was made available in
                local community halls and there was no intensive follow-up of study participants.
                Second, this is the first study to be conducted outside a high-income country.</p>
      <p>A Cochrane review of interventions to reduce falls in older people living in the
                community identified 17 trials that compared exercise interventions with no-exercise
                control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Gillespie1">[41]</xref>.
                Overall, the trials suggested that exercise interventions reduced the risk of falls
                (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72–0.97). This review was based on small
                    (<italic>n</italic> = 28–437; total in
                analysis = 2,494) and brief (5–52 wk) trials, only one of
                which was set outside a high-income country. Results from our study suggest that the
                physical activity intervention resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of
                falls (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.89–1.07) and thus do not support the
                conclusion from the Cochrane review. However, it is important to note that the
                sample recruited into the current study had a more restricted age range than that of
                some other studies, which may partially explain the discrepancy between the current
                finding and the existing literature.</p>
      <p>Simple measures of walking speed and ability have been widely used as markers of
                functional ability in later life. Walking speed has repeatedly been shown to be a
                powerful predictor of health-related events and mortality in healthy older people
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Cesari1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Dumurgier1">[46]</xref>. The evidence base for the 6-min walk relates mostly to
                individuals with preexisting respiratory problems, but similarly suggests that poor
                performance on the test is predictive of mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Rostagno1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Szekely1">[48]</xref>. Indeed, a 6-min walk of less
                than 350 m is one of four components of a prediction score for death in patients
                with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Celli1">[49]</xref>. In a study of 112 individuals
                with stable COPD, Redelmeier and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Redelmeier1">[50]</xref> estimated a difference of
                54 m (95% CI 37–74) in 6-min walk distances was associated with a
                noticeable difference in patients' subjective comparison ratings of their
                walking ability and was clinically relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-ATS1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Wise1">[52]</xref>. There are no guidelines for
                clinical relevance of the 6-min walk in healthy older people; however, enhanced
                walking capacity as demonstrated in this study is directly correlated with improved
                walking speed and, thus, it may be associated with improved health or quality of
                life outcomes, especially among populations who walk as their primary means of
                transport.</p>
      <p>Given the intervention-specific nature of the numerator (additional meters walked),
                it is not possible to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of physical activity
                classes to other health care interventions in Chile and Latin America. Economic
                evaluations of similar physical activity programs from other settings suggest that
                it may represent value for money. For example, a review of health care–based
                interventions aimed at improving physical activity identified five controlled trials
                in older populations, all of which demonstrated favorable cost-effectiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Hagberg1">[53]</xref>. A more recent
                cluster randomized trial of a community based exercise program in ≥65-y-olds in
                the UK demonstrated that it cost approximately €17,000 to gain a
                quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which again compares favorably with other health
                care interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Munro1">[54]</xref>. We estimate that rolling out the exercise program to all
                older people in Chile would account for approximately 5% of the
                government's US$3.3 billion health care expenditure, although we would
                expect that such scaling up would substantially reduce unit and thus total costs. A
                community-based intervention of the kind provided in the CENEX study, which is
                practical, affordable, and enjoyable for participants, provides further evidence to
                support the contention that exercise is a “best buy”‘ in public
                health terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Morris1">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is important to recognize that there may be broader, long-term economic effects on
                the population or health service that have not been accounted for in the instruments
                used to assess economic components. For example, wider benefits may include social
                capital created through the physical activity intervention, and an increase in the
                level of trust in health services and participants' willingness to use such
                services, which, in turn, may influence the effectiveness of future programs.</p>
      <p>Chile has a high burden of infectious and nutrition-related chronic diseases, which
                impose significantly on the national health budget, thus increasing the importance
                of identifying cost-effective preventive public health interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001023-Christensen1">[56]</xref>. From the
                results of this study, there is little evidence to support the effectiveness of
                Chile's national nutritional supplementation program in reducing the incidence
                of pneumonia for 65.0–67.9-y-olds. However, the provision of physical activity
                classes to older people, especially at high levels of adherence, may well have
                clinical benefit for older people in metropolitan settings such as Santiago. Future
                challenges include increasing uptake to, and retention in, sustainable physical
                activities, and exploring mechanisms for extending the benefit of physical activity
                both beyond metropolitan Santiago and into other age groups.</p>
