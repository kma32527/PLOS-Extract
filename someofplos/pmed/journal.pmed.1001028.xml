      <title/>
      <p>This month <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> publishes a research article reporting that
                medical doctors and mental health professionals from the US Department of Defense
                working at the Guantánamo Bay prison concealed or failed to document medical
                evidence of intentional harm of nine detainees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-Iacopino1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The authors—Vincent Iacopino, a senior medical advisor to Physicians for Human
                Rights, and Stephen Xenakis, a retired US Army Brigadier General—present a
                case series of nine individuals detained in Guantánamo Bay, all of whom
                alleged torture and ill treatment during detention at the facility. Acting as
                nongovernmental medical personnel recruited by lawyers acting for the nine
                detainees, the authors scrutinized medical records, client affidavits,
                attorney–client notes and summaries, and legal declarations of medical experts
                for evidence of torture and ill treatment. Where such evidence existed, Iacopino and
                Xenakis assessed whether medical personnel at the camp had either documented or
                treated symptoms arising from torture.</p>
      <p>Guantánamo Bay is a detention facility for US prisoners in Cuba that opened in
                2002. Despite US President Barack Obama pledging during the 2008 presidential
                elections to shut Guantánamo Bay and transfer detainees to the US for trial,
                the prison shows no sign of closing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-No1">[2]</xref> and 172 detainees remain incarcerated there. Both authors
                of the paper, which publishes this week, are from Physicians for Human Rights, a US
                not-for-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing health professionals to
                investigate and stop human rights abuses, that has previously documented in a series
                of extensive reports evidence of the involvement of US personnel in torture at
                Guantánamo Bay and other prisons worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-Physicians1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-Physicians2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-Physicians3">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This research article adds solid, specific evidence of both human rights abuses at
                Guantánamo Bay and the apparent complicity of medical personnel in the abuse.
                It documents specific features of torture alleged by the detainees including
                “enhanced interrogation techniques” that were deemed suitable for use in
                US interrogations by then-President George W. Bush <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-J1">[6]</xref>. These techniques included sleep
                deprivation, exposure to temperature extremes, serious threats, forced positions,
                beatings, and forced nudity. In addition, each of the nine detainees reported being
                subjected to severe beatings, sexual assault and/or the threat of rape, mock
                execution, mock disappearance, and being choked. By analyzing medical records and
                carrying out psychological evaluations, either directly or by proxy, the authors of
                the <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> paper were able to detail the physical and mental
                health of each detainee. Crucially, although some of the physical injuries sustained
                by detainees that were consistent with allegations of torture were documented by
                medical personnel in the camp, <italic>causes</italic> of injury were not
                investigated by those personnel. Furthermore, mental health practitioners in the
                camp recorded symptoms characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in
                seven of nine detainees, but failed to investigate the causes of the symptoms or to
                diagnose or treat the detainees' PTSD.</p>
      <p>Iacopino and Xenakis reach a sobering conclusion: “Medical doctors and mental
                health personnel assigned to the US Department of Defense neglected and/or concealed
                medical evidence of intentional harm. The full extent of medical complicity in US
                torture practices will not be known until there is a thorough, impartial
                investigation including relevant classified information. We believe that, until such
                time as such an investigation is undertaken, and those responsible for torture are
                held accountable, the ethical integrity of medical and other healing professions
                remains compromised.”</p>
      <p>These findings are of course at stark odds with the codes of international medical
                associations, which prohibit physicians from participating in or being present
                during torture or other degrading procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-World1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-American1">[8]</xref>. Their findings especially
                violate the American Medical Association's stance that specifically charges
                physicians with providing assistance to victims of torture, and to “whenever
                possible, strive to change situations in which torture is practiced or the potential
                for torture is great” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001028-American1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Publishing peer-reviewed documentary evidence of harm—especially from settings
                difficult to access such as prisons or conflict settings—is a vital and
                important role of medical journals. This paper adds new evidence that will bolster
                calls for further investigation into the complicity of medical personnel in torture
                at Guantánamo Bay, which clearly breaches fundamental human rights. Evidence
                must be obtained and properly reported in order that those who have been negligent
                (or worse) can be appropriately dealt with, including where necessary by
                prosecution.</p>
