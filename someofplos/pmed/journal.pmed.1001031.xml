      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A decade into the 21st century, billions of people have yet to benefit from the
                health advances of the 20th century. Life expectancy at birth in sub-Saharan Africa
                is 53 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-World1">[1]</xref>—only two years higher than in the United States a
                century ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Arias1">[2]</xref>,
                and 27 years lower than in high-income countries today <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-World1">[1]</xref>. The most basic human needs
                continue to elude the world's poorest people. In 2010, approximately 925
                million people were suffering from chronic hunger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Food1">[3]</xref>, 884 million people lacked access
                to clean water, and 2.6 billion people were without access to proper sanitation
                facilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Such global health disparities will likely persist until there is fair and effective
                global governance for health—the organization of national and global norms,
                institutions, and processes that collectively shape the health of the world's
                population. Global governance for health goes beyond the health sector. It requires
                remediating the currently unfair and detrimental health impacts of international
                regimes (e.g., trade, intellectual property, and finance), and developing stable,
                responsive, democratic political institutions.</p>
      <p>A coalition of civil society and academics, with a shared vision of the “right
                of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and
                mental health” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-International1">[5]</xref> (“right to health”), is therefore launching
                the Joint Action and Learning Initiative on National and Global Responsibilities for
                Health (JALI). JALI seeks to develop a post–Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
                framework for global health, one rooted in the right to health and aimed at securing
                universal health coverage for all people. We seek to clarify the health goods and
                services to which all people are entitled, national and global responsibilities to
                secure the health of the world's population, and governance structures required
                to realize these responsibilities. Our goal is a global agreement, such as a
                Framework Convention on Global Health, which sets priorities, clarifies national and
                international responsibilities, ensures accountability, and develops corresponding
                institutions, such as a Global Health Fund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Gostin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Cometto1">[7]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Partnerships with Civil Society Organizations</title>
      <p>JALI will draw inspiration from, and collaborate with, civil society movements, which
                are central to securing and ensuring adherence to a global health agreement. Such
                movements have spurred momentous transformations in health. Advocates changed the
                world's response to AIDS from one marked by discrimination to one focused on
                empowering marginalized people and scaling up HIV services. The Campaign to Ban
                Landmines drove a process that culminated in a treaty banning this indiscriminate
                weapon.</p>
      <p>Civil society campaigns for the right to health, such as those through the
                People's Health Movement, are already underway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Peoples1">[8]</xref>. Nongovernmental organizations
                (NGOs) from the South and North launched a Declaration of Solidarity for a Unified
                Movement for the Right to Health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Partners1">[9]</xref>. JALI is developing the partnerships required to undertake
                an inclusive process involving research, analysis, and extensive online and regional
                consultations to gain insight into and build consensus around answers to four
                foundational questions, and to stimulate coordinated action to reduce health
                inequities. This bottom-up, research-focused process will develop a detailed
                understanding of health rights and state obligations, clear targets and benchmarks
                for success, and effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms. These will add
                precision to and enhance the effectiveness of international human rights law, which
                could in turn enhance civil society efforts to hold their own governments to
                account. By drawing on the voices of civil society and disadvantaged communities,
                JALI could have the legitimacy and the political support to transform global
                governance for health.</p>

      <title>Four Defining Questions in Global Health</title>
      <p>The four defining questions, and preliminary directions on answers, are:</p>
      <p>
        <italic>1. What are the services and goods guaranteed to every person under the human
                    right to health?</italic>
      </p>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has placed universal health coverage high on the
                global health agenda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-World2">[10]</xref>, defining three dimensions of coverage: 1) the proportion
                of the population served; 2) the level of services; and 3) the proportion of health
                costs covered by prepaid pooled funds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-World3">[11]</xref>. WHO has defined universal
                coverage “as access to key promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative
                health interventions for all at an affordable cost” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-World4">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The human right to health, an international treaty obligation, provides critical
                insight into how states should work towards universal coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001031-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Core obligations offer benchmarks to
                assess progress towards universal coverage, such as non-discrimination, equitable
                distribution of health facilities, and essential services for all, including those
                addressing underlying determinants of health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <fig id="pmed-1001031-g001" position="float">
        <object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1001031.g001</object-id>

        <caption>
          <title>Universal health coverage and the right to health.</title>
          <p>The pooled funds represent the total amount of funding that states have
                        available to expand universal health coverage along three dimensions: 1) who
                        is covered, and the proportion of population covered; 2) what services are
                        covered; and 3) the extent to which the state covers the cost of these
                        services. Under a right to health approach, this total level of funding will
                        be derived from the maximum of available resources that states are required
                        to dedicate to the right to health and other rights.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001031.g001" xlink:type="simple"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The core principle of equality requires states to prioritize covering 100% of
                their populations. Although 100% coverage of all health services will not be
                possible immediately, full coverage of “key” health interventions should
                be an initial benchmark towards universal coverage. The right to health framework
                militates against a narrow definition of “key” services. Rather, these
                should encompass WHO's health system building blocks (e.g., services,
                workforce, information, financing, and governance); essential vaccines, medicines,
                and technologies; and fundamental human needs (e.g., sanitation, nutritious food,
                potable water, safe housing, vector abatement, tobacco control, and healthy
                environments).</p>
      <p>Critically, universal coverage should be re-conceptualized to encompass fundamental
                human needs given their major impact on health. Within this framework, specific
                services would be determined nationally through participatory processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Frenk1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The provision of each of these core entitlements—health systems, essential
                vaccines and medicines, and fundamental human needs—should represent only one
                significant step towards achieving the highest attainable standard of health.
                States, even wealthy ones, will need to continue to progress towards universal
                coverage. The right to health requires states to spend the “maximum
                of…available resources” towards progressively realizing health and other
                socioeconomic rights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-International1">[5]</xref>. Thus, under international law, states have a duty
                “to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards” fully
                realizing the right to health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>
        <italic>2. What responsibilities do all states have for the health of their own
                    populations?</italic>
      </p>
      <p>The right to health places the primary responsibility on governments to ensure the
                health needs of all their inhabitants. National responsibility includes health
                sector funding, addressing the socioeconomic determinants of health, and good
                governance.</p>
      <p>There is no universally agreed level of health sector funding adequate to meet the
                population's needs. African heads of state agreed to a benchmark of at least
                15% of national budgets devoted to the health sector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Organization1">[15]</xref>, and to allocating at
                least 10% of their national budgets for agricultural development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-African1">[16]</xref>. Additionally,
                32 African countries set a target, as an aspiration, to have public sector budget
                allocations for sanitation and hygiene programs reach at least 0.5% of gross
                domestic product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Second1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These benchmarks set a minimum bar for national funding responsibilities, which
                extend beyond the health sector. National health responsibilities should comply with
                well-defined, measurable international standards, balanced against the flexibility
                necessary to respect national priorities, health profiles, and needs.</p>
      <p>States also have a responsibility to govern well, derived from central human rights
                tenets such as participatory processes, transparent and accountable government, and
                non-discrimination and equality. Well-designed legal rules and institutional
                arrangements can facilitate honest administrations, openness, and accountability,
                along with meaningful civil society and community participation in decision-making.
                The law, moreover, should guarantee equality and non-discrimination on the basis of
                race, sex, religion, disability, and other statuses. Measures to enhance
                accountability to communities in India's National Rural Health Mission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Ministry1">[18]</xref>, and
                Brazilian policies to reduce health disparities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Bhutta1">[19]</xref>, offer instructive lessons.</p>
      <p>
        <italic>3. What duties do states owe to people beyond their borders in securing
                            the right to health?</italic>
      </p>
      <p>Resource-poor states lack capacity to ensure all of their people even core health
                goods and services, much less a fuller realization of the right to health. Countries
                in a position to assist are obliged to do so under principles of international law
                and global social justice. The Committee on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights has
                declared that cooperation towards realizing the right to health is “an
                obligation of all States,” particularly those “in a position to assist
                others” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United3">[20]</xref>. All countries have mutual responsibilities towards
                ensuring the health of the world's most disadvantaged.</p>
      <p>Beyond development assistance, coordination and coherence is required across sectors,
                as global health can be improved or harmed through state and international policies
                and rules that govern areas such as trade, intellectual property, health worker
                migration, international financing, and debt relief. These responsibilities extend
                to the exercise of state power and influence over multilateral institutions such as
                the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization.</p>
      <p>International aspects of the right to health are ill-defined. With limited
                exceptions, such as the commitment of wealthy countries to spend 0.7% of
                gross national product on official development assistance, health and development
                commitments are framed collectively, vaguely, or not at all. Even when countries
                make commitments, they often fail to follow through. For example, only one month
                after countries at the 2010 United Nations (UN) MDG Summit committed to provide
                “adequate funding” for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
                Malaria, pledges at the replenishment conference fell billions of dollars short
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United4">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-McNeil1">[22]</xref>. The Summit
                called for accelerated development assistance for health, though the rate of
                increase in assistance dropped during the global recession <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United4">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Institute1">[23]</xref>. Budget shortfalls in the
                aftermath of the financial downturn further threaten assistance levels.</p>
      <p>
        <italic>4. What kind of global governance for health is needed to ensure that
                            all states live up to their mutual responsibilities?</italic>
      </p>
      <p>Translating a shared understanding of national and global responsibilities into new
                realities requires effective and democratic global governance for health.
                Notwithstanding the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, global health faces
                challenges of weak leadership, poor coordination, underfunded priorities, and a lack
                of transparency, accountability, and enforcement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Gostin2">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Innovative global governance and enhanced funding would empower WHO to exercise
                effective leadership in the health sector and persuasive advocacy on agriculture,
                finance, and trade. Moreover, state policies (e.g., agricultural subsidies,
                intellectual property, and foreign affairs) can powerfully affect health in
                resource-poor countries. States, therefore, should adopt a
                “health-in-all-policies” approach where all ministries address the
                health impacts of their policies and programs. Effective governance must include
                active citizen participation to ensure transparency, collaboration, and
                accountability while maximizing creativity and resource mobilization by states,
                international organizations, businesses, and civil society.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, the global health architecture must hold stakeholders accountable,
                with clear standards for success, monitoring progress, and enforcement—all of
                which have been lacking. Lack of sufficiently precise obligations and compliance
                mechanisms under the right to health hinders accountability, though promising
                approaches exist. Human rights bodies and UN special rapporteurs are adding clarity
                to state responsibilities under the right to health, which is required for
                meaningful accountability, as are constitutional court decisions in Argentina,
                India, and South Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Hogerzeil1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Gauri1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Innovations in human rights law and practice hold potential for greater
                accountability. Regional right-to-health special rapporteurs could be established,
                enabling more effective national engagement. An empowered human rights sector could
                learn from international regimes with more vigorous adjudication and enforcement
                mechanisms, such as trade. Actions to ensure that social movements and voters are
                well-informed about their countries' commitments could strengthen political
                accountability.</p>
      <p>The Global South, where most of the world's least healthy people reside, should
                lead in shaping global governance for health policies, where community priorities
                drive global action. New governance requires the full participation of, and support
                for, marginalized populations.</p>

    <sec id="s5">
      <title>Towards a Hopeful Future for Global Health</title>
      <p>Why would states agree to greater accountability when so many countries fail to
                adhere to existing commitments? We do not underestimate the gravity of the
                challenge, yet JALI offers possibilities for success. Social mobilization could
                ignite new possibilities, as the AIDS movement has done, unleashing the collective
                power of health advocates and empowered communities.</p>
      <p>The framework of mutual responsibilities that emerges from JALI should prove
                attractive to both Southern and Northern governments, creating incentives to develop
                a far-reaching global health agreement. Mutual responsibilities come with mutual
                benefits. Southern countries will benefit from increased respect for their
                strategies, greater and more predictable funding from more coordinated and
                accountable development partners, reform of policies that harm health, such as those
                in trade and agriculture, and most importantly, better health for their populations.
                Countries in the North will benefit from increased confidence that development
                assistance is spent effectively and the prospect of reduced financing needs over
                time as host countries increase their own health spending and build sustainable
                health systems. All will benefit from lessons on shared health challenges, from the
                economic and educational gains that will come with improved global health, and from
                increased protection for their populations from global public health
                threats—and from mutual goodwill derived from participating in an historic
                venture to make unprecedented progress towards global health equity.</p>
      <p>This is also a moment of rare opportunity. The post-MDG global health framework is
                yet to be developed. Demand for accountability is growing. The right to health is
                increasingly motivating not only civil society, but also governments. The Pan
                American Health Organization passed a resolution on health and human rights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Pan1">[27]</xref>, and the UN
                General Assembly explicitly recognized the right to clean water and sanitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-United1">[4]</xref>. Universal
                coverage, primary health care, and socioeconomic determinants are receiving renewed
                focus. Global health remains prominent on the international agenda, evidenced by the
                attention to global health and foreign policy and the upcoming UN high-level summit
                on non-communicable diseases.</p>
      <p>In January 2011, WHO's Executive Board called on the Organization to assume a
                “more active and effective role” in “directing and
                coordinating” international health activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-WHO1">[28]</xref>. The agency initiated a reform
                process to strengthen its “central role in global health governance”
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-WHO1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001031-Sridhar1">[29]</xref>. JALI supports
                WHO leadership, but also governance reforms extending beyond WHO, and even beyond
                the health sector, for a deeper understanding of the multiple forms of injustice
                that adversely affect health and development.</p>
      <p>We invite readers to join JALI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.section27.org.za/2010/11/23/jali" xlink:type="simple">http://www.section27.org.za/2010/11/23/jali</ext-link>) to develop widely
                shared understandings of national and global responsibilities for health to inform
                post-MDG commitments and create an innovative global agreement. It is time to
                define—and to meet—these responsibilities.</p>
