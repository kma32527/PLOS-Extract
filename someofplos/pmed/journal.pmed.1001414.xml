          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Stigma, discrimination, lack of privacy, and long waiting times partly explain why six out of ten individuals living with HIV do not access facility-based testing. By circumventing these barriers, self-testing offers potential for more people to know their sero-status. Recent approval of an in-home HIV self test in the US has sparked self-testing initiatives, yet data on acceptability, feasibility, and linkages to care are limited. We systematically reviewed evidence on supervised (self-testing and counselling aided by a health care professional) and unsupervised (performed by self-tester with access to phone/internet counselling) self-testing strategies.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Seven databases (Medline [via PubMed], Biosis, PsycINFO, Cinahl, African Medicus, LILACS, and EMBASE) and conference abstracts of six major HIV/sexually transmitted infections conferences were searched from 1st January 2000–30th October 2012. 1,221 citations were identified and 21 studies included for review. Seven studies evaluated an unsupervised strategy and 14 evaluated a supervised strategy. For both strategies, data on acceptability (range: 74%–96%), preference (range: 61%–91%), and partner self-testing (range: 80%–97%) were high. A high specificity (range: 99.8%–100%) was observed for both strategies, while a lower sensitivity was reported in the unsupervised (range: 92.9%–100%; one study) versus supervised (range: 97.4%–97.9%; three studies) strategy. Regarding feasibility of linkage to counselling and care, 96% (<italic>n</italic> = 102/106) of individuals testing positive for HIV stated they would seek post-test counselling (unsupervised strategy, one study). No extreme adverse events were noted. The majority of data (<italic>n</italic> = 11,019/12,402 individuals, 89%) were from high-income settings and 71% (<italic>n</italic> = 15/21) of studies were cross-sectional in design, thus limiting our analysis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Both supervised and unsupervised testing strategies were highly acceptable, preferred, and more likely to result in partner self-testing. However, no studies evaluated post-test linkage with counselling and treatment outcomes and reporting quality was poor. Thus, controlled trials of high quality from diverse settings are warranted to confirm and extend these findings.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec>
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>About 34 million people (most living in resource-limited countries) are currently infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and about 2.5 million people become infected with HIV every year. HIV is usually transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected partner. HIV infection is usually diagnosed by looking for antibodies to HIV in blood or saliva. Early during infection, the immune system responds to HIV by beginning to make antibodies that recognize the virus and target it for destruction. “Seroconversion”—the presence of detectable amounts of antibody in the blood or saliva—usually takes 6–12 weeks. Rapid antibody-based tests, which do not require laboratory facilities, can provide a preliminary result about an individual's HIV status from a simple oral swab or finger stick sample within 20 minutes. However preliminary rapid positive results have to be confirmed in a laboratory, which may take a few days or weeks. If positive, HIV infection can be controlled but not cured by taking a daily cocktail of powerful antiretroviral drugs throughout life.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>To reduce the spread of HIV, it is essential that HIV-positive individuals get tested, change behaviors avoid transmitting the virus to other people by, for example, always using a condom during sex, and if positive get on to treatment that is available worldwide. Treatment also reduces transmission of virus to the partner and controls the virus in the community. However, only half the people currently living with HIV know their HIV status, a state of affairs that increases the possibility of further HIV transmission to their partners and children. HIV positive individuals are diagnosed late with advanced HIV infection that costs health care services. Although health care facility-based HIV testing has been available for decades, people worry about stigma, visibility, and social discrimination. They also dislike the lack of privacy and do not like having to wait for their test results. Self-testing (i.e., self-test conduct and interpretation) might alleviate some of these barriers to testing by allowing individuals to determine their HIV status in the privacy of their home and could, therefore, increase the number of individuals aware of their HIV status. This could possibly reduce transmission and, through seeking linkages to care, bring HIV under control in communities. In some communities and countries, stigma of HIV prevents people from taking action about their HIV status. Indeed, an oral (saliva-based) HIV self-test kit is now available in the US. But how acceptable, feasible, and accurate is self-testing by lay people, and will people who find themselves self-test positive seek counseling and treatment? In this systematic review (a study that uses pre-defined criteria to identify all the research on a given topic), the researchers examine these issues by analyzing data from studies that have evaluated supervised self-testing (self-testing and counseling aided by a health-care professional) and unsupervised self-testing (self-testing performed without any help but with counseling available by phone or internet).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers identified 21 eligible studies, two-thirds of which evaluated oral self-testing and a third of which evaluated blood-based self-testing. Seven studies evaluated an unsupervised self-testing strategy and 14 evaluated a supervised strategy. Most of the data (89%) came from studies undertaken in high-income settings. The study populations varied from those at high risk of HIV infection to low-risk general populations. Across the studies, acceptability (defined as the number of people who actually self-tested divided by the number who consented to self-test) ranged from 74% to 96%. With both strategies, the specificity of self-testing (the chance of an HIV-negative person receiving a negative test result is true negative) was high but the sensitivity of self-testing (the chance of an HIV-positive person receiving a positive test result is indeed a true positive) was higher for supervised than for unsupervised testing. The researchers also found evidence that people preferred self-testing to facility-based testing and oral self-testing to blood-based self testing and, in one study, 96% of participants who self-tested positive sought post-testing counseling.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These findings provide new but limited information about the feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy of HIV self-testing. They suggest that it is feasible to implement both supervised and unsupervised self-testing, that both strategies are preferred to facility-based testing, but that the accuracy of self-testing is variable. However, most of the evidence considered by the researchers came from high-income countries and from observational studies of varying quality, and data on whether people self-testing positive sought post-testing counseling (linkage to care) were only available from one evaluation of unsupervised self-testing in the US. Consequently, although these findings suggest that self-testing could engage individuals in finding our their HIV status and thereby help modify behavior thus, reduce HIV transmission in the community, by increasing the proportion of people living with HIV who know their HIV status. The researchers suggested that more data from diverse settings and preferably from controlled randomized trials must be collected before any initiatives for global scale-up of self-testing for HIV infection are implemented.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>On July 3, 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an oral point-of-care (POC) HIV self test, OraQuick, for over-the-counter (OTC) sale on the basis of a positive recommendation from their Blood Product Advisory Committee (FDA-BPAC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-US1">[1]</xref>. This decision, the first for a self test for an infectious disease, is an important step towards normalizing the process of receiving an HIV diagnosis, currently beset with stigma and discrimination. The FDA approved the oral HIV test even though it is less sensitive than a blood test because of its potential to allow more people to know their sero-status and thus potentially avert thousands of cases of HIV transmission. Although this approval has paved the way for a self-testing paradigm complementary to facility-based testing, evidence is needed to understand whether self-testing will lead to more people knowing their HIV status and whether self-testing can be implemented, and operationalized as a strategy in global settings.</p>
      <p>If HIV self-testing is to realize its promise of increasing the number of at-risk individuals knowing their sero-status evidence is needed to demonstrate that self-testing strategies can be an acceptable or preferred mode of HIV testing. Crucially, it is important to demonstrate that individuals who are self-testing can be given reasonable assurance of test accuracy, especially for populations with varying backgrounds and literacy levels. Furthermore, evidence on whether self-testing will offer a private, confidential alternative to facility-based HIV testing with a safe conduit to care and treatment is needed to improve outcomes for both individuals and at-risk populations.</p>
      <p>If self-testing is proven to help increase knowledge of sero-status in those individuals that do not seek facility-based testing and improves linkages to care and treatment rates in the community, then it will stand to impact control HIV at the population level. However, as of 2013, that vision remains unrealized. Facility-based HIV testing strategies (voluntary testing and counselling, provider-initiated and conventional client-initiated testing and counselling) have been in place for decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Mavedzenge1">[2]</xref>. However, stigma and discrimination faced in these settings remain key barriers to testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Joint1">[3]</xref>. Additional barriers include fear of visibility, fear of lack of confidentiality of a positive test result, a lack of privacy, and increased waiting time to obtain a test result <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Spielberg1">[4]</xref>. It is no surprise therefore that about six in ten individuals living with HIV infection remain untested globally and as a consequence, are unaware of their HIV sero-status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Joint2">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this context, self-testing offers some promise in alleviating or eliminating these barriers. It provides individuals with the option of knowing their HIV status in the privacy of their homes and therefore has the potential to negate the effects of stigma, and reduce perceived discrimination. Although self-testing has the potential to help increase the numbers of individuals aware of their HIV sero-status, this strategy has been beset with concerns and challenges about its success <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Richter1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Walensky1">[8]</xref>. This is also partly attributed to a lack of evidence on self-testing behaviors, and effective linkage initiation to treatment and counselling after self-testing. To our knowledge, only one published narrative review has evaluated the potential role of self-testing in health care worker populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Mavedzenge1">[2]</xref>. A related meta-analysis compared the diagnostic accuracy of oral versus finger-stick antibody POC tests to demonstrate that oral POC tests could play a role in future self-testing initiatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-PantPai1">[9]</xref>. Another systematic review on home-based rapid testing initiatives where people are encouraged to get tested and counselled by health care workers in home visits (thus different from self-testing) alluded to the potential of offering self-testing to individuals in resource constrained settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Sabapathy1">[10]</xref>. With a view to fill a knowledge gap in understanding supervised and unsupervised self-testing strategies that are being evaluated globally, and to guide their effective implementation in high-income and resource constrained settings, we performed a systematic review.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the current evidence on two common strategies: (a) supervised and (b) unsupervised self-testing strategies in high- and low-risk populations worldwide. A supervised strategy (self-testing and counselling processes) was always aided by a health care professional (HCP). An unsupervised strategy was performed by a self-tester without any help, but with counselling and linkage to care offered off-site (e.g., over the phone) by a HCP. Our specific objectives included documentation of all outcomes from implementation research associated with self-testing and counselling strategies (acceptability, accuracy, feasibility, cost, and counselling preferences). Further, data on challenges, concerns, and barriers documented from qualitative research or mixed methods studies were also synthesized.</p>

        <title>Search Strategy and Identification of Studies</title>
        <p>For the period of January 1, 2000–October 30, 2012, we searched seven electronic databases (Medline [via PubMed], Biosis, PsycINFO, Cinahl, African Medicus, LILACS, and EMBASE) and abstracts from six major HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) conferences (Canadian Association of HIV Research [CAHR], International Society for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Research [ISSTDR], International AIDS Society [IAS], Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections [CROI], Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA], and the Inter Science Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy [ICAAC]). Additionally, we reviewed bibliographies and contacted the authors for original data. We included abstracts if full-texts were not available.</p>
        <p>Our search string (limited to humans) was: (1) “HIV”[MeSH] OR “HIV Seropositivity”[MeSH] OR “HIV Infections”[MeSH] AND (2) (“Self Care”[MeSH]) OR “Self Administration”[MeSH]) OR “Point-of-Care Systems”[MeSH] OR “self*test*” OR “rapid*test*.”</p>

        <p>Seven studies that evaluated supervised strategies documented errors in test performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-OraSure1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-CarballoDieguez1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Belza1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Gaydos1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Ng1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Spielberg5">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Choko1">[33]</xref>. Errors documented in general population in urban Malawi requested significantly more assistance from HCPs during self-testing with oral tests; errors were noted as a result of early removal of kit from the developer and spilling of the developer fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Choko1">[33]</xref>. Two studies from Singapore and Spain with finger-stick tests reported a high degree of errors, where 0.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 1/200) of participants obtained invalid self-test results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Ng1">[28]</xref> and about 1% (<italic>n</italic> = 2/208) of the finger-stick self-test results were found to be invalid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Belza1">[21]</xref>. In comparison, test conduct and performance errors noted with oral tests were: (i) collecting the oral mucosal sample, (ii) reading test instruction, and, (iii) interpreting test results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Gaydos1">[24]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the study that evaluated both strategies, a higher error rate (4.76%, <italic>n</italic> = 24/504) was observed in test performance and interpretation by populations who tested positive for HIV in a supervised setting compared to unscreened or low-risk populations in an unsupervised strategy (1.25%, <italic>n</italic> = 56/4,465) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-OraSure1">[13]</xref>. This difference was attributed to the fact that, being already aware of their sero-status, individuals testing positive for HIV that self-tested did not care to read the instructions carefully and subsequently made more errors than unscreened populations. Two studies from the US have demonstrated that an improvement in self-test instructions for test conduct and interpretation reduce the incidence of errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Lee2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Spielberg5">[32]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Overall in both strategies, a pattern of errors in self-test conduct was noted: (1) failing to place the oral test device in the developer solution after swabbing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Spielberg5">[32]</xref>, (2) removing the test kit from the developer solution too early <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Choko1">[33]</xref>, (3) spilling the developer fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-OraSure1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Ng1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Choko1">[33]</xref>, and lastly (4) dipping the test device in the developer solution before swabbing the gums <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-OraSure1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-CarballoDieguez1">[16]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We identified 21 studies that assessed supervised or unsupervised HIV self-testing strategies. The majority of the evidence from included studies was for supervised strategies from high-resource settings, although seven recent studies reported on an unsupervised strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Kalibala1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-OraSure1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Helm1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-CarballoDieguez2">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-delaFuente1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Katz1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Lee1">[26]</xref>. Included studies recorded a high score for acceptability (range: 74%–96%), preference over facility-based testing (range: 61%–91%), and partner self-testing (range: 80%–97%). Sensitivity and specificity for both unsupervised and supervised self-test strategies was high, but a lower sensitivity was reported for unsupervised (range: 92.9%–100%; one study) versus supervised (range: 97.4%–97.9%; three studies) strategies. Only one of the included studies reported on linkage to counselling and care where 96% (<italic>n</italic> = 102/106) of individuals who tested positive for HIV stated they would seek post-test counselling.</p>
      <p>While the evidence of high acceptability for supervised strategies is clear, it is not so for unsupervised strategies, especially in resource constrained settings. Only one study evaluated it, and the study focused on acceptability in a health literate population (HCPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Kalibala1">[12]</xref>. In terms of interpretation, self-testing has to be viewed as a process that requires a higher level of motivation and pro-activity compared to facility-based conventional testing. It involves a certain level of independence and assumes a basic level of literacy (typically grade 6 or high school) to ensure confidence in the self-test conduct and interpretation and enough personal involvement to seek post-test counselling and linkage to care and treatment. In addition to motivation, the conduct of a self test and its interpretation are key to its successful implementation. Additionally, demystifying the process of self-testing on television and social media will improve passive absorption, help de-stigmatize the HIV testing process, and promote the visibility of a self-testing strategy while providing information on HIV. Therefore, more research on exploring the best strategy (i.e., supervised versus unsupervised strategies) for different high- and low-risk populations in resource-constrained settings is clearly needed.</p>
      <p>Evidence for preference for self tests was evident for both supervised and unsupervised strategies, while mode and medium of preferences for counselling varied across settings, populations, and strategies. In terms of interpretation, qualitative research will help understand and tailor the preferred counselling option to high- and low-risk populations in diverse settings. Counselling strategies must be tailored to the literacy levels, lifestyle needs, and preferences, especially for populations living in resource constrained settings.</p>
      <p>For cost preferences, low-income populations in both high- and low-resource settings tended to prefer free self tests whereas higher income groups in both settings were willing to pay typically up to US$20. This finding implies that the price of a self-test kit will be an important factor in determining the uptake of self tests. Qualitative research will help guide the ranges of cost preference. This is crucial to policy initiatives for both strategies in both settings.</p>
      <p>Regarding findings on accuracy, while a consistently high specificity was noted for both strategies across all settings, a wide variability in sensitivity estimates was observed. Lower sensitivity was more prominent in studies that used the unsupervised self-testing strategy. Interestingly, lower estimates of sensitivity were also reported from high-prevalence settings, conducted by at-risk testers that were experienced with testing (including individuals who knew their sero-status) but generated more errors with the self test by not complying with instructions compared to individuals who did not know their sero-status. In contrast, naïve self-testers in low-risk settings seemed to follow instructions diligently resulting in high estimates of sensitivity. Although this process of passive absorption and priming to self-test instructions was present in supervised strategies in high-income settings where it resulted in fewer errors and highly accurate results, it was notably absent or weakly implemented in the unsupervised strategy. This finding highlights the importance of improving clarity of instructions to self-test. In terms of generalizability, adapting these instructions to contexts and populations with use of various media (pictorial and textual instructions, web, social media, or smartphone-based content in a user friendly format) and tailoring to languages and levels of literacy especially for low-resource settings will be essential.</p>
      <p>In terms of feasibility, none of the existing literature addressed issues related to seeking linkage to care (obtaining a CD4 count or having visited a clinic for ART initiation) and evidence from only one study reported that 96% (<italic>n</italic> = 102/106) of individuals who tested positive for HIV stated they would seek post-test counselling. Linkages could be better documented in the next phase of controlled studies.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in planning roll out of self-testing strategies, clarification of some concepts and limitations of the self tests to potential self-testers is necessary. These include presence of faint positive lines and their interpretation as a positive test result, and the limitation of antibody-based self tests to detect an HIV infection only after 90 d. With either strategy, occurrence of false negatives or indeterminate test outcomes cannot be eliminated with antibody-based oral or finger-stick self tests so repeat testing at 3-mo intervals should always be encouraged. At any time, calling or meeting a counsellor for clarification of test results must be emphasized.</p>
      <p>For poor and less literate populations who cannot afford self tests or cannot comprehend the process of testing, the supervised self-testing strategy may remain the best option. But this option requires a careful controlled evaluation in many sub-Saharan and Asian settings. Engagement of providers and stakeholders is a necessary first step before implementation of a self-testing strategy because treatment and staging must be available for newly diagnosed individuals with HIV. Efforts must be made to avoid loss to follow up.</p>
      <p>In under regulated and under funded health systems, it will be important to regulate the quality of self-test kits along with the process of self-testing. In contrast, in well-managed health systems in high-income countries (e.g., US, Canada, UK, Australia, Singapore, Japan) and populations with high socio-economic status in emerging economies and middle-income countries (China, South Africa, Russia, India, Brazil, Colombia), affordable OTC self tests sold at pharmacies or online should work well with linkages operationalized by counsellors via different mediums, such as over the phone, the Internet, or face-to-face at a clinic.</p>
      <p>Evidence of extreme adverse effects, for example suicide, and the potential for abuse of self tests was consistently absent. However, as such evidence is collected in well-controlled studies, such data from a real world context will be hard to document. Anecdotal evidence suggests that unregulated rapid tests are available in markets of African and Asian countries and that such abuse will happen regardless of the introduction of self tests. Nevertheless, safeguards introduced by public health systems could help minimize the problem. To reach preliminary self-testers, a 24/7 toll free number to reach counsellors in time, and the offer of an option of face-to-face counselling could help obviate the occurrence.</p>
      <p>In terms of new research, controlled clinical trials in different populations and settings with exploration of tailored and novel linkage modalities are urgently needed. This will generate the best evidence on offering an optimal and tailored strategy suited to the needs of different populations and settings. The impact of self-testing on detecting new cases of HIV in the community and changes in sexual behaviour of self-testers post-testing are yet to be assessed. Because data on prior HIV testing behaviour for unsupervised strategies were undocumented, new knowledge on whether self-testing reached new testers is unclear and therefore needed. Data on the impact of self-testing in increasing community engagement in screening, and on long term HIV outcomes remain limited. These data can be documented through community-based cluster RCTs or implementation research. However, it is hard to conduct such trials in communities when self tests are not approved for use in many countries and especially in health systems where linkage to counselling is not in place. Lastly, formative research that further explores individual motivations in using self tests, their fears, perceptions, and concerns, is needed. It will assist in tailoring self-testing to the needs and preferences of individuals and communities.</p>
      <p>In sum, self-testing offers an alternative for individuals who desire privacy and confidentiality to find out their sero-status, as well as for under-resourced health care systems and settings where stigma and discrimination may prevail. It offers the potential to bring more people to self-screen and proactively seek linkage to care and prevention, but its potential in optimizing linkages remains unproven. However, if optimized, self-testing could facilitate and motivate individuals who preliminarily tested positive for HIV to seek care and counselling. Furthermore, care seeking should not be left to the motivated self-tester, but facilitated through various means, including technological innovations. But in any such system, if any component of self-testing, linked counselling and initiation of care are poorly managed, then the self-testing strategy could cause more harm than good. At all times therefore, linking positive self-test results within an 8–24-h window period to post-test counselling followed up by CD4 count and ART initiation should continue to be emphasized.</p>

        <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
        <p>Approximately 70% of the included studies were cross-sectional in design. The majority of the data were primarily derived from implementation studies and from high-income settings (89%), only one of which was an RCT. Few studies were conducted in resource constrained countries, none of which were RCTs. Lack of data from resource constrained settings limited our comparisons of supervised versus unsupervised test strategies (one unsupervised study of HCPs in Kenya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Kalibala1">[12]</xref> and one supervised study of an urban population in Malawi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Choko1">[33]</xref>). Data on linkage to care was sparse with only one unsupervised self-testing study reporting linkage to care as an outcome. Selection and volunteer bias (self-selection of participants) within included studies cannot be ruled out. Publication and reporting bias are also likely. Errors in test interpretation were recorded in three studies. With these errors, a potential misclassification of false negative test results and misinterpretation of faint positive lines is probable; hence information bias (misclassification of test results) is also likely.</p>
        <p>The quality of reporting in included studies was generally poor. STARD and QUADAS checklists could not be used to assess quality because they are tailored for diagnostic accuracy, which was not the primary outcome in most studies. The use of observational study designs, data from pilot studies, with incomplete reporting of data items and lack of compliance with STROBE reporting criteria, were typical problems encountered in our quality assessment of the studies. A general lack of standardized reporting of outcomes beyond accuracy (patient centered outcome or implementation research outcomes) in the field of POC diagnostics has been noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001414-Balram1">[34]</xref>. It is therefore not surprising that these outcomes were heterogeneously and incompletely reported across many studies. The wide range of sources searched, the lack of language restrictions, and the evaluation of study quality are strengths of this review.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Privacy, anonymity, time-savings, and convenience facilitated a high acceptability and preference for both supervised and unsupervised self-testing strategies across diverse global settings. Included studies demonstrated that it was feasible to implement both supervised and unsupervised oral fluid-based self-testing strategies, despite variable accuracy estimates obtained by self-testers. However data on linkages to care were only reported by a single study of unsupervised self-testing. Self-testing can be an alternative option to facility-based testing for individuals who desire more privacy. However, controlled trials wherever possible, and implementation studies that document linkage to care, are warranted to confirm findings from observational studies. Although self-testing offers the potential to increase the number of individuals to self-screen for HIV and therefore deliver more people to care, systems that can maintain confidentiality and operationalize linkage to care within a reasonable time frame are pertinent to its success. More data from diverse settings are needed to inform global scale-up and policy recommendations for HIV self tests.</p>
