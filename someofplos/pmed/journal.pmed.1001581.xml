<title>Background</title>
<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) and termination of pregnancy (TOP) are global health concerns, but their interaction is undetermined. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between IPV and TOP.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>A systematic review based on a search of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Ovid Maternity and Infant Care from each database's inception to 21 September 2013 for peer-reviewed articles of any design and language found 74 studies regarding women who had undergone TOP and had experienced at least one domain (physical, sexual, or emotional) of IPV. Prevalence of IPV and association between IPV and TOP were meta-analysed. Sample sizes ranged from eight to 33,385 participants. Worldwide, rates of IPV in the preceding year in women undergoing TOP ranged from 2.5% to 30%. Lifetime prevalence by meta-analysis was shown to be 24.9% (95% CI 19.9% to 30.6%); heterogeneity was high (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;90%), and variation was not explained by study design, quality, or size, or country gross national income per capita. IPV, including history of rape, sexual assault, contraceptive sabotage, and coerced decision-making, was associated with TOP, and with repeat TOPs. By meta-analysis, partner not knowing about the TOP was shown to be significantly associated with IPV (pooled odds ratio 2.97, 95% CI 2.39 to 3.69). Women in violent relationships were more likely to have concealed the TOP from their partner than those who were not. Demographic factors including age, ethnicity, education, marital status, income, employment, and drug and alcohol use showed no strong or consistent mediating effect. Few long-term outcomes were studied. Women welcomed the opportunity to disclose IPV and be offered help. Limitations include study heterogeneity, potential underreporting of both IPV and TOP in primary data sources, and inherent difficulties in validation.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>IPV is associated with TOP. Novel public health approaches are required to prevent IPV. TOP services provide an opportune health-based setting to design and test interventions.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Intimate partner violence (sometimes referred to as domestic violence) is one of the commonest forms of violence against women and is a global health problem. The World Health Organization defines intimate partner violence as any act of physical, psychological, or sexual aggression or any controlling behavior (for example, restriction of access to assistance) perpetrated by the woman's current or past intimate partner. Although men also experience it, intimate partner violence is overwhelmingly experienced by women, particularly when repeated or severe. Studies indicate that the prevalence (the percentage of a population affected by a condition) of intimate partner violence varies widely within and between countries: the prevalence of intimate partner violence among women ranges from 15% in Japan to 71% in Ethiopia, and the lifetime prevalence of rape (forced sex) within intimate relationships ranges from 5.9% to 42% across the world, for example. Overall, a third of women experience intimate partner violence at some time during their lifetimes. The health consequences of such violence include physical injury, depression, suicidal behavior, and gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
<p>Intimate partner violence can also lead to gynecological disorders (conditions affecting the female reproductive organs), unwanted pregnancy, premature labour and birth, and sexually transmitted infections. Because violence may begin or intensify during pregnancy, some countries recommend routine questioning about intimate partner violence during antenatal care. However, women seeking termination of pregnancy (induced abortion) are not routinely asked about intimate partner violence. Every year, many women worldwide terminate a pregnancy. Nearly half of these terminations are unsafe, and complications arising from unsafe abortions are responsible for more than 10% of maternal deaths (deaths from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications). It is important to know whether intimate partner violence and termination of pregnancy are associated in order to develop effective strategies to deal with both these global health concerns. Here, the researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the associations between intimate partner violence and termination or pregnancy. A systematic review identifies all the research on a given topic using predefined criteria; meta-analysis combines the results of several studies.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
<p>The researchers identified 74 studies that provided information about experiences of intimate partner violence among women who had had a termination of pregnancy. Data in these studies indicated that, worldwide, intimate partner violence rates among women undergoing termination ranged from 2.5% to 30% in the preceding year and from 14% to 40% over their lifetime. In the meta-analysis, the lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence was 24.9% among termination-seeking populations. The identified studies provided evidence that intimate partner violence was associated with termination and with repeat termination. In one study, for example, women presenting for a third termination were more than two and a half times more likely to have a history of physical or sexual violence than women presenting for their first termination. Moreover, according to the meta-analysis, women in violent relationships were three times as likely to conceal a termination from their partner as women in non-violent relationships. Finally, the studies indicated that women undergoing terminations of pregnancy welcomed the opportunity to disclose their experiences of intimate partner violence and to be offered help.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
<p>These findings indicate that intimate partner violence is associated with termination of pregnancy and that a woman's partner not knowing about the termination is a risk factor for intimate partner violence among women seeking termination. Overall, the researchers' findings support the concept that violence can lead to pregnancy and to subsequent termination of pregnancy, and that there may be a repetitive cycle of abuse and pregnancy. The accuracy of these findings is limited by heterogeneity (variability) among the included studies, by the likelihood of underreporting of both intimate partner violence and termination in the included studies, and by lack of validation of reports of violence through, for example, police reports. Nevertheless, health-care professionals should consider the possibility that women seeking termination of pregnancy may be experiencing intimate partner violence. In trying to prevent repeat terminations, health-care professionals should be aware that while focusing on preventing conception may reduce the chances of a woman becoming pregnant, she may still be vulnerable to abuse. Finally, given the clear associations between intimate partner violence and termination of pregnancy, the researchers suggest that termination services represent an appropriate setting in which to test interventions designed to reduce intimate partner violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as âbehaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including acts of physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behavioursâ encompassing both current and past intimate partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-World1">[1]</xref>. Estimated prevalence varies globally and within countries, and is partly dependent on definition and methodology; lifetime exposure has been found to range from 15% in Japan to 71% in Ethiopia (estimated by WHO multi-country studies), has been estimated at 24% in the UK based on UK Home Office crime statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-UK1">[2]</xref>, and has been estimated to be around 35% (inclusive of stalking) in the US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Black1">[3]</xref>. Rape within intimate relationships has been reported to be common across a number of continents, with lifetime prevalence of forced sex ranging from 5.9% to 42% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Krug1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Health consequences of IPV are known to include, but not be limited to, increased physical injuries and gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and psychiatric co-morbidities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Krug1">[4]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Howard1">[7]</xref>. Violence may begin or intensify during pregnancy and is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Silverman1">[8]</xref> and maternal death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Lewis1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Cantwell1">[10]</xref>. Increased homicide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Campbell1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Abrahams1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Stckl1">[12]</xref> and suicide are found among individuals experiencing IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Campbell1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Devries2">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Randomised trial evidence has shown that training primary care professionals in selective questioning of women about IPV increases disclosure and referral to specialist IPV services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Feder1">[14]</xref>. Antenatal routine questioning for IPV is recommended in both the US and UK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-UK2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-1">[16]</xref>, despite uncertainty over the harms and benefits of universal questioning and subsequent intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Ramsay1">[17]</xref>. Ongoing pregnancy is considered to be a time of increased risk of IPV, yet women seeking termination of pregnancy (TOP) are not such a focus of attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Aston1">[18]</xref>. An evidence-based understanding of the association between IPV and TOP would directly inform the development of strategies for effective interventions for IPV. To our knowledge there has been no previous systematic review of the literature.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between IPV and TOP.</p>

<title>Selection Criteria</title>
<p>Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they (1) included women who were seeking or had undergone a TOP and studied at least one aspect of IPV in this group; (2) were a randomised control trial, case-control study, cohort study, cross-sectional analysis, experimental study, or secondary study with data of interest; and (3) were peer reviewed. Studies focusing on violence by individuals other than current or former intimate partners were excluded. No restrictions were placed on the setting, time, or language of the studies. Quantitative data were not necessary for inclusion.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Search Strategy</title>
<p>The population of interest was women seeking or having undergone a TOP in any setting; the exposure was the presence or absence of IPV; the control group, where reported, was a separate cohort of comparable individuals (e.g., pregnant women not seeking TOP, pregnant women not reporting IPV, or women attending a gynaecology clinic); the statistic of interest was the association between IPV and TOP. We included articles where the relative timing of IPV and TOP could not be delineated. The search strategy was devised using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) and free text terms with synonyms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001581-t001">Table 1</xref>). Searches were carried out in Medline (1946â21 September 2013), Embase (1980â21 September 2013), PsycINFO (1806â21 September 2013), and Ovid Maternity and Infant Care (1971â21 September 2013) from the earliest possible date until 21 September 2013. In addition, a search of Web of Science and hand searches of reference lists of all included articles were carried out. Nine authors were contacted regarding results, and they identified further articles. There was no restriction on language. If multiple articles based on the same study were identified, duplication was avoided by only using the data reported for different sub-groups.</p>

<title>Data Extraction</title>
<p>All titles were independently screened by two authors (M. H. and S. B.). If either considered a title relevant, both reviewers independently screened the abstract. All articles were included for full-text assessment if either author considered the abstract relevant or there was uncertainty. Full-text assessment to determine inclusion was independently carried out by two authors (M. H. and S. B.). Any disagreements were discussed, and any study whose inclusion remained ambivalent was referred to a third author (L. C. C.).</p>
<p>A standard form was devised (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001581.s001">Table S1</xref>) prior to data extraction and quality scoring. Data were extracted on study type; population; setting, country, and region; demographic and health factors; intervention; comparator population; definition of IPV; screening tools used; and incidence and prevalence of IPV among general populations and in relation to TOP. Data from the articles were independently extracted by two authors (M. H. and B. L. P.). Results addressing violence by individuals other than current or previous intimate partners were excluded. Any uncertainties were discussed, and referred to a third author (L. C. C.) if necessary. Data extraction and quality scoring of articles published in languages other than English (<italic>n</italic>â=â3) were undertaken by one author (M. H.) and the translator.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Quality Appraisal</title>

Two authors (M. H. and B. L. P.) carried out full quality appraisal of all articles. Any disagreements were discussed, and referred to a third author (L. C. C.) if necessary. Quantitative CASP scores of â¥25, â¥20, â¥15, and â¤14 and qualitative CASP scores of â¥17, â¥14, â¥12, and â¤11 were considered high, medium, low, and very low quality, respectively.</p>

Comparisons between groups used odds ratios (ORs). Estimated heterogeneity (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup>) is displayed for all group and sub-group analyses. We investigated the possibility of a sub-group of recent or high-quality studies with consistent methods and consistent results that could be used to give generally applicable results.</p>
<p>Meta-analysis regression is a meta-analysis technique developed specifically to explain large and unexplained differences in results between studies (also known as heterogeneity). The method used assumes that the differences are in part random and in part explainable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Knapp1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using meta-analysis regression: country's GNI per capita (in intervals of INT$10,000), study quality (measured by CASP score), date of study (decade), study design (cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control), setting (urban versus regional versus national), and study size (total number of participants as a continuous variable). Egger's test was performed in order to assess potential publication bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Egger1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The review was performed according to protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001581.s007">Text S1</xref>) and in line with PRISMA guidelines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001581.s004">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Key Features of Studies</title>
<p>The publication dates of the studies ranged from 1985 to 2013, with the majority (67/74, 91%) having been reported since 2000. Sixty-eight studies included quantitative data, with six being exclusively qualitative. The majority of quantitative studies were cross-sectional (57), with the remaining being cohort (three) and case-control (eight, of which five used a pregnant and three used a non-pregnant comparator group). Geographically, the study locations spanned six continents: North America (35), Asia (12), Europe (10), Africa (8), Australasia (6), and South America (2), with one further study analysing data from several continents. Women were asked about IPV in a variety of settings, including home, gynaecology wards, termination clinics, and other specialist medical clinics, and in various ways, including telephone or written questionnaire and national scale surveys. Among the quantitative studies there were 10 high, 31 medium, 19 low, and eight very low quality reports (mean score 20.2, standard deviation 4.0). Of the qualitative studies two were medium, one low, and three very low quality (mean score 11.5, standard deviation 2.2). The majority of studies analysed exclusively women (69), with few analysing exclusively men (two) or both men and women (three). Sample sizes ranged from eight to 33,385 participants (eight, 30, and 36 studies had &lt;100, 100â999, and â¥1,000 participants, respectively; median number of participants 942, interquartile range 208 to 2,391). The exposures included physical violence (53), sexual violence (47), and emotional violence (19), with many articles looking at combinations (42). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001581.s005">Table S5</xref> shows the associations of clinical and demographic factors with IPV in women seeking TOP.</p>

<title>Summary of Main Findings</title>
<p>The literature is extensive, but variable in quality, and largely focused on female factors. High rates of physical, sexual, and emotional IPV were found across six continents among women seeking a TOP. According to meta-analysis, partner not knowing about the TOP was associated with IPV among women seeking TOP. However, lack of partner support for TOP is not associated with IPV among women seeking TOP. The literature also suggests that women in abusive relationships were more likely to report inability to make autonomous contraceptive choices, partner contraceptive sabotage, and sexual violence, and they were less likely to have informed their partner about the pregnancy or involved him in decision-making about it. IPV was cited as a reason for wanting TOP, and rape-related pregnancy had a particularly high chance of leading to TOP. The meta-analysis did not find that multiple TOPs were associated with IPV, but its credibility is undermined by both the number of studies that did (albeit unquantified) and the association reported by men who stated they had been perpetrators of IPV. Although it was not always determined whether experiencing IPV was a determining factor in the decision to end, rather than continue, a pregnancy, the findings support the concept that violence can sometimes lead to an initial pregnancy (via coercion, rape, sexual assault, or contraceptive sabotage) and to a subsequent TOP (via coercion). There was a lack of data regarding long-term outcomes for women in violent relationships who underwent TOP, but associations with repeat TOP (and possibly miscarriage) lend support to the notion of a repetitive cycle of abuse and pregnancy. Not informing the male partner may then be explicable as a reason to avoid partner involvement or further abuse.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Strengths of the review and meta-analysis include use of multiple databases, no language restriction, hand searching of reference lists, double data entry, and quality assessment of both quantitative and qualitative studies from a wide variety of settings, thus improving reliability and generalisability. Limitations include unexplained large differences in both prevalences and odds ratios between studies (heterogeneity), likelihood of underreporting of both IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Jewkes1">[99]</xref> and TOP (particularly when both are stigmatised) in the primary data sources, and inherent difficulties in validation. There is potential publication bias towards research showing a positive relationship. The meta-analysis may be biased, as only those studies quantitatively reporting a significant result could be included, whilst those stating an association (without providing data for inclusion) had to be excluded. It was not possible to determine the legality of, or access to, TOP for each country or state at the specific time point of study; thus, the analysis has not included evaluation of such barriers. It was not possible to determine temporal relationships and patterns of abuse, pregnancy, and TOP.</p>
</sec><sec id="s5c">
<title>Comparison with Other Studies</title>
<p>Only one review has previously examined the association between IPV and TOP within a study of broader sexual health issues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Coker1">[100]</xref>, concluding that TOP and repeat TOP were associated with IPV, but without reporting on other associations. The review was single-authored, lacked systematic analysis, and included only eight studies. Other relevant systematic reviews and observational studies on IPV have included women with ongoing pregnancies, women with pregnancy loss, or all women of reproductive age, noting poorer mental, physical, and pregnancy outcomes for the women experiencing IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Ellsberg1">[101]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Trevillion1">[104]</xref>. One review found an association between presence of depressive or anxiety disorders in women and increased likelihood of IPV compared to women without mental disorders, but the direction of causality could not be determined, as few studies were longitudinal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Trevillion1">[104]</xref>. IPV was also associated with physical injury: presentation to hospital accident and emergency departments with unwitnessed head, neck, or facial injuries was a significant marker for IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Wu2">[103]</xref>. A large observational study conducted by WHO found that women who reported a history of partner violence were more likely to report physical and mental health problems including emotional distress and suicidal thoughts, as well as difficulties with activities of daily living <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Ellsberg1">[101]</xref>. Comparison groups that might prove useful would be women with ongoing but unplanned pregnancy (no specific studies available) and women with ongoing wanted pregnancy. In ongoing pregnancies, IPV was associated with 1.5-fold increased risks of low birth weight and preterm birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Shah2">[102]</xref>. A large observational study has reported poorer maternal outcomes, including hypertension, renal and urinary tract infection, and vaginal bleeding, with IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Silverman1">[8]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s5d">
<title>Implications and Clinical Relevance</title>
<p>Health-care professionals should be aware of the high rates of physical, sexual, and emotional violence among women seeking TOP, and particularly the clinical factors associated with greatest risk: previous TOP, lack of contraception, initially planned pregnancy, ultrasound redating, and the partner not funding or not being told about the TOP. There are potential associations for IPV with young age, marital status, ethnicity, and low household income. IPV compromises both the safety and health of the woman requesting the TOP, and potentially that of her partner and any existing children if a woman retaliates or children witness or experience the violence directly. In attempting to prevent repeat TOP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Department1">[105]</xref>, a narrow focus, especially on long-acting contraception, that excludes addressing the wider needs of a woman in a violent relationship might leave a woman less likely to become pregnant but just as vulnerable to IPV. Good practice obligates that termination services should have robust policies for ensuring women's safety and confidentiality, providing information and referral pathways for those who disclose IPV, and exemplar guidance exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Some groups have evaluated whether screening for IPV is justified in selected populations of women. Theoretically, early identification and effective intervention for violence may reduce repeat unintended pregnancy and TOP, as well as improve longer term health outcomes. Three systematic reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-OReilly1">[106]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Nelson1">[108]</xref> have concluded that screening is warranted, leading the US Preventative Task Force to recommend that clinicians should screen women of childbearing age for interpersonal violence, such as IPV, and refer women who screen positive to intervention services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Moyer1">[109]</xref>. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is currently undertaking a consultation regarding guidance on identification and prevention of IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-National1">[110]</xref>. However, interventions in this area are inherently complex and difficult to research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Lee1">[111]</xref>, and evidence for the effectiveness of counselling intervention programmes or other interventions remains limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-OReilly1">[106]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Ramsay2">[112]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Jahanfar1">[113]</xref>. Of all approaches evaluated, intensive advocacy (aiming to provide women with information and support to facilitate access to community resources) appears the most promising in reducing physical abuse 1â2 y after the intervention, but impact on quality of life or mental health is not proven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Ramsay2">[112]</xref>. The majority of interventions studied have focused on the female experiencing IPV, but some have undertaken theoretical analysis of models in which changes in the behaviours of the male perpetrators are included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Cismaru1">[114]</xref>. A comparative study of promising health-based IPV interventions in primary care and maternity services across Europe found that key implementation issues of IPV interventions included clinical champions, leadership roles, funded and coordinated multiagency partnerships with clear referral pathways, multidisciplinary and participant feedback, and evaluation of outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Bacchus1">[115]</xref>. Interventions as part of the pathway for women seeking TOP require further consideration.</p>
</sec><sec id="s5e">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>No study we found set out to examine the association or temporal relationships between IPV and TOP, which would require (at a minimum) including women with and without an IPV history and with and without a history of TOP. There is extremely limited information about male partners of women seeking TOP, as perpetrators or as experiencing IPV, and which male-related factors contribute to increased likelihood of IPV. Greater information is required on long-term outcomes of violence and TOP on both partners. The findings of pregnancy âconcealmentâ and higher rates of murder and suicide with IPV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Granja1">[116]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Gissler1">[117]</xref> mean that researchers must be cautious and aware of women's safety. Harms have been identified following health-based IPV interventions, such as breaches of confidentiality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Bacchus1">[115]</xref>. Therefore, a public health approach that does not focus solely on the woman (either as âproblemâ or âsolutionâ) or health services should be considered, for example, using educational, social norm, and/or criminal justice interventions. Nevertheless, given the clear associations, termination services provide an appropriate setting in which to assess screening for, or give information about, IPV, whether pre- or post-TOP, and for offering an intervention that women desire, such as a âone stopâ offer of referral to specialist IPV services, especially in view of low return to clinics for follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Grossman1">[118]</xref>. Given that routine identification of women experiencing IPV and provision of a standard intervention has recently been shown to have no impact on quality of life or mental well-being, there is now a need for considering new strategies, including alternative intervention models and targeting perpetrators as well as the women affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-Hegarty1">[119]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001581-World2">[121]</xref>. On the basis of this review, research into the suitability, acceptability, and design of an intervention programme is justified, and should be tested preferably in a randomised control trial. Any legal barriers to intervention and reporting, such as criminalisation of TOP, should also be investigated and described.</p>
</sec><sec id="s5f">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>IPV is associated with TOP. Novel public health approaches are required to address IPV against women and repeat TOP. Termination services provide an opportune health-based setting in which to design and test interventions at the individual level.</p>
