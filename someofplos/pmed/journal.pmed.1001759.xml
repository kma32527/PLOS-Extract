<abstract><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Development of noninvasive molecular assays to improve disease diagnosis and patient monitoring is a critical need. In renal transplantation, acute rejection (AR) increases the risk for chronic graft injury and failure. Noninvasive diagnostic assays to improve current late and nonspecific diagnosis of rejection are needed. We sought to develop a test using a simple blood gene expression assay to detect patients at high risk for AR.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>We developed a novel correlation-based algorithm by step-wise analysis of gene expression data in 558 blood samples from 436 renal transplant patients collected across eight transplant centers in the US, Mexico, and Spain between 5 February 2005 and 15 December 2012 in the Assessment of Acute Rejection in Renal Transplantation (AART) study. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) in one center. A 17-gene set—the Kidney Solid Organ Response Test (kSORT)—was selected in 143 samples for AR classification using discriminant analysis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.94; 95% CI 0.91–0.98), validated in 124 independent samples (AUC = 0.95; 95% CI 0.88–1.0) and evaluated for AR prediction in 191 serial samples, where it predicted AR up to 3 mo prior to detection by the current gold standard (biopsy). A novel reference-based algorithm (using 13 12-gene models) was developed in 100 independent samples to provide a numerical AR risk score, to classify patients as high risk versus low risk for AR. kSORT was able to detect AR in blood independent of age, time post-transplantation, and sample source without additional data normalization; AUC = 0.93 (95% CI 0.86–0.99). Further validation of kSORT is planned in prospective clinical observational and interventional trials.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Throughout life, the kidneys filter waste products (from the normal breakdown of tissues and food) and excess water from the blood to make urine. If the kidneys stop working for any reason, the rate at which the blood is filtered decreases, and dangerous amounts of creatinine and other waste products build up in the blood. The kidneys can fail suddenly (acute kidney failure) because of injury or poisoning, but usually failing kidneys stop working gradually over many years (chronic kidney disease). Chronic kidney disease is very common, especially in people who have high blood pressure or diabetes and in elderly people. In the UK, for example, about 20% of people aged 65–74 years have some degree of chronic kidney disease. People whose kidneys fail completely (end-stage kidney disease) need regular dialysis (hemodialysis, in which blood is filtered by an external machine, or peritoneal dialysis, which uses blood vessels in the abdominal lining to do the work of the kidneys) or a renal transplant (the surgical transfer of a healthy kidney from another person into the patient's body) to keep them alive.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
<p>Our immune system protects us from pathogens (disease-causing organisms) by recognizing specific molecules (antigens) on the invader's surface as foreign and initiating a sequence of events that kills the invader. Unfortunately, the immune system sometimes recognizes kidney transplants as foreign and triggers transplant rejection. The chances of rejection can be minimized by “matching” the antigens on the donated kidney to those on the tissues of the kidney recipient and by giving the recipient immunosuppressive drugs. However, acute rejection (rejection during the first year after transplantation) affects about 20% of kidney transplants. Acute rejection needs to be detected quickly and treated with a short course of more powerful immunosuppressants because it increases the risk of transplant failure. The current “gold standard” method for detecting acute rejection if the level of creatinine in the patient's blood begins to rise is to surgically remove a small piece (biopsy) of the transplanted kidney for analysis. However, other conditions can change creatinine levels, acute rejection can occur without creatinine levels changing (subclinical acute rejection), and biopsies are invasive. Here, the researchers develop a noninvasive test for acute kidney rejection called the Kidney Solid Organ Response Test (kSORT) based on gene expression levels in the blood.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
<p>For the Assessment of Acute Rejection in Renal Transplantation (AART) study, the researchers used an assay called quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to measure the expression of 43 genes whose expression levels change during acute kidney rejection in blood samples collected from patients who had had a kidney transplant. Using a training set of 143 samples and statistical analyses, the researchers identified a 17-gene set (kSORT) that discriminated between patients with and without acute rejection detected by kidney biopsy. The 17-gene set correctly identified 39 of the samples taken from 47 patients with acute rejection as being from patients with acute rejection, and 87 of 96 samples from patients without acute rejection as being from patients without acute rejection. The researchers validated the gene set using 124 independent samples. Then, using 191 serial samples, they showed that the gene set was able to predict acute rejection up to three months before detection by biopsy. Finally, the researchers used 100 blood samples to develop an algorithm (a step-wise calculation) to classify patients as being at high or low risk of acute rejection.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
<p>These findings describe the early development of a noninvasive tool (kSORT) that might, eventually, help clinicians identify patients at risk of acute rejection after kidney transplantation. kSORT needs to be tested in more patients before being used clinically, however, to validate its predictive ability, particularly given that the current gold standard test against which it was compared (biopsy) is far from perfect. An additional limitation of kSORT is that it did not discriminate between cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune rejection. These two types of immune rejection are treated in different ways, so clinicians ideally need a test for acute rejection that indicates which form of immune rejection is involved. The authors are conducting a follow-up study to help determine whether kSORT can be used in clinical practice to identify acute rejection and to identify which patients are at greatest risk of transplant rejection and may require biopsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the application of high-throughput discovery methods for improved detection of disease-specific biomarkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sarwal1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li2">[4]</xref>, there is ambiguity about the path to developing a clinically applicable molecular assay with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity, such that it can be used in practice for disease diagnosis and patient care management. In kidney transplantation, acute rejection (AR) occurs in about 15%–20% of patients using the current standard of care for immunosuppression and is detected by an invasive biopsy following a drift in the patient's serum creatinine, the current peripheral marker for graft injury. However, a drift in serum creatinine is nonspecific for AR and occurs only after substantive graft damage. In addition, in a number of patients, AR occurs subclinically, without a drift in serum creatinine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Naesens1">[5]</xref>, and thus these AR cases remain largely undetected until extensive graft damage develops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Moreso1">[6]</xref>. Both AR and subclinical AR represent major risk factors for developing chronic graft injury and graft loss, which not only require cost-intensive patient care (with dialysis costs of up to US$100,000/year per person in the US) but also reduce the quality of life of patients. Some transplant programs perform protocol biopsies as a means of frequent graft monitoring, but thereby increase the risk of unnecessary invasive procedures in patients who do not have AR, and add to the financial burden of insurance payers. Furthermore, biopsy histology is subject to sampling error <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Furness1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Furness2">[8]</xref> and is not predictive of AR. The development of a sensitive, specific, and noninvasive test for the risk of AR is therefore a critical and currently unmet need in transplantation. In the present study we developed a simple blood quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) test called the Kidney Solid Organ Response Test (kSORT) to predict AR, improve risk stratification assessment in transplantation, and provide relevant information for immunosuppression decision-making <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Naesens2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Roedder1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The Assessment of Acute Rejection in Renal Transplantation (AART) study was designed in a collaborative effort in eight renal transplant centers in the United States, Mexico, and Spain, and utilized 558 peripheral blood (PB) samples from 436 adult and pediatric renal transplant patients for developing a simple blood QPCR test for AR diagnosis and prediction in recipients of diverse ages, on diverse immunosuppression, and subject to transplant-center-specific protocols. Patients &lt;20 y of age were included in the pediatric cohort, and patients ≥20 y were included in the adult cohort. The mean age in the pediatric dataset was 13.20 y±4.76 y, and the mean age in the adult dataset was 47.43 y±14.59 y. Blood samples were collected from transplant recipients cross-sectionally during clinical follow-up visits and were matched with a contemporaneous kidney allograft biopsy between 2005 and 2012. Centers that participated in the AART study were Stanford University, Stanford, California (Stanford; <italic>n</italic> = 162 pediatric samples); Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez Laboratorio de Investigacion en Nefrologia, Mexico City, Mexico (Mex; <italic>n</italic> = 23 pediatric samples); Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia (Emory; <italic>n</italic> = 43 adult samples); University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California (UCLA; <italic>n</italic> = 105 adult samples); University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (UPMC, <italic>n</italic> = 132 adult samples); California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, California (CPMC; <italic>n</italic> = 37 adult samples); University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California (UCSF; <italic>n</italic> = 40 adult samples); and Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain (Barcelona; <italic>n</italic> = 16 samples). Samples were split into a training set of 143 AR and No-AR adult samples collected in non-clinical-trial settings in four centers (AART143 cohort) for gene selection and model training; a first validation set of 124 independent AR and No-AR adult (≥20 y) and pediatric (&lt;20 y) samples (AART124 cohort) collected by each participating center, for validation of selected genes for AR detection across ages, centers, and settings; and a second prospective validation set of 191 adult and pediatric samples serially collected up to 6 mo prior to and after a rejection biopsy (AART191 cohort) for evaluation of AR prediction. Blood samples from these three cohorts were simultaneously measured on the microfluidic high-throughput BioMark QPCR platform (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Livak1">[12]</xref> for a total of 43 genes. The final kSORT assay of 17 genes for noninvasive detection of AR was locked in a third validation set of 100 adult and pediatric samples (AART100 cohort) on the Applied Biosystems (ABI; Foster City, CA) QPCR platform with the development of a novel algorithm (kSORT analysis suite [kSAS]). 21 patients in the AART143 cohort contributed samples to the AART100 cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001759-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001759-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001759.s007">S2</xref>).

<title>AART study design in 436 unique adult/pediatric renal transplant patients from eight transplant centers.</title>
<p>558 PB samples from 436 adult and pediatric renal transplant patients collected from eight independent transplantation centers in the US, Spain, and Mexico were assessed. Emory, UCLA, UPMC, CPMC, UCSF, and Barcelona contributed adult samples, Mexico and Stanford, pediatric samples.

<title>Patient and Sample Information</title>
<p>All adult patients included in this study were enrolled in the regular transplant program at each center. Pediatric patients were those participating in an investigator-initiated clinical trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sarwal2">[13]</xref> who also gave written informed consent to participate in this study. Patients did not undergo additional study-specific procedures, and no adverse events were reported. Each PB sample analyzed in this study was paired with a contemporaneous renal allograft biopsy (within 48 h) from the same patient, in all cases of AR (<italic>n</italic> = 188) and all cases of No-AR (<italic>n</italic> = 370), with the exception of 12 samples collected before or after a rejection and 13 samples from clinically stable patients (stable defined as absence of a drift in serum creatinine &gt;20% of baseline, no donor-specific antibodies [DSA] and no rejection within 3 mo post-transplantation). Blood samples collected at the time of clinically indicated biopsies (drift in serum creatinine &gt;20% of baseline) were included in the analyses if obtained prior to any immunosuppression treatment intensification. Blood samples collected at the point of protocol biopsies were obtained from all pediatric patients at engraftment; at 3, 6, 12 and 24 mo post-transplantation; and additionally at the times of clinically suspected graft dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref>. In the adult cohort the majority of patients had clinically indicated biopsies only for allograft dysfunction; protocol biopsies in the adult cohort were obtained from patients enrolled in Barcelona (<italic>n</italic> = 16) at 6 mo post-transplantation. Multiple PB–biopsy pairs from the same patient were utilized as long as each biopsy had a conclusive phenotypic diagnosis. Each biopsy was scored by the center pathologist at each enrolling clinical site using the latest Banff classification criteria for renal allograft pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sis1">[14]</xref>. The blood–biopsy pairs were categorized as AR (<italic>n</italic> = 188) or No-AR (<italic>n</italic> = 370). AR included both cellular and humoral types and was defined as presence of (1) acute interstitial and tubular Banff scores ≥1 or (2) lesions in the glomeruli and peritubular capillary compartments paired with diffuse positive C4d staining at peritubular capillaries (humoral AR). No-AR was defined as an absence of any histological evidence of AR. In the No-AR group, there were 40 samples that either met the Banff criteria for chronic allograft injury (samples displaying interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy scores ≥1; <italic>n</italic> = 3) or exhibited chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity (<italic>n</italic> = 6), BK polyomavirus (BKV) infection (<italic>n</italic> = 4), or other graft injury such as acute tubular nephritis (<italic>n</italic> = 27). While 19 cases met the criteria of humoral rejection, the remaining AR biopsies were considered cell-mediated rejection or mixed rejection if they had absent C4d staining but detectable DSA. Samples included in the AART study were collected between 5 February 2005 and 15 December 2012.</p>

<title>Selection of 43 genes for AR screening</title>
<p>The 43-rejection-gene set represents a combination of significant genes in acute renal allograft rejection identified by whole genome microarray analysis of biopsy and paired blood samples transcriptionally profiled from patients with and without biopsy-confirmed AR.

<title>Selection of 17 genes for kSORT in Fluidigm QPCR data</title>
<p>First, we evaluated the differential expression of ten out of 43 genes, selecting the same ten genes (<italic>CFLAR, DUSP1, IFNGR1, ITGAX, MAPK9, NAMPT, NKTR, PSEN1, RNF130, RYBP</italic>) that have been validated as diagnostic for AR in PB using standardized clinical trial sample collection and processing protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref>. The validation of the excellent discriminatory potential of these genes for biopsy-confirmed AR was conducted in a multicenter, US, randomized prospective clinical trial (SNSO1), supported by the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in which a minimum set of different combinations of five of the ten genes were sufficient to detect AR in the graft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Naesens1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sarwal2">[13]</xref>.

To improve the diagnostic accuracy for AR in the 143 adult samples, various statistical modeling methods were used to include an additional seven genes (<italic>CEACAM4, EPOR, GZMK, RARA, RHEB, RXRA, SLC25A3</italic>7), which improved the accuracy of the gene panel for discriminating AR from No-AR samples, for a final selection of 17 genes. These 17 genes were then validated for their discriminatory performance in an independent cohort of both adult and pediatric biopsy-matched blood samples (AART124) collected by non-standardized non-clinical-trial methods as well as by standardized clinical trial methods. The statistical methods used for selection of the 17 genes included <italic>t</italic>-test statistics with the Bonferroni post-correction or the <italic>q</italic>-value method to control the false discovery rate (for differential gene expression analysis between AR and No-AR); penalized logistic regression with the lasso and elastic net regularization paths (to define genes with the highest predictive power for AR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Friedman1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Zhu1">[21]</xref>; regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent for estimations for penalized logistic regression, available through the R package glmnet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Friedman1">[20]</xref>; and partial least squares discriminant analysis (plsDA) (for gene selection with discriminant analyses and equal prior probability for classification) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Cho1">[22]</xref>, available through Partek Genomics Suite version 6.6.

<title>kSORT and kSAS development on ABI Viia7 data for prospective analysis of acute rejection</title>
<p>Given the underlying heterogeneity of the AART study samples, due to differences in sample handling and co-morbidities in the adult population versus the pediatric cohort, and to avoid the step of initial data normalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Thomas1">[24]</xref>, a new correlation-based algorithm named kSAS was developed to allow for robust and easier classification of AR. kSAS was developed to apply fixed AR and No-AR QPCR reference profiles across the 17-gene panel to allow for accurate prospective prediction of samples independent of input sample number, and thus kSAS is feasible for translation to a routine clinical assay. kSAS uses QPCR dC<sub>T</sub> or ddC<sub>T</sub> values generated from two reference QPCR profiles (one for known AR and one for known No-AR), derived from the mean gene expression signature (centroid) obtained from multiple AR or No-AR samples. When a given sample gene expression profile is analyzed in kSAS, its expression is correlated to the reference profiles for one or more developed gene sets (models). In the Fluidigm dataset, kSAS was used to identify a single model composed of 14 of the 17 genes. For the ABI analyses, multiple equivalent top-performing gene sets (<italic>n</italic> = 13) were discovered from the analysis of samples from two collection sites (UCSF and UPMC) by randomly selecting and testing the performance of all possible permutations of different-sized gene sets of the 17 genes. Prior to discovery and testing of the ABI samples in the AART100 dataset, reference centroids were developed for different protocols (sample collection/processing methods). All ABI samples were evaluated against this database of reference centroids, with results reported for the centroid pair (AR and No-AR) with the greatest correlation to the evaluated sample (independent of collection methods). Classification of a sample as AR, No-AR, or indeterminate was derived by computing the Pearson correlation coefficients for all sample–centroid comparisons, assigning a score of 1 to samples with a greater correlation to an AR centroid and a score of −1 to samples with a greater correlation to a No-AR centroid. A kSAS aggregated AR risk score (−13 to 13) was then determined by summing the scores for all evaluated gene models. Indeterminate samples were defined as those with a score less than 9 and greater than −9, based on evaluation of sample classification.

Out of the patients with blood samples 0–3 mo prior to the AR biopsy (<italic>n</italic> = 35), at time of stable graft function, 62.9% (22 out of 35 samples) had very high AR prediction scores (96.4%±0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001759-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001759-t003">Table 3</xref>), significantly greater than scores in patients with stable graft function and no AR on follow-up (19.4%±0.3; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Of the patients with blood samples drawn 0–3 mo after AR treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 31), 51.6% (16 out of 31) still had elevated predicted AR scores (86.00%±0.17); the remaining 15 samples showed AR scores below the threshold θ for AR (θ = 50%; 6.59%±0.13%) at 0–3 mo after AR treatment. As serum creatinine levels in patients with elevated AR prediction scores were 2.04±0.40 mg/dl compared to creatinine levels of 1.8±0.4 mg/dl in patients with decreased AR prediction scores, the latter likely represented patients who responded to AR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001759-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of kSORT to predict acute rejection in 191 serially collected samples.</title>
<p>191 blood samples serially collected within 6 mo before (pre) or after (post) biopsy-confirmed AR were evaluated by kSORT. Frequencies of samples predicted as AR (red) or predicted as No-AR (green) were compared between sample collection time points (&gt;3 mo prior to AR biopsy, <italic>n</italic> = 30; 0–3 mo prior to AR biopsy, <italic>n</italic> = 35; at AR biopsy, <italic>n</italic> = 74; 0–3 mo after AR biopsy, <italic>n</italic> = 31; &gt;3 mo after AR biopsy, <italic>n</italic> = 21; and at No-AR/stable time points, <italic>n</italic> = 216). 62.86% of samples collected 0–3 mo (1.15±0.90 mo) prior to the AR biopsy had high probabilities for AR predicted by kSORT (96.36±0.08). High probabilities for AR persisted in 51.6% of samples collected 0–3 mo post-AR (94.60%±0.14); in comparison, 83.8% of the No-AR samples were always predicted as No-AR (8.20%±0.12). Mean AR scores were significantly different between pre-AR samples (0–3 mo) and No-AR/stable samples, as well as between AR samples and No-AR/stable samples.</p>

<title>The Biological Basis of the 17 Genes</title>
<p>When evaluated in the context of experimentally predicted interactions, more than half of the 17 genes in the plsDA model were directly or indirectly associated with each other by common molecular pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001759.s005">Figure S5</xref>), particularly regulation of apoptosis, immune phenotype, and cell surface. In addition to the ten genes previously evaluated as peripheral biomarkers for pediatric AR, and known to be mostly expressed in PB cells of the monocyte lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref>, six of the additional seven peripheral AR genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Wu1">[25]</xref> were also expressed by activated monocytes (<italic>RXRA, RARA, CEACAM4</italic>), endothelial cells (<italic>EPOR, SLC25A37</italic>), and T cells (<italic>GZMK</italic>) in the peripheral circulation. Eleven of the 17 genes played a common role in cell death and the cell survival network (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, [Qiagen, Valencia, CA]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001759.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Locking the 17-Gene kSORT Assay on the ABI Viia7 QPCR Platform with kSAS, a Customized Analysis Suite</title>
<p>Having established the performance of the kSORT plsDA model for detection and prediction of biopsy-confirmed AR in pediatric and adult patients, the final kSORT assay was developed on the ABI platform (ABI Viia7). To mitigate the data normalization required to control for batch effect and sample handling differences, we developed a new algorithm called kSAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001759-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) to classify samples using multiple covariate-impacted reference sets, based on expression correlation (Pearson) of an individual sample to each reference profile of AR and No-AR. Rather than relying on a single gene set, this method creates and uses multiple gene subsets (models), each of which is then correlated to a reference AR or No-AR expression profile for a given sample to provide a combined model score for each reference. Samples with multiple disagreeing model predictions (<italic>n</italic>&gt;2) are considered indeterminate and thus cannot be confidently assigned as AR or No-AR. The kSORT kSAS assay was developed and cross-validated in 100 independent adult and pediatric samples collected from 44 patients with AR and 56 patients without AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001759-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of kSAS performance in the Fluidigm dataset</title>
<p>To develop the kSAS algorithm, we utilized the Fluidigm QPCR dataset of the AART143 cohort and split the samples into a training set of <italic>n</italic> = 95 and a test set of <italic>n</italic> = 48 by random selection.

<title>Locking the kSAS score in the ABI dataset</title>
<p>To account for possible sample-protocol-associated covariates, mean gene expression measurements (centroids) were calculated from known AR and known No-AR samples for the major experimental covariates (sample collection/processing methods) to create a panel of possible reference AR and No-AR profiles. For each evaluated sample, kSAS automatically selects the most correlated reference set for downstream classification. In contrast to other classification algorithms, kSAS does not apply fixed mathematical coefficients, and thus its output is not affected by differences in RNA preparation and handling variances, which can affect QPCR data ranges. Blood samples (<italic>n</italic> = 32, UCSF and UPMC) confirmed as AR (<italic>n</italic> = 16) or No-AR (<italic>n</italic> = 16) were evaluated by kSAS and tested for the performance of over 130,000 different possible gene combinations (3–17 genes per model). This analysis yielded 13 different 12-gene combinations utilizing a total of 15 of the 17 genes (<italic>CEACAM4, CFLAR, DUSP1, EPOR, GZMK, ITGAX, MAPK9, NAMPT, NKTR, PSEN1, RARA, RHEB, RXRA, RYBP, SLC25A37</italic>), with seven core genes present in all 13 12-gene combinations (<italic>CEACAM4, CFLAR, EPOR, GZMK, NKTR, PSEN1, SLC25A37</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001759.s006">Table S1</xref>). As our multiple model approach provided distinct scores for each gene set, we evaluated the combined ability of these models to provide a single confidence score for each patient that is not based on a single gene model but includes all 13 12-gene models. This aggregated AR risk analysis produced a numerical AR risk score for each patient (−13 to 13), by simply subtracting the number of times a patient was predicted as No-AR by the 13 12-gene models from the number of times the same patient was predicted as AR.</p>

<title>Validation of kSAS in independent samples from adult and pediatric transplant recipients</title>
<p>To assess the performance of the fixed kSAS algorithm utilizing the 13 12-gene models, we calculated aggregated AR risk scores for the combined dataset of 100 AR and No-AR samples (26 AR, 42 No-AR; AART100). The large majority of samples were classified as AR or No-AR with all kSAS gene models in agreement (81 out of 100). Given the large agreement in model predictions, to minimize false positive AR predictions, if three or more disagreeing calls (∼1/4 of the models) occurred, the sample was classified as indeterminate, otherwise the sample was predicted to be high risk for AR (≥11 AR calls; combined score ≥9), or low risk for AR (≥11 No-AR calls; combined score ≤−9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001759-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Among patients predicted as high risk, 92.3% were classified correctly as AR (36 out of 39); among patients predicted as low risk for AR, 93.5% (43 out of 46) were classified correctly as No-AR based on the biopsy reading (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001759-t002">Table 2</xref>), resulting in a sensitivity of 92.31% (95% CI 79.13%–98.38%) and specificity of 93.48% (95% CI 82.10%–98.63%).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clinical availability of molecular tests for accurate disease diagnosis and patient stratification for treatment regimens is a pressing issue in medicine. Molecular classification of acute transplant rejection independent of the invasive biopsy procedure is a much needed clinical assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Roedder1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sigdel1">[26]</xref>. Recent scientific research has highlighted the deficiencies of using histology alone as a means for detecting AR, with its inherent problems of sampling, read variability, and the inability to use the biopsy for serial monitoring and AR prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Furness1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Furness2">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study we developed a simple yet sensitive and specific noninvasive QPCR test, kSORT, together with a novel algorithm, kSAS, for the detection and prediction of acute renal allograft rejection from a PB sample, irrespective of the rejection grade or pathological diagnosis of antibody- or cell-mediated rejection. kSORT accurately indicated the risk and prevalence of acute renal rejection in 558 PB samples from 436 adult and pediatric renal transplant patients based on the expression of 17 genes (final AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.98). The kSORT assay performance was independent of age, time post- transplantation, transplant-specific patient management, and sample processing. The kSAS algorithm, which correlates the expression of an individual patient sample to multiple gene AR and No-AR reference profiles across multiple overlapping gene models, was successful at classifying samples with known sample handling variables.</p>
<p>The approach we applied here combined our previous findings in pediatric transplant patients in a clinical trial setting with a novel discovery in adult and pediatric transplant patients from a “real-life” setting. We advanced our recent transcriptional panel of ten genes previously shown to be differentially regulated in blood from patients with AR in different solid organs (the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sigdel1">[26]</xref> and the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Nankivell1">[27]</xref>). This initial AR panel assay was developed in a cohort of pediatric-only renal transplant patients with low risk of AR (pre-transplant panel reactive antibody level &lt;20%; <italic>n</italic> = 279; ages 1–21 y) as part of an NIH-funded randomized trial in 12 US centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sigdel1">[26]</xref>, with stringent control of the standard operating procedure for patient care and blood sample processing. We performed additional QPCR in PB samples collected in the present AART study, which represents a real-life heterogeneous transplant cohort of 436 adult and pediatric patients from eight independent transplant centers, where samples were collected irrespective of the patients' immunologic risk, immunosuppression, and co-morbidities, and where different blood RNA sampling methodologies were applied. This approach allowed for the development of an assay for which performance is robust against clinical and experimental confounders—important assets of kSORT and the kSAS algorithm, as multiple studies have shown that such confounders are associated with wide variability in the quality and reproducibility of gene expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Taylor1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li3">[31]</xref> and are likely to confound the interpretability of test results.</p>
<p>Another strength of the kSORT assay is its high positive predictive value (PPV) (93.21%) for detecting AR in a PB sample. The only PB diagnostic test that is currently available for detecting transplant rejection in transplant patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Deng1">[32]</xref> detects the absence of moderate/severe acute cellular cardiac rejection (ISHLT 3A), but provides low sensitivity for detection of the presence of AR (PPV = 6.8%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Deng1">[32]</xref>. Similarly, a blood gene expression test for assessing obstructive coronary artery disease (CorusCad, CardioDx, Palo Alto, CA) yielded a PPV of 46% in a multicenter validation study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Rosenberg1">[33]</xref>. In addition to the high sensitivity of kSORT to detect AR at the point of rejection (as diagnosed by the current gold standard), kSORT was able to identify subclinical AR in 12 out of 16 subclinical rejections that were included in the AART100 cohort and predicted clinical AR in &gt;60% of samples collected up to 3 mo prior to graft dysfunction and histological AR—an important ability for a rejection test, as subclinical and clinical AR are precursors of chronic rejection and graft loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Naesens1">[5]</xref>. Although current immune-monitoring tools for assessing the adaptive alloimmune response have shown their usefulness for predicting the potential risk of AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Loupy1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Bestard1">[35]</xref>, detection of donor-specific antibodies or memory-effector T cells does not necessarily translate to ongoing immune-mediated allograft damage, and these effector mechanisms may not always be detected prior to or at the time of biopsy-proven AR. Furthermore, most centers currently do not perform protocol biopsies as a means to detect subclinical AR, and thus subclinical cases remain largely undetected. The kSORT assay is promising for routine noninvasive post-transplant monitoring to predict AR and limit graft damage with timely intervention. The high specificity of the kSORT assay suggests its potential value to be additionally used as a negative predictor of rejection in the graft.</p>
<p>A constraint of the kSORT assay in its current assay design is its inability to discriminate between TCMR and ABMR in our study. Two potential explanations could account for this observation; on the one hand, a likely link lies in a common finding of monocyte activation in both types of AR, as the kSORT genes were highly enriched in monocytes. Indeed, monocytes are critical cells that can directly mediate the injury of tubulitis in TCMR in the allograft; additional evidence exists that donor-specific HLA class I antibodies in ABMR activate endothelial cells, which in turn can recruit and activate monocytes and leukocytes, increasing graft inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Naemi1">[36]</xref>. On the other hand, the common kSORT gene expression in both cellular and humoral rejections may represent hierarchical architecture of the adaptive immune response that takes place during the rejection process, rather than clustering with any specific effector mechanism responsible for each type of allograft rejection. In fact, some genes were also highly expressed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas some others were highly up-regulated in B cells or dendritic cells, thus suggesting the close interplay between both main effector mechanisms of the adaptive immune response during allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Haynes1">[37]</xref>. Recent studies where gene expression analyses allowed for discrimination of ABMR and TCMR were based on transcriptional studies of the rejecting biopsy tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sellares1">[38]</xref>, most valuable to better understand underlying molecular mechanisms that may differentiate ABMR and TCMR based on injury localization in specific compartments of the kidney biopsy (endothelial cells in ABMR versus tubular cells in TCMR) or the specific major effector mechanisms of injury (natural killer cells in ABMR versus cytotoxic T cells in TCMR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Brouard1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Danger1">[42]</xref>. Of note, down-regulation of kSORT genes in patients with other underlying inflammatory processes such as BKV infection and non-allospecific nephritis suggests that despite being a monocyte-driven transcriptional signature, kSORT illustrates the activation of an allogeneic immune response.</p>
<p>Similar to our recent observation of a common rejection module (CRM; <italic>n</italic> = 11 genes) in tissue across heart, liver, lung, and kidney allografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Khatri1">[3]</xref>, the present study in blood also finds genomic commonalities for the 17 genes across kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref> and heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li2">[4]</xref> and across pediatric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li1">[2]</xref> and adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Li2">[4]</xref> transplant recipients. The combined learning in blood and tissue supports the postulation that immune perturbation is global, synonymous across transplant organs and unaffected by age, suggesting a common immunological axis. This apparent commonality supports the future evaluation of kSORT for patient monitoring beyond kidney transplantation. Nevertheless, the CRM genes detected in tissue do not overlap with our kSORT genes detected in blood, which is not surprising as the predominant expression changes in the graft reflect cellular infiltration and inflammation, and are likely different from the signals of activated trafficking cells in the periphery.</p>
<p>A limitation of our study is the currently unavoidable fact that the reference for evaluation of our blood test performance is based on histological readings, with their aforementioned shortcomings, which serve as the current gold standard for detection of rejection. Moreover, the lack of centralized histological information for all biopsy samples might be considered as an additional constraint, even though all tissue samples were evaluated following the current gold standard Banff score classification for the description of main allograft lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1001759-Sis1">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, kSORT needs to be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial before its clinical efficacy can be determined. To clinically evaluate the diagnostic and predictive performance of kSORT, we have included patient monitoring by kSORT in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (Steroid Avoidance and Low-Dose CNI by ATG-Induction in Renal Transplantation [SAILOR]; EU Clinical Trials Register SUGBG-012011). The results of this trial will further evaluate whether kSORT can be used as an objective and quantitative measure for the risk of AR, and whether kSORT can be used serially post-transplant to complement current clinical practice guidelines for stratifying patient immune risk, medication load, and requirement for biopsy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this report we present the validation of the kSORT assay to detect risk of AR in renal transplant patients; the kSORT assay has the potential to become a simple, robust, and clinically applicable blood test.</p>
