<title>Background</title>
<p>Being overweight is an important risk factor for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Weight change between pregnancies has been suggested to be an independent mechanism behind GDM. We assessed the risk for GDM in second pregnancy by change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from first to second pregnancy and whether BMI and gestational weight gain modified the risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and findings</title>
<p>In this observational cohort, we included 24,198 mothers and their 2 first pregnancies in data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (2006–2014). Weight change, defined as prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy minus prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy, was divided into 6 categories by units BMI (kilo/square meter). Relative risk (RR) estimates were obtained by general linear models for the binary family and adjusted for maternal age at second delivery, country of birth, education, smoking in pregnancy, interpregnancy interval, and year of second birth. Analyses were stratified by BMI (first pregnancy) and gestational weight gain (second pregnancy). Compared to women with stable BMI (−1 to 1), women who gained weight between pregnancies had higher risk of GDM—gaining 1 to 2 units: adjusted RR 2.0 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.7), 2 to 4 units: RR 2.6 (2.0 to 3.5), and ≥4 units: RR 5.4 (4.0 to 7.4). Risk increased significantly both for women with BMI below and above 25 at first pregnancy, although it increased more for the former group. A limitation in our study was the limited data on BMI in 2 pregnancies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The risk of GDM increased with increasing weight gain from first to second pregnancy, and more strongly among women with BMI &lt; 25 in first pregnancy. Our results suggest weight change as a metabolic mechanism behind the increased risk of GDM, thus weight change should be acknowledged as an independent factor for screening GDM in clinical guidelines. Promoting healthy weight from preconception through the postpartum period should be a target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, overweight has reached epidemic proportions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref002">2</xref>], with serious consequences for reproductive health. Being overweight during pregnancy increases the risk of complications in pregnancy, in childbirth, and for the newborn child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref007">7</xref>] and is an important risk factor for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref011">11</xref>]. GDM is defined as glucose intolerance of various degrees that is first detected during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref012">12</xref>], and the prevalence of GDM has increased, with variation by countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref015">15</xref>]. GDM increases the risk of immediate adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref016">16</xref>] and, in the long term, the risk of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref019">19</xref>]. Children born to GDM mothers have an increased risk of high birthweight and being overweight in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The underlying genetic, physiological, and environmental factors behind the development of GDM are not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref021">21</xref>]. Both prepregnant Body Mass Index (BMI) and gestational weight gain are risk factors for GDM, but evidence of an independent or joint effect is inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref024">24</xref>]. Most observational studies have not been able to evaluate shared genetic and early environmental risk factors within families. Recent studies have suggested interpregnancy weight change as part of the causal mechanism behind the risk of GDM and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in the second pregnancy; however, knowledge of this is scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref027">27</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the effect of interpregnancy weight change may depend on the woman’s prepregnant BMI during her first pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref027">27</xref>]. One study found that women gaining weight between their first and second pregnancy increased their risk for GDM in their second pregnancy, even though they were normal weight during both pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>]. Previous studies have not been able to study the importance of gestational weight gain upon this association. We estimated the association between prepregnancy BMI changes from the first to the second pregnancy and GDM in the second pregnancy for women giving birth in Norway. Secondly, we explored the roles of prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy and gestational weight gain in second pregnancy as effect modifiers.</p>

<title>Data sources</title>
<p>This observational cohort study complies with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The project was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee, REK VEST (2015/1728). Informed consent was not required as data were de-identified, and the researchers did not have any additional patient contact. We used prospectively collected data from the population-based Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref028">28</xref>]. Using the unique national identification number, each child born was linked to his/her mother, so that each record consisted of the mother and her successive 2 first births (2006–2014). The MBRN was established in 1967 and is based on compulsory notification of all live- and stillbirths from 16 weeks of gestation (12 weeks from 2002). Midwives and doctors attending the birth complete a standardized notification form on demographics, maternal health before and during pregnancy, previous reproductive history, complications during pregnancy and delivery, and pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref029">29</xref>]. Data on maternal height and weight prior to conception are self-reported. Weight at the end of pregnancy is defined as maternal weight measured at last antenatal visit or when arriving at the delivery ward. The collection of maternal height and weight information in MBRN began in 2006 when Norway adopted a revised electronic birth notification system, but the implementation of the system by all delivery units was not complete until 2014. The proportion of registered maternal height and weight in MBRN steadily increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 71.6% of births in 2014 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002367.s003">S1 Fig</xref>]. Complete data on prepregnancy height and weight is available for 24% of the women having their first 2 deliveries during 2006–2014. During this period, the distribution of women across the different BMI categories has been stable over time, suggesting that even in years with low reporting, the data are likely representative for the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref030">30</xref>]. Data on country of birth (Nordic defined as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland) was obtained from The National Population Registry, Statistics Norway. Maternal education, defined as the highest achieved years of education classified according to The Norwegian Standard Classification of Education, was obtained from the National Education Database, Statistics Norway.</p>

<p>Prepregnant BMI was calculated from weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Our main exposure was interpregnancy weight change defined as prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy minus prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy. Gestational weight gain in second pregnancy was calculated as weight (kg) at the end of pregnancy minus prepregnant weight. A total of 105,429 women delivered their first 2 births during 2006–2014. To be included, women had to have prepregnancy height and weight reported for both pregnancies (<italic>n</italic> = 24,677). We excluded women with prepregnant BMI below 15 (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and interpregnancy weight change above +30 and below −30 BMI units (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<italic>n</italic> = 3), as they were considered implausible. To evaluate first-time occurrence of GDM in the second pregnancy, women diagnosed with GDM in their first pregnancy were excluded (<italic>n</italic> = 329). In the analyses exploring the potential effect modifying role of gestational weight gain in second pregnancy, only women who had their weight registered both before and at the end of their second pregnancy were included in the analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 11,972). A weight gain above 70 kg during second pregnancy was considered implausible (<italic>n</italic> = 6)</p>
<p>We categorized prepregnancy BMI into underweight (&lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25–29.9), and obese (≥30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref031">31</xref>]. Prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy was further dichotomized into &lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> versus ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for stratified analyses. We categorized interpregnancy weight change into 6 groups: &lt;−2, −2 to &lt;−1, −1 to &lt;1 (reference), 1 to &lt;2, 2 to &lt;4, and ≥4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref027">27</xref>]. Gestational weight gain was grouped into the following: weight loss, 0–7.9 kg, 8–15.9 kg, and ≥16 kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref032">32</xref>]. In stratified analyses, women with a weight loss were excluded, and gestational weight gain was dichotomized by the median value: 0–13.9 kg and ≥14 kg. The main outcome was GDM (yes/no), notified by a check box on the birth notification form or as free text coded at the MBRN according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10. The diagnostic criteria and screening strategy for GDM are given in the national guidelines for antenatal care and obstetrics made by the Norwegian Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (in 1998, 2008, and 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref033">33</xref>]. GDM is diagnosed when fasting plasma glucose levels are &lt;7.0 millimole (mmol)/liter (l) and serum blood glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (2 hours after intake of 75 grams oral glucose) is ≥7.8 mmol/l but &lt;11.1 mmol/l. Women follow a standardized antenatal program with regular visits, which include urine stix testing for glucose at each visit. Independent of gestational week, an OGTT is recommended when the stix is positive (≥+++). Women with risk factors (age &gt; 38 years, close relatives with Gestational Diabetes type 1/2, immigrants from the Indian Subcontinent or North Africa, prepregnant BMI &gt; 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or prior GDM) will be offered an OGTT as early as possible in pregnancy, and if negative, it will be repeated in week 28–30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Maternal smoking habits were reported at the end of pregnancy, and women could answer “no,” “occasionally,” “daily,” or they could decline to answer (<italic>n</italic> = 2,592). Daily and occasional smokers (<italic>n</italic> = 110) were considered smokers. Interpregnancy interval was calculated as the date of the second birth minus the date of first birth minus the pregnancy length of the second pregnancy, and it was categorized into &lt;12, 12 to &lt;24 (reference), 24 to &lt;36, and ≥36 months. In stratified analyses, the interpregnancy interval was dichotomized: &lt;24 and ≥24 months. The gestational age of the second pregnancy was based on second trimester ultrasound estimations or, if missing, on the mother’s last menstrual period.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Chi-square tests were used to investigate associations and linear trends between variables. General linear models with extension for the binary family were used to estimate the association between interpregnancy weight change from the first to second pregnancy and the risk of GDM in the second pregnancy. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% CI were calculated for interpregnancy weight-change categories. Maternal age at second delivery (&lt;25, 25–29, 30–34, ≥35 years), country of birth (Nordic/non-Nordic), highest achieved years of education (&lt;11, 11–14, ≥14 years), smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), interpregnancy interval (&lt;12, 12 to &lt;24, 24 to &lt;36, ≥36 months), and year of the second birth (continuous variable) were considered as possible confounders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref034">34</xref>] and were adjusted for in the multivariable binary regression model. The presented adjusted models (<italic>n</italic> = 20,824) had missing information on covariates in 3,374 (13.9%) women. Missing values for smoking, maternal education, and maternal country of birth were therefore handled by missing imputation using chained equations (MICE) with logistic regression for smoking and maternal country of birth and multinomial logistic regression for maternal education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref035">35</xref>] [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002367.s004">S1 Table</xref>]. When evaluating a potential effect modification by prepregnant BMI in the first pregnancy (BMI &lt; 25 and BMI ≥ 25), and gestational weight gain (&lt;14 and ≥14) in the second pregnancy, we included an interaction term in the multiplicative model evaluated by Likelihood ratio test. To compare the risk of GDM in women with BMI ≥ 25 and BMI &lt; 25 in the first pregnancy, we included interpregnancy BMI change as a continuous variable in the interaction term (Likelihood ratio test, Poisson regression). Associations were considered statistically significant at the 5% level. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA IC Statistical software version 14 and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 23 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.spss.com/" xlink:type="simple">www.spss.com</ext-link>).</p>

<p>The overall absolute risk of GDM in second pregnancy was 18.1 per 1,000 pregnancies (439/24,198), and the prevalence of GDM increased with increasing level of prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy (<italic>p</italic> for trend &lt;0.001). Interpregnancy weight change from the first to second pregnancy was relatively stable (−1 to &lt;1 BMI units) in 47.6% of women (<italic>n</italic> = 11,512), while 16.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 4,076) of women had a weight loss of &gt;1 BMI unit and 35.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 8,610) of women gained weight ≥1 BMI unit. To evaluate the representativeness of our study population, we compared the study population with the general population in MBRN during 2006–2014 [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002367.s013">S10 Table</xref>].</p>
<p>During the second pregnancy, 0.8% (100/12,078) of women lost weight (&lt;0 kg), 10.5% had a GWG of 0 kg to 7.9 kg, 53.7% had a GWG of 8 kg to 15.9 kg, and 34.9% had a GWG of ≥16 kg.

<title>Principal findings</title>
<p>We found a higher risk of GDM in women who increased their weight by ≥1 BMI unit from their first to second pregnancy compared to women with stable weight (−1 to &lt;1 unit change). The risk estimates for GDM increased with increasing weight gain and applied to both normal-weight (prepregnant BMI &lt; 25) and overweight (prepregnant BMI ≥ 25) women in their first pregnancy. Women with a BMI &lt; 25 in their first pregnancy had the strongest association between interpregnancy weight gain and GDM. A preventive effect on GDM was seen in overweight women (first pregnancy) who reduced their weight by ≥2 BMI units until the second pregnancy.</p>

<title>Interpregnancy weight change, BMI in first pregnancy, and the risk of GDM</title>
<p>Previous studies on interpregnancy weight change and risk of GDM are generally consistent with our findings with some exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref039">39</xref>]. A Swedish population-based study found that the risk for GDM in the second pregnancy increased linearly with interpregnancy weight gain and was also present in women whose BMI was &lt;25 in both pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>], consistent with our results. However, for overweight and obese women (BMI &gt; 25 in first pregnancy), they found that only those with a large interpregnancy weight gain of ≥3 BMI units had an increased risk of GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>]. A regional cohort study from Belgium found an increased risk of GDM in women who had an interpregnancy weight gain of ≥1 BMI unit but only among women with BMI &lt; 25 in their first pregnancy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref037">37</xref>]. An American study also found, as we did, that the risk of GDM associated with interpregnancy weight gain applied both to women with BMI below and above 25 in first pregnancy. The risk estimates were also higher in women who had BMI &lt; 25 in their first pregnancy, similar to our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>We found a preventive effect of losing weight ≥2 BMI units from first to second pregnancy in women who had BMI ≥ 25 in first pregnancy, when compared to women with stable BMI in this group. Some studies have confirmed this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref039">39</xref>], while others have not found any preventive effect of reducing weight on the risk of GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>Gestational weight gain and GDM</title>
<p>Obese women tend to gain less weight during pregnancy and also have the highest baseline risk of GDM; therefore, it is important to take BMI into consideration when examining gestational weight gain and GDM. We found the highest risk of GDM in women who had the lowest gestational weight gain, which has been confirmed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref037">37</xref>]. Reverse causation is a possible explanation, as women with GDM are closely monitored and receive advice on nutrition and physical activity, which may lead to lower gestational weight gain during the second pregnancy. Few studies have included gestational weight gain during second pregnancy when exploring the association between interpregnancy weight change and GDM. A study from Belgium found that inadequate gestational weight gain in second pregnancy was associated with GDM both in women who were normal weight or overweight in their first pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<title>Pathophysiological mechanisms behind GDM</title>
<p>GDM is characterized by a decreased insulin sensitivity together with an inadequate insulin response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref012">12</xref>]. Obesity is an important risk factor for glucose intolerance during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref040">40</xref>], explaining the increased risk of GDM in women with a prepregnant BMI ≥ 25 in their first pregnancy when compared to women with BMI &lt; 25 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002367.g004">Fig 4</xref>]. A normal pregnancy is characterized by a 50%–60% physiological decrease in insulin sensitivity (before conception until late pregnancy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref040">40</xref>], and the pancreatic β cells compensate for this by increasing their insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref012">12</xref>]. Results from our study suggest that increasing weight between first and second pregnancy, during a relatively short time (more than 60% of the women in our study had an interpregnancy interval of &lt;24 months; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002367.t001">Table 1</xref>), may stress the glucose metabolism and cause a subclinical decreased insulin sensitivity among normal-weight women as well as overweight women. Normal-weight women generally have a higher insulin sensitivity than overweight and obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref040">40</xref>]. We suggest that an additive effect of the physiological decrease in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy may overload the capacity and increase the susceptibility to develop GDM, especially in normal-weight women who are used to higher insulin sensitivity.</p>

<title>Strength and limitations</title>
<p>We used data from a large population-based register with compulsory notification and negligible selection bias. Data were family-based, collected prospectively with a longitudinal design and included several confounding factors that made it possible to evaluate weight change as a causal mechanism behind GDM. BMI represents prepregnant BMI and is not obscured by an effect of gestational weight gain upon the risk of GDM, in contrast to most studies reporting BMI before week 15 of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref039">39</xref>] or week 16–17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref036">36</xref>]. A limitation in our study was the limited proportion of information on BMI available in both first and second pregnancy during the study period. However, comparing the study population with the population with missing information on BMI [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002367.s013">S10 Table</xref>], our study population is likely to be representative. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy depends on prepregnant weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref022">22</xref>]. When evaluating effect modification by gestational weight gain, we stratified on a possible intermediate variable on the causal path from prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy (part of our exposure) and GDM, which may have introduced bias in our estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref041">41</xref>]. We cannot exclude unmeasured confounding, as we were not able to take into account other time-varying variables associated with GDM, such as family history of GDM, mothers weight gain in childhood/early adulthood, prepregnant diet, and vigorous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref034">34</xref>]. Data on height and weight are self-reported, and as height tends to be overreported whereas weight is under-reported, this might cause bias due to misclassification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref042">42</xref>]. However, several studies have found self-reported height and weight in women of reproductive age and in pregnant women to be valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref044">44</xref>]. As data are collected prospectively, misclassification of BMI is independent of a later GDM diagnosis and therefore likely to be nondifferential, which would tend to bias risk estimates toward the null and underestimate the risk of GDM. We did not include gestational weight gain during first pregnancy in our model and were therefore not able to make a distinction between gestational weight gain in first pregnancy and interpregnancy weight change. According to observational studies, gestational weight gain is strongly associated with short- and long-term postpartum weight retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec024">
<title>Health implications</title>
<p>Pregnant women who increase their weight by ≥1 BMI unit from their first to second pregnancy should be closely monitored during their second pregnancy to reveal development of GDM, irrespective of prepregnant BMI. Antenatal guidelines for monitoring GDM in pregnancy should add interpregnancy weight change as an independent risk factor for GDM with a routine stress-test of glucose tolerance during pregnancy in women with weight gain more than 1 BMI unit. A possible preventive effect on GDM of losing weight between pregnancies in overweight women needs to be replicated in other studies. Efforts that are targeting women who are overweight in pregnancy and childbirth should expand in focus to promote healthy weight from preconception throughout reproduction. Today, less than 10% of countries’ national policies address healthy maternal weight across the entire spectrum of childbearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002367.ref046">46</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Women who increased their weight by ≥1 BMI unit from first to second pregnancy had increased risk of GDM in the second pregnancy compared to women with stable weight (−1 to &lt;1 BMI unit change). This applied to women with prepregnant BMI below and above 25 in the first pregnancy; however, the strongest association was found in women with BMI &lt; 25. We found a preventive effect on GDM in overweight women (first pregnancy) who reduced their weight by ≥2 BMI units until the second pregnancy. Our results support a metabolic mechanism behind the increased risk of GDM, represented by the weight change itself.</p>
