<title>Background</title>
<p>Conventional HIV testing services have been less comprehensive in reaching men than in reaching women globally, but HIV self-testing (HIVST) appears to be an acceptable alternative. Measurement of linkage to post-test services following HIVST remains the biggest challenge, yet is the biggest driver of cost-effectiveness. We investigated the impact of HIVST alone or with additional interventions on the uptake of testing and linkage to care or prevention among male partners of antenatal care clinic attendees in a novel adaptive trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and findings</title>
<p>An adaptive multi-arm, 2-stage cluster randomised trial was conducted between 8 August 2016 and 30 June 2017, with antenatal care clinic (ANC) days (i.e., clusters of women attending on a single day) as the unit of randomisation. Recruitment was from Ndirande, Bangwe, and Zingwangwa primary health clinics in urban Blantyre, Malawi. Women attending an ANC for the first time for their current pregnancy (regardless of trimester), 18 years and older, with a primary male partner not known to be on ART were enrolled in the trial after giving consent. Randomisation was to either the standard of care (SOC; with a clinic invitation letter to the male partner) or 1 of 5 intervention arms: the first arm provided women with 2 HIVST kits for their partners; the second and third arms provided 2 HIVST kits along with a conditional fixed financial incentive of $3 or $10; the fourth arm provided 2 HIVST kits and a 10% chance of receiving $30 in a lottery; and the fifth arm provided 2 HIVST kits and a phone call reminder for the women’s partners. The primary outcome was the proportion of male partners who were reported to have tested for HIV and linked into care or prevention within 28 days, with referral for antiretroviral therapy (ART) or circumcision accordingly. Women were interviewed at 28 days about partner testing and adverse events. Cluster-level summaries compared each intervention versus SOC using eligible women as the denominator (intention-to-treat). Risk ratios were adjusted for male partner testing history and recruitment clinic. A total of 2,349/3,137 (74.9%) women participated (71 ANC days), with a mean age of 24.8 years (SD: 5.4). The majority (2,201/2,233; 98.6%) of women were married, 254/2,107 (12.3%) were unable to read and write, and 1,505/2,247 (67.0%) were not employed. The mean age for male partners was 29.6 years (SD: 7.5), only 88/2,200 (4.0%) were unemployed, and 966/2,210 (43.7%) had never tested for HIV before. Women in the SOC arm reported that 17.4% (71/408) of their partners tested for HIV, whereas a much higher proportion of partners were reported to have tested for HIV in all intervention arms (87.0%–95.4%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in all 5 intervention arms). As compared with those who tested in the SOC arm (geometric mean 13.0%), higher proportions of partners met the primary endpoint in the HIVST + $3 (geometric mean 40.9%, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 3.01 [95% CI 1.63–5.57], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), HIVST + $10 (51.7%, aRR 3.72 [95% CI 1.85–7.48], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and phone reminder (22.3%, aRR 1.58 [95% CI 1.07–2.33], <italic>p</italic> = 0.021) arms. In contrast, there was no significant increase in partners meeting the primary endpoint in the HIVST alone (geometric mean 17.5%, aRR 1.45 [95% CI 0.99–2.13], <italic>p</italic> = 0.130) or lottery (18.6%, aRR 1.43 [95% CI 0.96–2.13], <italic>p</italic> = 0.211) arms. The lottery arm was dropped at interim analysis. Overall, 46 male partners were confirmed to be HIV positive, 42 (91.3%) of whom initiated ART within 28 days; 222 tested HIV negative and were not already circumcised, of whom 135 (60.8%) were circumcised as part of the trial. No serious adverse events were reported. Costs per male partner who attended the clinic with a confirmed HIV test result were $23.73 and $28.08 for the HIVST + $3 and HIVST + $10 arms, respectively. Notable limitations of the trial included the relatively small number of clusters randomised to each arm, proxy reporting of the male partner testing outcome, and being unable to evaluate retention in care.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, the odds of men’s linkage to care or prevention increased substantially using conditional fixed financial incentives plus partner-delivered HIVST; combinations were potentially affordable.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We conducted a cluster randomised study in urban Blantyre, Malawi, recruiting pregnant women attending an ANC for the first time for their current pregnancy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We assessed the impact of providing oral self-test kits to male partners via the ANC attendees on male partner testing and clinic attendance for post-test services within 28 days of the woman’s enrolment. Additionally, we offered a guaranteed monetary financial incentive of $3 or $10 or a chance to win $30 in a lottery to male partners, conditional on clinic attendance. We also tested the impact of phone call reminders to the male partner immediately after the woman collected the kits, repeated after 5 days.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A total of 2,349 eligible pregnant women were recruited to the study. Compared to a standard of care (SOC) of a personalised invitation letter to the male partner to attend the clinic for HIV testing and to receive post-test services, male partner testing increased from 17% with SOC to between 87% and 95% with the oral self-test kits, as reported by the women.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subsequent male partner clinic attendance within 28 days of the woman’s enrolment was 13.0% with SOC; 17.5% with self-test kits only; 40.9% and 51.7% with self-test kits plus $3 and $10 financial incentives, respectively; 18.6% with self-test kits plus lottery; and 22.3% with self-test kits plus phone reminder. No serious adverse events were reported either by the women or their male partners.</p></list-item>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2016, 1.0 million people died of diseases associated with HIV infection, and 1.8 million were newly infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref001">1</xref>]. Eastern and southern Africa have been disproportionately affected by the epidemic, and face challenges in reaching men: regionally, only 52% of men living with HIV are aware of their infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref002">2</xref>], whilst deaths from AIDS-related illnesses are 27% higher amongst men than women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref001">1</xref>]. Achieving the 2020 UN targets of having 90% of all people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of those diagnosed on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of those on treatment virally suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref001">1</xref>] should bring major reductions in HIV incidence and mortality, but may also require novel service delivery approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>HIV self-testing (HIVST), whereby individuals collect their own sample (oral or blood), conduct the test, and interpret their result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref003">3</xref>], has been found to be highly acceptable to those wishing to test for HIV infection and has been shown to increase coverage and frequency of testing in high-risk men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref004">4</xref>]. In Malawi, community-based distribution of HIVST kits plus home-based ART initiation in an urban slum setting increased demand for ART, and was shown to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref006">6</xref>]. In Kenya, secondary distribution of HIVST kits by antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees to their male partners increased uptake of HIV testing, although subsequent uptake of post-test HIV care and prevention services (“linkage”) was not optimally measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref007">7</xref>]. Linkage after HIVST has been previously evaluated from the perspective of delivery of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref009">9</xref>], with mixed results. Demand for ART increased 3-fold when community participants who self-tested positive were offered 2 weeks of ART at home in Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref006">6</xref>], while self-testing did not increase ART initiation in a study among female sex workers in Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref008">8</xref>]. Studies that assess linkage after HIVST to HIV prevention services such as circumcision or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are very rare.</p>
<p>Antenatal services in eastern and southern Africa have achieved near-universal HIV testing amongst pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref010">10</xref>], providing an ideal opportunity for engaging male partners and extending benefits to the unborn child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref011">11</xref>]. We used a novel multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) cluster randomised trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref012">12</xref>] to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and costs of a number of candidate interventions including HIVST alone and in combination with conditional fixed financial incentives, lotteries, or phone reminders.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Design, setting, and participants</title>
<p>This was a 2-stage Phase II MAMS adaptive cluster randomised trial conducted at 3 primary health clinics in Blantyre, Malawi, between 8 August 2016 and 30 June 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref012">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002719.s006">S1 Text</xref>). We block randomised ANC days (representing clusters of women) to 1 of 6 trial arms (standard of care [SOC] and 5 intervention arms; ratio 1:1:1:1:1:1) in stage 1. All women were screened for eligibility at their routine ANC visit, with each ANC day offering services to first time attendees eligible as a cluster. Those eligible (first ANC visit for current pregnancy, residence in Blantyre, with a male partner not known to be on ART) and who provided informed consent were allocated to the study arm assigned to that day. At the end of stage 1, intervention arms could be dropped if <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.2 compared to SOC, or for safety concerns including intimate partner violence, guided by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). Further ANC days, as determined to be needed by sample size re-calculation, were then randomised in equal proportions to the remaining trial arms for stage 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>An independent statistician generated the allocation sequence for the trial arms. The arm assignment of each ANC day was only revealed to the field team on the morning of the recruitment day, to enhance allocation concealment. In the SOC arm, women were given an invitation letter addressed to their male partner informing them of the importance of having an HIV test, and the availability of HIV testing and fast track referral for HIV treatment or voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services through a male-friendly clinic (MFC) set up within the recruiting facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref013">13</xref>]. The male partner had to present the letter to identify himself and his partner at the clinic in order to access MFC services.</p>
<p>Treatment for participants in all 5 intervention arms included the SOC letter and clinic access together with 2 prequalified oral HIVST kits (OraQuick HIV Self Test, OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA, US) for the woman to take home for her male partner: 1 arm offered this combination only (“ST”). Two arms offered an additional conditional fixed cash financial incentive of $3 or $10 (referred to as “ST + $3” and “ST + $10”, respectively), and a fourth intervention arm offered a 10% chance of winning $30 (“ST + lottery”). The fifth intervention arm included a phone call to the male partner on the day the woman enrolled, which was repeated 5 days later if partner had not come to the clinic (“ST + reminder”). Regardless of HIV self-test results, the male partners were asked to present to the clinic with their letter as identification. Incentives were given to the men and were conditional on their attending clinic-based HIV treatment or prevention services within 28 days. The study’s selection of $3, $10, and a phone reminder as additional interventions used formative study results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref013">13</xref>]. The $3 amount reflected the out-of-pocket costs of accessing facility HIV testing services in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Outcomes and measurement</title>
<p>The primary outcome was the proportion of male partners who tested for HIV and linked into care or prevention within 28 days of the woman’s enrolment, assuming 1 man per enrolled woman. All men in the HIVST arms were asked to present their used HIVST kit, and could repeat HIVST with a study HIV counsellor at the MFC. In the SOC arm, HIV testing used finger-prick rapid diagnostic test kits following Malawi national HIV testing guidelines, provided to male partners who attended the MFC.</p>
<p>Confirmatory testing followed Malawi national guidelines and was conducted in all trial arms by Ministry of Health HIV counsellors at the clinic. There was referral for ART if the male partner was HIV positive, for VMMC if the male partner was HIV negative and uncircumcised, or for counselling if the male partner was HIV negative and already circumcised. We conducted 2 post hoc analyses. First, we restricted the numerator to confirmed HIV positive men referred for ART and HIV negative men referred for VMMC, thus excluding men who were HIV negative and already circumcised. Second, the numerator was restricted to men who started ART or got circumcised.</p>
<p>The secondary outcomes were the proportion of male partners who tested for HIV within 28 days, as reported by the women through audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) at follow-up, and the risk of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref012">12</xref>] within 28 days of the woman’s enrolment, as reported through ACASI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Analysis and sample size</title>
<p>Assuming each cluster enrolled 40–60 women, and that 25% of male partners achieved the primary outcome in the SOC arm with a coefficient of variation (<italic>k</italic>) of 0.10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref012">12</xref>], 6 clusters per arm in stage 1 and 7 clusters per arm in stage 2 gave 80% power to detect a 15% absolute difference in proportions at a 20% and 5% significance level for stage 1 and stage 2, respectively. The target sample size for stage 2 was re-calculated using the observed harmonic mean number of women per cluster and the proportion achieving the primary outcome. The intention-to-treat principle was followed, using the number of consented women as the denominator in each cluster.</p>
<p>Baseline characteristics of male partners, as reported by the women, were compared across trial arms. A planned interim analysis at the end of stage 1 was conducted in order to make pre-planned trial adaptations. We analysed combined stage 1 and 2 data by comparing each intervention arm to the SOC arm and computing a risk ratio (RR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref015">15</xref>] and 95% confidence interval (CI), using a cluster-level summaries approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref015">15</xref>] due to the small number of clusters per arm. Any baseline imbalance was adjusted for using a 2-step approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref015">15</xref>]: First, we used a logistic regression model with baseline covariates to obtain an expected outcome; second, the cluster-level ratio of observed:expected outcomes was compared by arm. A <italic>t</italic> test was used to compute a <italic>p</italic>-value for each comparison, followed by a Dunnett test to correct for multiple comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref016">16</xref>]. The statistical analysis approach is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002719.s002">S1 Appendix</xref>, and we completed a CONSORT Checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002719.s001">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Cost analysis</title>
<p>For each trial arm we recorded all resources used by those randomised to that arm and then costed each resource use item to estimate the total costs. We divided the total costs by the total number of men who tested for HIV and attended an MFC to estimate the cost per male partner who tested for HIV and attended an MFC, and by the total number of men who started ART or were referred for VMMC to estimate the cost per male partner who tested for HIV and either started ART or was referred for VMMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002719.s003">S2 Appendix</xref>). Costs were estimated from the health provider perspective and are presented in 2016 US dollars.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The trial was approved by the University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee and by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee. Women provided written or witnessed (with thumb print for those illiterate) informed consent before undergoing any trial procedures. Written consent for male partners was waived by the 2 ethics committees. The waiver of consent for male partners was granted on the basis that HIV testing is a SOC service, but the study provided information for the male partners to read and voluntarily decide to take part in the trial.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Recruitment and follow-up was completed between 8 August 2016 and 30 June 2017. In total, 3,137 pregnant women (71 clusters [ANC days]: 36 in stage 1 and 35 in stage 2) were screened, of whom 2,349 (74.9%) were eligible and consented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002719.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Baseline characteristics of male partners, as reported by the women, were reasonably balanced across trial arms except for male partner HIV testing history. Recruitment clinic was also imbalanced by trial arm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002719.t001">Table 1</xref>). All analyses were adjusted for these 2 covariates.</p>

In each case, the AE occurred from women pressurising their partner to use a self-test kit, leading to disagreements culminating in temporary (2–3 days) separation. No physical or sexual violence was reported, and all 3 events resolved within 3 days.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main findings of this trial were that, in Blantyre, Malawi, secondary distribution of HIVST kits to male partners by women attending antenatal care greatly increased the proportion of male partners who had an HIV test and, if combined with conditional financial incentives or a phone call reminder, significantly increased male linkage into post-test HIV care and prevention services. With self-testing recently recommended by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref003">3</xref>]—and several low-cost products, including 1 WHO prequalified self-test and 4 others approved for procurement through major donors—national strategies based on HIVST such as the one described here are becoming highly feasible.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of unusually high HIV risk for both partners as well as the child, such that reaching the male partners of pregnant women with HIV services has high societal and public health value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref011">11</xref>]. In our study, women reported high uptake of HIVST by their male partner at 28 days (range 87.0% to 95.4% in the 5 HIVST intervention arms). Previous ANC-based studies in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref017">17</xref>] and Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref018">18</xref>], also reliant on proxy-reporting, estimated testing by 90.8% to 91.1% of men using secondary distribution of self-test kits. This is in stark contrast with previously disappointing results for male partner testing initiatives, and is consistent with other data that suggest that HIVST is highly acceptable to men, adolescents, and key populations who are not well served by standard clinic-based HIV testing services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref020">20</xref>]. HIVST should now be considered as a leading candidate for routine ANC policy and practice in high HIV prevalence settings.</p>
<p>Although merely testing as a couple can reduce sexual risk taking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref021">21</xref>], timely uptake of ART, if HIV positive, and effective prevention, if HIV negative, are key to maximising and maintaining the health benefits of all testing modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref001">1</xref>]. Improving previously poor linkage into HIV care following standard HIV testing has been a major recent focus of HIV programmes globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref022">22</xref>]. For HIVST, reconstructing the standard HIV care cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref001">1</xref>] is generally not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref005">5</xref>], but demand for post-test services at the population level (without knowledge of underlying HIV prevalence) provides an alternative measure of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, using a composite HIV care and prevention outcome, we show significant benefits from 2 conditional fixed financial incentive arms. Financial incentives, including one-off rewards for desired behaviour, have shown a consistently positive effect on uptake and completion of standard HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref025">25</xref>]. Interestingly, our results differ in that men’s uptake of HIVST was not influenced by incentives, based on self-report by women. Instead, uniformly high kit usage rates in all self-testing arms suggest high intrinsic motivation for self-testing, to which incentives add relatively little. HIVST has high user acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref019">19</xref>], is strongly preferred over alternative approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref019">19</xref>], and incurs negligible inconvenience or user costs when delivered at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref014">14</xref>]. Combining HIVST with conditional fixed financial incentives did, however, increase the proportion of men attending clinic-based HIV care and prevention services within 28 days, from 13.0% in the SOC arm to 51.7% in the ST + $10 arm. This includes a significant increase in the hard prevention outcomes of ART initiation and VMMC, and adds to the body of mixed evidence concerning incentives and linkage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref028">28</xref>], as well as establishing the principle that linkage interventions can increase health benefits from secondary distribution HIVST strategies.</p>
<p>Our costing suggests that of the 5 interventions evaluated, the $3 and $10 incentive arms offered the best value for money. Malawians incur a cost of approximately US$3 to access free facility-based HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref014">14</xref>], and this cost often deters men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref029">29</xref>]. The $10 incentive in the ST + $10 incentive arm was considered by potential participants as the likely maximally efficacious amount to cover all their opportunity costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref013">13</xref>]. Although providing financial incentives and HIV self-test kits is costly, it may be necessary to reach the UN 2020 targets. The potential to rapidly test and optimise locally relevant financial incentives is a strength of multi-arm adaptive trial designs, modified here to support clustered units of randomisation. For instance, we anticipated but did not find high acceptability/effectiveness of lottery-based incentives following behavioural intervention trials that showed significantly reduced HIV incidence in Lesotho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref030">30</xref>] and increased HIV testing in Zimbabwe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref031">31</xref>]. Our cost analysis may overestimate the cost per person tested since the number of male partners tested is based on men who attended the clinic while a higher number may have tested without necessarily attending the clinic.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study are the relatively small number of groups of women attending on any single ANC day and randomised to each arm, and proxy-reporting to estimate usage of HIVST by male partners. Computer-based interviews (ACASI), however, were used to minimise misreporting due to social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref032">32</xref>]. There was no incentive for the SOC participants to attend the MFC except that it was a fast track clinic. This may potentially bias the results towards the incentive arms appearing to be more effective than they truly are as men may otherwise have sought care elsewhere. Risk behaviour, condom use, and retention in care were not evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002719.ref033">33</xref>], and, due to service availability restrictions, not all men were followed through from booking to VMMC.</p>
<p>In this study we show pronounced effects on testing without safety concerns from secondary distribution of HIVST kits, in keeping with previous estimates from ANC studies, with no additional benefit from accompanying financial incentives. This implies that secondary distribution of HIVST kits through ANCs may be scalable. Incentives of $3 and $10, conditional on attending clinic-based services within 28 days, and a phone call reminder did, however, significantly increase timely uptake of HIV treatment and prevention to an extent likely to be cost-saving. Compared to SOC, we saw no significant benefit of providing HIVST kits only, according to the primary endpoint. Secondary distribution of HIVST kits, ideally accompanied by interventions promoting timely linkage into HIV care and prevention cascades, is a promising new approach for routine ANC services to reach male partners, enhance prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and contribute more broadly to country-level HIV prevention targets.</p>
