<title>Background</title>
<p>Infants born preterm compared with infants born at term are at an increased risk of dying and of serious morbidities in early life, and those who survive have higher rates of neurological impairments. It remains unclear whether exposure to repeat courses of prenatal corticosteroids can reduce these risks. This individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) assessed whether repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth in order to benefit their infants is modified by participant or treatment factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and findings</title>
<p>Trials were eligible for inclusion if they randomised women considered at risk of preterm birth who had already received an initial, single course of prenatal corticosteroid seven or more days previously and in which corticosteroids were compared with either placebo or no placebo. The primary outcomes for the infants were serious outcome, use of respiratory support, and birth weight z-scores; for the children, they were death or any neurosensory disability; and for the women, maternal sepsis. Studies were identified using the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth search strategy. Date of last search was 20 January 2015. IPD were sought from investigators with eligible trials. Risk of bias was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration. IPD were analysed using a one-stage approach.</p>
<p>Eleven trials, conducted between 2002 and 2010, were identified as eligible, with five trials being from the United States, two from Canada, and one each from Australia and New Zealand, Finland, India, and the United Kingdom. All 11 trials were included, with 4,857 women and 5,915 infants contributing data. The mean gestational age at trial entry for the trials was between 27.4 weeks and 30.2 weeks. There was no significant difference in the proportion of infants with a serious outcome (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.04, 5,893 infants, 11 trials, <italic>p</italic> = 0.33 for heterogeneity). There was a reduction in the use of respiratory support in infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with infants not exposed (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97, 5,791 infants, 10 trials, <italic>p</italic> = 0.64 for heterogeneity). The number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit was 21 (95% CI 14 to 41) women/fetus to prevent one infant from needing respiratory support. Birth weight z-scores were lower in the repeat corticosteroid group (mean difference −0.12, 95%CI −0.18 to −0.06, 5,902 infants, 11 trials, <italic>p</italic> = 0.80 for heterogeneity). No statistically significant differences were seen for any of the primary outcomes for the child (death or any neurosensory disability) or for the woman (maternal sepsis). The treatment effect varied little by reason the woman was considered to be at risk of preterm birth, the number of fetuses in utero, the gestational age when first trial treatment course was given, or the time prior to birth that the last dose was given. Infants exposed to between 2–5 courses of repeat corticosteroids showed a reduction in both serious outcome and the use of respiratory support compared with infants exposed to only a single repeat course. However, increasing numbers of repeat courses of corticosteroids were associated with larger reductions in birth z-scores for weight, length, and head circumference. Not all trials could provide data for all of the prespecified subgroups, so this limited the power to detect differences because event rates are low for some important maternal, infant, and childhood outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we found that repeat prenatal corticosteroids given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth after an initial course reduced the likelihood of their infant needing respiratory support after birth and led to neonatal benefits. Body size measures at birth were lower in infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids. Our findings suggest that to provide clinical benefit with the least effect on growth, the number of repeat treatment courses should be limited to a maximum of three and the total dose to between 24 mg and 48 mg.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Respiratory distress syndrome, caused by surfactant deficiency, is a common complication of preterm birth and a major cause of early neonatal mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref001">1</xref>]. Infants born preterm often require respiratory support, with significant numbers requiring assisted ventilation and treatment with exogenous surfactant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref001">1</xref>]. Children born preterm who survive have a higher risk of subsequent long-term neurodevelopmental impairments such as cerebral palsy, cognitive dysfunction, blindness, and deafness than do children born at term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref003">3</xref>]. The global burden is substantial, with estimates suggesting up to 8% of preterm infants have neurological impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref004">4</xref>]. The personal and emotional costs for affected individuals and their families are high, as are the immediate and long-term societal costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref006">6</xref>]. Effective antenatal treatments that can reduce the morbidities of preterm birth are clearly needed. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids remains the ‘gold standard’ antenatal intervention to reduce the risk of fetal and neonatal mortality related to preterm birth, but residual morbidity remains a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Use of repeat prenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth to prevent neonatal morbidity was first suggested in the early 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref008">8</xref>]. The Cochrane systematic review assessing the use of repeat prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth to prevent neonatal disease shows their use results in a clinically important reduction in both the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (risk ratio 0.83, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.75 to 0.91; eight trials; 3,206 infants; number needed to treat [NNT] 17, 95% CI 11 to 32) and of serious infant outcome (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94; seven trials; 5,094 infants; NNT 30, 95% CI 19 to 79) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref009">9</xref>]. These neonatal benefits support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women who have received an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids 7 or more days previously and who remain at risk of preterm birth. However, the aggregate review is unable to provide important details needed by guideline developers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref010">10</xref>], clinicians, and pregnant women and their families, notably, whether repeat prenatal corticosteroids are more effective in some women by reason of their risk of preterm birth; what is the best gestational age for administration for maximal benefit; and what dose, number of repeat doses, and timing prior to birth are optimal.</p>
<p>To address these questions, the Prenatal Repeat Corticosteroid <underline>I</underline>nternational IPD-MA Study: assessing the effects using the best level of Evidence (PRECISE) Group was formed to undertake an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) of the data from eligible trials. This approach has the advantages of allowing for exploration of interactions between treatment and characteristics at a participant level and enables examination of differential treatment effects between subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Results are reported using the Preferred Items for Reporting for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD Statement) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref014">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002771.s011">S1 Text</xref>). The IPD-MA followed the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002771.s012">S2 Text</xref>). The Child Youth and Women’s Health Service Research Ethics Committee, South Australia, Australia, approved the study (REC2334/12/13). The included trials had received country- and site-specific ethical review, with individual participants providing written, informed consent.</p>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Specific objectives</title>
<p>The objectives of the PRECISE IPD-MA were to assess, using IPD methods and MAs, the effects on important clinical outcomes of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment given to women at risk of preterm birth to benefit their infants, both short-term and long-term, and whether the treatment effects differed by the following prespecified participant and treatment characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref015">15</xref>]: the reason the women were at risk of preterm birth (e.g., antepartum haemorrhage, preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, preterm labour, hypertensive disease of pregnancy); the gestational age when the repeat prenatal corticosteroids were given; and the dose, number of repeat doses, and timing prior to birth that treatment was given.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Eligibility criteria</title>
<p>Trials were eligible if they randomised women considered at risk of preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation), who had already received a single course of prenatal corticosteroids seven or more days previously, to either corticosteroids—administered to the women intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally—or placebo/no placebo, and if they reported data on one or more of the prespecified outcomes. Quasirandom study designs were not eligible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Identifying studies: Information sources and search strategy</title>
<p>The search strategy developed by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref016">16</xref>]. This identified trials from monthly searching of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), weekly searches of MEDLINE, monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO), hand searches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences, and weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</p>
<p>Search terms used were [repeat or multiple] and [antenatal or prenatal] and [corticosteroid* or steroid* or glucocorticoid* or betamethason* or dexamethason* or hydrocortison*]. Date of last search was 20 January 2015. The WHO/CTRP portal was accessed to identify any recently completed or ongoing trials. There was no language restriction on searches. Trialists within the PRECISE Group were asked if they knew of any unpublished or other trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Study selection processes</title>
<p>Eligibility of identified trials was assessed independently and unblinded by two members of the PRECISE Project Team (PFM and TKM). Any differences regarding eligibility were resolved by discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Data collection processes and data items</title>
<p>The Chairperson of the PRECISE Project Team (CAC) contacted the investigators of all eligible studies to invite them to join the PRECISE Trialist Group and to include IPD data from their trial in the IPD-MA. Prespecified variables were developed and defined by the PRECISE Trialist Group. Investigators were asked if these variables were available or could be derived for their study, and a coding system was developed.</p>
<p>Deidentified data were collected on all randomised women. These included baseline data for descriptive purposes and analyses (reason at risk of preterm birth, gestational age at trial entry, plurality of the pregnancy, expected date of birth) and details of the intervention planned and given (date of randomisation, allocated intervention, type and dose of antenatal corticosteroids given, mode of administration, number and frequency of repeat courses given) together with the infant, childhood, and maternal outcomes to allow the planned analyses.</p>
<p>The data from the individual trials were recoded as needed and stored in a secure database only accessible by the PRECISE Data Management Group. The individual trialists were asked to verify their coded data prior to analyses. Data were checked for internal consistency, extreme or missing values, errors, and consistency with published reports. Randomisation methods and intervention details were cross-checked against trial protocols, clinical record forms, and published reports for all trials. The PRECISE biostatistician (MV), project coordinator (TKM), and data manager (SZ) liaised with the trialists to check any inconsistencies and missing data. The final IPD dataset prepared from each trial was sent to the trialist for verification before being included in the full PRECISE dataset. Data items collected are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002771.s012">S2 Text</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Risk of bias assessment in individual studies</title>
<p>Risk of bias for each study was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref017">17</xref>] by two members of the PRECISE Project Team (PFM and TKM) independently, with differences resolved by discussion. Each study was judged to have high, low, or unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias), allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias), incomplete outcome data (possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data), selective reporting (checking for possible reporting bias), and other bias (checking for bias due to problems not already covered). The magnitude and direction of the bias and whether it was considered likely to affect the findings were assessed. If any aspect was unclear, additional information was sought from the trialists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Specification of outcomes and effect measures</title>
<p>The primary prespecified outcomes for the infant were serious outcome (defined by the PRECISE Group as any of death [fetus, neonatal, infant, or child], severe respiratory disease as defined by the trialists, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage, chronic lung disease [oxygen dependent at 36 weeks postmenstrual age], definite necrotising enterocolitis, stage 3 or worse retinopathy of prematurity in the better eye, or cystic periventricular leucomalacia); use of respiratory support (defined as mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airways pressure, ECMO, oscillatory ventilation, or any other form of assisted ventilation); and birth weight z-scores.</p>
<p>The primary prespecified outcome for the child was death or any neurosensory disability at childhood follow-up (defined as developmental delay or intellectual impairment [developmental quotient or intelligence quotient more than one standard deviation below the mean], cerebral palsy [abnormality of tone with motor dysfunction], blindness ([corrected visual acuity worse than 6/60 in the better eye], or deafness [hearing loss requiring amplification or worse]).</p>
<p>The primary prespecified outcome for the woman was maternal sepsis (defined as chorioamnionitis during labour, pyrexia after trial entry requiring the use of antibiotics, puerperal sepsis, or intrapartum fever requiring the use of antibiotics or postnatal pyrexia).</p>
<p>Secondary outcomes were prespecified in the PRECISE IPD-MA protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002771.s012">S2 Text</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Synthesis methods and additional analyses</title>
<p>The statistical analysis plan was prepared by the PRECISE Data Management Group and agreed by the PRECISE Trialist Group. One-step IPD-MA analyses were conducted on the checked IPD from all the trials. All randomised participants with outcome data available were included in the analyses, performed on an intention-to-treat basis by treatment allocation at randomisation.</p>
<p>Binary outcomes were analysed using log binomial regression models with results presented as RRs with 95% CIs and associated two-sided <italic>p</italic> values. Continuous outcomes were analysed using linear regression models, and results were presented as differences in means with 95% CI and two-sided <italic>p</italic> values. Correlations between outcomes due to multiple births were taken into account using generalised estimating equations (GEEs) for infant and child outcomes. Differences in treatment effect between prespecified subgroups were assessed by testing a treatment-by-subgroup interaction term within the model. A treatment-by-trial interaction term was included in the model to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect across trials. When excessive statistical heterogeneity in treatment effect or inconsistency across trials was detected, then the rationale for combining trials was questioned and the source of heterogeneity explored.</p>
<p>For growth outcomes, z-scores were calculated at birth, hospital discharge, and follow-up based on WHO Child Growth Standards and British 1990 reference data, reanalysed 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref019">19</xref>]. For composite outcomes, some trials did not collect all variables used to define the composite. Analysis of composite outcomes included all trials that collected at least one variable used to define the composite. Participants were classified as having the outcome if they experienced any of the events contributing to the composite for which data were available and classified as not having the outcome otherwise. Statistical significance was assessed at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 level. NNT was calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR): NNT = 1/ARR, where ARR = Control Event Rate minus Experimental Event Rate.</p>
<p>Analyses presented do not correspond to published estimates from individual trials in every case because trialists may have defined outcomes differently or prespecified different criteria for inclusion or exclusion of data from their analysis. Discrepancies between published estimates and PRECISE estimates do not imply that one or the other is incorrect.</p>

<title>Number of courses of repeat prenatal corticosteroids received</title>
<p>The number of courses of repeat prenatal corticosteroids received varied by trial due to the different treatment protocols. The number of courses also varied by participant characteristics such as the gestational age at which study treatment commenced, with women commencing at an earlier gestational age having more time to receive more courses of treatment provided birth did not occur. Half of the children in the analyses were exposed to only one course of treatment. Only 3% of children were exposed to six or more courses of treatment. CIs for this subgroup were therefore wide because of the smaller number of participants in the analysis. Because the number of courses received was a postrandomisation measurement, these analyses were considered exploratory, although still clinically important, comparisons. For the primary outcomes of serious outcome and use of respiratory support for the infant, treatment effects differed according to the number of courses of repeat treatments received. Benefits of repeat corticosteroid were observed for infants who were exposed to between 2 to 5 courses of repeat corticosteroids compared with infants exposed to only a single repeat course or 6 or more repeat courses. There were greater reductions in birth weight and length z-scores for infants exposed to 4 or more repeat courses and in head circumference for infants exposed to two or more repeat courses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002771.s008">S8 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec039">
<title>Summary of evidence</title>
<p>The major findings from the PRECISE IPD-MA are that for women at risk of preterm birth, use of repeat prenatal corticosteroids following an initial course 7 or more days previously does not reduce the risk of serious outcome for their infant but does reduce the risk of their infant needing respiratory support after birth. The number of women who need to be treated to prevent one infant needing respiratory support is 21 (95% CI 14 to 41). This benefit is associated with their infant being less likely to have respiratory distress syndrome, having less severe respiratory disease, and being less likely to require resuscitation at birth, surfactant treatment, and oxygen supplementation. These respiratory benefits are not at the expense of any short-term complications for the mother. However, z-scores for weight are significantly lower in infants whose mothers receive repeat prenatal corticosteroids (mean difference 80 g), as are z-scores for head circumference and length at birth and the proportion of infants born small for gestational age. The clinical significance of the reduction in birth weight z-scores is unclear. There appear to be no longer-term clinical benefits or harms of repeat prenatal corticosteroids in childhood, as assessed by neurosensory disabilities, respiratory outcomes, or behaviour, and few differences in body size, although weight z-scores are lower by ‒0.11 SD (95% CI ‒0.19 to ‒0.03). The clinical importance of this reduction in weight z-score at early childhood follow-up, in the absence of clear evidence of effects on head size, length/height, or neurosensory outcomes is unclear. There is also a small reduction in systolic blood pressure of uncertain clinical importance. Ex-preterm survivors have higher blood pressure in late adolescence or early adulthood than do term controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref035">35</xref>], which may predispose them to more cardiovascular disease in adult life. Since blood pressure tracks through childhood into late adolescence in preterm survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref036">36</xref>], a small reduction in child blood pressure may be a long-term benefit of repeat doses of corticosteroids. Follow-up into adolescence and adult life is needed to clarify this.</p>
<p>The results from this IPD-MA are consistent with the aggregate meta-analysis in the Cochrane review assessing the use of repeat prenatal corticosteroids in women who remain at risk of preterm birth after an initial course of corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref009">9</xref>]. The new information that this IPD-MA has clarified is that no specific subgroup of infants benefitted more or less from exposure to repeat prenatal corticosteroids, including plurality, the gestational ages when repeat treatment was first given, or the time prior to birth the last repeat treatment was given.</p>
<p>In three subgroup analyses involving postrandomisation events (the minimum actual interval between repeat treatment courses, the number of repeat prenatal corticosteroids courses received, and the total dose of corticosteroids received), differences were seen between subgroups. The risk of a serious outcome for the infant and the need for respiratory support were reduced when exposed to at least 2 repeat treatment courses and to total doses of more than 24 mg of repeat treatment. Death at any time was reduced with exposure to total doses of between &gt;24 mg to 48 mg.</p>
<p>The number of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment courses and the total dose of repeat prenatal corticosteroids also affected body size z-scores at birth, with exposure to increasing numbers of repeat treatment courses or larger total doses associated with greater reductions in growth. There were greater reductions in birth weight for infants exposed to 4 or more repeat courses. To provide clinical benefit with the least harm in women who remain at high risk of preterm birth 7 or more days after an initial course of corticosteroids, it would seem prudent to limit the use of any repeat corticosteroids to a total dose of between &gt;24 mg to 48 mg and a maximum of 3 repeat courses of treatment.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>IPD-MA is recognised as the gold standard for systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref011">11</xref>]. One of the strengths of this IPD-MA is that all the trialists were willing to be part of the PRECISE Group collaborative initiative and provide their data. All the trials used betamethasone—there are no IPD-MA data for dexamethasone.</p>
<p>In this way, we were able to include IPD from all the known completed randomised trials of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment given to women at risk of preterm birth to benefit their infants. The IPD-MA findings provide the best available evidence for decision makers at this time.</p>
<p>We have recently updated the search for trials (date of search 22 January 2019). No additional randomised trials of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment given 7 or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids were identified. Two of the trials have reported health outcomes in later childhood, one at 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref037">37</xref>] and the other 6–8 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref038">38</xref>]. Both trials found no differences between children exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids and those not in the risk of death or neurodevelopmental disability or in body size measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Not all trials collected or were able to provide data for all of the prespecified subgroups. This limited the power to be able to detect overall or subgroup differences because event rates are low for some important maternal, infant, and childhood clinical outcomes. Neonatal hypoglycaemia was not reported in any of the trials but has recently been linked with use of antenatal corticosteroids in the late preterm period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref039">39</xref>], so it should be assessed in any future primary studies. Several of the planned subgroup analyses were for events that happened after randomisation, including number of repeat treatments given, the timing prior to birth repeat treatment was given, and the total dose received. Interpretation of these results should be cautious because postrandomisation events may be affected by the treatment given. Although such events are more subject to bias, our purpose was to identify mothers and infants within subgroups who would benefit most from treatment. This would enable use of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment to be optimally targeted.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The PRECISE IPD-MA found that repeat prenatal corticosteroids given to women at ongoing risk of preterm birth after an initial course reduces the likelihood of their infant needing respiratory support after birth and leads to other respiratory benefits. Body size measurements at birth are lower in infants whose mothers had received repeat prenatal corticosteroids, and the reductions in weight z-scores and systolic blood pressure seen at childhood follow-up are of uncertain clinical importance. No longer-term clinical benefits or harms are seen in childhood for neurosensory disabilities, respiratory outcomes, or behaviour.</p>
<p>Prenatal corticosteroids are easy to administer, relatively inexpensive, and are effective at reducing the need for respiratory support that preterm infants often require. Recommendations to use repeat prenatal corticosteroids when indicated are now included within the WHO recommendations on interventions to improve preterm birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref040">40</xref>] and several national clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref042">42</xref>]. More widespread adoption could lead to significant global health and economic benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002771.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>It is reassuring that the respiratory benefit is seen among varying reasons for risk of preterm birth, in singleton and multiple pregnancies, and across a range of preterm gestational ages when repeat treatment courses are first given and times prior to birth the last repeat treatment is given. Because the benefits of reduced serious outcome and need for respiratory support for the infant are accompanied by a reduction in measures of body size at birth that are related to the number of repeat treatment courses and total dose of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment given, it would seem prudent to limit the use of repeat corticosteroids in women who remain at high risk of preterm birth to a total dose of between &gt;24 mg to 48 mg and a maximum of three repeat courses of treatment.</p>
