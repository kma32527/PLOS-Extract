<title>Background</title>
<p>It is estimated that around 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections, with experts predicting an alarming possible increase to 10 million deaths each year by 2050 and major future challenges to the way we practice medicine and surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref002">2</xref>]. It was welcome news that tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and infectious diseases along with health system strengthening were featured at the G20 summit (November, 2018), under the wider aim of improving sustainability, and progress towards more coordinated international efforts will be reviewed at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (September 2018) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref003">3</xref>]; but how are health professionals, managers, and policymakers assuring coordinated efforts within human healthcare? Globally, there has been much emphasis on a ‘One Health’ approach that involves connecting the health of humans, animals, and the environment to tackle AMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref002">2</xref>]. This is driving much-needed antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activities in animal production sectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref004">4</xref>]. However, we have yet to achieve and establish joined-up approaches within human health. This paper, therefore, focuses on an analysis of multisectoral AMS in human health. AMS remains a cornerstone for addressing AMR with numerous initiatives implemented with varying degrees of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref006">6</xref>]. A critical gap we have identified is that approaches have largely focused efforts separately in primary care or secondary care, and have also heavily targeted medical prescribers. In this paper, we propose that policymakers, clinical leaders, and healthcare managers assess and consolidate AMS activities across the whole health economy, and we use a novel, to our knowledge, approach to demonstrate how such an assessment can be made. We present the extent to which existing AMS initiatives are multisectoral or integrated across a whole health economy within individual countries and their impact on antimicrobial-related outcomes. We then highlight some challenges and key considerations for developing and harnessing potential benefits of integrated AMS approaches.</p>

<title>Need for a whole-health–economy approach</title>
<p>Health systems are required to deliver best outcomes efficiently, facing the challenges of macroeconomic constraints, technology costs, and increasing public need and demand. Consolidating the sometimes disparate programs and initiatives within the health sector is necessary, and integrated models of care across primary, secondary, tertiary, and long-term care can help with coordinated implementation of AMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref007">7</xref>]. Assessment of the degree of integration of AMS across the whole health economy is essential if we are to understand how a ‘One Health’ approach to addressing AMR may be achieved. Much AMS activity has been concentrated in hospital settings, creating a practical but somewhat artificial boundary that neglects bidirectional influences between hospital and community care services. Antimicrobial use in the community is associated with the development of AMR in and outside hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref008">8</xref>]. Furthermore, use of accident and emergency departments by ambulatory patients contributes to fragmented care and overuse of antimicrobials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref009">9</xref>]. The way people access healthcare has evolved: the availability of blended care and complex patient-care pathways in some countries allows for patient-centred approaches as well as more rational use of services. The availability of antimicrobials without a prescription in some countries and increasing availability of online pharmacies provides an additional challenge for AMS. Fundamentally, AMS is lagging behind the advances made in health service delivery and patient behaviours by remaining sector-based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>What does integration mean and how can we assess it?</title>
<p>The One Health perspective on integration involves multiple sectors communicating and working together to design and implement programs, policies, legislation, and research to achieve better public health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref002">2</xref>]. In practice, in England, new integrated care models are being developed through 50 selected collaborative organisations that will inform potential redesign of the whole health system, and 25 integrated care pioneer sites to test new and different ways of joining up health and social care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref010">10</xref>]. Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport established nine pioneer sites to integrate clinical and community services with the aim of achieving ‘better healthcare at lower cost’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref011">11</xref>]. In the United States, accountable care organisations—which typically involve multiple physician practices and at least one hospital—have been established to improve the quality of care while lowering costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref012">12</xref>]. However, AMS is not explicit in any of these wider health-system–integration models.</p>
<p>To further complicate matters, there is no standard definition of integration, and a number of integrated care models have been proposed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref017">17</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002774.s002">S1 Table</xref></bold>). In this analysis, we define and summarise the extent of integration based on the six facets of critical health system function described by Atun and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref018">18</xref>] because it provides a practical level of granularity on the concept of intervention integration and is specific to healthcare (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002774.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>). We appreciate that there may be unpublished initiatives. However, as a novel, to our knowledge, analysis of this issue, the focus was on examining evidence of integrated AMS initiatives from the literature so that some measures of impact and associated context can be synthesised. Our aim was to identify practical considerations to support policymakers seeking to develop integrated AMS across the whole health economy. We carried out a systematic search of the literature published between January, 2006 and December, 2018, selected relevant articles using prespecified inclusion criteria, and reviewed evaluative studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002774.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). This paper describes an analysis based on 16 AMS initiatives from nine high-income countries and one low-middle–income country (<bold>Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002774.t002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002774.t003">3</xref></bold>).</p>

<fn id="t003fn001"><p>AMS initiatives, models, programs, and interventions are terms that are used interchangeably in the literature. Here, we use ‘AMS model’ to refer to a proposed simplified framework that outlines the structure, processes and intended outcomes associated with the goal of AMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref035">35</xref>]. Examples are the internationally recognised AMS model for hospitals from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref036">36</xref>] and British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref037">37</xref>]. An AMS intervention is any action taken with the aim of improving antimicrobial use, e.g., use of delayed/back-up antibiotic prescriptions or implementation of infection specialist approval for restricted antimicrobials. Accordingly, an AMS program describes a coordinated effort to improve antimicrobial use that involves two or more AMS interventions. <bold>Abbreviations</bold>: AMS, antimicrobial stewardship; ESBL-E, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae; GP, general practitioner; LID, long-term care facility infectious disease.</p></fn>

<title>Extent of AMS integration across the whole health economy</title>
<p>Integration mapping of the 16 initiatives based on <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002774.t001">Table 1</xref></bold> suggests that a range of approaches have been used to achieve multisectoral AMS (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002774.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). Full integration in Planning was often considered a key factor for establishing many initiatives coupled with an integrated Stewardship and Governance approach. Integration in these two facets was mainly achieved through expansion of the AMS program, by which the primary governance responsibilities remained with the host institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref033">33</xref>], rather than through establishment of new structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref025">25</xref>]. AMS initiatives that had a shared governance structure across healthcare organisations (i.e., partially integrated) were either national programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref027">27</xref>] or state-wide programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref031">31</xref>]. While these provide examples of an integrated AMS governance approach, effective governance is likely to require much more than a multistakeholder approach to plan and deliver services; a mixed regulatory and persuasive strategy including effective public engagement is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref038">38</xref>]. In our analysis, nine initiatives were partially integrated for Demand Generation, showing a potential missed opportunity for this critical facet that includes raising awareness and increasing engagement with the public, practitioners, health service managers, and policymakers. Monitoring and Evaluation relate to the functions around data collection, analysis, reporting, and performance-management systems. Full integration was identified in one initiative in which the health system oversaw these functions regionally or was responsible for these functions directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref033">33</xref>]. More often, data collection and analyses were managed by the wider health system; however, performance management roles were not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref032">32</xref>]. Financing relates to the pooling of funds/funding source, cross-program use of funds, and provider payment methods involved in the AMS initiative. The majority of initiatives did not report on how they were or should be financed or how the funds were or should be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref032">32</xref>].

Overall, 11 studies evaluated the AMS initiative using mainly quasiexperimental study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref039">39</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002774.s003">S2 Table</xref></bold>).

<title>Opportunities and implications for policy</title>
<p>Especially when planning new initiatives, a health system function framework as employed here can be critical to minimise duplication of effort and achieve efficiencies from the viewpoint of healthcare professionals and service users. Our assessment has highlighted strengths of initiatives associated with beneficial outcomes, and we present these as three interconnected practical recommendations for policymakers to consider.</p>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>A successful integrated AMS approach can be developed through expansion of an existing AMS program</title>
<p>When compared to hospital-based AMS, strategies within primary care and long-term care have generally been slow to develop. Outside of hospitals, structural constraints sometimes include undefined AMS leadership at the organisational level and therefore unclear responsibilities around local AMS objectives and lack of timely pathways to specialist support. An integrated AMS model, particularly one involving secondary care, can overcome some of the community-based issues by either extending existing secondary-care AMS programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref033">33</xref>], adapting from established frameworks for secondary-care AMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref030">30</xref>], or creating a joint platform for multisectoral AMS strategies to be presented, developed, monitored, and/or shared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref027">27</xref>]. It therefore follows that an integrated AMS program may also be able to address process issues such as fragmented and timely follow-up of patients, their symptom progression, and medical management. However, further research is required to investigate this. Critically, there is a need for establishing sustainable funding for AMS teams working beyond hospital settings that is not solely derived from cost savings through reduced drug expenditure. Instead, funding for developing and supporting AMS teams should be considered within the patient safety and healthcare-quality–related spending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref040">40</xref>]. Irrespective of these issues, adoption and uptake of AMS strategies are likely to be influenced by the underlying health system and culture in a country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Opportunities for success establishing consistent communication channels with responsibilities and common goals clearly defined</title>
<p>Few health systems appear to have effective mechanisms for sharing and disseminating learning about AMS, leading to small-scale local initiatives. Strengthening communication between commissioners, providers, and consumers by having more structured and clear communication pathways, such as in the Strama model developed in Sweden and the similarly structured Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group, can be an effective way to develop, disseminate, and monitor ways to improve AMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Capitalise on existing resources and processes</title>
<p>Patients and the public have a pivotal role in infection prevention and management, yet failure to involve and engage with them in decision-making or achieve sustained behaviour change remains a problem in all health sector settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref042">42</xref>]. We found few examples of patient or public involvement in the design and delivery of integrated AMS initiatives (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002774.t003">Table 3</xref></bold>). However, we know from other studies that patient misconceptions about AMR and what constitutes appropriate antibiotic use is a major driver for inappropriate behaviours around antibiotic use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref043">43</xref>]. Furthermore, our stakeholder analysis suggests that there are potentially more opportunities for integration, particularly involving primary care service providers. For instance, in the United Kingdom, it is well recognised that nurses and pharmacists in the community are generally more accessible to the public than general practitioners (GPs). The continuing expansion of their roles in the community, which not only provides support to patients but also reduces the burden on primary care physicians, is testament to this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002774.ref045">45</xref>]. However, there are few AMS initiatives that capitalise on these valuable resources to deliver integrated AMS—by this, we mean appropriate antibiotic access and preservation and knowledge mobilisation for promoting AMS that is aligned with primary, secondary, tertiary, and long-term institutional care sectors. We found little involvement of dental practitioners in most multisectoral AMS initiatives, which is another missed opportunity. Further work is required to investigate such AMS roles in the community and embed these more widely as applicable in the respective country. A more robust evidence base is needed to establish the effectiveness of integrated AMS initiatives and specifically consider contextual antecedents to better inform future sustained improvements.</p>
<p>Overall, we urge policymakers, clinical leaders, and healthcare managers to assess and consider consolidating AMS activities across the whole health economy. Each of these stakeholders have an important role to drive and support clinicians, researchers, and research-active patients to carry out quality research that will inform the development of more robust evidence-based policies and guidelines. The analytic framework presented here can be used to assess the extent of integration of existing or planned multisectoral AMS initiatives, and we have outlined three areas with practical considerations towards how future integration of AMS initiatives across the whole health economy may be achieved. Ultimately, integrated AMS must prove itself as an essential element of efficient redesign if it is to deliver sustained patient benefits.</p>
