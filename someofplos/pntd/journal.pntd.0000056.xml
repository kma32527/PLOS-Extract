Infection is acquired during occupational or recreational exposure to contaminated soil and water, organisms gaining entry to the accidental human host via abrasions or less commonly the conjunctiva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>. Disease may also be acquired through direct contact with infected animals, and occurs in farmers, veterinarians and abattoir workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>. The disease has a worldwide distribution but is most common in tropical regions where incidence peaks during the rainy season <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Bharti1">[2]</xref>. Clinical manifestations are broad ranging and follow a biphasic pattern in which a septicemic phase lasting around one week is followed by an immune phase during which antibodies are raised and organisms localize in tissues and appear in urine. Much disease is sub-clinical or mild, but patients reaching medical attention usually have an acute febrile illness associated with one or more of chills, headache, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion, and abdominal symptoms which can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>. Leptospirosis has been described as anicteric or icteric; the former represents 85–90% of cases and is associated with a good prognosis, while the latter may be associated with multisystem disease involving particularly the kidneys, lung and heart, with a reported mortality rate of 5–15% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease in Thailand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Tangkanakul1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Ellis1">[4]</xref>. Before 1996, the number of cases reported to the Department of Disease Control (DDC) was approximately 200 per year. Leptospirosis was sporadic and reported mainly from central and southern regions. A marked change occurred in the subsequent decade, with a year-on-year rise from 398 cases in 1996 to a peak of 14,285 cases in 2000. This was followed by a continuous decline with 2,868 cases reported during 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Disease1">[5]</xref>. Reporting in Thailand is voluntary and probably represents a small proportion of true cases. There was also a shift in the geographical distribution, with the majority of cases being reported in the northeast. One explanation for the outbreak is that it was related to the emergence of a biologically successful clone of <italic>Leptospira</italic>. This possibility is supported by a study of 44 leptospiral strains obtained from humans during three outbreaks in Brazilian urban centers, in which typing using arbitrarily primed PCR demonstrated that 43 isolates exhibited very similar fingerprints suggestive of a clonal population of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Pereira1">[6]</xref>. In addition, during a large urban outbreak in Brazil, <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni was isolated from 87% of cases with positive blood cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Ko1">[7]</xref>. Although it is currently unclear to what extent genetic relatedness can be informed by serotype alone, this observation is consistent with the majority of cases being caused by the expansion of a single outbreak clone.</p><p>The aim of this study was to define the molecular epidemiology of <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains isolated from humans during the Thai outbreak, and to relate this to the maintenance animal host. To achieve this, an MLST scheme was developed for <italic>L. interrogans</italic>, the major cause of human disease. This approach has the advantage over existing typing schemes in that the data generated are amenable to detailed evolutionary analysis. MLST data are also readily comparable via the internet, and establishment of an MLST scheme therefore paves the way for future studies. Our results confirm the emergence of a dominant clone of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Autumnalis; this was the major cause of human disease, and was found in a maintenance host which was defined as the bandicoot rat.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and bacterial strains</title><p>A prospective study was undertaken at Udon Thani General Hospital in northeast Thailand to identify patients with leptospiremia. This 1,000 bed provincial hospital serves a predominantly rural population, &gt;80% of whom are rice farmers and other agricultural workers who are repeatedly exposed to rats and water contaminated by rat urine. Patients were recruited during consecutive months from October 2000 to December 2002, then for four months during each rainy season (July to October inclusive) during 2003 and 2005. The reason for this pattern of recruitment is that leptospirosis is predominantly a rainy season disease. Consecutive adult patients (≥15 years) presenting with fever (&gt;37.8°C) of unknown cause were recruited following informed and written consent. Patients with a blood smear positive for malaria parasites or other definable infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection were excluded. The clinical features of leptospirosis are broad ranging and similar to other acute febrile illnesses common to this geographic area such as scrub typhus and dengue fever. In view of this, all adult patients presenting with acute undifferentiated fever were cultured to detect leptospiremia. A 10 ml blood sample was drawn on the day of admission into a sterile tube containing 250 units of sodium heparin for <italic>Leptospira</italic> culture.

Of the 115 isolates obtained from patients in Udon Thani, 104 were available for molecular characterization. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on at least one representative of each ST. One hundred isolates were <italic>L. interrogans</italic>, 3 were <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> and 1 was <italic>L. kirschneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000056.s001">Table S1</xref>). Three strains (<italic>L. borpetersenii</italic> serovar Javanica) failed to amplify at five or six MLST loci but were identical to each other at <italic>glmU</italic>; these strains are not considered further. The 101 isolates from Udon Thani corresponded to 12 STs but a single ST predominated, with ST34 accounting for 77 (76%), all of which were identified as serovar Autumnalis. Of the remainder, 8 isolates belonged to ST46, 4 isolates were ST49, and the remaining nine sequence types consisted of one or two isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000056.s001">Table S1</xref>). A single isolate defined as ST41 was also serovar Autumnalis but this strain is unrelated to ST34, showing divergence at all seven alleles. Thus two strains sharing the same serovar can be distantly related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>, possibly because serovars may arise independently in differently lineages by evolutionary convergence, or by horizontal gene transfer.</p><p>To explore the role of the dominant clone ST34 in the putative outbreak of leptospirosis, the proportion of <italic>Leptospira</italic> ST34 was determined for each year of the study in Udon Thani (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This demonstrated that the dominance of ST34 declined over time, being replaced by a range of other sequence types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000056-t001">Table 1</xref>). The proportion of clinical <italic>Leptospira</italic> isolates that were ST34 fell from 85% in 2000/2001 to 64% in 2002/2003 and 56% in 2004/2005 (years combined because of small numbers in 2004 and 2005 - χ<sup>2</sup> for trend = 6.61, p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Dominance of ST34 as a cause of leptospirosis across Thailand</title><p>To define the extent to which ST34 was distributed across Thailand, a further 24 unselected isolates obtained in 2003 and 2004 from human cases of leptospirosis from across the country were evaluated. The total proportion of isolates corresponding to ST34 was 17/24 (71%) (two strains were non-typable <italic>L. borpetersenii</italic>). The geographic distribution was as follows: Lumpang, 1/2 isolates; Rayong, 1/1 isolate; Chumphon, 2/4 isolates; Loei, 9/9 isolates; Ratchaburi, 1/1 isolate; Yasothon, 1/1 isolate; Nakon Ratchasima, 2/5 isolates; and Maha Sarakham, 0/1 isolate. This is not significantly different from the proportion of ST34 in isolates from Udon Thani in the same years (Fisher's exact p = 0.37), and confirms that the outbreak clone ST34 was widely distributed throughout Thailand and formed the predominant virulent strain at the time of the outbreak. A further six STs were identified in this collection, four of which were not observed in the Udon Thani collection. These data provide further support for the picture of a single dominant clone (ST34) associated with an increased incidence of human disease, within a “background” population of higher genotypic diversity. One strain (ST22 obtained in Lumpang province) was serovar Autumnalis, but showed divergence at 5/7 alleles from ST34.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>The bandicoot rat as a maintenance host</title><p>To determine whether a link could be identified between ST34 and a maintenance host, 8 isolates available from rodents captured in northeast Thailand were characterized. Seven strains (from <italic>B. indica</italic> (6) and <italic>B. savilei</italic> (1)), were <italic>L. interrogans</italic> ST34. This confirms the predominance of the outbreak strain in a maintenance host, which in this case appears to be the bandicoot rat. The remaining isolate from <italic>R. rattus</italic> was <italic>L. interrogans</italic>, ST49 which was also isolated from human cases in Udon Thani in 2001/2 (n = 4) and Nakhon Ratchasima in 2004 (n = 1). This does not exclude the possibility of additional maintenance hosts, but rodents trapped in agricultural areas reflect the species to which farmers are commonly exposed.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Thai isolates are clonally restricted compared with reference collections</title><p>To place the Thai isolates within a global context, we selected a total of 76 reference strains representative of the species of the <italic>Leptospira</italic> strain population in Thailand but recovered from diverse geographical sources (<italic>L. interrogans</italic> 65, <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> 3, <italic>L. kirschneri</italic> 8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000056.s001">Table S1</xref>). From our Thai sample of 123 clinical isolates, 16 STs were identified (0.13 ST per isolate; 5 strains of <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> being non-typable by MLST). In contrast, MLST revealed 59 STs for 73 reference strains (0.81 ST per strain), revealing that the reference strains are far more diverse, and that only a small fraction of the global diversity was recovered in the Thai sample. The reference <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> strains did not amplify at all seven loci, and so are again scored as non-typable. The largest clones within the reference collection were ST17 and ST37 (both with 4 isolates); one ST contained 3 isolates, 7 STs contained two isolates and the remaining 49 sequence types had one representative strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000056.s001">Table S1</xref>). ST34 was not represented in the reference collection. One strain was serovar Autumnalis (Akiyami A, ST27) but this was unrelated to ST34 and was much more similar to the non-ST34 Autumnalis strain isolated in Udon Thani (ST41). This analysis indicates that the strains causing human disease in Thailand are more clonally restricted than reference strains from variable hosts and geographical locations, and that the population genetic structure of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> is highly diverse when considering non-ST34 isolates. This further supports the argument that the predominance of ST34 during the Thai outbreak does not reflect a clonal population structure, and is consistent with a temporary selective advantage.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> ST34</title><p>A phylogenetic analysis was performed to shed light on the emergence of ST34. All 204 typable strains (excluding 8 non-typable <italic>L. borgpetersenii</italic> isolates) were evaluated to identify the close relatives of ST34. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows two neighbour-joining trees based on the concatenated sequences of the seven MLST genes (3165-bp). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2a</xref> was constructed using all 204 isolates. There was a clear distinction between the two species <italic>L. interrogans</italic> and <italic>L. kirschnerii</italic> which was also noted in loci individually (not shown). ST34 isolates accounted for almost half of the tree, illustrating the numerical dominance of this clone. As the branching order of this tree is unclear, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2b</xref> shows a neighbour joining tree for just the STs highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. Of the four Autumnalis STs, ST27 and ST41 appear closely related in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2a and 2b</xref>, but unrelated to the other Autumnalis STs ST22 and ST34. This latter pair appears to be closely related in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2b</xref> reveals this is an artifact of the poorly resolved topology of this tree. The different clones sampled from Thailand in this study did not form a single cluster but were dispersed throughout the tree. This suggests that they have not all diverged from a single common Thai ancestor. The lack of evidence for strong geographical structure is consistent with high rates of migration via the rodent (or possibly human) host. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000056-g002">Figure 2b</xref> identifies ST29 (reference strain Bangkinang 1) as a close relative of ST34; this was isolated from a human in Indonesia. Other close relatives of ST34 are also reference strains from Indonesia and Malaysia (not shown), although the significance of this is unclear as the tree is not robustly supported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Human outbreaks of leptospirosis are well documented in the literature, as are clusters of cases linked by specific water-related activities or occupations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Bharti1">[2]</xref>. Outbreaks in Thailand and elsewhere are often linked to climatic events such as flooding and the concomitant increase in human exposure to environments contaminated by <italic>Leptospira</italic>. The precipitous increase in reported cases of leptospirosis in Thailand commencing in 1999, followed by the sustained incidence during the ensuing years, could not be explained by persistent climatic change or sequential episodes of regional flooding. Changes in reporting practice can lead to marked changes in the perceived disease incidence, although this does not explain the marked rise and fall in reported cases over time. An alternative explanation is that this was associated with the presence of a biologically successful clone of pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic>. In this study, we developed and applied robust typing methods to provide several lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis. This clone is likely to harbour an adaptive (competitive) advantage, albeit transiently. Possible explanations include a selective advantage for ST34 in the maintenance host (the bandicoot rat) leading to a higher bacterial load and higher shedding from urine, or a survival advantage once shed into environment, such as increased resistance to desiccation. Both possibilities are amenable to testing in the laboratory setting. Alternatively, ST34 may have a greater propensity to cause human disease compared with other circulating clones. Although difficult to test, the finding that ST34 co-existed in the environment with a large number of other STs but caused most disease would be supportive of this hypothesis. The virulence of ST34 as reflected by severity of human disease was not assessed in patients presenting to Udon Thani hospital, since the comparator group was small and caused by 11 other STs. The emergence of ST34 may have predated the outbreak, and this is difficult to refute since no strains were available from the period prior to the outbreak. However, the decline in frequency of ST34 as a cause of leptospirosis over time is consistent with the suggestion that there is a direct link between the clone and the outbreak.</p><p>Previous studies of human outbreaks have largely relied on serological methods to confirm clinical cases and to define indirectly the infecting isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett1">[1]</xref>. The standard serological method (microscopic agglutination test, MAT) provides a broad idea of serogroups responsible for leptospirosis in a given geographic area, but in one study the predominant serogroups at a titer of ≥100 correctly predicted less than 50% of serovars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Levett2">[13]</xref>. Arbitrarily primed PCR has been used successfully to study human outbreaks in Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Pereira1">[6]</xref>, and to characterize 40 isolates recovered from humans between 1995 and 2001 on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India, 32 of which were a clone with a fingerprint matching that <italic>of L. interrogans</italic> sensu stricto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Roy1">[14]</xref>. Here, we use the more discriminatory and robust method of MLST to identify clusters of closely related isolates. The use of multiple gene loci is essential, as frequent recombination within the population would make inferences based on single gene loci unreliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Hanage1">[15]</xref>. This study clearly demonstrates the advantages of bacterial isolation in that it permits detailed typing studies to characterize local populations and outbreaks.</p><p>The MLST scheme presented here was developed primarily to characterize the isolates responsible for the outbreak of leptospirosis unfolding in Thailand in the early 2000s (i.e. <italic>L. interrogans</italic> and the closely related L. <italic>L. kirschneri</italic>), and is not designed for the characterization of the genus as a whole. Nevertheless, the scheme presented here demonstrates the utility of MLST for <italic>Leptospira</italic> for characterizing isolates from a clinical perspective. For more taxonomic or genus-wide evolutionary studies, or for disease caused by other <italic>Leptospira</italic> species, the primer sequences could be refined in order to broaden the phylogenetic range over which they amplify, or alternatively the loci used by Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>. may be employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000056-Ahmed1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our observations provide strong support for the hypothesis that the ST34 clone was associated with the 1998–2003 outbreak of leptospirosis in northeast Thailand. The existence of this strain collection now provides a unique opportunity to study the basis for pathogenicity and disease acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pntd.0000056.s001" mimetype="application/x-excel" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000056.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Strain details and MLST results for <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. included in this study</p><p>(0.05 MB XLS)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the staff of the Medical Department of Udon Thani General Hospital and Sunee Chueasuwanchai (Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University) for assistance with the prospective clinical study.
