                turning point in the long and notorious history of some of humanity's
                oldest diseases.</p><p>The values and principles embodied in primary health, the United Nations Millennium
                Declaration, and initiatives such as <italic>PLoS Neglected Tropical
                Diseases</italic> are all about fairness, solidarity, collective responsibility,
                participatory approaches, and a duty to take care of vulnerable groups. Equity is a
                fundamental principle of health development. Access to life-saving and
                health-promoting interventions should not be denied for unjust reasons, including an
                inability to pay. The free availability of leading research articles will benefit
                decision-makers and diseases control managers worldwide. It will also motivate
                scientists, both in developing and developed countries.</p><p>The prospects for reducing the enormous burden caused by neglected tropical diseases
                have changed dramatically in just the past few years. We can identify a succession
                of well-planned actions, firmly rooted in evidence, which have paved the way
                forward. These actions hold lessons for other areas of public health, and deserve to
                be widely publicized.</p><p>Strongly associated with poverty, these diseases frequently overlap geographically.
                They tend to cluster in places where housing is substandard, drinking water is
                unsafe, sanitation is poor, access to health care is limited or non-existent, and
                insect vectors are constant household and agricultural companions.</p><p>This geographical overlap means that people are often affected by more than one
                disease. It also means that strategies developed to deliver interventions for one
                disease can rationally be used to deliver interventions for others. This opens
                opportunities for integrated approaches, for simplification, cost-effectiveness, and
                streamlined efficiency. We must not forget that we are dealing with neglected
                populations, as well as neglected diseases; populations usually living in areas not
                covered by formal health services, which are often extremely difficult to reach.</p><p>When these diseases are viewed together, we gain critical mass. We get a better grip
                on the scale of the economic and social consequences as well as the health burdens.
                Arguments for giving these diseases higher priority become more powerful, more
                persuasive. In addition, grouping these diseases together creates opportunities for
                sharing innovative solutions, especially as most control programmes face similar
                operational constraints.</p><p>Persuasive arguments have come from additional lines of evidence. Research continues
                to reveal the intricate damage caused by these diseases. I am convinced that
                    <italic>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</italic> will generate more evidence,
                spearhead innovation, and help to disseminate knowledge, experiences, and
                    achievements.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000065-g001"/></p><fig id="pntd-0000065-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0000065.g001</object-id><label>Image 1</label><caption><title>Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000065.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec></body><back/></article>
