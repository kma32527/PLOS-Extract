Such results are particularly important because LF programs have the necessary diagnostic and treatment tools to eliminate the disease as a public health problem globally, and already by 2006, the Global Programme to Eliminate LF had initiated treatment programs covering over 400 million of the 1.3 billion people at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To obtain annual costs to carry out the MDA strategy, researchers from seven countries developed and followed a common cost analysis protocol designed to estimate 1) the total annual cost of the LF program, 2) the average cost per person treated, and 3) the relative contributions of the endemic countries and the external partners. Costs per person treated ranged from $0.06 to $2.23. Principal reasons for the variation were 1) the age (newness) of the MDA program, 2) the use of volunteers, and 3) the size of the population treated. Substantial contributions by governments were documented ‚Äì generally 60%‚Äì90% of program operation costs, excluding costs of donated medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>MDA for LF elimination is comparatively inexpensive in relation to most other public health programs. Governments and communities make the predominant financial contributions to actual MDA implementation, not counting the cost of the drugs themselves. The results highlight the impact of the use of volunteers on program costs and provide specific cost data for 7 different countries that can be used as a basis both for modifying current programs and for developing new ones.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Lymphatic filariasis (LF), commonly known as elephantiasis, is a profoundly disfiguring parasitic disease caused by thread-like nematode worms. This disease can often be disabling, thus reducing the potential productivity of the affected individuals. The WHO places the number of people at risk in 83 countries at 1.307 billion. This study was undertaken in seven countries‚ÄîBurkina Faso, Ghana, Egypt, Tanzania, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti‚Äîusing a common protocol to determine the costs of mass drug administration (MDA) programs to interrupt transmission of infection with LF, because there is lack of sufficient information about the costs of these programs. The results demonstrate that LF MDA is affordable and relatively inexpensive when compared to other public health programs. In the context of initiatives for integrating programs for the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases, this study adds specifically to the relatively scarce body of information about the costs of MDA programs for LF. It also adds to the general knowledge about the application of methods that can be used to estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of an integrated approach.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by a sub-contract of a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to the Emory Lymphatic Filariasis Support Center which was responsible for facilitating the development of the costing protocol.

Economic costs are useful to evaluate the allocation of program resources and their opportunity costs, e.g., whether these resources could be used more productively elsewhere. Financial costs are helpful to program managers to measure actual program expenditures and assess affordability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-Haddix1">[17]</xref> (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000067-t001">Table 1</xref> for the classification of costs.) Financial costs include all costs with the exception of donated materials. Capital items were annualized to reflect costs incurred in one year for the project. They do not include bicycles because these were the property of the volunteer drug distributors, and thus considered a donation. Volunteer training per diems are classified as Financial and Economic costs, but the value of volunteer unpaid time is not included in either Financial or Economic costs. Because the capital costs were annualized, the cash expenditures described reflect those incurred in one year for the project.</p><table-wrap id="pntd-0000067-t001" position="float"><object-id

perspective because most resources dedicated to the LF MDAs were channeled through Ministry of Health (MOH) programs. Participants agreed to gather MDA costs, beginning with the year 2000, the first year of the LF global elimination effort. Costs were calculated in local currencies and converted to US dollars for the final analysis, based on average exchange values for the years being analyzed (base year 2002).</p><p>Most of the countries were still in the early stages of expanding their MDAs when the cost analysis studies began. The exception was Egypt where the MDA targeted almost 90% of the population at risk the first year and 100% the second year studied.</p><p>Project inputs defined in the protocol were: personnel, supplies and drugs (medications for the MDA and for treatment of adverse reactions), as well as capital and recurrent costs for equipment, transportation, and facilities. Each input was allocated to one or more categories of activities involved in accomplishing the MDA: training, mapping, mobilization and education, drug distribution, adverse reaction monitoring, surveillance/laboratory, and administration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000067-t002">Table 2</xref>). Capital costs were defined as one-time investments in physical goods that have a life longer than one year and generally cost more than $1000. These costs were annualized, using a formula that accounted for years of useful life, scrap value, and a discount rate set at 3%. Recurrent costs included those items that were consumed on a regular basis; i.e., personnel time, office and laboratory supplies, fuel, and drugs. Recurrent costs for maintenance of donated capital items such as bicycles were also included. In cases where facilities or equipment costs were not available, costs of similar facilities or rentals were used as a proxy.

Located 30 km west of Port-au-Prince in the south, Leogane is one of the highest risk areas in the country. Except for lower coverage in year-2 (2001) of the MDA program (because of side reactions that occurred after the first MDA) the program expanded not only in Leogane in 2002 but also to Milot, another high risk area just south of Cap Hatien in the north.</p><p>Researchers in the Dominican Republic collected cost data for the first two MDA campaigns.

Coverage rates are defined as the number of individuals reported to have ingested the antifilarial drugs divided by the total at-risk population in the program area. Those excluded from treatment included pregnant women, lactating women in the 1<sup>st</sup> week post-partum, the very sick, children under two years of age in countries where DEC plus albendazole is the MDA regimen, and children under 90 cm in height (generally under 5 years of age) where albendazole is administered with Mectizan.</p><p>The data were collected from national, regional and district levels of the health care system via pre-tested questionnaires and spreadsheets, sometimes with the assistance of other agencies such as Ministries of Agriculture and Information. As LF is but one of many population-based health programs, most inputs (including personnel time, facilities, equipment, supplies, vehicles and fuel) were often shared by more than one program, and costs were apportioned accordingly. To capture the actual costs and percentage of the resources dedicated to LF, the teams reviewed program records and interviewed LF program administrators and personnel about allocations of personnel and resource time per year.

shown) to gauge how much an increase in personnel costs would impact overall costs. Personnel was selected for sensitivity analysis because, with the exception of Egypt, this input represented the largest source of costs in the participating countries. Sensitivity analyses conducted on personnel input for Ghana and Burkina Faso demonstrated that increasing the proportion of personnel time dedicated to the LF MDA did not raise financial costs beyond the currently-calculated ranges, even under conditions where personnel time was doubled (Ghana - US$0.25 and Burkina - US$0.08) or tripled (Ghana - US$0.34 and Burkina - US$0.11). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of personnel costs in the Philippines showed that personnel costs would remain well within the range of the current Financial costs (US$ 0.69) even if personnel time were doubled.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>There were three principal study limitations. First, investigators frequently encountered problems in estimating the proportion of time and money allocated specifically to the LF MDA programs. Staff had not previously tracked time apportioned to LF-specific activities, and since LF programs are small in relation to other MOH initiatives (consuming anywhere from 1% to 5% a year in most countries), recall was problematic at times. Similar situations were encountered with respect to other resources such as transportation, facilities and equipment dedicated to LF. Second, interpretations of the definitions of certain activity categories sometimes differed among researchers applying the cost analysis protocol and data collection instrument. At times questions arose about allocation to one or the other of categories mentioned. Third, while study teams attempted to identify the original source of funds, the original funder may not have been correctly identified in all cases, especially where money was channeled through one or more intermediary sources.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Good cost analysis is essential to provide an evidence-based rationale for investing in LF elimination. The key target figure is the cost per person treated. Few results have been available to date, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-deRochars1">[12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-Ramzy1">16]</xref> and little has been documented about the principal determinants of cost per person treated. This study has defined key activities and input categories and gathered cost information via the standardized cost-analysis studies of seven national LF MDA programs.</p><p>One of the most striking findings of the present studies is the variability in the Financial cost per person treated. Differences in programmatic structure can account for some of these differences because each country tailors the LF elimination strategy for a best fit to local conditions. But beyond the program-specific differences, the principal determinants underlying the variability appeared to be: 1) the newness of the country program (<italic>i.e.,</italic> the number of years it had been running), 2) the use of volunteers, and 3) the size of the population treated.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Newness or Round of MDA</title><p>MDA program start-up years resulted in higher Financial and Economic costs per person treated than did subsequent years. Inevitably, there are more costs and reallocation of resources in the first year of a program. At the same time, new programs typically cover a limited geographic area and a relatively small population in their first year. As the population covered expands after the first year, the cost per person treated tends to drop.</p><p>In addition to extra expenditures in a start-up year as compared to other years, costs can also decrease over time because new cost-savings strategies are identified and implemented. For example, in the first MDA year in the Dominican Republic, health workers from non-governmental organizations participated in the MDA; these individuals were paid per diem for all of the time they participated, in some cases higher than the wages of workers in the health system. MDA integration into the health system contributed to the 50% decrease in the second year Program cost per person treated. Similarly in Haiti, after the first year cost analysis revealed that 22% of resources were dedicated to adverse reactions, the adverse reaction protocol was revised to an equally effective but less costly strategy. In the second year only 4% of resources were used for adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Use of Volunteers</title><p>The use of volunteers had the greatest impact on costs. In Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Ghana, and the Philippines - where Program costs are lowest - health workers are employed down to the sub-district level, and volunteers, who are compensated very little in the LF program, work at the village level. Volunteers in these countries contribute a large proportion of the time dedicated to the MDA (frequently receiving per diem only for days in training) and at times provide their own transportation (e.g., Burkina Faso). However, while there is a strong relationship between the use of volunteers and lower cost per person treated, this does not suggest that any country choosing to use volunteers would see savings of 85%. Country-specific conditions that lead to the use of volunteers may also determine lower costs overall.</p><p>The use of volunteers leads to the question of how to accurately value the time volunteers ‚Äòdonated‚Äô to each program. One traditional approach to valuing volunteer time is to apply the wage from the volunteer's normal paid employment and value their volunteer time accordingly. The problem with this, as pointed out by McFarland <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-McFarland1">[18]</xref> in a report on the costs of onchocerciasis MDA, is that many volunteers are subsistence farmers who do not participate in the formal labor market. One alternative is to decide the fair market value of the time, i.e. the amount the volunteer would be paid if the program had to hire individuals for the work,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-Onwujekwe1">[19]</xref> or another, by using an estimate from prior studies in a similar setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-McFarland1">[18]</xref></p><p>In the country programs included in this study, a diverse group of individuals, comprising students, teachers, farm laborers, and elderly retirees, served as volunteers. Owing to this fact and the economic conditions in the participating countries, applying traditional methodologies for costing volunteer time may not be appropriate. After several countries explored volunteer participation in MDAs and the earning capacity of volunteers in their regular pursuits, a decision was made by the investigators in all participating countries not to include these costs. Therefore, while the study included the per diem paid to volunteers during training, it did not account for the opportunity cost of the volunteer's time dedicated to the MDA itself. The evaluation of the community contribution from countries which used volunteers is very definitely underestimated.</p><p>Program managers can control, to some extent, the use of volunteers and might explore this strategy in resource-constrained environments. Beyond the monetary savings, there is a benefit from connecting the program with volunteers who are opinion leaders from different community sectors. So while initially decisions to utilize volunteers might be financially based, countries ultimately can benefit not only from volunteers' labor but also from their connections to the communities in which they serve. However, program managers must bear in mind the competition for volunteers from other health programs which sometimes pay volunteers more for their efforts. The sensitivity analyses on personnel time devoted to the MDA point to the possibility that it may be worthwhile exploring opportunities to increase remuneration for volunteers. Indeed, both valuing and best utilizing volunteer time merit continued examination.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Size of Population Treated</title><p>The third principal source of variation in cost per person treated was the size of the population treated, an element that can be controlled by program managers during program expansion. When programs scale-up, the cost per person treated drops, primarily because most of the overhead costs are associated with start-up costs at the national and district levels. Once the system has been established, the majority of the new costs are in the new area (district or governorate) that is being covered. In Burkina Faso and Tanzania the Financial costs per person were halved as the MDA covered larger populations. Between 2001 and 2002 Program costs in Burkina declined 45% while the population treated increased by over 400%. The progression in Tanzania between 2000 and 2003 was similar, with the Financial cost per person treated decreasing by 47% while the treated population increased over 13-fold. Between 2000 and 2001, the number of persons treated in Egypt increased 29%, while the Financial cost per person treated decreased 27%.</p><p>Such findings emphasize the need to keep current programs adequately funded so that these programs can expand and increase the number of persons treated and thereby capture the savings resulting from the economies of scale.</p><p>Once the principal determinants of the cost per person treated are identified, they can be used to manage program costs either by making internal changes within a program, such as scaling-up and increasing efficiency, or by taking advantage of existing external resources, as through integration. LF elimination programs can be integrated into the existing health system, as in the Dominican Republic, or with other preventive chemotherapy programs. For the LF elimination program, costs per person treated are within the range of those estimated for other similar disease control and elimination programs; namely soil-transmitted helminths ($0.25 per treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-World3">[20]</xref>), trachoma ($0.50 per treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-Kumaresan1">[21]</xref>) and onchocerciasis ($0.58 per treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-McFarland1">[18]</xref>). The potential programmatic overlap of activities among these and other public health initiatives includes administration, drug distribution, monitoring, surveillance, and social mobilization, so attractive cost-saving opportunities can be envisioned through integration. While estimates place the cost savings from integrated delivery between 25% and 47%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-Fenwick1">[22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-Brady1">23]</xref> the LF cost analysis protocol utilized in the present cost study can provide a useful tool by which to document the potential savings from integrating some or all programmatic activities of these initiatives. Indeed, countries that have already completed the LF cost analysis are well placed to estimate costs of integrated programs, given that many of the costs common to all programs have already been identified.</p><p>Also of particular interest from this study was the documentation of the substantial contributions (<italic>i.e.,</italic> program <italic>ownership</italic>) by national governments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000067-g002">Figure 2</xref>). On average 56% of Financial costs of the LF elimination programs were financed by governments. The Egyptian government contributed 80% of Program costs, including participation of the Ministries of Health and Population, of Agriculture, and of Information. This is consistent with similar programs for TB and malaria which estimate that 70% of Financial costs are paid for by national governments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-World4">[24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000067-World5">25]</xref> Furthermore, LF MDA programs do not require new or additional funding for all inputs. For example, the portion of the salary of a District Medical Officer (DMO) spent on the project would be included in the analysis as a program cost, but the DMO's salary would have been funded regardless of whether the time was spent on LF MDA activities or other programs and may not require additional financial outlays. Governments have a choice as to where they use their resources, and the percentages noted in this study emphasize the commitment these national governments have made to LF elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Resource allocation choices</title><p>Surveillance and mapping activities represented a significantly higher proportion of resource requirements in Egypt than in other countries (between 10% and 12% at both the national and governorate levels), since Egypt has selected small MDA implementation units, i.e. the village level, and hence focused on monitoring potential ‚Äòat-risk‚Äô areas closely in a large number of implementation units.</p><p>Tanzania's national program chose to invest heavily in social mobilization and education to assist the districts in raising awareness in the general population for current and future MDAs. The districts placed more emphasis on funding drug distribution and personnel training.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The principal aim of this study was to provide critical information regarding the cost of implementing MDA for the prevention of lymphatic filariasis. The study demonstrates that the costs of MDA programs for LF elimination are comparable to those estimated for other similar disease control and elimination programs. While some programs had costs per person treated of over a dollar, it was quite straightforward to identify those factors most affecting program costs.</p><p>Such findings can be used on a national scale for program planning, development and fundraising, and on a global scale for calculating current global costs, predicting scale-up costs and calculating savings from integration with other programs. These results also will form the basis for guiding cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses, as more information on the effectiveness of MDAs in the study countries becomes available. Additionally, the analytic tool used in this study will be valuable for further studies of the LF elimination program including costing of LF disability alleviation activities and the process certifying LF elimination.</p><p>A further finding of particular importance was documentation of the impact that the use of volunteers has on program costs. Further research on how best to utilize volunteerism for such public health programs could contribute appreciably to ensuring success of the MDA-based programs and to anchoring them in the communities they seek to protect.</p><p>Finally, implementation of this study produced a number of ancillary program benefits. The process of defining and reviewing costs allowed for a review of operations at all levels (inputs, processes and outputs) that was also frequently used to assess efficiency. The findings provide the opportunity for the development of cost-effective implementation models built on best practices from each country; hopefully, these can be adopted and adapted by new programs from the start, particularly in Africa where almost 30 more endemic countries still need to initiate LF elimination programs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Our gratitude to Marco Del Negro for review of the methods section.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0000067-World1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">             <collab xlink:type="simple">World Health Organization</collab>             <year>2006</year>             <article-title>Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.</article-title>             <source>WER</source>             <volume>81</volume>             <issue>22</issue>             <fpage>221</fpage>             <lpage>232</lpage>          </element-citation></ref><ref id="pntd.0000067-Ramaiah1"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">             <person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Ramaiah</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Das</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Michael</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Guyatt</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>             <year>2000</year>             <article-title>The economic burden of lymphatic filariasis in India.</article-title>             <source>Parasitology Today</source>             <volume>16</volume>             <issue>6</issue>             <fpage>251</fpage>             <lpage>253</lpage>          </element-citation></ref><ref id="pntd.0000067-Gyapong1"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">             <person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Gyapong</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Gyapong</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Aikins</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Adjei</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>             <year>1996</year>             <article-title>The economic burden of lymphatic filariasis in northern Ghana.</article-title>             <source>Annals of Tropical Medicine &amp; Parasitology</source>             <volume>90</volume>             <issue>1</issue>             <fpage>39</fpage>             <lpage>48</lpage>          </element-citation></ref><ref id="pntd.0000067-UN1"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">             <collab xlink:type="simple">UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries</collab>             <article-title>List of Least Developed Countries.</article-title>             <comment>Available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/ldc/list.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/ldc/list.htm</ext-link>.
