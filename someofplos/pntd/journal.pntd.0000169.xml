Giardiasis infections can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms and pose a major health concern in the developing world. <italic>Giardia</italic> are known to attach robustly to a variety of surfaces, but the conditions that influence this attachment are not known. In this study, we examined the behavior of attached <italic>Giardia</italic> parasites exposed to rapid changes in solution properties, like those <italic>Giardia</italic> might encounter in the intestine. After systematically varying media concentration and composition, we found that only one solution property caused rapid detachment of <italic>Giardia</italic> cells: tonicity, which is a measure of the total concentration of solutes in the solution that are unable to pass through a semi-permeable membrane (here, the cell membrane of <italic>Giardia</italic>). We found similar results for <italic>Giardia</italic> initially attached to monolayers of intestinal cells. <italic>Giardia</italic> cells remaining attached after a change in tonicity are able to adapt to the change, highlighting the general ability of this organism to weather normal changes in the intestinal environment. We propose that <italic>Giardia</italic>'s susceptibility to large changes in tonicity could be explored as a possible new route for treatment of giardiasis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (WRH) and a National Science Foundation CAREER Award (DAF).

Giardiasis is generally treated with metronidazole or other nitroimidazoles, which target the parasite's anaerobic metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gardner1">[6]</xref>, as well as with furazolidone or quinacrine. However, these chemotherapeutic agents are not always available, fully effective, or tolerated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gardner1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Upcroft1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>While the exact mechanism of virulence is not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Farthing1">[5]</xref>, attachment of <italic>Giardia</italic> to the small intestine wall is a requirement, since unattached cells would simply pass through the intestine during peristalsis. Thus attachment, also a requirement for cell proliferation in the host, can be considered a virulence factor in giardiasis. Trophozoites in culture have been observed to attach and detach in less than one second <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Erlandsen1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Campanati1">[9]</xref>, and they are able to attach to a variety of surfaces, both biological and inert. Attachment itself has been studied extensively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Erlandsen1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Elmendorf1">[10]</xref>), but the contributing environmental factors remain unclear, as does an understanding of how <italic>Giardia</italic> are able to remain attached (or reattach when necessary) in the highly variable environment of the small intestinal lumen.</p><p>In addition to resisting shear stresses resulting from peristaltic flow, <italic>Giardia</italic> must withstand variations in the osmolality and pH of the contents of the small intestine resulting from normal feeding behavior of the host. Osmolality is defined as the total concentration of solutes per kilogram of solvent. Strictly speaking, for a semi-permeable membrane that passes some solutes, such as a cell membrane, the most relevant measure is tonicity, or the concentration of membrane-impermeant solutes per kilogram of solvent. Osmolality in most organisms is tightly regulated, and in humans, serum osmolality is held at 290 mOsm/kg. In the upper digestive tract, however, osmolality and pH can vary considerably from fed to fasted states. The largest variability is in the antrum and the duodenum, where osmolality has been found to range from approximately 30% to more than 200% of serum levels in fasted and fed states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Kalantzi1">[11]</xref>, and pH fluctuations below pH 5 and above pH 7.5 have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Kalantzi1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Dressman1">[12]</xref>. Both pH and osmolality stabilize somewhat in more distal portions of the small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Lindahl1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gisolfi1">[15]</xref>.</p><p>To study the effect of osmolality and pH changes on <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> attachment, we developed a flow chamber assay to monitor cell attachment during changes in media concentration and composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000169-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The closed chamber prevented exposure to excessive oxygen, as <italic>Giardia</italic> are microaerophilic, and it allowed us to monitor attachment to both glass surfaces and intestinal epithelial monolayers under controlled flow rates, while quickly changing media. We tracked changes in the number of attached cells during the experiments to quantify effects on attachment. Our results show that <italic>Giardia</italic> rapidly detached from both glass and enterocyte monolayer surfaces when osmolality was altered from standard growth medium conditions. We found that the fraction of detached cells increased with the magnitude of osmolality change. Experiments with iso-osmotic solutions containing solutes that can and cannot pass through the cell membrane (non-isotonic and isotonic, respectively) indicate that tonicity is the critical factor causing detachment. Interestingly, we observed that <italic>Giardia</italic> are able to adapt to moderate changes in tonicity, indicated by the dependence of detachment on the change in tonicity rather than the absolute tonicity. Based on <italic>Giardia</italic>'s adaptation to environments of different tonicities, we were able to vary solution tonicity periodically in a way that forced extensive detachment of <italic>Giardia</italic> from both glass and epithelial monolayers.</p><fig id="pntd-0000169-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0000169.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of the closed laminar flow chamber setup used to test attachment of <italic>Giardia</italic> under varying media conditions.</title><p><italic>Giardia</italic>, test medium, and control medium were flowed in separately at controlled flow rates.

Next, time-lapse videos of cell attachment under 20X phase illumination on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY) were acquired with a Cascade II CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) at 1 frame/second. Flow rates in the chamber were controlled using syringe pumps (PHD 22/2000 and Pump 11, Harvard Apparatus). The chamber was first flushed of unattached cells by flowing in unmodified growth medium at 0.3 mL/min for three minutes at the beginning of each time-lapse.

Variations in osmolality were established by preparation of media with additional or less water as necessary. High and low pH isotonic media were prepared by slight dilution of HEPES-based medium with water, followed by adjustment of pH with NaOH or HCl, then by a final adjustment of osmolality with sucrose.

Media variations of approximately 60 to 620 mOsm/kg and pH 5 to pH 8 were selected to span the range measured in the human proximal small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Kalantzi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gisolfi1">[15]</xref>. We limited bulk flow rate to 0.3 mL/min, a rate that flushed unattached cells from the chamber but did not perturb attached cells. At significantly higher flow rates (approximately 3 mL/min and higher), cells first oriented upstream into the flow and then were forced to detach by the shear stress of the flow (data not shown). We found that when detachment of cells occurred, the response was very rapid, and detachment was complete within less than two minutes (including media exchange time) for a given population, so we limited test media presentation to three minutes unless otherwise noted. Longer experiments (up to 60 min) did not result in significant additional detachment unless the medium composition was not suitable for cell growth (e.g. sucrose solutions or media lacking cysteine; data not shown).</p><p>As a first test of osmotic stress response, we exposed cells to a range of dilutions and concentrations of standard complete growth medium. We monitored cell attachment numbers during the three-minute exposure period and found no significant effect on attachment for osmolality shifts smaller than ∼±30% from the baseline medium osmolality of 300−330 mOsm/kg. Above ∼30% shifts in osmolality (osmolality below ∼230 mOsm/kg or above ∼430 mOsm/kg) both hypo- and hyperosmotic solutions resulted in rapid detachment of a statistically significant fraction of attached cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000169-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

To this end, <italic>Giardia</italic> were initially incubated for 10 minutes in growth media of slightly elevated or lowered osmolality (by +79 mOsm/kg and −107 mOsm/kg, respectively). Cells were then exposed to a moderate osmotic shift in the opposite direction. For the cells incubated in +79 mOsm/kg medium, the test medium osmolality was 182 mOsm/kg, or 124 mOsm/kg below the incubation medium and 197 mOsm/kg below normal medium tonicity. For cells incubated in the –107 mOsm/kg medium, test medium osmolality was a normal 308 mOsm/kg. In both cases, when cells were subsequently exposed to these osmolality shifts, which were of an absolute osmolality that would not normally result in much detachment, a statistically significant percentage of cells detached. The amount of detachment depended on the osmotic difference between the incubation medium and test solution instead of on the absolute value of the incubation medium and test solution osmolality. That is, cells appeared to adapt to the osmolality of their incubation medium. As a result, detachment for the given osmolality change is similar to that for cells initially incubated in normal medium (300−330 mOsm/kg) and exposed to the same magnitude of osmotic change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000169-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd-0000169-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0000169.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Detachment under changes in solution composition, osmolality, and tonicity.</title><p>(A) Cells initially incubated in growth media of a slightly higher (green) or lower (blue) osmolality adjusted to the shifted osmolality of the incubation medium.

Thus, changes in media tonicity, not osmolality, cause detachment, where tonicity is the effective osmolality due to cell-impermeant osmolytes.

We hypothesized that if these cells were truly adjusting to a different medium tonicity, this adaptation would render them sensitive to a small deviation from the original medium tonicity that was insufficient to cause detachment before adaptation. For example, cells that had previously adapted to a slightly hypertonic medium would be more sensitive to a small hypotonic challenge than if they did not adapt.

In these experiments, we used live cell microscopy to monitor immediate detachment events upon exposure to test media in a flow chamber. Short-timescale detachment of <italic>Giardia</italic> has not been examined in the numerous studies of forced detachment, as most assays measure population attachment levels after a period of 2−24 hours incubation with a given drug or medium composition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Sousa1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Correa1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gillin1">[23]</xref>). Such studies have shown that <italic>Giardia</italic> attachment and survival rates are inhibited by changes in pH and osmolality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gillin1">[23]</xref>, but the long incubation prior to quantification of attachment makes it very difficult to separate direct effects on attachment from an overall effect on cell viability. Our results demonstrate that not only are <italic>Giardia</italic> susceptible to tonic shock, but that the response is rapid, with a detachment time constant of 25 seconds. This is consistent with the extremely rapid attachment and detachment behavior of trophozoites noted in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Erlandsen1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Campanati1">[9]</xref>. Notably, remaining cells appear to adapt to the new tonicity and are not susceptible to further detachment unless subjected to a second tonic shock.</p><p>It is unclear whether the tonicity-dependent detachment we observe is because tonic changes directly affect <italic>Giardia</italic>'s mechanism of attachment or whether detachment is a secondary result, perhaps due to observed osmotic shrinking and swelling of the cell. Attachment is associated with a unique microtubule-based structure called the ventral disk, which is located on the underside of the cell. Other studies have hypothesized several methods of attachment, including specific binding by lectins to the surface of intestinal cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Elmendorf1">[10]</xref>). High resolution (100X) phase contrast video microscopy of attached <italic>Giardia</italic> under hypotonic shock (−196 mOsm/kg) showed that detachment events are non-catastrophic, with affected cells simply “falling off” the glass surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000169.s002">Video S2</xref>). Beating of the ventral flagella was sinusoidal as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Ghosh1">[24]</xref>, even during detachment, and cell morphology appeared unchanged.</p><p>Given <italic>Giardia</italic>'s ability to adhere to glass and other inert surfaces and the observation that detachment forces are unaffected by surface chemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Hansen1">[25]</xref>, a pressure-based mechanism of attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Holberton1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Jones1">[28]</xref> appears most likely. Yet the major question of how pressure is generated remains open. We propose that the detachment behavior observed in this study is consistent with an osmotic, pressure-based mechanism of attachment in which cells create an osmotic pressure differential to generate attachment force. Osmolyte leak rate or a compromised seal around the ventral disk would be the primary modes of attachment failure under tonic shock. Although this model is consistent with our data, we know of no example in the literature of a single-celled organism that generates an osmotic gradient for attachment.</p><p>Previous studies of the regulatory volume decrease of unattached cells showed that <italic>Giardia</italic> cells release alanine and potassium to decrease intracellular osmolality upon exposure to hypotonic media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Park1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Maroulis1">[31]</xref>.

Giardiasis is a disease with a global distribution but a disproportionate impact on developing countries, contributing to malnutrition problems and to diarrheal illnesses that are particularly dangerous to young children and the immunocompromised. Current drug treatment methods exist, namely the administration of metronidazole, but they are not always effective or tolerated. Additionally, <italic>Giardia</italic> are capable of multiple drug resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Upcroft1">[7]</xref>; drug-resistant isolates have been found in patients although epidemics of resistant strains have not yet been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Gardner1">[6]</xref>. As such, a simple, cost-effective, safe treatment that is easily administered and effective against all strains of the parasite would be particularly useful.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that sufficient changes in tonicity that are timed to take advantage of <italic>Giardia</italic>'<italic>s</italic> adaptation mechanisms can strongly and rapidly promote <italic>Giardia</italic> detachment. Since the tonicity changes leading to detachment in our experiments are within the range measured in the human small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000169-Kalantzi1">[11]</xref>, this method could be explored as a possible way to treat giardiasis or to enhance the effectiveness of present treatment methods. Ingestion of a low tonicity solution, such as water, followed by an interval that allows parasites to adjust to the lower lumenal tonicity, then followed by ingestion of a high tonicity solution, containing perhaps sucrose or PEG, may induce parasites to detach from the intestinal epithelium, as they did from human intestinal epithelial monolayers in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000169-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000169.s001">Video S1</xref>). Our experiments used a PEG/electrolyte mixture approved for use in humans as the medium base to support the feasibility of this treatment possibility. One central question facing application of this approach is whether sufficiently rapid swings in osmolarity can be achieved in the human intestine.</p><p>Our results provide clear evidence of <italic>Giardia</italic>'s sensitivity to and ability to adapt to the changing chemical environment of the host intestine. If tonicity-dependent detachment of <italic>Giardia</italic> is confirmed in human or animal model studies, our proposed “tonic shock therapy” may provide a useful strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of current treatments, helping to relieve symptoms in patients unable to take metronidazole or other antigiardial medications, or combating drug-resistant parasite strains.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pntd.0000169.s001" mimetype="video/quicktime" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000169.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p><bold>Detachment of fluorescently labeled <italic>Giardia</italic> from C2<sub>BBe</sub>-1 monolayer under periodic tonicity swings of +/−150 mOsm/kg.</bold></p><p>Movie plays at 50X real time.
