When a large cholera outbreak occurs, the disease appears briefly on the radar of public attention. Some unfortunate populations around the world suffer recurrent episodes of cholera but their plight goes unnoticed. We established cholera surveillance in impoverished areas in Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (India), and Beira (Mozambique) where the disease is known to occur regularly. The cholera burden was calculated using the site population as the denominator and the number of cholera cases as the numerator. The lowest overall rate was in Jakarta with 0.5 cases per 1000 population per year. The incidence was three times higher in Kolkata (1.6/1000/year) and eight times higher in Beira (4.0/1000/year), adding to the growing impression of the large cholera problem in Africa. In all sites, children are the most affected. Estimates such as these are useful when considering where and among whom interventions against the disease are most needed. Improvement of water supply and sanitation is the best strategy against cholera and other diarrheal diseases but may not be achievable in these impoverished areas in the near future. Other immediate, short- to medium-term strategies such as vaccination against cholera may be useful.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Diseases of Most Impoverished Program administered by the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) and by the Swedish International Development Agency for Cooperation with Developing Countries (SIDA).

Profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. Oral and intravenous rehydration therapy has markedly decreased case fatality rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Mahalanabis1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Carpenter1">[3]</xref> but cholera remains a dreaded illness because of its rapid onset, severity, and potential to cause outbreaks that easily overwhelm public health systems in impoverished settings. Seasonal disease occurs in many less developed countries that cannot afford to establish or to maintain essential infrastructure for safe water supply and sanitation. Outbreaks may arise during natural disasters and complex emergencies.</p><p>In 2006, 52 countries officially reported a total of 236,896 cholera cases including 6,311 deaths with a CFR of 2.7%, to the World Health Organization (WHO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-WHO1">[4]</xref>. These numbers do not reflect the true burden of cholera due to limitations in the surveillance and notification systems of many countries where the disease is endemic, as well as widespread underreporting because of fear of unjustified travel and trade-related sanctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-WHO1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Zuckerman1">[5]</xref>. Hospital-based studies and outbreak reports provide important information, but they usually do not have a clear population denominator to allow estimation of the age-specific incidence of cholera in a community. A further challenge in the estimation of disease burden is the dearth of microbiology laboratories capable of detecting <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 and O139. Reported cases are often based solely on clinical diagnosis of the illness, adding further uncertainty. In the recent past, population-based information on the burden of culture-confirmed cholera cases has come principally from a single research institution in Bangladesh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Sack2">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Policymakers from several developing countries have indicated that information on the age-specific burden of cholera is essential to decide the urgency of control strategies, including vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-DeRoeck1">[7]</xref>. We established population-based surveillance for cholera in three study areas in Indonesia, India, and Mozambique in preparation for potential vaccine trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Agtini1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Lucas1">[10]</xref>. The areas were selected based on known endemicity of cholera and the presence of pre-existing research infrastructure or the potential to create such infrastructure. Using similar methodology in the three study areas allowed us to compare the overall and age-specific incidence of cholera across sites. Various findings from the three sites have been published elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Agtini1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Lucas1">[10]</xref>.

A diarrhea episode was defined as passage of three or more loose or liquid stools in the 24 hour period prior to presentation for care. Repeat visits for the same episode of diarrhea, defined as three or fewer days apart between the end of the first episode and the onset of the second, were excluded. For every patient agreeing to participate, a case report form was completed and a rectal swab was obtained and inoculated into Cary-Blair transport media. The definition of diarrhea and laboratory methods was standardized across the study sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Rectal swabs in Cary-Blair media were brought on the same day to the study laboratory and plated directly onto thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose (TCBS) agar (Eiken Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan). The specimens were also incubated in alkaline peptone water (pH 8.6) for 6 to 8 hours at 37°C then plated onto TCBS. After overnight incubation at 37°C, suspected colonies on the TCBS plates were tested biochemically and confirmed by agglutination with polyvalent O1 and monovalent Ogawa and Inaba antisera (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan). Non-agglutinating strains were tested with antiserum to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O139 strain.</p><p>Laboratory methods for isolation of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were similar in each site. Isolation of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> was conducted in reference laboratories in two sites (the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 in Jakarta and the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in Kolkata).

Only <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 was isolated at all sites.</p><fig id="pntd-0000173-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0000173.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cholera incidence (per 1000 population per year) in study sites in three countries.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000173.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that young children bear the greatest burden of cholera. Cholera has traditionally been considered to occur infrequently in young children, and consequently, the WHO recommends that cholera should be suspected among those over two years of age who have acute watery diarrhea and severe dehydration if cholera is endemic in the local area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-World1">[11]</xref>. Aside from our data, two other studies have shown that cholera is a significant problem in young children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Sack2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Bhattacharya1">[12]</xref>, but neither provide population-based incidence. Our findings have implications for the enhanced benefit of cholera vaccination targeting specific age-groups in cholera-endemic areas. Protecting children against cholera may not only decrease the burden in this age group but decrease transmission of the disease to their family members and the community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Ali1">[13]</xref>. Immunization of adult women with killed oral cholera vaccines has been shown to confer herd immunity against cholera to children too young to be vaccinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-AliMEmch1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Our comparison shows that the overall rates of cholera cases presenting for treatment varied widely across the study sites in three different countries, with the highest incidence in the African site. These findings add to the growing impression of the large cholera burden in Africa. In 2006, Africa reported 234,349 cholera cases to the WHO, accounting for 99% of the officially-notified global cholera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-WHO1">[4]</xref>. Between 1995 and 2005, 66% of cholera outbreak reports to ProMed came from sub-Saharan Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Griffith1">[15]</xref>. It has been suggested that the number of individuals at risk for cholera may be higher in Asia than in subSaharan Africa because of the higher population density in the former. But since cholera-endemic areas are likely to be more widespread in subSaharan Africa as evidenced by the officially reported cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-WHO1">[4]</xref>, then the number of individuals at risk could potentially be higher in this continent.</p><p>Culture-confirmation showed that all isolates were <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1. Previously, only <italic>V. cholerae</italic> serogroup O1 caused epidemic cholera. In late 1992, large outbreaks of cholera began in India and Bangladesh that were caused by a previously unrecognized serogroup of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, designated O139, synonym Bengal. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 had since been isolated in 11 countries in South-East Asia but less frequently in recent years. In 2006, 120 laboratory-confirmed <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O139 cases were reported from mainland China and 3 from Thailand but from no where else <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-WHO1">[4]</xref>. The expectation that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O139 would become more widespread has apparently not occurred so far.</p><p>There are limitations to our data. First and foremost the surveillance sites were arbitrarily selected based on known cholera endemicity and may not be representative of the region. Although sentinel surveillance is the most reliable approach to collect comparable surveillance data between continents, data have to be interpreted with this limitation in mind. Second, there may have been variations in the intensity of surveillance despite similar case capture procedures across sites. Third, the size of the catchment population at each site differed considerably, ranging from 20,000 in Beira to 60,000 in Kolkata and 160,000 in Jakarta. Furthermore, the estimate in Beira had to be corrected for the direct protection from cholera vaccination. The true disease incidence may be even higher considering the herd (indirect) protection conferred by the vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000173-Ali1">[13]</xref>. Fourth, the data is based on study periods of one year in Beira and two years in Kolkata and Jakarta. Cholera incidence may vary over several years. It is possible that Beira was having an unusually high number of cases that year. Longer-term surveillance could provide additional important information but surveillance for long periods would be complicated by population mobility and consequent variations in the denominator. Fifth, we are reporting cholera incidence in areas with seasonal cholera, where the population is likely to have immunity from previous exposures. Attack rates during outbreaks at the time of natural disasters and complex emergencies occurring among populations without previous exposure to cholera are likely to be higher. Finally, passive surveillance in all three sites could only detect those cases which were perceived to be severe enough to require medical care and although we implemented methodology in each study site to optimize surveillance, some cases may have escaped our detection system. For example, health care utilization patterns may have influenced the relative differences in detected cholera between age groups. Young children with diarrhea may be more frequently taken for health care treatment compared to adults. It is possible that patients, particularly adults, escaped our detection system and that active surveillance could have identified more cases. However, it was not our intention to find all diarrhea cases in the community but only those perceived to be severe enough to require medical care and thus burdening the public health service.</p><p>This is to our knowledge the first comparison of the incidence of culture-confirmed treated cholera cases in endemic areas using standardized methods. In all our study sites, rates were highest in young children indicating the need to revisit the standard guidelines for clinically suspecting cholera. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O139 was not detected in the study sites. We found considerable differences in the burden of disease in the three sites, with the African site having a multi-fold higher incidence compared to the Asian sites. Incidence of cholera is important when considering where and among whom interventions such as vaccination would be most beneficial.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
