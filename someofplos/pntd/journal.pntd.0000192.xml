Tsetse flies are viviparous and have a low reproductive capacity, giving birth to only 6–8 progeny during their lifetime. Thus, small perturbations to their reproductive fitness can have a major impact on population densities. We measured the fecundity (number of larval progeny deposited) and mortality in parasite-resistant tsetse females and untreated controls and found no differences. There was, however, a typanosome-specific impact on midgut infections. Infections with an immunogenic parasite line that resulted in prolonged activation of the tsetse immune system delayed intrauterine larval development resulting in the production of fewer progeny over the fly's lifetime. In contrast, parasitism with a second line that failed to activate the immune system did not impose a fecundity cost. Coinfections favored the establishment of the immunogenic parasites in the midgut. We show that a decrease in the synthesis of <italic>Glossina</italic> Milk gland protein (<italic>GmmMgp</italic>), a major female accessory gland protein associated with larvagenesis, likely contributed to the reproductive lag observed in infected flies. Mathematical analysis of our empirical results indicated that infection with the immunogenic trypanosomes reduced tsetse fecundity by 30% relative to infections with the non-immunogenic strain. We estimate that a moderate infection prevalence of about 26% with immunogenic parasites has the potential to reduce tsetse populations. Potential repercussions for vector population growth, parasite–host coevolution, and disease prevalence are discussed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In many cases, parasites adapt to their hosts' biology over time and the extent of their harmful effects gradually diminishes. Insect-transmitted parasites such as African trypanosomes, however, are unusually pathogenic for their mammalian hosts because they rely on their invertebrate hosts for transmission to the next mammalian host. To ensure their maximum transmission, it is essential that parasite infections do not compromise insect host's fitness traits, including longevity and host-finding ability. Our results in tsetse indicate that, as theory predicts, trypanosome infections do not reduce host longevity. Instead, they divert host resources from reproduction and can reduce reproductive output by as much as 30%. Such loss of reproductive fitness occurs as a result of the induction of tsetse's immune responses. A closely related non-immunogenic parasite line does not induce host responses and does not compromise host fecundity. It is possible that host immune responses are needed in the case of the immunogenic line to control the parasite density to prevent excessive host damage. Because tsetse are viviparous and each adult female typically gives rise to only few progeny during their lifetime, even modest costs on reproduction can have a significant impact on host abundance. Our model predicts that if the prevalence of immunogenic parasite infections in tsetse populations reaches over 26%, they begin to have a negative impact on population growth rate. Infection rates as high as 30% have been reported with trypanosomes in the field. Our laboratory findings coupled with our modeling studies now provide a framework to investigate the status of co-infections, host immune activation processes, fecundity outcomes, transmission dynamics, and host virulence phenotypes in natural tsetse–trypanosome populations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the NIH (AI51584 and AI068932), Li Foundation, Ambrose Monell Foundation, and Robert Leet and Clara Gutherie Patterson Trust to SA; NIH Award F32 GM077964 to GMA; the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to TWP; and Notsew Orm Sands Foundation to APG.

Despite the high disease incidence in mammalian hosts, infection prevalence in insect vectors is typically low. For example, with the tsetse vectors of trypanosomes that cause African sleeping sickness, often only 1–3% of flies are infected in field populations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Aksoy1">[1]</xref>). This is also reflected in laboratory experiments where although all flies are subjected to an infectious bloodmeal, only a few show established midgut infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hao1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hu1">[3]</xref>. Successful parasite infection of vectors likely reflects a balance between the effectiveness of the vector insect's immune response and the ability of the parasite to evade this response. The ability to resist parasitism has been shown to carry a fitness cost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hoang1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Gwynn1">[7]</xref>. In several cases, a decrease in reproductive output has been shown to result from activation of the host's immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Ahmed1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hurd2">[10]</xref>. In a recent study, transgenic mosquitoes which expressed molecules that conferred parasite resistance were found to be more fit than wild type insects when exposed to malaria parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Marrelli1">[11]</xref>. Presumably the transgenic insects were able to eliminate infections prior to the activation of costly natural immune responses. In parasitized insects, the parasites likely compete for the insect's restricted nutritional resources. Here a balance also probably exists, since reductions in host survival or fitness would diminish the likelihood of parasite transmission. To compensate for nutrient competition while maintaining longevity, many insect vectors exhibit reduced or delayed reproduction as a trade-off during parasite infection (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hurd2">[10]</xref>). Understanding the effect of parasitism on vector fitness is fundamental to predicting the future trajectory of coevolution between parasites and their hosts and eventual disease transmission dynamics.</p><p>Little has been reported on the impact of trypanosome infection outcomes on tsetse. Unlike most insects that are oviparous, tsetse females are viviparous producing one larva at a time, a process that results in few offspring produced over a lifespan. The pregnant females nurture their single larva <italic>in utero</italic> via specialized accessory gland (milk gland) secretions. It is likely that tsetse's viviparous character would result in different outcomes on lifetime fitness traits when compared to other insects where reproductive output is greatest and most sensitive to adverse occurrences in early adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Carey1">[12]</xref>. In addition to reproductive fitness, vector longevity is especially relevant as African trypanosomes undergo multiple stages of differentiation in tsetse and require extensive developmental periods before transmission to their next mammalian host.</p><p>During blood-feeding, adult tsetse can acquire bloodstream form (BSF) trypanosomes from mammalian hosts. During the early course of infection, BSF, which differentiate and replicate as procyclic forms in the midgut, undergo a massive attrition. In a small percentage of flies, parasites continue to proliferate and establish midgut infections. The mechanisms involved in parasite elimination are likely based on tsetse immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Gibson1">[13]</xref> and may include lectin agglutination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Welburn1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Welburn2">[15]</xref>, other lectin-like activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Ingram1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Ingram2">[17]</xref>, antioxidant activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hao2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Macleod2">[20]</xref> and killing by antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hao1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hao2">[18]</xref>.

Additional support for a role of AMPs in resistance comes from studies where knock down of AMP expression in tsetse resulted in increased parasite prevalence <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hu1">[3]</xref> and where recombinant Attacin has been shown to exhibit trypanolytic activity <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Hu2">[22]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the cost to tsetse of resistance to trypanosome infections.

We evaluated the cost of infections using two parasite lines, which differ in their ability to activate tsetse immune responses.

Using a mathematical model, we then estimated the impact of fecundity cost on tsetse populations and discuss the putative effect of this cost on disease transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Parasite and insect species</title><p>BSF of the YTat1.1 parasites were derived from <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> stabilate TREU 164 (TREU = Trypanosomiasis Research Edinburgh University).

Procyclic culture forms of the non-immunogenic YTat1.1<sup>EP</sup> parasites expressed EP and not GPEET procyclins, whereas the immunogenic YTat1.1<sup>WT</sup> cells expressed both EP and GPEET procyclins, as determined using specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000192-g002">Figure 2</xref>, panels A and B) and by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000192-g002">Figure 2</xref>, panels C and D). We do not know how our specific culture conditions caused the selection of the phenotype that exhibited decreased GPEET expression. However, the procyclin repertoire of the trypanosome lines we investigated was remarkably stable and did not change over several months of culture. Indeed, after being frozen for more than 6 months, thawed parasites grown in log-phase for a month exhibited the same phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000192-g002">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Procyclic midgut trypanosomes purified from infected flies 12 days post parasite acquisition primarily expressed the EP procyclins with both parasite strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000192-g002">Figure 2, D and F</xref>).

Two trypanosome strains that differentially activate host immunity were employed to assess the cost of the ability to clear parasite infections (resistance) and the cost of midgut parasite infections in susceptible flies. In contrast to the dogma that expression of parasite resistance traits incurs a fitness cost to the insect host, we observed no significant fecundity cost associated with trypanosome resistance in laboratory reared tsetse. However, activation of tsetse immune responses by infecting flies with immunogenic trypanosomes reduced host reproductive output while infections with non-immunogenic trypanosomes did not.</p><p>It is unusual that we did not detect a fecundity cost associated with parasite resistance in tsetse. This observation, that differs from what is seen in mosquitoes, may reflect the viviparous reproductive biology of tsetse where investments in reproductive output begin significantly later and continue throughout the lifetime of adult female flies. Female tsetse develop a single oocyte per gonotrophic cycle. Following ovulation and fertilization, the embryo develops within the uterus and hatches into a first instar larva, which molts through two more instars before being deposited as a fully developed larva which quickly pupates in the soil. From this point on, there is a continuous investment in nurturing the single larva produced one at a time, approximately every ten days, through the remainder of the female lifespan. This differs dramatically from mosquitoes, which have a high reproductive output as young adults and hence may be more sensitive to perturbations early in life. We cannot rule out however that our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments conducted under uniform environmental conditions and ample nutritional supply may have skewed any potential fecundity cost that flies may experience upon expression of parasite resistance in the wild.</p><p>Reduced host fecundity has been observed in various systems with parasitized insects (reviewed in Hurd, 2003). Our result is the first demonstration of a significant loss of fecundity in parasitized tsetse but only when infected with an obviously immunogenic trypanosome line. Loss of fecundity in tsetse may arise from the cost of prolonged immune activation since a similar fitness cost was not observed in flies infected with the non-immunogenic parasites. Our results suggest that the decreased expression of milk gland protein <italic>GmmMGP</italic>, the most abundant protein product in the “milk” secretion of modified accessory glands, may cause the observed delayed larvagenesis process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Attardo1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Osir1">[40]</xref>. We recently noted that in addition to <italic>GmmMGP</italic>, <italic>transferrin</italic>, which is also expressed in the female milk gland organ and is transported into the developing larva is down regulated by YTat1.1<sup>WT</sup> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Guz1">[41]</xref>. A similar reduction in the abundance of vitellogenin (Vg) mRNA and the titer of circulating Vg in the hemolymph has been reported in plasmodium infected mosquitoes during early oocyst development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Ahmed2">[42]</xref>. Later in the infection process, changes in the ovarian follicular epithelium have also been associated with a decrease in Vg uptake by the ovary and may also result in reduced hormone ecdysone production, which is needed for the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Vg</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Dhadialla1">[43]</xref>. Our results suggest several avenues for future research. It remains to be seen whether the regulation of host gene expression could result from an adaptive strategy that has evolved in response to parasitism, or that it reflects the manipulation of the host insect by the parasites. The regulation of milk-gland protein and transferrin transcription remains to be described, but may similarly be subject to hormonal regulation, which in turn may be influenced by parasite infections.</p><p>One potential difference we identified between the trypanosome strains used to infect tsetse was in their EP and GPEET procyclin compositions. Under our culture conditions, the immunogenic YTAT<sup>WT </sup>line expressed both major forms of procyclin, while the YTAT<sup>EP</sup> line only expressed EP procyclins. Procyclin epitopes analyzed from parasites obtained from midgut infections indicated that both lines expressed the EP isoforms later in the infection process, similar to previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Urwyler1">[44]</xref>. It is possible that the highly phosphorylated GPEET molecules present on YTAT<sup>WT</sup> procyclic culture form parasites, upon acquisition in the blood meal, are recognized by the host's immune system early in the infection process and elicit the immune activation we observed in our study. Supporting this idea, when beads carrying different surface charges were introduced into mosquitoes, different physiological networks were induced resulting in varied vector cost outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Schwartz1">[45]</xref>. It is possible that as a consequence of host-parasite co-evolutionary dynamics, trypanosomes have evolved to down regulate the expression of GPEET in order to avoid inducing host resistance mechanisms. It is entirely possible however, that variations in parasite molecules other than procyclins may be responsible for the observed host immune outcome. The expression of GPEET alone in the early infection process cannot explain the sustained induction of host immune effectors in the case of infections with the immunogenic line since this line also switches to express predominantly the EP procyclins in late midgut infections. As molecular data on tsetse immunity are accumulating, it would be of interest to conduct a global expression analysis of both RNA and protein using the two parasite lines to gain a broader appreciation of the host-parasite interactions in the tsetse system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Lehane1">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Multiple vector immune components are likely to play a role in parasite transmission and resistance phenotype. Although our previous results have identified an important role for antimicrobial peptides in parasite establishment in tsetse, lack of AMP expression does not result in greater parasite infection prevalence for YTAT<sup>EP</sup>. It is possible that other trypanocidal effectors, such as lectins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Welburn1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Ingram2">[17]</xref> and antioxidant activity in the midgut milieu at the time of parasite acquisition that are necessary for resistance. Alternatively, cascades in immunity pathways could result in the synthesis of different trypanolytic immune effectors, which are uncharacterized at the present time. The similar midgut infection intensities observed with both trypanosome lines may also suggest general regulatory processes whereby homeostasis of parasite density is maintained to prevent excessive harm on host physiology. Our mixed infection experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> however showed that the immunogenic parasites outcompeted the non-immunogenic parasites in midguts. It is plausible that tsetse immune products, in particular antimicrobial peptides, may have varying trypanolytic effect on parasites with initial differences in surface protein composition. It is then possible that infections with the immunogenic parasites, invoking host immune responses, could prevent the transmission of other strains that may be more sensitive to the host immune products.</p><p>The prevalence of tsetse infections reported with <italic>T. brucei</italic> sspp. in the wild is low, typically in the order of 1–3% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Leak1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Waiswa1">[49]</xref>, suggesting the potential for only a small impact on the whole tsetse population. However, the prevalence of infections with other trypanosome species such as <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic>, can be significantly higher, for example 28% reported in Burkina Faso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Jamonneau1">[50]</xref> and 24% in Tanzania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Malele1">[51]</xref>. Furthermore infections with mixed trypanosome species are common, comprising over 30% of infections reported in natural populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Adams1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Morlais1">[54]</xref>. Our modeling results suggest that these higher infection rates could have substantial effect on the tsetse population dynamics if the presence of these parasite species were to cause similar reproductive delays. Such reproductive delays caused by immunogenic trypanosome strains could lead to a reduction in tsetse population size and consequently to less transmission of parasites to vertebrate hosts. In turn, the resulting reduced trypanosome prevalence in vertebrates would lead to a lower prevalence in tsetse and a corresponding rebound of the tsetse population until an equilibrium of trypanosome prevalence in tsetse and vertebrate hosts is reached at lower levels than would occur with an avirulent strain. The mechanisms of tsetse population regulation are not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Rogers1">[55]</xref>, so the magnitude of the impact of trypanosome-induced fecundity delays on trypanosome infections in vertebrates is difficult to predict.</p><p>Assuming that both parasite lines we investigated have equal probability for maturation in the salivary glands for mammalian transmission, our co-infection dynamics would favor the spread of the immunogenic phenotype. Reducing its tsetse host's fitness is evolutionarily disadvantageous to the trypanosome, but only weakly compared to the possible benefits of increased virulence. Interestingly, YTat1.1<sup>WT</sup> is known to be highly virulent in the mammalian host, but we do not have a virulence phenotype for YTat1.1<sup>EP</sup> since we cannot obtain salivary gland mammalian transmissible infections with this line. Trade-offs between virulence and parasite transmissibility can maintain virulence, as can competition within a host between multiple strains of a parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Galvani1">[56]</xref>. Co-evolution between pathogen and host could lead to more complicated dynamics, from the emergence of mutualism to an escalating cycle of virulence and host resistance. In fact, a field study demonstrated that the resistance of <italic>Anopheline</italic> mosquitoes to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite development varied considerably between different combinations of parasite and vector isolates, suggesting that there are specific compatibilities between the insect and parasite genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000192-Lambrechts1">[57]</xref>. If there is no cost of resistance against virulent trypanosomes, we would expect resistance to increase until the “virulent” trypanosome is driven extinct. In contrast, the “avirulent” trypanosome would not impose selection on its tsetse host, and would persist. If there is a cost of resistance however, there would be an equilibrium proportion of resistance genotype at which the cost of resistance is balanced by the cost and prevalence of virulent infection. In this case, if the avirulent trypanosome strain without any fecundity cost emerged and spread, genetically susceptible tsetse would be expected to completely replace resistant tsetse. Simultaneously, disease prevalence in both tsetse and mammalian hosts would rise. Future experiments will need to be conducted with flies in the field to understand the impact of natural parasite infections on host immunity, and the potential burden of host immune activation on fecundity in order to relate to disease epidemiology. Our laboratory findings coupled with our modeling studies now provide a framework to investigate the status of co-infections, host immune activation processes, fecundity outcomes, transmission dynamics and host virulence phenotypes in natural tsetse-trypanosome populations.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pntd.0000192.s001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000192.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Progeny fitness parameters for male and female [shaded] tsetse uninfected* and infected with YTat1.1<sup>WT</sup>.</p><p>* Progeny of control and uninfected (resistant) females were combined in all three observations because of the lack of any significant differences (P&lt;0.05).
