Cholera remains an important cause of diarrhea globally, and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> continues to cause major epidemics in the most vulnerable populations. Although there have been recent discoveries about how the bacterium adapts to the human intestine and causes diarrhea, there is little understanding of why some people are protected from infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. This article describes several factors that are associated with the risk of developing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection among people living in the same household with a patient with severe cholera who are at high risk of contracting the infection. One of the findings is that IgA antibodies, a type of antibody associated with immunity at mucosal surfaces such as the intestine, that target several components of the bacteria are associated with immunity to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection. This article also describes genetic and nutritional factors that additionally influence susceptibility to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research and by the following grants: U01 AI058935 (S.B.C.); RO3 AI063079 (FQ); R01 AI40725 (E.T.R.); International Research Scientist Development Award K01 TW07144 (R.C.L.); Pediatric Scientist Development Program K12 HD00850 (J.B.H.); International Research Scientist Development Award K01 TW07409 (J.B.H.), and Fogarty International Clinical Research Scholars Program D43 TW05572 (A.I.K.).

The O1 serogroup of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is classified into two biotypes (classical and El Tor), and two major serotypes (Inaba and Ogawa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Kaper1">[1]</xref>. In the 1960s, the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor biotype emerged as a major cause of cholera, ultimately replacing the classical biotype. In 1992, the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O139 serogroup first appeared, and after briefly predominating in South Asia, now persists in this region, but at much lower levels than <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor.</p><p>Although absent from the view of most resource-rich nations, the global impact of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection remains enormous. Cholera is vastly underreported, but it is estimated that there are over one million cases of cholera annually, with more than 100,000 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Anonymous1">[2]</xref>. According to the WHO, there is an urgent need for cholera vaccines that provide durable protection, particularly among children less than 5 years of age in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Anonymous1">[2]</xref>. One limitation to the development of effective vaccination programs for cholera is that the factors that determine human susceptibility to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> remain poorly defined.</p><p>Natural infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 induces adaptive immune responses that are protective against subsequent disease. Volunteer studies in non-endemic settings have demonstrated that infection with classical biotype <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 provides 100% protection from subsequent challenge with a classical biotype strain, while infection with the El Tor biotype of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 provides 90% protection from subsequent challenge with an El Tor strain. This protection lasts at least 3 years in volunteer studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Levine1">[3]</xref>. In an endemic area, an initial episode of El Tor cholera reduces the risk of a second clinically apparent infection by 90% over the next several years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Glass1">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The best-studied correlate of immunity to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is the serum vibriocidal antibody, a complement-fixing bacteriocidal antibody. Seroepidemiologic studies in endemic areas have shown that vibriocidal antibody titers increase with age and correlate with protection from cholera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Glass2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Mosley1">[6]</xref>. However, there is no threshold vibriocidal antibody titer above which complete protection from infection is achieved, and the vibriocidal antibody may be a surrogate marker for an undetermined protective immune response at the mucosal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Saha1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Although a major component of the vibriocidal antibody is directed against serotype specific LPS, levels of serum LPS-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody have not been found to correlate with protection from cholera in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Glass2">[5]</xref>. A portion of the vibriciodal antibody may also be directed against <italic>V. cholerae</italic> outer membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Neoh1">[8]</xref>. Antitoxin immunity is primarily directed at the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB); however serum IgG-antibodies to CTB have not been found to correlate with protection from cholera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Glass2">[5]</xref>, and toxin-based vaccines confer only transient protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Clemens1">[9]</xref>. Robust mucosal and systemic humoral responses to TcpA, the major subunit of the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), a type IV pilus that is required for intestinal colonization, have recently been demonstrated in patients with cholera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Asaduzzaman1">[10]</xref>, but it is unknown whether these responses are associated with protection from disease.</p><p>In addition to adaptive immune responses, innate host characteristics may also influence the outcome of an individual's exposure to <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Multiple case-control studies in cholera endemic areas have demonstrated that individuals with blood group O are at increased risk of hospitalization with cholera, and it has been hypothesized that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection may have selected for the low prevalence of the O blood group in the Ganges Delta region, a historic and current global epicenter of cholera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Glass3">[11]</xref>. Other genetic or innate immune factors may also influence susceptibility to cholera. For example, studies of duodenal biopsies obtained from patients with cholera demonstrate recruitment of neutrophils to the intestinal epithelium during acute infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Qadri1">[12]</xref>, and also reveal increased expression of broad classes of innate immune effectors, including lactoferrin and other antibacterial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Flach1">[13]</xref>, suggesting further potential sources of genetic variability that might contribute to susceptibility to cholera.</p><p>The nutritional status of the host may also affect susceptibility to diarrheal diseases such as cholera, by influencing both innate and adaptive immunity. The micronutrients zinc and vitamin A play central roles in mucosal immunity, and when given in community-based supplementation programs, may reduce the incidence and morbidity of diarrheal diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-FischerWalker1">[14]</xref>. Although zinc supplementation in children has been found to modify adaptive immune responses to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Qadri2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Albert1">[16]</xref>, there are no prior studies demonstrating a specific association between baseline nutritional characteristics and the risk of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection in individuals.</p><p>Here, we present the results of a prospective, observational study aimed at identifying host factors that are associated with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection within households in a cholera-endemic setting. Our results may be relevant to the design and evaluation of more effective cholera vaccines for use in resource-poor areas of the world.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and subject enrollment</title><p>The hospital at the Clinical Research and Service Centre (CRSC) of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) provides care for more than 100,000 patients annually, including approximately 10,000 to 20,000 with cholera, the majority of whom are residents of Dhaka city. Index cases presenting to the hospital with severe acute watery diarrhea were eligible for inclusion in this study if their stool cultures were subsequently positive for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, if they were older than 6 months, and if they were without significant co-morbid conditions. Upon presentation of the index case, a field team discussed enrollment with household contacts of the index case, and consenting household contacts were then enrolled into the study immediately upon culture confirmation of the index case (within 24 hours of presentation of the index case). Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared the same cooking pot for three or more days. Blood specimens for ABO typing, baseline vibriocidal titers, and baseline anti-LPS, anti-CTB and anti-TcpA antibody levels were immediately collected from consenting household contacts upon enrollment. The field team visited household contacts on each of the next six days, and again on days 14 and 21. During these visits, contacts were questioned about diarrheal symptoms, and rectal swabs were obtained for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> culture. Follow-up blood samples for vibriocidal antibody titers were obtained from contacts on study days 7 and 21.

As with the vibriocidal antibody, higher serum levels of LPS-specific IgA were associated with protection from infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1, but not with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O139. CTB-specific serum IgA levels were associated with protection from infection with both the O1 and O139 serogroups (the ORs were equivalent), but this finding only reached statistical significance for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 infection. TcpA-specific IgA levels were associated with significant protection against both O1 and O139 serogroups. In contrast with serum IgA results, there were no associations between serum LPS, CTB, or TcpA-specific IgG and outcomes in household contacts.</p><p>In a smaller subset of our cohort of household contacts, we also evaluated CTB and LPS- specific IgA levels in fecal extracts. This analysis included 282 contacts that completed 21 days of follow-up prior to June 2002. Fecal levels of antigen specific IgA were not significantly correlated with serum IgA levels to the same antigen. Levels of fecal CTB IgA were not significantly associated with the risk of infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, or with the risk of diarrhea in infected individuals.

A total of 259 household contacts that completed 21 days of follow-up were classified based on relatedness to the index case. The analysis included 197 first-degree relatives (i.e. siblings, parents or children) of the index case, and 62 non-first degree relatives.

In this study, we identified novel immunologic markers that predict protection from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection in a population in Bangladesh, as well as other host characteristics that modify susceptibility.</p><p>The vibriocidal antibody is the only previously described marker of immunity to cholera and is routinely utilized in pilot studies of vaccine efficacy. Here, we show that levels of serum IgA specific to three V. <italic>cholerae</italic> antigens – CTB, LPS and TcpA – also predict protection among household contacts of patients infected with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor, the current predominant cause of cholera. Interestingly, levels of serum IgG directed against these same antigens did not predict protection, possibly because serum IgA levels better reflect protective immune responses at the intestinal mucosal surface where secretory IgA (sIgA) is the predominant immunoglobulin. We also examined baseline fecal levels of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> antigen specific IgA, although there was no significant correlation of these with baseline serum IgA antibodies to the same antigen. Antigen-specific fecal IgA levels did not correlate with protection from cholera, except for a mild effect of fecal IgA specific to LPS. This might reflect proteolysis of IgA in fecal samples, such that baseline fecal IgA measurement may not adequately represent an accurate level of the response to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> antigens at the mucosal level.</p><p>Among the antigens evaluated, responses to TcpA appear to be unique in that they are associated with protection from both the O1 and O139 serogroups. Expression of <italic>tcpA</italic> mRNA is highly up-regulated in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> during human infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Larocque1">[24]</xref>, yet it remains uncertain to what extent this antigen is present in current killed and live-oral cholera vaccines. A systematic comparison of TcpA responses in naturally-infected individuals compared to vaccine recipients would be important to address this question. Our data suggest that inclusion of TcpA as a vaccine component may be useful in boosting protective immunity across both serogroups.</p><p>Studies in the rabbit ileal loop model of cholera suggest that anti-toxin and anti-LPS immune responses are synergistic in the prevention of fluid accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Svennerholm1">[25]</xref>. In concordance with this observation, our multivariate analysis showed that both anti-toxin (anti-CTB) and anti-bacterial (vibriocidal antibody) responses were independent predictors of susceptibility to cholera. This finding is also consistent with the results of clinical trials of the whole cell-B subunit vaccine, which suggest a role for anti-CTB responses in conferring additional short term protection compared with whole cell vaccine alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000221-Clemens1">[9]</xref>. Our multivariate model also indicated that increasing age predicted immunity from cholera, independent of both anti-CTB IgA and vibriocidal antibody levels, suggesting that additional components of protective immunity remain unidentified.</p><p>In addition to adaptive immune responses, we identified other host and environmental characteristics that affected the risk of developing cholera in our study population. Although an association between blood group phenotype and severity of cholera has previously been recognized, we observed an additional familial segregation of susceptibility to cholera within households. In particular, first-degree relatives of cholera patients were significantly more likely to develop infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> than less closely related members living in the same household, and this was independent of blood group. Such increased susceptibility might be related to closer contact or shared behaviors between first degree relatives, or could reflect additional genetic components of susceptibility to cholera.</p><p>We found direct evidence to support the importance of nutrition in susceptibility to infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Increasing levels of retinol, but not zinc, were associated with decreased susceptibility to both infection and symptomatic disease. This observation underscores the importance of retinol supplementation in young children in developing countries where cholera is endemic.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. Although we demonstrated that cholera antigen-specific serum IgA levels correlate with protection from infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, it is possible that these immunologic markers, like the vibriocidal antibody, are surrogates for protective immune responses localized at the mucosal surface. Thus, the inability to measure intestinal levels of sIgA using non-invasive techniques remains a major limitation and necessitates the discovery of better proxy measurements of mucosal immunity. It is also possible that a portion of household contacts in our study were infected prior to onset of symptoms of the recognized household index case. We accounted for this by excluding from assessment of baseline immunologic characteristics those contacts reporting diarrhea in the week prior to enrollment or having a positive rectal swab upon entry into the study.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that immunologic, genetic, and nutritional characteristics of individuals all contribute to human susceptibility to infection with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in a household. Although it is hypothesized that immune responses at the mucosal surface are the primary mediators of protection from <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the specific antigens to which these responses are directed have not been identified. Our observation that levels of serum IgA (but not serum IgG) directed at certain <italic>V. cholerae</italic> antigens are associated with protection from infection underscores the need to better understand anti-<italic>V. cholerae</italic> immunity at the mucosal surface. Such understanding would be critical in designing and evaluating improved vaccines against <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the study participants as well
