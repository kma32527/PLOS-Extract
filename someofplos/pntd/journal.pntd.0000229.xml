However, few studies have evaluated the complete SAFE strategy, and of these, none have investigated the associations of Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement (A,F,E) interventions and active trachoma.

Children aged 1–9 years were examined for trachoma and uptake of SAFE assessed through interviews and observations. Using ordinal logistic regression, associations between signs of active trachoma and A,F,E interventions were explored. Trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI) was considered more severe than trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF). A total of 1,712 children from 25 clusters (villages) were included in the analysis. Overall uptake of A,F,E interventions was: 53.0% of the eligible children had received at least one treatment with azithromycin; 62.4% children had a clean face on examination; 72.5% households reported washing faces of children two or more times a day; 73.1% households had received health education; 44.4% of households had water accessible within 30 minutes; and 6.3% households had pit latrines. Adjusting for age, sex, and district baseline prevalence of active trachoma, factors independently associated with reduced odds of a more severe active trachoma sign were: receiving three treatments with azithromycin (odds ratio [OR] = 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0–0.4); clean face (OR = 0.3; 95% CI 0.2–0.4); washing faces of children three or more times daily (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.3–0.7); and presence and use of a pit latrine in the household (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–0.9).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Analysis of associations between the A,F,E components of the SAFE strategy and active trachoma showed independent protective effects against active trachoma of mass systemic azithromycin treatment, facial cleanliness, face washing, and use of pit latrines in the household.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a strategy for trachoma control known as SAFE—surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement. Regular evaluations of trachoma control activities are advocated for by the WHO for decision making, programme planning, and the rational use of programme resources. We undertook a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of the SAFE strategy following three years of interventions in four districts in Southern Sudan. In this paper, we aimed to find out the relationship between the antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement (A,F,E) and active trachoma signs. Our study revealed that prevalence of active trachoma was less in children who had received treatment with azithromycin, had clean faces, had faces washed more frequently, and used latrines compared to children who had not received these interventions. The study findings are important since they make the case for implementing the A,F,E interventions together.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Surveys were funded by the Lions Clubs International.

Antibiotic therapy in individuals and facial cleanliness in children, combined with environmental improvement (A,F,E components of SAFE), have been designed to treat ocular Chlamydia infection and reduce the risk of transmission of ocular Chlamydia.</p><p>There is evidence from randomised controlled trials that the individual A,F,E components of the SAFE strategy have an effect on active trachoma when applied on their own: effect of antibiotics on active trachoma at three months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Schachter1">[2]</xref>; effect of face-washing on trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-West1">[3]</xref>; and effect of fly-control on active trachoma at three and six months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Emerson2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Emerson3">[6]</xref>. In these trials, the effects of these components have been tested individually to avoid the use of hybrid interventions that generate findings that are difficult to interpret. The challenge of disentangling the relative contribution to an effect of a combination of components has prevented trials of such hybrid trials being conducted. However, the reality of program implementation is that SAFE is a comprehensive and integrated strategy that has three control components (the A,F,E) that should be applied simultaneously.</p><p>In the biological and epidemiological context, it is reasonable to expect there to be an additive effect of the A,F,E components of the SAFE strategy. Mass azithromycin administration, plus an increase in clean faces among children, plus improved access to water, plus reduced vector populations will likely be more effective than any one component alone. Despite the need for evaluation of the combined effects of A,F,E components of SAFE being highlighted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Sommer1">[7]</xref>, no studies have explored the relationship between programme delivery of the combined A,F,E interventions and prevalence of active trachoma. Therefore we aimed to investigate the association between active trachoma and community intervention with A,F,E components of the SAFE strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Surveys were conducted in four districts (Kiech Kuon, Padak, Katigiri and Tali) in Southern Sudan between April to June 2005.

In brief, population based surveys were undertaken to estimate the prevalence of active trachoma signs before and following three years of implementation of the SAFE strategy. A two-stage cluster random sampling design was used to select the sample. In each district, 6 villages (clusters) were selected in stage one and 30 households selected in each cluster at the second stage. All eligible persons residing in the household were examined for trachoma and/ or interviewed.

During the annual treatment round, teams of distributors including health care workers and trained village volunteer moved from village to village providing directly observed treatment to all eligible persons.

Descriptive statistics were used to examine the sample characteristics, prevalence of active trachoma signs, prevalence of A,F,E interventions, and other explanatory variables. Differences in proportions were compared by chi-square test. To investigate the association between severity of active trachoma signs and A,F,E interventions, ordinal logistic hierarchical regression models were developed using generalized linear models (GLM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-McCullagh1">[22]</xref>. The multilevel structure of GLM allowed for non-independence of the household and district variables, enabled clustering of individual observations within households, and districts, and allowed for variability at individual, household, village and district levels. We fitted an ordinal logistic regression model to study associations between severity of active trachoma signs and A,F,E interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Hosmer1">[23]</xref>. This model allowed for analysis of a polytomous ordinal response on a set of predictors and computed odds ratios (OR) of having a more severe active trachoma sign compared to a less severe sign. In this model TI was considered more severe than TF, which is in turn a more severe sign of trachoma than a normal conjunctiva. This method did not assume that TF causes TI or that the relationship between the three orders (normal, TF only, and any TI) is linear. Univariate analysis was conducted for each explanatory variable. Multivariable models were then developed by stepwise regression analysis for model selection. This involved starting with a null model then proceeding in a sequential fashion of adding/deleting explanatory variables if they satisfied the entry/removal criterion which was set at 5% significance level using a log-likelihood ratio test. Age and sex were retained in all multivariable models to control for any potential confounding effects. Potential effect modification was evaluated by including interaction terms in the models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of missing data by multiple imputations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Rubin1">[24]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>The Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement Secretariat of Health (SPLM/Health) approved the protocol and clearance to conduct the surveys was obtained from the local authorities.

The number of individual treatments with azithromycin was associated with reduced relative odds of having less severe active trachoma (p-trend = 0.036). Having received one or two treatments was associated with a 20% reduction in the relative odds of active trachoma; however, this was not statistically significant. Receiving three treatments was independently and strongly associated with reduction on the relative odds of active trachoma: OR = 0.1; 95% CI (0.0–0.7). Clean face was also strongly associated with independent reduction in the relative odds of active trachoma: OR = 0.3; 95% CI (0.2–0.4). Reports of washing faces of children two or more times was independently associated with reduced relative odds of active trachoma (p-trend = 0.001); whereas households using pit latrines had 60% reduction in relative odds of active trachoma: OR = 0.4; 95% CI (0.2–0.9). There was no evidence of interaction between the A,F,E interventions based on our effect modification models. Sensitivity analysis of the effect of missing data by multiple imputation of missing data and analysis of association between severity of active trachoma and A,F,E interventions revealed effect estimates similar to those in which missing data had been excluded (data not shown).</p><table-wrap id="pntd-0000229-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0000229.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis of association between severity of active trachoma (no TF, no TI; TF only; any TI) and A,F,E interventions (n = 17,12).</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pntd-0000229-t003-3" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000229.t003" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Factor</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Odds Ratio<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">*</xref></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">95% CI</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">p-value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>A</bold>ntibiotics (azithromycin treatment)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 time</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.8</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.5–1.1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">p-trend = 0.036</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 times</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.8</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.5–1.4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 times</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.0–0.7</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>F</bold>acial cleanliness</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clean face</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.3</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.2–0.4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Face washing per day (twice)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.7</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.4–1.0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">p-trend = 0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Face washing per day (thrice or more)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.3–0.7</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>E</bold>nvironmental improvement</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pit latrine</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.2–0.9</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.031</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt105"><p>*Adjusted for the effects of age, sex and baseline prevalence</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have previously published findings on the effects of three years of the SAFE strategy in Southern Sudan based on a before-and-after analysis comparing change in prevalence of active trachoma signs at baseline compared to the three-year evaluation; which suggested that where more A,F,E activities had been implemented, greater declines in prevalence were observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Ngondi1">[8]</xref>. In this study we present a cross-sectional analysis of associations between active trachoma and A,F,E components of the SAFE strategy. The cross-sectional nature of our data had limitations in that it did not take into account all the baseline risk factors that may influence the outcome. Modelling associations between change in prevalence of active trachoma and interventions accounting for change in risk factors would yield more precise results. However, this would not have been possible since the triennial evaluation was not designed to measure change in risk factors. Further research for a more rigorous method of modelling the effect of A,F,E interventions using cross-sectional survey data accounting for change in potential risk factors is suggested.</p><p>Despite the limitations in the study design, our findings suggest that receiving three treatments with azithromycin, clean face, increased frequency of washing faces of children and use of pit latrines were independently associated with reduced prevalence of active trachoma. The A,F,E interventions are designed to reduce the risk of trachomatous inflammation in individuals and communities; leading to a reduction in the lifetime risk of conjunctival scarring and blinding complications of trachoma. The effect estimates are consistent with independent effects of A,F,E interventions and reinforce the argument for implementing the full SAFE strategy as an integrated approach to control blinding trachoma. The packaging of trachoma control interventions into a four-pronged community-based approach provides a comprehensive programme for trachoma elimination that is adaptable to many different situations and which can be implemented at the community level. Because each component of the SAFE strategy uses appropriate and readily adaptable technologies, trachoma control can be integrated with broader health and development efforts targeting poor and marginalized populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-WHO1">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Our survey was designed as an evaluation of the SAFE strategy under operational field conditions. We used clinical signs of active trachoma as operational outcome measures and maintained a high inter-observer reliability to minimize bias among trachoma graders, as recommended by the WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Solomon3">[26]</xref>. It has been argued that nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) of conjunctival swabs are the best way of determining the prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in order to monitoring mass antibiotic administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Dawson1">[27]</xref>; however, this is currently not advocated by the WHO for programmatic use. We measured health education, face washing, and azithromycin treatment based on self-reports by the female heads of households and caregivers of children. Reporting of face washing behaviour by mothers or caregivers of children was likely to be overestimated since in most cultures hygiene is considered a desirable activity regardless of the actual practices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Polack1">[28]</xref>. However, recall bias in reporting of azithromycin treatment in children by caregivers was likely to underestimate azithromycin usage to a large extent. While the magnitude of these biases cannot be estimated, our study showed independent associations of antibiotics treatment, clean face, face washing and pit latrines and lower prevalence of active trachoma signs. Use of multilevel models controlled for clustering and variability of our observations at the household, village and district levels as well as the potential confounding effects of age, sex and baseline district prevalence of active trachoma.</p><p>We defined a clean face as the absence of ocular and or nasal discharge. Face washing has been shown to be effective in improving facial cleanliness in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-West1">[3]</xref>. Having a clean face is though to reduce autoinfection with ocular Chlamydia as well as reducing transmission to others. However, active trachoma also causes ocular and nasal discharge; therefore it is unclear whether dirty faces lead to trachoma, or trachoma results in dirty faces, especially in cross-sectional studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Kuper1">[29]</xref>. Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Pruss1">[30]</xref>, our models showed that a clean face was independently associated with lower prevalence of active trachoma. We also found face washing two or more times a day to be independently associated with lower prevalence of active trachoma. Nonetheless, there was no evidence of statistical interaction between face washing and cleans faces and between the A,F,E interventions, possibly because our sample was not powered to investigate such interactions. Overall, our study suggests that children who lived in families that were more amenable to receiving mass distribution of azithromycin, owned a pit latrine, and had faces washed two or more times a day, were less likely to have active trachoma.</p><p>Previous studies have explored the relationship between active trachoma and interventions based on ecological analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Ewald1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Astle1">[34]</xref>. However, ecological analyses have a major limitation since bias may result by generalisation of correlation of observations made at a group level to individuals. Our study has advantages since we have modelled individual outcomes of active trachoma. The ordinal category of active trachoma severity is more precise than the conventional dichotomous approach since it makes full use of the data on active trachoma signs that is inherent in the WHO simplified grading scheme. Variability in characteristics across the study districts has previously been highlighted as a possible explanation for heterogeneity in uptake of SAFE and therefore likely to affect the effectiveness of SAFE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000229-Ngondi1">[8]</xref>. We used multilevel models which allowed for variability at individual, households and district levels as well as adjustment for non-independence of observations at household and district levels (clustering).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study of associations between the A,F,E components of SAFE and active trachoma showed independent protective effects against active trachoma of mass systemic azithromycin treatment, clean face on examination, reported face washing, and presence and use of pit latrines in the household.
