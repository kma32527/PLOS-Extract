Until recently, pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B or pentamidine compounded the classical arsenal of treatment. All these drugs are toxic and have to be administered by the parenteral route. Tamoxifen has been used as an antiestrogen in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer for many years. Its safety and pharmacological profiles are well established in humans. We have shown that tamoxifen is active as an antileishmanial compound in vitro, and in this paper we analyzed the efficacy of tamoxifen for the treatment of mice infected with <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic>, an etiological agent of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis and the main cause of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis in South America.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>BALB/c mice were infected with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes. Five weeks post-infection, treatment with 15 daily intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg tamoxifen was administered. Lesion and ulcer sizes were recorded and parasite burden quantified by limiting dilution. A significant decrease in lesion size and ulcer development was noted in mice treated with tamoxifen as compared to control untreated animals. Parasite burden in the inoculation site at the end of treatment was reduced from 10<sup>8.5±0.7</sup> in control untreated animals to 10<sup>5.0±0.0</sup> in tamoxifen-treated mice. Parasite load was also reduced in the draining lymph nodes. The reduction in parasite number was sustained: 6 weeks after the end of treatment, 10<sup>15.5±0.5</sup> parasites were quantified from untreated animals, as opposed to 10<sup>5.1±0.1</sup> parasites detected in treated mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Treatment of BALB/c mice infected with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> for 15 days with tamoxifen resulted in significant decrease in lesion size and parasite burden. BALB/c mice infected with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> represents a model of extreme susceptibility, and the striking and sustained reduction in the number of parasites in treated animals supports the proposal of further testing of this drug in other models of leishmaniasis.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Leishmaniasis is an antropozoonotic disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations. In humans, signs of disease vary from skin and mucosal ulcers to enlargement of internal organs such as the liver and spleen. The unicellular parasite <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> is able to infect humans and cause localized or diffuse skin lesions. The treatment for this disease is difficult, as it requires prolonged and painful applications of toxic drugs that are poorly tolerated. Therefore, a key area in leishmaniasis research is the study of new therapeutic schemes and less toxic drugs. The present report is based on the investigation of tamoxifen's activity (a compound that has been in clinical use since the 1970s for the treatment of breast cancer) in the treatment of mice experimentally infected with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>. We observed that infected mice treated with 20 mg/kg/day of tamoxifen for 15 days showed a significant clinical and parasitological response, with reduction in the size of lesions and ulcers and decreased numbers of parasites. These promising results pave the way for further testing of this drug as a new alternative in the chemotherapy of leishmaniasis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).

Therefore, new alternatives for the treatment of leishmaniasis are greatly needed.</p><p>In South America, <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> is one of the causative agents of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis and the most important agent of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), a devastating disease with uncontrolled progression, characterized by multiple skin lesions and vaste numbers of amastigotes. As a rule, there is no satisfactory response to DCL treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Franke1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Convit1">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown that the antiestrogen tamoxifen, a drug extensively used as a chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agent against breast cancer, presents leishmanicidal activity in vitro. This drug has a direct leishmanicidal effect and it also shifts the pH of parasitophorous vacuoles from acid to neutral, which in turn heightens the drug effect on amastigotes.

Female BALB/c mice (4–5 week-old) were inoculated with 5×10<sup>6</sup> stationary-phase parasites at the base of the tail. Five weeks after infection, mice were randomly assigned into experimental groups (n = 7–10). Treated groups received intraperitoneal injections of 30.4 mg tamoxifen citrate/kg/day (the drug equivalent to 20 mg/kg/day tamoxifen) or 20 mg/kg/day meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) for 15 days. Tamoxifen citrate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA; Glucantime was a kind gift from Sanofi-Aventis. Stock solutions of tamoxifen were prepared in saline every two days and stored at 4°C. Disease progression was evaluated once a week by recording the average diameter of the tail measured as the mean of tail base diameters in horizontal and vertical directions) and the ulcer size, expressed as the ulcer area in mm<sup>2</sup>. Measurements were taken with a caliper (Mitutoyo Corp., Japan). Body and uterus weights were also registered. Animal experiments were repeated four times and were approved by the Ethical Committee.</p><p>Parasite burden from infected tissue was quantified as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Lima1">[11]</xref>. Promastigotes differentiated from lesion amastigotes were used on drug sensitivity assays while in the first passage in vitro. Cellular viability was assessed by measuring the cleavage of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) by metabolically active cells as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Barcinski1">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Data on lesion progression were analyzed for statistical significance by using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (GraphPad Prism 5 software).

At the end of treatment, the average body weight in animals treated with tamoxifen was equivalent to values for the control group (untreated mice: 26.2±1.1 g; treated mice: 25.4±1.8 g) and the average weight of uteri indicated no significant alteration between tamoxifen-treated (0.18±0.4 g) and untreated mice (0.21±0.6 g). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000249-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the progression of lesion size in untreated <italic>versus</italic> tamoxifen-treated mice.

Effectiveness was apparent not only as reduced swelling and ulceration in treated animals but also as an important reduction in parasite burden.</p><p>The experimental model of infection used in this study is one of extreme susceptibility. BALB/c mice infected subcutaneously with <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> develop progressive swelling at the inoculation site, followed by ulceration and loss of tissue simultaneous with the appearance of methastasis at distant sites. The treatment did not lead to sterile cure of lesions but <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites have been shown to remain present and viable, although in decreased numbers, after treatment with antimonials in a variety of animal models, as well as in humans. The lack of clinical or parasitological response to Glucantime in <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> BALB/c infected mice has been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Gonalves1">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the timing for initiation of treatment can significantly influence the disease outcome, as stressed by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Garnier1">[14]</xref>. Our experimental treatments were initiated 30–35 days after mice infection, an interval of time that allowed the establishment of disease and when infection sites were already swollen and, in some animals, had started ulcerating. So, the data shown here imply that the intraperitoneal administration of tamoxifen resulted in a remarkable response to treatment. We are currently evaluating tamoxifen's efficacy in the treatment of other models of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. We have shown in vitro that tamoxifen leishmanicidal effect is independent of the estrogen receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Miguel1">[10]</xref> and therefore it is unlikely that response to treatment would be different in male or female mice. Indeed, preliminary results obtained in <italic>Leishmania chagasi</italic> infected hamsters show no gender-related effect on the anti-leishmanial response to tamoxifen.</p><p>Apart from its direct leishmanicial activity, tamoxifen mode of action in vivo could involve other pathways favouring amelioration of the infection. Tamoxifen has been reported to increase synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Loo1">[15]</xref>. We did not detect differences in the accumulation of nitrate on supernatants of <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> infected macrophages treated or not treated with tamoxifen (data not shown).</p><p>The metabolite profile of tamoxifen varies in different animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Robinson1">[16]</xref>. This drug has been used in mice in a variety of doses and administration schemes. The dosage employed in this study was chosen based on previous reports showing that, in mice, daily intraperitoneal injections of 25 to 100 mg/kg of tamoxifen resulted in drug serum levels similar to those observed in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-DeGregorio1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>This antiestrogen has been widely used for treatment and prevention of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Jordan1">[18]</xref>. The most serious side effect observed on clinical grounds is an increased risk for endometrial cancer which appears after prolonged use. Effects observed in our experiments suggest that antileishmanial therapy with tamoxifen would not require extensive periods of treatment. We did not detect changes in uterine weight in treated female mice, a well-established parameter for evaluation of tamoxifen's toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Perry1">[19]</xref>. Tamoxifen administered at 40 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks has been recently shown to impair bone growth in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000249-Karimian1">[20]</xref> raising concerns on the application of this drug to treat leishmaniasis in children. We are also investigating the effect of other selective estrogen receptor modulators with different effects in bone metabolism, like raloxifene, as antileishmanial drugs.</p><p>The potential value of tamoxifen for treating human leishmaniasis needs further evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an in vivo investigation on tamoxifen's efficacy against <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection and points to a new alternative in the
