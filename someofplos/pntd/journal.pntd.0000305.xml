<p>Parasites of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genus can rapidly alter several macrophage (MØ) signalling pathways in order to tame down the innate immune response and inflammation, therefore favouring their survival and propagation within their mammalian host. Having recently reported that <italic>Leishmania</italic> and bacterial LPS generate a significantly stronger inflammatory response in animals and phagocytes functionally deficient for the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1), we hypothesized that <italic>Leishmania</italic> could exploit SHP-1 to inactivate key kinases involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling and innate immunity such as IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1). Here we show that upon infection, SHP-1 rapidly binds to IRAK-1, completely inactivating its intrinsic kinase activity and any further LPS-mediated activation as well as MØ functions. We also demonstrate that the SHP-1/IRAK-1 interaction occurs via an evolutionarily conserved ITIM-like motif found in the kinase domain of IRAK-1, which we named KTIM (<underline>K</underline>inase <underline>T</underline>yrosyl-based <underline>I</underline>nhibitory <underline>M</underline>otif). This regulatory motif appeared in early vertebrates and is not found in any other IRAK family member. Our study additionally reveals that several other kinases (e.g. Erk1/2, IKKα/β) involved in downstream TLR signalling also bear KTIMs in their kinase domains and interact with SHP-1. We thus provide the first demonstration that a pathogen can exploit a host protein tyrosine phosphatase, namely SHP-1, to directly inactivate IRAK-1 through a generally conserved KTIM motif.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> developed several methods to seize control of macrophage signalling pathways in an effort to inactivate their killing abilities. One effective method utilized by the parasite is the activation of host protein tyrosine phosphatases, specifically SHP-1. This increased phosphatase activity contributes to the inactivation of signalling molecules involved in critical macrophage functions such as NO and cytokine production. Interestingly, the absence of SHP-1 results in stronger macrophage inflammatory responses to a bacterial cell wall component known as LPS, a molecule detected by macrophages through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This observation suggested a role for SHP-1 in the regulation of TLR signalling. Our study reveals that upon <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, SHP-1 is able to rapidly bind to and inactivate a critical kinase (IRAK-1) in this pathway. This regulatory binding was shown to be mediated by an evolutionarily conserved motif identified in the kinase. This motif was also present in other kinases involved in Toll signalling and therefore could represent a regulatory mechanism of relevance to many kinases. This work not only reports a unique mechanism by which <italic>Leishmania</italic> can avoid harmful TLR signalling, but also provides a platform on which extensive investigation on host evasion mechanisms and regulation of cellular kinases can be gained.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Innate inflammatory responses play a critical role in controlling pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Takeda1">[1]</xref>. However, protozoan parasites such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> evolved strategies to avoid phagocyte activation by seizing control of key signalling pathways, therefore favouring their invasion and survival within the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Olivier1">[2]</xref>. We recently reported that the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-1 plays a pivotal role in taming down phagocyte-mediated inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Forget1">[3]</xref>. For instance, we showed that in the absence of SHP-1, several pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα) and chemokines, as well as inflammatory neutrophil recruitment were all exacerbated by <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Forget1">[3]</xref>. Of interest, we also found that LPS mediates an excessive inflammatory response in the absence of SHP-1, therefore suggesting that SHP-1 could exert its negative regulatory action via Toll like receptor (TLR) signalling.</p>
<p>As SHP-1 can interact with various members of the JAK and MAP kinase families in physiological, immune response, and infection contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Olivier1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Forget1">[3]</xref>, we explored the possibility that the capacity of <italic>Leishmania</italic> to block the macrophage (MØ) inflammatory response could result from rapid IRAK-1 kinase inactivation through SHP-1 action. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the fact that several LPS-mediated MØ functions (e.g. TNFα, NO, IL-12), critical for the containment of pathogens and adaptive immune response development, are inhibited upon <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Olivier1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Cameron1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Carrera1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Whereas invertebrates depend mainly on the evolutionarily conserved innate immune system to fight off pathogens, vertebrates have developed a sophisticated adaptive immune system, hence the need to regulate the innate immune response. The TLR family has been shown to play a key role in triggering innate immunity as well as the subsequent induction of adaptive immune responses in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Lang1">[6]</xref>. Our previous findings reporting augmented <italic>Leishmania</italic>- and LPS-induced innate inflammatory response in the absence of SHP-1 (PTPN6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Forget1">[3]</xref>, and the several reports that key transcription factors (NF-κB and AP-1) related to TLR signalling were strongly activated in the absence of SHP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Forget2">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Massa1">[9]</xref>, suggested the importance of SHP-1 in the negative regulation of TLR signalling and its subsequent inflammatory response in vertebrates. Of interest, a mutation in the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene coding for SHP-1 in humans has been recently linked to Sezary syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Alonso1">[10]</xref>, a T-cell cutaneous lymphoma arising from chronic inflammatory state.</p>
<p>From these observations, and given the fact that IRAK-1 serves as a crucial kinase in all MyD88-dependent pathways leading to the activation of innate inflammatory responses, we hypothesised that SHP-1 is a critical player in the negative regulation of this kinase that can be exploited by <italic>Leishmania</italic>. For instance, until recently there was no indication that SHP-1 could interact with IRAK-1. However, a recent study by Cao's laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-An1">[11]</xref> provided strong evidence that SHP-1 can interact with IRAK-1.</p>
<p>Here, we provide evidence that SHP-1 negatively regulates IRAK-1 intrinsic kinase activity in its resting state and upon <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection through binding to an evolutionarily conserved ITIM-like motif located within IRAK-1's kinase domain. In addition, it is important to stress that this is the first mention of this motif to be found within a kinase, as to date it has only been found within the intracytoplasmic portion of immunoglobin (Ig)-like receptors. Of interest, we also discovered that this ITIM-like motif was present in several other kinases. Finally, our study also provides evidence from <italic>in silico</italic> sequence analyses that both IRAK-1 and SHP-1 evolutionarily emerged in vertebrates concomitantly with the development of a better-controlled innate immune response. Therefore the appearance of this key interaction in early vertebrates may have also contributed to the development of the more complex adaptive immune response.</p>

<title>SHP-1 regulates IRAK-1 kinase activity by direct interaction</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of SHP-1 on IRAK-1 kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated IRAK-1 from the lysates of SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> MØs and their wildtype (WT) counterparts and subjected the IP to an IRAK-1 kinase assay. Results indicated that IRAK-1 kinase activity in SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> cells was significantly higher compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g001">Figure 1</xref>, top panel). The increase in IRAK-1 basal kinase activity observed in SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> cells is not due to a differential expression of IRAK-1 as supported by loading controls provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g001">Figure 1</xref>, lower panels).</p>

<p>Then, to evaluate whether the SHP-1 regulatory effect on IRAK-1's kinase activity involved their interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation assays and observed that IRAK-1 and SHP-1 co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Their association was further confirmed as we have detected PTP activity corresponding to SHP-1 in the IRAK-1 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, top panel), and IRAK-1 kinase activity in the IP of SHP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). A secondary rat antibody was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figures 2A and B</xref>). These experiments suggested the presence of IRAK-1 and SHP-1 in the same multi-protein complex. To test whether they directly interact, we <italic>in vitro</italic> translated IRAK-1 using radiolabelled methionine, and put the radiolabelled IRAK-1 in contact with GST-SHP-1. IRAK-1 was pulled down specifically by GST-SHP-1 and not by GST alone, showing that this interaction is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether the binding of SHP-1 is sufficient to regulate IRAK-1 kinase activity. To do so, IRAK-1 was immunoprecipitated and put in contact with increasing concentrations of active GST-SHP-1. IRAK-1 kinase activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by GST-SHP-1 and not by GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2D, left panel</xref>). Interestingly, the highest dose of GST-SHP-1 used to inhibit IRAK-1 activity did not alter IRAK-4's kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2D, right panel</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that the PTP-SHP-1 dephosphorylates tyrosyl residues raised the possibility that IRAK-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated. To investigate this hypothesis, alkali-resistance phosphoprotein assays were performed. Treatment of IRAK-1 kinase assay gels with KOH permits the in-gel dephosphorylation of pSer and pThr, but not pTyr allowing us to evaluate the contribution of tyrosine phosphorylation to the overall phosphorylation signal. Although IRAK-1 is known to be phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Kollewe1">[18]</xref>, our results represent the first demonstration that IRAK-1 is also tyrosine phosphorylated in the resting state, and that LPS increases IRAK-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation by 46±15% SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, upper panels). This finding was further confirmed by western blot using the 4G10 pTyr-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lower two panels).</p>

<title>SHP-1 binds to the kinase domain of IRAK-1 via an ITIM-like motif</title>
<p>At the view of our observations, we screened the mouse IRAK-1 sequence for possible SHP-1 binding sites. We discovered that IRAK-1 contains an ITIM-like motif (<sub>286</sub><bold>L</bold>V<bold>Y</bold>GF<bold>L</bold><sub>291</sub>) located in its kinase domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000305.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This motif was found to be absent in all the other IRAK family members since the last residue is a methionine instead of a leucine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000305.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To determine the involvement of this ITIM-like motif in the SHP-1/IRAK-1 binding, we used the full-length IRAK-1 sequence to introduce site-specific mutations within the motif followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Firstly, a Y288F mutation slightly decreased SHP-1 binding suggesting that possible phosphorylation of the motif's central tyrosine may increase binding affinity but is not absolutely necessary for the binding to occur. Secondly, an L291M mutation, which renders the site no more ITIM-like, significantly decreased SHP-1 binding. Thirdly, the G289A/F290Y/L291M triple mutation, which also disrupts the ITIM-like motif, completely abrogated the binding of SHP-1. Interestingly, this triple mutant of IRAK-1 is identical to the corresponding site within IRAK-4. Collectively, these site-specific mutations confirm the role of the ITIM-like motif in the binding of SHP-1 to IRAK-1. This represents the first description of such a motif in a kinase that we now call KTIM (<bold>K</bold>inase <bold>T</bold>yrosyl-based <bold>I</bold>nhibitory <bold>M</bold>otif). Importantly, these experiments also suggest that the SHP-1-mediated regulation of IRAK-1 is a mechanism not shared with IRAK-4.</p>

<p>As <italic>Leishmania</italic> activates host SHP-1 and blocks many LPS-mediated functions known to be detrimental to the parasite, we investigated the possibility that <italic>Leishmania</italic> inactivates IRAK-1.

<p>In light of these observations, we were interested to evaluate whether the <italic>Leishmania</italic>-mediated IRAK-1 kinase inactivation could alter LPS-mediated functions in infected MØs. Our results indicated that unlike LPS stimulation <italic>per se</italic> that activates IRAK-1, infection with <italic>Leishmania</italic> rendered IRAK-1 activation refractory to this TLR4 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Since IRAK-1 signals downstream of all TLRs with the exception of TLR3, we investigated whether this <italic>Leishmania</italic>-induced IRAK-1 inactivation is persistent upon stimulation with other TLR ligands. As expected, <italic>Leishmania</italic> was able to render IRAK-1 unresponsive to MALP (TLR2), flagellin (TLR5), and CpG (TLR9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that alteration of IRAK-1-dependent signalling by <italic>Leishmania</italic> causes a general unresponsiveness to a broad range of TLR ligands.

<p>To demonstrate that the increased SHP-1/IRAK-1 binding upon <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection is responsible for IRAK-1 inactivation, IRAK-1 kinase activity was monitored in infected WT and SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> MØs.

However, while the KTIM in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> showed some variations compared to the other vertebrate sequences (<bold>L</bold><underline>I</underline><bold>Y</bold><underline>LY</underline><bold>L</bold>), it was absent in zebrafish due to the presence of a methionine at the last position (<bold>V</bold><underline>I</underline><bold>Y</bold><underline>VYM</underline>). Next, we addressed the origin of IRAK-1 and SHP-1 as they are only present in vertebrates. Sequence similarity analyses, including available IRAK-4 sequences from vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000305.s004">Figure S4</xref>), indicate that IRAK-1 evolved from IRAK-4 by gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Similar sequence similarity comparisons suggest that SHP-1 evolved from SHP-2 and its orthologues found in invertebrates and that the ancestral SHP-1 gene also appeared through gene duplication in lower vertebrates (zebrafish) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g009">Figure 9B</xref>).</p>

<p>From these observations, we raised the question whether other kinases may also have a KTIM within their kinase domain. Although several proteins involved in MyD88-dependent signalling (e.g. MyD88, TIRAP, TRAF6) did not contain KTIMs in their amino acid sequence (data not shown), we were intrigued to discover that several kinases from the JAK, MAP, Src, and IKK kinase families (JAK2, JAK3, Erk1/2, JNK, p38, Lyn, IKKα/β) contained one or more potential KTIMs, the majority located within their kinase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). This finding raises the possibility that KTIMs play important regulatory functions for many kinases by favoring their interaction with SHP-1, as we herein report for IRAK-1. SHP-1 binding may control the activity of these kinases at resting state or regulate their activity upon activation. In gel phosphatase assays that we performed support this possibility as they demonstrate that IPs of IKK-β, Erk, JNK, and p38 indeed exhibit SHP-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000305-g010">Figure 10B</xref>), indicating that these kinases interact with SHP-1. Interestingly, Syk – a kinase that has no KTIM in its amino acid sequence – did not show interaction with SHP-1 at resting state.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> has been reported to inhibit critical LPS-mediated MØ functions such as NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12 and TNF) production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Olivier1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Cameron1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Carrera1">[5]</xref>. Although mechanisms whereby NO is inhibited by <italic>Leishmania</italic> in response to IFN-γ have been well explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Olivier1">[2]</xref>, our knowledge concerning the negative regulatory mechanisms leading to the down-regulation of LPS-mediated MØ functions in <italic>Leishmania</italic>-infected cells is limited. Herein, we provide the first demonstration that the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite can rapidly inactivate IRAK-1 kinase activity with the participation of SHP-1, therefore inhibiting MØ LPS-mediated functions. We further reveal that the mechanism by which this inactivation occurs is through the binding of SHP-1 to an evolutionarily-conserved ITIM-like motif located in the kinase domain of IRAK-1. This is the first demonstration that a pathogen can use a host PTP to inactivate IRAK-1 and therefore block signalling pathways ultimately leading to free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines production known to be detrimental to its survival.</p>
<p>Given that TNF is a potent MØ activator, NO is leishmanicidal, and IL-12 is a critical cytokine that drives Th1 responses essential for the development of immunity against <italic>Leishmania</italic>, it is not surprising that the parasite has evolved means to block the production of these molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Olivier1">[2]</xref>. A role for <italic>Leishmania</italic> phosphoglycans (PG) has been proposed in the inhibition of NO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Proudfoot1">[21]</xref>. In addition, roles for promastigote PG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Feng1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Piedrafita1">[23]</xref> and amastigote cysteine peptidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Weinheber1">[24]</xref> in the inhibition of LPS-mediated IL-12 production have been reported. Nevertheless, apart from very few reports about <italic>Leishmania</italic>-induced alterations in the Erk MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Feng1">[22]</xref> and the downstream transcription factor NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Weinheber1">[24]</xref>, very little is known about how LPS-mediated functions are inhibited by <italic>Leishmania</italic>. In this study, we confirmed that all three LPS-mediated MØ functions were inhibited by <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Importantly, looking at NO production as a key function involved in the killing of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, we were able to show that IRAK-1 signalling is key for its production. In fact, our finding that <italic>Leishmania</italic> inactivates IRAK-1 kinase activity and that this inactivation is persistent upon subsequent LPS-stimulation supports the fact that the parasite is able to successfully block LPS-mediated NO production in MØs. Interestingly, consistent with the fact that IRAK-1 signals downstream of many TLRs, we showed that IRAK-1 was also unresponsive in <italic>Leishmania</italic>–infected cells subjected to stimulation with TLR2, TLR5, and TLR9 ligands. This result suggests that the parasite causes wide range unresponsiveness to TLR signalling upon infection possibly allowing <italic>Leishmania</italic> to avoid any harmful MØ activation involving TLR engagement. Interestingly, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> has been shown to activate IRAK-1 in IFN-γ-primed MØs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Flandin1">[25]</xref> suggesting that the activation state of the MØ can play an important role in the ability of the parasite to inactivate IRAK-1. In an effort to understand how <italic>Leishmania</italic> inactivates IRAK-1, we were able to identify SHP-1 as a key player in this process as there was almost a complete rescue of IRAK-1 activity in SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> MØs infected with <italic>Leishmania</italic>. This rescue was corroborated by the parasite's inability to block LPS-mediated NO production in SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> MØs. These results suggest a new evasion mechanism whereby <italic>Leishmania</italic> can avoid detrimental MØ functions driven by MyD88-dependent pathways by blocking IRAK-1, a key kinase in this pathway.</p>
<p>Our observation that the <italic>Leishmania</italic>–mediated IRAK-1 inactivation was associated with enhanced SHP-1 binding to IRAK-1 fits with our finding that SHP-1 binds to and regulates IRAK-1 at resting state. We clearly showed that IRAK-1's intrinsic kinase activity was higher in SHP-1<sup>−/−</sup> compared to WT MØs identifying SHP-1 as a novel regulator of IRAK-1 activity, a finding supported by recent work of Cao and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-An1">[11]</xref>. The fact that SHP-1 interacts with and also dephosphorylates tyrosyl residues raised the possibility that IRAK-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated. Here, we show that IRAK-1 is indeed tyrosine phosphorylated at resting state, and further so in response to LPS stimulation. Given that IRAK-1 was previously shown to be phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Kollewe1">[18]</xref>, our findings represent the first demonstration that IRAK-1 is also tyrosine phosphorylated.</p>
<p>Having identified an ITIM-like motif in the kinase domain of IRAK-1 as the binding site of SHP-1, its functionality was demonstrated by generating mutations within the motif providing valuable information about the role of its amino acid components in the binding affinity of SHP-1. Firstly, the tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y288F) mutation suggested that the phosphorylation of the motif's central tyrosine is not necessary for the binding of SHP-1 to occur. Indeed it has been previously reported that tyrosyl phosphorylation within ITIMs is not always required for the binding of SH2-domain containing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Avril1">[26]</xref>. Secondly, the observation that the G289A-F290Y-L291M mutation caused a total abrogation of SHP-1 binding, and that the L291M mutation partially reduced binding suggested that the amino acids between the central tyrosine and the terminal leucine in the motif play an important role in the binding affinity of SHP-1. Lastly, as the triple mutant was designed to render the ITIM-like site in IRAK-1 identical to its corresponding site in IRAK-4, the loss of SHP-1 binding in this mutant suggested that the SHP-1-mediated regulation of IRAK-1 is a regulatory mechanism not shared with IRAK-4. It is noteworthy to emphasize that ITIMs have been named so due to their presence in intracytoplasmic portions of transmembrane receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Staub1">[27]</xref>. Given that here we describe this motif to be found in a cytosolic kinase and show that it mediates SHP-1 binding and IRAK-1negative regulation, we propose to rename it KTIM (<bold>K</bold>inase <bold>T</bold>yrosyl-based <bold>I</bold>nhibitory <bold>M</bold>otif).</p>
<p>In MyD88-dependent signalling pathways, binding of TLR ligand to its corresponding receptor causes a rearrangement of the receptor complex and triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88, which in turn recruits the kinases IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 to the receptor complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Takeda1">[1]</xref>. Upon critical phosphorylations of IRAK-1 by IRAK-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Kollewe1">[18]</xref>, IRAK-1 is partially activated and is able to get fully activated by autophosphorylation. This autophosphorylation causes IRAK-1 to detach from the MyD88 complex and attach to TRAF6 activating downstream signalling pathways. Therefore, the IRAK-1 inactivation by <italic>Leishmania</italic>-induced SHP-1 had to interfere somehow with the integrity of the previous signalling events. Of utmost interest, we have been able to show that although IRAK-1 was still able to bind MyD88 in <italic>Leishmania</italic>-infected MØs in response to LPS stimulation, the kinase was unable to detach from the MyD88 complex and bind to TRAF6 as the stimulation persisted. This is the first demonstration that a pathogen can interfere with Toll signalling by altering IRAK-1's capacity to dissociate from the MyD88 complex. This inability of IRAK-1 to detach from MyD88 is supported by our observation that the binding of <italic>Leishmania-</italic>induced SHP-1 to the kinase domain of IRAK-1 causes a strong inactivation of this kinase seen by its inability to autophosphorylate, a process required for IRAK-1 to detach from the receptor complex and activate downstream signalling cascades.</p>
<p>Finally, it was remarkable to find out that the KTIM in IRAK-1 was evolutionarily conserved from human to rodents. The absence of KTIM in fish and its appearance in amphibians suggests that this motif emerged rapidly after the appearance of the ancestral IRAK-1 gene in early branching vertebrates (amphibians) and was highly conserved thereafter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000305.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Our findings thus raise the possibility that during the course of evolution, the emergence of a mechanism to regulate the innate immune response by targeting IRAK-1 activity (e.g. SHP-1) may have favoured the development of a more sophisticated adaptive immune system in higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000305.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In addition, it is important to note that Toll-Interacting Protein (TOLLIP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Mushegian1">[28]</xref>, the only other negative regulator of IRAK-1 in the resting state has emerged very early in invertebrates as opposed to SHP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Neel1">[29]</xref>, IRAK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Li1">[30]</xref> and the KTIM motif which all appeared only in early vertebrates. Noteworthy, we found that several other kinases from the JAK, MAP and IKK kinase families contained one or more potential KTIMs raising the possibility that KTIMs play important regulatory functions in many kinases (other than IRAK-1) by favouring their interaction with SHP-1. In fact, it has been previously reported that some of these kinases (e.g. JAK2, JAK3, JNK, Erk1/2) are negatively regulated by SHP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Bedecs1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000305-Matsubara1">[33]</xref>. However, none of these studies paid great attention to the mechanism whereby SHP-1 either interacts or regulates these kinases. It remains to be mentioned that whereas some of these kinases are also present in invertebrates, IRAK-1 and its KTIM only appeared in vertebrates. This observation supports the idea that the appearance of this motif in IRAK-1 has favoured the development of a mechanism to control the innate immune response. In this context, regulation of IRAK-1 kinase activity would have prevented abnormal and exacerbated microbicidal and inflammatory immune responses that could have been detrimental to vertebrates and to the development of the adaptive immune response. It is also tempting to speculate that the appearance of an improved control over kinases by SHP-1 may have influenced the global development of vertebrates, as several of these kinases play pivotal roles in the regulation of cellular, molecular, developmental, and metabolic processes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified a new evasion mechanism whereby <italic>Leishmania</italic>-activated SHP-1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved KTIM located in IRAK-1's kinase domain leading to its inactivation. This abrogation was associated with the inability of IRAK-1 to detach from the MyD88 complex to bind TRAF6, consequently resulting in the unresponsiveness of <italic>Leishmania</italic>-infected macrophages to several TLR ligand stimulation including LPS. By doing so, the parasite is not only able to block LPS-mediated MØ production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be involved in <italic>Leishmania</italic> killing, but also terminate the extremely important roles played by these molecules in the development of an effective adaptive immune response. At the evolutionary level, we propose that the appearance of SHP-1 as a key regulator of IRAK-1 kinase activity represented a pivotal evolutionary step that could have favoured the development of the adaptive immune response in vertebrates.</p>
