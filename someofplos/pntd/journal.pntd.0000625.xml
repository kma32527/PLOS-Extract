<title>Background</title>
<p>Filarial nematodes, including <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>, the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, undergo molting in both arthropod and mammalian hosts to complete their life cycles. An understanding of how these parasites cross developmental checkpoints may reveal potential targets for intervention. Pharmacological evidence suggests that ecdysteroids play a role in parasitic nematode molting and fertility although their specific function remains unknown. In insects, ecdysone triggers molting through the activation of the ecdysone receptor: a heterodimer of EcR (ecdysone receptor) and USP (Ultraspiracle).</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>We report the cloning and characterization of a <italic>B. malayi</italic> EcR homologue (<italic>Bma-EcR</italic>). Bma-EcR dimerizes with insect and nematode USP/RXRs and binds to DNA encoding a canonical ecdysone response element (EcRE). In support of the existence of an active ecdysone receptor in <italic>Brugia</italic> we also cloned a <italic>Brugia rxr</italic> (retinoid X receptor) homolog (<italic>Bma-RXR</italic>) and demonstrate that Bma-EcR and Bma-RXR interact to form an active heterodimer using a mammalian two-hybrid activation assay. The Bma-EcR ligand-binding domain (LBD) exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation via a GAL4 fusion protein combined with a chimeric RXR in mammalian cells treated with Ponasterone-A or a synthetic ecdysone agonist. Furthermore, we demonstrate specific up-regulation of reporter gene activity in transgenic <italic>B. malayi</italic> embryos transfected with a luciferase construct controlled by an EcRE engineered in a <italic>B. malayi</italic> promoter, in the presence of 20-hydroxy-ecdysone.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study identifies and characterizes the two components (<italic>Bma-EcR</italic> and <italic>Bma-RXR</italic>) necessary for constituting a functional ecdysteroid receptor in <italic>B. malayi</italic>. Importantly, the ligand binding domain of BmaEcR is shown to be capable of responding to ecdysteroid ligands, and conversely, ecdysteroids can activate transcription of genes downstream of an EcRE in live <italic>B. malayi</italic> embryos. These results together confirm that an ecdysone signaling system operates in <italic>B. malayi</italic> and strongly suggest that Bma-EcR plays a central role in it. Furthermore, our study proposes that existing compounds targeting the insect ecdysone signaling pathway should be considered as potential pharmacological agents against filarial parasites.</p>
</sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Filarial parasites such as <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> and <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> are the causative agents of the tropical diseases lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, which infect 150 million people, mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia. Filarial nematodes have a complex life cycle that involves transmission and development within both mammalian and insect hosts. The successful completion of the life cycle includes four molts, two of which are triggered upon transmission from one host to the other, human and mosquito, respectively. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the molting processes in filarial nematodes may yield a new set of targets for drug intervention. In insects and other arthropods molting transitions are regulated by the steroid hormone ecdysone that interacts with a specialized hormone receptor composed of two different proteins belonging to the family of nuclear receptors. We have cloned from <italic>B. malayi</italic> two members of the nuclear receptor family that show many sequence and biochemical properties consistent with the ecdysone receptor of insects. This finding represents the first report of a functional ecdysone receptor homolog in nematodes. We have also established a transgenic hormone induction assay in <italic>B. malayi</italic> that can be used to discover ecdysone responsive genes and potentially lead to screening assays for active compounds for pharmaceutical development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human filarial parasitic nematodes are responsible for two chronic severely debilitating tropical diseases: lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. The global efforts in the treatment and control of the spread of infection for both parasites so far have resulted in limited success. Also, the widespread use of the few available specific drugs for fighting these diseases raises the possibility of the development of drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Awadzi1">[1]</xref>. With 140 million cases of infection worldwide, and over a billion people at risk of contracting these debilitating diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Molyneux1">[2]</xref>, the development of a wide range of therapeutic interventions and treatment options is urgent.</p>
<p>Filarial parasites spend portions of their life cycle in obligate mammalian and insect hosts. The completion of a successful life cycle requires the passage of the developing nematode through four molts, two in the mammalian host and two in the arthropod host. The transmission of the parasite from one host to the other initiates a rapid molt, indicating that the developmental cues that trigger molting are closely tied to the integration of the parasitic larva into a new host environment. Inhibition of molting would result in the arrest of the life cycle in either the mammalian or insect host and the prevention of both pathology and/or the infective cycle. Thus, the study of the molting process in filarial nematodes could point to specific targets for drug development.</p>
<p>Molting in ecdysozoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Aguinaldo1">[3]</xref> has been best characterized in insects. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) acts as the temporal signal to initiate molting, regulates embryogenesis, and coordinates tissue-specific morphogenetic changes in insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Riddiford1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Beckstead1">[6]</xref>. Ecdysone signaling is regulated by the activity of a heterodimeric receptor composed of two nuclear receptor proteins EcR and USP, although the hormone binding function resides only within EcR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Koelle1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Henrich1">[10]</xref>. After ligand binding, EcR/USP activates a cascade of gene expression whose end result is the execution of molting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Hall1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Three alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of <italic>EcR</italic> have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Talbot1">[12]</xref>. Mutations in these different <italic>EcR mRNA</italic> isoforms result in a range of phenotypes that includes lethality at the embryonic, larval and pupal stages, disruption of salivary gland degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Davis1">[13]</xref>, aberrant neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Schubiger1">[14]</xref>, and changes in female fecundity and vitellogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Carney1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>EcR and USP, as well as a number of the proteins involved in the ecdysone-signaling cascade, are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Henrich1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Thummel1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Mangelsdorf1">[18]</xref>. NRs are characterized by significant amino acid sequence similarities in two key functional domains: the DNA binding domain (DBD), which directs the sequence-specific DNA-binding of the receptor, and the ligand binding domain (LBD), which mediates dimerization, ligand binding and transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Laudet1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Bertrand1">[20]</xref>. Some nuclear receptors have been shown to interact with a number of small molecule ligands such as metabolites and hormones, and these interactions are important for regulation of their activity. Other NRs are considered orphan receptors and are either not ligand-regulated or their cognate ligands have yet to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Laudet1">[19]</xref>. Homologs of the insect NRs that function downstream of EcR and USP have also been identified in filarial parasites (21, 22; Egaña, Gissendanner and Maina, unpublished results) as well as in the free-living nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Sluder1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Asahina1">[26]</xref>. Surprisingly, however, homologs of EcR or RXR/USP are apparently absent in the exceptionally large <italic>C. elegans</italic> NR family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Sluder1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>In filarial nematodes the molecular triggers of molting remain largely unknown. As in insects, a possible candidate for a signal that controls molting in <italic>B. malayi</italic>, the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, is the steroid hormone 20E. Both free and conjugated ecdysteroids have been identified in the larvae of several parasitic nematodes including <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> and <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Mendis1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Mercer1">[29]</xref>. In addition, ecdysteroids have been shown to exert biological effects on several nematodes. For example, in <italic>Nematospiroides dubius</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Dennis1">[30]</xref> and <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Fleming1">[31]</xref> molting can be stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> by low concentrations of ecdysteroids. Also, molting of third stage larvae of <italic>D. immitis</italic> can be stimulated with 20E and RH5849, an ecdysone agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Barker1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Warbrick1">[33]</xref>. The arrest at the pachytene stage of meiosis is abrogated when <italic>D. immitis</italic> ovaries are cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> with ecdysone and <italic>B. pahangi</italic> adult females can be stimulated to release microfilaria when cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> with ecdysone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Barker2">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>There appears to be a physiological connection between the filarial parasite and its arthropod host that may involve ecdysteroid signaling. Uptake of microfilaria (L1) by a feeding female mosquito at the time of a bloodmeal coincides with an increase in the production of mosquito ecdysteroids that results in the initiation of mosquito oocyte maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Wang1">[35]</xref>. Concurrent with this increase in ecdysteroid concentration in the mosquito host, larvae initiate a molt transition from L1 to L2 and later from L2 to L3, the infectious stage of the parasite. These observations suggest a potential role for ecdysone in the regulation of molting and other developmental processes in filarial nematodes.</p>
<p>We previously identified an <italic>rxr</italic> homolog in the dog filarial parasitic nematode <italic>D. immitis</italic> and demonstrated its ability to dimerize with an insect EcR and function in Schneider S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Shea1">[36]</xref>. We extend this work here with the identification and characterization of <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>rxr</italic> homologs from <italic>B. malayi</italic>. Bma-EcR and Bma-RXR share some of the biochemical properties of insect EcR and RXR and show differences that appear to be nematode specific.</p>

<p><italic>Brugia malayi</italic> adult males, females or L1 larvae (TRS Labs, Athens, GA) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with a pestle and mortar. Total RNA was purified from the pulverized tissue using RNAwiz (Ambion). RNA was quantified with a spectrophotometer and its quality assessed by gel electrophoresis. One µg of total RNA per isolation was reverse-transcribed using the ProtoScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's protocol.</p>

<title>Cloning of <italic>Bma-EcR</italic>, <italic>Ov-RXR</italic> and <italic>Bma-RXR</italic></title>
<p>The genomic library from <italic>B. malayi</italic> in pBeloBAC vector gridded on Nylon filters (Filarial Genome Network, FGN, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nematodes.org/fgn/index.shtml" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nematodes.org/fgn/index.shtml</ext-link>) was screened using a cDNA fragment from a <italic>D. immitis</italic> EcR homolog (<italic>Di-EcR</italic>) (C. Shea, J. Richer and C. V. Maina, unpublished results) as a probe. Three positive BACs were identified and the individual corresponding bacterial clones were cultured. The inserts were confirmed to contain identical or overlapping sequences by restriction digestion analysis. One 11kb <italic>Xba</italic>I fragment identified by southern blot hybridization with the <italic>Di-EcR</italic> probe was subcloned into Litmus 28i and the insert was sequenced using GPS®-1 Genome Priming System (NEB) as directed by the manufacturer. PCR primers were designed to amplify <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> using sequence from the identified exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Blaxter1">[37]</xref>. The primers used to amplify the full ORF were: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – GGC GCT AGC ATG ACT ACA GCA ACA GTA ACA TAT CAT GAG TT – 3′</named-content> (Nco-MMT-5); <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – GGC CTC GAG CGA TTC TAT GGA TAG CCG GTT GAG GTT – 3′</named-content> (Xho-GYP-3). To determine the expression pattern and identify alternate isoforms of <italic>Bma-EcR</italic>, adult female, male, L1, L2, L3 cDNA libraries (FGN) were screened using the following primers: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – GGG TAA TTC CTA CCA ACA GCT - 3′</named-content>(GNS); <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – CAA GGG TCC AAT GAA TTC ACG AT – 3′</named-content> (GPL) corresponding to a fragment of the LBD from amino acids GNSYQQ to REFIGPL'. Additional sequence to extend the <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> isoforms identified was obtained by PCR, combining the latter two primers with the T3 and T7 promoter primers as their sequence is present in the library vector.</p>
<p>An <italic>O. volvulus</italic> L3 cDNA library (FGN) was screened by PCR using the following primers: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – GAT CTT ATC TAT CTA TGC CGA GAA</named-content> ,– 3′; <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – TAC TTT GAC ATT TGC GGT AAC GAC – 3′</named-content> corresponding to the amino acid sequence DLIYLCRE and RYRKCQSM of the conserved DNA binding domain of DiRXR-1 respectively. Additional <italic>Ov-rxr</italic> sequence was obtained by PCR using the same primers in combination with the T7 and T3 promoter primers. Candidate clones were identified by hybridization with a fragment of DiRXR-1 sequence. An amplified fragment from this library contained sequence corresponding to the <italic>Ov-rxr</italic> A/B and C domains.</p>
<p>Using BLAST, the <italic>Di-rxr-1</italic> sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Shea1">[36]</xref> was used to screen the <italic>B. malayi</italic> genome sequence available from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) parasites database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.jcvi.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project=bma1" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.jcvi.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project=bma1</ext-link>). This analysis resulted in the identification of several exons encoding an 1189 bp fragment of open reading frame (ORF) that corresponded to a putative homolog of <italic>rxr</italic> in <italic>Brugia</italic> (<italic>Bma-RXR</italic>). Based on the genomic sequence we designed PCR primers and used them to amplify the expected <italic>Bma-RXR</italic> mRNA using a nested PCR approach. One µl of a reverse transcription reaction from female total RNA was used as the template for the first round of PCR carried out with primers <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – CGA TCT ATG CCC ATC AGA TTG-3′</named-content> (LCP) and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – CAC AAT GCA AGC TAA GAG ATC G – 3′</named-content>(RSL) at 46°C annealing temperature.

Using the sequence obtained, primers were designed to extend the 5′ of the coding sequence using a semi-nested PCR approach in combination with the 5′ splice leader SL1 primer. As above, two rounds of PCR were employed, in the first round using the SL1 primer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – GGT TTA ATT ACC CAA GTT TGA G - 3′</named-content>) and primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ – GAT GCT CGA TCA CCG CAT ATT GCA CAA ATG - 3′</named-content> (CAI) at 68°C annealing temperature and for the second round the SL1 primer and primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- TGG CAT ACA GTG TCA TAT TTG GTG TTG TGC - 3′</named-content> (STT) at 66°C annealing temperature.

<title>Bma-EcR cloning and genomic structure</title>
<p>A candidate <italic>EcR</italic> homolog was first identified from <italic>D. immitis</italic> using degenerate PCR primers based on insect EcRs (C. Shea, J. Richer and C.V. Maina, unpublished results). Using sequences from the <italic>D. immitis EcR</italic> homolog, genomic libraries from <italic>B. malayi</italic> available from the Filarial Genome Network (FGN) were screened. A strongly hybridizing BAC was identified and sequenced. This BAC contained a gene that encodes a protein with strong similarities to the <italic>EcR</italic> branch of nuclear receptors (see below). We designated this gene as <italic>Bma</italic>-EcR (to distinguish it from <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> EcR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Blaxter1">[37]</xref>). Using sequences corresponding to the predicted <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> exons, PCR primers were designed and used to screen larval and adult cDNA libraries. This library survey revealed <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> expression in L1, L3, and L4 larval stages, as well as in adult males and females (data not shown). In the microfilaria (L1) library, using primers from the putative ligand-binding domain (LBD) encoding region, two alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> (isoforms A and C) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). <italic>Bma-EcRA</italic> is the isoform containing the longest ORF (597 a.a.) with an intact LBD. <italic>Bma-EcRC</italic> contains exon 6 with a 29-nucleotide deletion that results in a reading frame shift that generates a premature stop codon and truncation of the LBD at helix 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This is the result of an alternative splice site within exon 6. In addition to these confirmed isoforms, a splice site consensus sequence was identified within exon 5 at the end of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) that, if used, would result in the omission of ten amino acids from the C-terminal extension of the DBD (indicated by an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This type of spliced mRNA isoform has been identified in <italic>D. immitis</italic> (C. Shea, J. Richer and C. V. Maina, unpublished results). We were unable to clone such an isoform (EcRB) from <italic>B. malayi</italic> by RT-PCR. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>Bma-EcRB</italic> is expressed in specific tissues or developmental stages not represented in the libraries or RNA used.</p>

Alternative splicing of exon 6 results in isoform C which is spliced 29 nucleotides downstream of the site used in isoform A (arrow A/C), changing the reading frame and prematurely terminating the LBD.

The DNA Binding Domain, T/A Box, LBD helices and AF2 region are underlined, and amino acid residue numbers are indicated. Residues that are found in a majority of the EcRs shown are shaded in black. Residues that are biochemically similar are shaded in gray. The position K397 where Bma-EcRC diverges from Bma-EcR A is indicated by an arrow labeled A/C. In Bma-EcR C, K397 is followed by the sequence DITLLRHV and a termination codon. The 10 amino acids that would be omitted in putative isoform B are marked by the two arrowheads and labeled (A/B). Position of PCR primers used for screening and cloning have been indicated by a small arrow labeled by the corresponding 3 amino acid residue name (see experimental procedures for primer names).

<title>Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Bma-EcR</title>
<p>Bma-EcR shows strongest similarity to the NR1H group of nuclear receptors typified by the insect EcRs and mammalian FXR and LXR receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g002">2</xref>). The strongest similarity is in the DBD which contains the canonical C<sub>4</sub> zinc finger structure of nuclear receptors. This domain is 10 amino acids longer in Bma-EcR than in the homologous region of the other EcRs. However, as indicated above, exclusion of these 10 amino acids by alternative splicing of this site (isoform B) would result in a better alignment of Bma-EcR with the other EcRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The LBD shows significant similarity in the regions encoding helices 3–10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Billas1">[48]</xref>. An exception is found in the region of helix 11–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Helix 12 of insect EcRs contains the AF2 motif, responsible for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. Although predictions of secondary structure of the <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> LBD protein sequence indicate helical folding of putative helices 3–10, no helical propensity is predicted in the region of helix 12 (data not shown). Immediately following the helix 12 region a glutamine-rich helical segment is present. Glutamine-rich sequences are often associated with transcription activation domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-KumarM1">[49]</xref>. These differences make Bma-EcR an unusual member of the receptor family that perhaps uses a different mechanism for ligand-dependent activation.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis of Bma-RXR</title>
<p>Similarly to Bma-EcR, global phylogenetic analysis places Bma-RXR together with USPs and RXRs (Supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000625.s001">Figs.

Relationships among arthropod USP/RXRs and Bma-RXR are not well resolved (aALRTs under 50%), but Bma-RXR groups strongly with Di-RXR-1. The grouping of Bma-RXR among USP/RXRs remains the same whether the <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> sequences are included or not in the tree (data not shown). The <italic>Schistosoma</italic> sequences are extremely divergent, to the extent of not being phylogenetically informative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-deMendonca1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Bonneton1">[53]</xref>, and branch at the base of the tree. While it is known that dipteran and lepidopteran USPs evolve especially fast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Bonneton1">[53]</xref>, Di-RXR-1 and Bma-RXR appear to have evolved even faster. Separate phylogenies of the DBD and LBD (not shown) indicate that this is entirely due to a very derived LBD. This observation is consistent with the alignment. The DBD on the other hand has evolved slowly, like the DBDs of its homologs in other species.</p>

<title>Bma-EcR heterodimerization and ligand-dependence <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To further characterize the properties of Bma-EcR we tested whether Bma-EcR, by virtue of its LBD, is capable of forming a dimer with Bma-RXR, its putative native partner, to constitute a functional receptor and transduce the hormonal signal of ecdysteroids in a cellular context. The assay we employed takes advantage of the fact that the LBD of nuclear receptors can function in a modular fashion fused to heterologous DNA binding domains such as the GAL4 DBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Hu1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Palli1">[44]</xref>. In order to test the ability of Bma-EcR LBD to activate transcription of a reporter gene in response to a particular hormone ligand, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with GAL4:Bma-EcR(LBD) in combination with RXR LBDs fused to VP16. In addition to the Bma-RXR(LBD) we tested human HsRXR and Hs-LmRXR(LBD) (a chimeric human-locust LBD). The latter was selected because it shows no constitutive dimerization and high ligand-dependent activity when partnered with other ecdysone receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Palli1">[44]</xref> (and ). The transfected cells were tested for trans-activation in the absence or presence of either the ecdysteroid Ponasterone-A or the synthetic ecdysone agonist RSL1 by assaying luciferase activity.</p>
<p>Significant transactivation was detected when GAL4:Bma-EcR(LBD) was partnered with Bma-RXR(LBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). The addition of RSL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) or Ponasterone A (data not shown) had no further stimulatory effect on the detected activity. These data demonstrate that Bma-EcR and Bma-RXR are <italic>bona fide</italic> nuclear receptor partners and that, like their insect counterparts, they avidly dimerize in the absence of ligand. The ligands apparently cannot appreciably increase the heterodimer's ability to activate transcription above that of the VP16 activation domain in this assay.</p>

<title>Heterodimerization of BmaEcR / BmaRXR and ligand specific responses of BmaEcR in mammalian cells.</title>
<p>(A) Increased luciferase activity indicates constitutive heterodimerization of the Bma-EcR and Bma-RXR LBDs. The LBDs of BmaEcR and Bma-RXR were used in a two-hybrid format to generate the fusions GAL4:Bma-EcR(LBD) and VP16:Bma-RXR(LBD). These were transfected alone or together in NIH-3T3 cells. A reporter containing Luciferase downstream of the GAL4 response element was co-transfected in NIH-3T3 cells. (B) GAL4:Bma-EcR(LBD) and VP16:Bma-RXR(LBD) were transfected together as above and the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of RSL-1 or solvent alone (DMSO). No significant activation in response to the ligand is observed. (C) Transactivation of the luciferase reporter indicates ligand dependent response of the Bma-EcR LBD. GAL4:Bma-EcR(LBD) and VP16:HsLmRXR(LBD) were transfected in NIH-3T3 cells which were treated with DMSO or increasing concentrations of RSL-1, or Ponasterone A (PonA) as indicated. HsLmRXR(LBD) is a chimeric LBD consisting of human and locust RXR LBDs. It shows no constitutive dimerization with Bma-EcR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000625.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) or other EcR LBDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Palli1">[44]</xref>.</p>

<p>Significant ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of luciferase was detected, however, when GAL4:Bma-EcR(LBD) was partnered with the chimeric VP16:Hs-LmRXR and treated either with Ponasterone-A or RSL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). This is likely the result of ligand-dependent dimerization of the two receptor LBD fusions and subsequent trans-activation <italic>via</italic> the VP16 activation domain. This result clearly demonstrates the ability of Bma-EcR LBD to transduce the action of the ecdysteroid Ponasterone-A and the ecdysteroid agonist, RSL1 in the transfected cells.</p>
<p>The dimerization and transactivation studies presented here show that Bma-EcR is able to heterodimerize with Bma-RXR in a cellular context and capable of triggering a transcriptional response in an ecdysteroid-specific manner. These observations taken together along with their expression profile suggest that Bma-EcR and Bma-RXR have the prerequisite functional properties to constitute a functional <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> ecdysone receptor.</p>

<title>Ecdysone-dependent transcription in <italic>B. malayi</italic>: A reporter assay</title>
<p>The existence of homologs for both protein components of Ecdysone Receptor in <italic>B. malayi</italic> which possess functional dimerization and DNA binding properties, and the earlier pharmacological observations by H. Rees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Warbrick1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Barker2">[34]</xref> suggest that ecdysone could function as a transcriptional regulatory ligand in <italic>B. malayi</italic>. To directly test this hypothesis, we employed a recently established transient transformation technique to explore whether ecdysteroids can activate transcription in <italic>B. malayi</italic> using a reporter assay. Recent studies have demonstrated that the 5′ UTR of the gene encoding the 12 kDa small subunit ribosomal protein of <italic>B. malayi</italic> (BmRPS12) was capable of acting as a promoter when used to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected <italic>B. malayi</italic> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-deOliveira1">[45]</xref>. The BmRPS12 promoter contains 5 ¾ copies of an almost exact 44 nt repeat that acts as an enhancer element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-deOliveira1">[45]</xref>. This promoter construct driving the expression of firefly luciferase (construct BmRPS12 (−641 to −1)/luc) was used to develop a reporter for <italic>B. malayi</italic> in which the enhancer repeat element was replaced with canonical ecdysone response elements (EcREs). We constructed the EcRE-BmRPS12-luciferase reporter (as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>) using the PAL-1 element that Bma-ECR is capable of binding <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This construct was tested for transcriptional activity in transfected <italic>B. malayi</italic> embryos, which were exposed to 20-OH ecdysone (20-E), or solvent alone, before being assayed for luciferase reporter activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g009">Fig. 9A</xref> ecdysteroid treatment resulted in a significant increase of reporter gene activity in cultures exposed to 20-E relative to control cultures (transfected in parallel with the same construct but exposed to solvent alone). This response to 20-E requires the presence of the EcRE sequence, since a construct lacking the EcRE did not exhibit any increase in luciferase activity in response to 20-E. Similarly, the response was strictly dependent on hormone, as constructs containing the EcRE produced levels of activity that were not significantly different from those obtained with the construct lacking the EcRE, in the absence of 20-E. Constructs containing the EcRE in both orientations were equally responsive to 20-E treatment, in keeping with previous studies demonstrating the symmetric nature of the binding of nuclear hormone receptors to their cognate response elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Hu1">[43]</xref>. The response to the 20-OH ecdysone was dose-dependent, reaching a plateau at 5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Molting in ecdyzosoans has been studied most extensively in insects. In insects EcR and USP initiate the transduction of the molt-triggering signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Riddiford1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Yao1">[9]</xref>. Molting progression is mediated by the expression and activation of a number of well-characterized genes, including additional nuclear receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Thummel1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-KingJones1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Tan1">[54,]</xref>. In contrast, in nematodes molting initiation and the molecular signaling responsible for its progression are only now starting to be understood. An RNAi screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for genes that are involved in molting has revealed a large number of “molting” genes, which encode proteins ranging from transcription factors and intercellular signaling molecules to proteases and protease inhibitors. However, no signal has been specifically identified as being the putative molting trigger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Frand1">[55]</xref>. Expression profiles of <italic>C. elegans</italic> “ecdysone cascade” nuclear receptors during molting cycles parallel the expression of their homologs in insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Gissendanner1">[56]</xref>, and <italic>nhr-23</italic>, <italic>nhr-25</italic>, <italic>nhr-41</italic>, and <italic>nhr-85</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of <italic>DHR3</italic>, <italic>Ftz-F1</italic>, <italic>DHR78</italic>, and <italic>E75</italic>, respectively, have been shown to be important for proper molting and/or dauer larva formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Asahina1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Gissendanner1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Kostrouchova1">[58]</xref>.

<p>Our previous studies demonstrated the existence of an <italic>rxr</italic> homolog in the canine filarial nematode <italic>D. immitis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Shea1">[36]</xref>. The isolation of <italic>Di-rxr-1</italic> indicated that, in contrast to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, filarial nematodes might contain different sets of NRs. The isolation of homologs of <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>rxr</italic> in <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> presented here demonstrates that filarial nematodes express both components of the ecdysone receptor and these nuclear receptors show dimerization, DNA binding, and hormone-binding characteristics similar to those of the canonical insect ecdysone receptors. Our phylogenetic analyses place the two receptors in the corresponding branches of the superfamily tree. They also indicate a rapid evolution of the LBDs. The LBDs of nematode RXRs are extremely divergent, on a similar scale to that of <italic>Schistosoma</italic> RXR LBD. Subsequent to our identification of <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>rxr</italic> homologs in <italic>Brugia</italic>, the sequencing of the genome was completed, identifying additional putative nuclear receptors in the ecdysone signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Ghedin1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>We cloned two <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> and one <italic>Bma-rxr</italic> mRNA isoforms. Northern blot analyses revealed <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> and <italic>Bma-rxr</italic> expression in adult males, females and L1s. In addition, RT-PCR analyses indicate that <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> is also present in L1, L2 and L3 larval stages. Since females contain developing embryos, it is not possible to differentiate between embryonic and female-specific expression of these two nuclear receptors in <italic>B. malayi</italic>. In insects <italic>EcR</italic> has been shown to be critical for both embryonic development and oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Carney1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Bender1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Pierceall1">[60]</xref> and in filarial nematodes ecdysone treatment releases meiotic arrest and stimulates microfilaria release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Barker2">[34]</xref>. Expression of <italic>EcR</italic> and <italic>rxr</italic> homologs in <italic>B. malayi</italic> females points to possible functions of the ecdysone receptor also in nematode oogenesis and/or embryogenesis.</p>
<p>The expression pattern of <italic>Bma-RXR</italic> differs somewhat from the expression pattern of the other filarial <italic>rxr</italic> identified to date, <italic>Di- rxr-1</italic>, which is expressed in males but not females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Shea1">[36]</xref>. In insects the rxr homologue “<italic>Ultraspiracle</italic>” (USP) is considered the main functional partner of EcR and as such its expression overlaps with that of <italic>EcR</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Kozlova1">[5]</xref>. This also seems to be the case in <italic>B. malayi</italic>, where we observed that at least one isoform of <italic>Bma-rxr</italic> has an overlapping expression pattern with <italic>Bma-EcR</italic>. However, two other <italic>Bma-rxr</italic> isoforms appear to be specifically expressed only in females.</p>
<p>The sequence differences of <italic>B. malayi</italic> and <italic>D. immitis</italic> RXR may mirror differences in expression patterns of the two RXR homologues. Whether these differences in sequence and expression pattern correlate with differences in ligand interaction and/or function remains an open question.</p>
<p>Both Bma-EcRA and a putative isoform B are able to bind a canonical ecdysone response element (EcRE) when partnered with USP. The question of whether isoform B exists in <italic>B. malayi</italic> (as in <italic>D. immitis</italic>) remains unanswered. We have shown that such an isoform is biochemically active, being able to dimerize with an insect USP and bind EcRE <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, isoform B is the most similar to the insect EcRs. Bma-EcRB contains a shorter (i.e. canonical) “T-box” region than Bma-EcRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000625-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The “T-box” region has been described as being able to modulate DNA binding to extended hormone response elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Rastinejad1">[61]</xref>. The presence of possible sequence variation in the “T-box” region in these two <italic>Bma-EcR</italic> variants could point to the possibility of differences in isoform-specific interactions with DNA target sequences.</p>
<p>Bma-EcRC contains a truncated LBD, and it is similar in organization to the estrogen-alpha variant Delta-5, which displays dominant-negative activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Bryant1">[62]</xref>. As we have shown, isoform C is unable to dimerize with a <italic>bona fide</italic> USP to bind the palindromic EcRE. These data suggest that Bma-EcRC may carry out a novel function that is independent of any interactions with an RXR partner. Establishing the role of <italic>Bma-EcRC</italic> is the aim of future investigations.</p>
<p>The sequence in the region of helices 11–12 in the LBD of <italic>B. malayi</italic> and <italic>D. immitis</italic> EcR and RXR homologues is strikingly divergent when compared to each other and to other EcRs and RXRs respectively. The most prominent feature in Bma-EcR is the absence of conserved helix 12 residues. This difference raises the question of what constitutes a functional activation function corresponding to AF2 in these nematode members of the nuclear receptor family. Our transcriptional activation assay results clearly show that the two receptors can dimerize and that the LBD of Bma-EcR is capable of transducing an ecdysteroid signal in a cellular context. Even though our analysis was carried out in a heterologous system, this type of assay has been shown to be highly informative for LBD-ligand interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Palli1">[44]</xref>. In this system, however, strong constitutive dimerization of receptor partners can obscure possible transcriptional effects of the ligand. Our results obtained with the chimeric RXR-LBD (which confers low constitutive dimerization) as a partner, indicate that the Bma-EcR LBD does show an ecdysteroid response. Evidence of hormone binding from these transactivation assays and the absence of a recognizable AF2 motif in Bma-EcR suggest that this receptor utilizes different features to achieve equivalent transcriptional functions than its insect counterparts.</p>
<p>The identification of the putative ecdysone receptor components presented here provides strong support to the long standing hypothesis that ecdysteroids play a role in filarial nematode embryogenesis and molting similar to their role in insects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Riddiford1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Barker1">[32]</xref>. Ecdysteroids have been detected in a number of nematodes (reviewed by Barker and Rees, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Barker1">[32]</xref>). When <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation of <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> microfilaria was attained, it was observed that the addition of 20E to the culture media resulted in L1 larva progressing to the infective L3 stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Townson1">[63]</xref>. This observation is consistent with the fact that after the bloodmeal, mosquitoes raise their ecdysteroid level, which correlates with the subsequent rapid molting of the ingested L1 larvae to the L2 stage. We attempted to directly demonstrate that ecdysone can act as a transcriptional trigger <italic>in vivo</italic> using a transient transformation reporter assay. Indeed, significant activity was observed in response to ecdysone . Our transgenic <italic>Brugia</italic> experiments confirm the <italic>in vivo</italic> functionality of both a consensus EcRE and 20-hydroxyecdysone in measurable transcriptional activity. Although we present no data to establish that the observed activation is mediated by the receptor(s) we have cloned, our results in conjunction with previous studies on this subject confirm that filarial nematodes in particular, contain and express the gene components of a functional ecdysone signaling system that is quite similar to that of other ecdysozoa. The role of this signaling system in filarial development will be the subject of further studies. Furthermore, the existence of a functional ecdysone signaling pathway in filarial nematodes does point to the possibility of using a novel approach for the development of drugs to fight filariasis based on testing of pre-existing compounds that specifically target the ecdysone pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000625-Palli2">[64]</xref>.</p>
