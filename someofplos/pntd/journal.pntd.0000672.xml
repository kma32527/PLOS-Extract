<p>The spread of dengue (DEN) worldwide combined with an increased severity of the DEN-associated clinical outcomes have made this mosquito-borne virus of great global public health importance. Progress in understanding DEN pathogenesis and in developing effective treatments has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Most of the DEN clinical isolates and cell culture-passaged DEN virus strains reported so far require either host adaptation, inoculation with a high dose and/or intravenous administration to elicit a virulent phenotype in mice which results, at best, in a productive infection with no, few, or irrelevant disease manifestations, and with mice dying within few days at the peak of viremia. Here we describe a non-mouse-adapted DEN2 virus strain (D2Y98P) that is highly infectious in AG129 mice (lacking interferon-α/β and -γ receptors) upon intraperitoneal administration. Infection with a high dose of D2Y98P induced cytokine storm, massive organ damage, and severe vascular leakage, leading to haemorrhage and rapid death of the animals at the peak of viremia. In contrast, very interestingly and uniquely, infection with a low dose of D2Y98P led to asymptomatic viral dissemination and replication in relevant organs, followed by non-paralytic death of the animals few days after virus clearance, similar to the disease kinetic in humans. Spleen damage, liver dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, but no haemorrhage, were observed in moribund animals, suggesting intact vascular integrity, a cardinal feature in DEN shock syndrome. Infection with D2Y98P thus offers the opportunity to further decipher some of the aspects of dengue pathogenesis and provides a new platform for drug and vaccine testing.</p>

<p>The spread of dengue (DEN) worldwide combined with an increased severity of the DEN-associated clinical outcomes have made this mosquito-borne virus of great global public health importance. Infection with DEN virus can be asymptomatic or trigger a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild acute febrile illness to classical dengue fever and to severe DEN hemorrhagic fever/DEN shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Progress in understanding DEN disease and in developing effective treatments has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that can reproduce all or part of the disease's clinical manifestations and outcome. Only a few of the DEN virus strains reported so far elicit a virulent phenotype in mice, which results at best in an acute infection where mice die within few days with no, few or irrelevant disease manifestations. Here we describe a DEN virus strain which is highly virulent in mice and reproduces some of the aspects of severe DEN in humans, including the disease kinetics, organ damage/dysfunction and increased vascular permeability. This DEN virus strain thus offers the opportunity to further decipher some of the mechanisms involved in DEN pathogenesis, and provides a new platform for drug and vaccine testing in the mouse model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue (DEN) virus belongs to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, and is the causative agent of DEN disease, a mosquito-borne illness that is endemic in subtropical and tropical countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Gubler1">[1]</xref>. With approximately half of the world's population residing in DEN endemic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Tolle1">[2]</xref> and more than 50 million new infections projected to occur annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Halstead1">[3]</xref>, DEN certainly poses as a global economic and health threat.</p>
<p>Infection with one of the four DEN serotypes can be asymptomatic or trigger a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild acute febrile illness to classical dengue fever (DF), and to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), characterized by fever, hemorrhagic tendency, thrombocytopenia, and capillary leakage according to the WHO guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Guidelines1">[4]</xref>. Despite the increasing attention and research efforts devoted to DEN in recent years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for DEN pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Current hypotheses for the development of severe DEN that involve dysfunction of the host immune system include enhancing mechanisms induced by sub-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies and memory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Halstead1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Martina1">[5]</xref>. Other non-enhancing mechanisms implicating the immune system include auto-immune responses against cross-reactive viral components, such as DEN non-structural 1 (NS1) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Lin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Cheng1">[7]</xref>. Platelet lysis, nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis of endothelial cells and complement activation have also been proposed to mediate thrombocytopenia and vascular leakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Kurosu1">[8]</xref>. In addition, host genetic predisposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Chaturvedi1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-FernndezMestre1">[11]</xref> and virus virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Pandey1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Leitmeyer1">[13]</xref> were reported as risk factors for the development of severe DEN.</p>
<p>No effective drugs or vaccines against DEN are currently available on the market <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Tan1">[14]</xref>. Undeniably, progress in deciphering the mechanisms responsible for DEN pathogenesis and in developing effective prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments has been impeded by the lack of suitable animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Yauch1">[15]</xref>. Humans and mosquitoes represent so far the only natural hosts for DEN virus. Non-human primates have been reported to be permissive to DEN infection but no apparent clinical symptoms of the disease were observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Halstead2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Scherer1">[17]</xref>, although a recent study reported signs of hemorrhage in rhesus macaques intravenously infected with a high dose of a DEN2 virus strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Onlamoon1">[18]</xref>. In addition, since the infected animals develop transient viremia and antibody responses, they have been useful for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine and antiviral candidates prior to clinical trials in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Sun1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Blaney1">[20]</xref>. However, for ethical and economical reasons, non-human primates do not represent a sustainable option for DEN research. Alternatively, the mouse model has been explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Yauch1">[15]</xref>. However, most of the DEN virus laboratory strains and clinical isolates do not replicate efficiently in mice. Mouse-adapted DEN virus strains displayed a higher infectivity but led to irrelevant clinical manifestations such as paralysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Sabin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Cole1">[22]</xref>. Alternatively, a variety of mouse genetic backgrounds have been explored that displayed greater susceptibility to DEN infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Wu1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>. Among them, AG129 mice, deficient in interferon (IFN)- α/β and -γ receptors, were shown to allow effective replication of DEN virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Williams1">[33]</xref>. However, great heterogeneity in the susceptibility of these mice to DEN virus strains, even within the same serotype, was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schul1">[32]</xref> with none or few of DEN disease manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>. Moreover, administration of high viral doses was necessary to trigger a virulent phenotype which resulted in the animals' death within few days at the peak of viremia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>. This is in contrast to humans for whom signs of severe DEN generally occur during or after defervescence when DEN virus is no longer detectable in the patient's blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Halstead1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Nimmannitya1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Nisalak1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we describe a unique non mouse-adapted strain of DEN virus serotype 2 (D2Y98P) which is highly infectious in AG129 mice upon intraperitoneal administration. Infection with a high viral dose of D2Y98P resulted in an acute model of infection with mice dying at the peak of viremia, whereas infection with a low viral dose led to asymptomatic dissemination and replication of the virus followed by death of the animals after the virus has been cleared from its host.</p>

<title>Virus strain and growth conditions</title>
<p>The virus strain used in this study (D2Y98P) derives from a 1998 DEN2 Singapore human isolate that has been exclusively passaged for about 20 rounds in <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells. C6/36 cells (ATCC# CRL-1660) were maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), and virus propagation was carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schul1">[32]</xref>. Virus stocks were stored −80°C. When necessary, heat-inactivation of the virus was performed at 55°C for 15 min.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Virus quantitation</title>
<p>Plaque assay was carried out to quantify the number of infectious viral particles using BHK-21 (Baby Hamster Kidney, ATCC# CCL-10) cells as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Sim1">[36]</xref> with slight modifications. Briefly, BHK cells were cultured to approx. 80% confluency in 24-well plates (NUNC, NY, USA). The virus stock was 10-fold serially diluted from 10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup> in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO). BHK-21 monolayers were infected with 100 ul of each virus dilution. After incubation at 37°C and 5% C0<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 1 hr with rocking at 15 min intervals, the medium was decanted and 1 ml of 1% (w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose in RPMI supplemented with 2% FCS was added to each well. After 4 days incubation at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for 30 min with 200 µl of 1% crystal violet dissolved in 37% formaldehyde. After thorough rinsing with water, the plates were dried and the plaques were scored visually.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Mice infection</title>
<p>AG129 [129/Sv mice deficient in both alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) and gamma (IFN-γ) interferon receptors] were obtained from B&amp;K Universal (UK). They were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in individual ventilated cages. Eight to 9 week-old mice were administered with 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) of D2Y98P via the intraperitoneal (ip.) route (0.4 ml in sterile PBS). Where indicated, mice were inoculated with the same dose and volume of heat-inactivated D2Y98P.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Antibody titres</title>
<p>Systemic antibody titres against D2Y98P were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schul1">[32]</xref>. Briefly, 96-well plates (Corning costar, NY, USA) were coated overnight at 4°C with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of heat-inactivated D2Y98P virus in 0.1M NaHCO3 buffer at pH 9.6. Two-fold serially diluted serum samples (1∶25 to 1∶25,600) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (Chemicon) or IgG (H+L) (Bio-rad) secondary antibody were used at a 1∶3,000 dilution. Detection was performed using Sigma<italic>Fast</italic>™ O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped with 75 µl of 1M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and absorbance was read at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-rad model 680). ELISA titres were defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that equals to 3 times the absorbance reading from uninfected mouse serum sample.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)</title>
<p>PRNT was carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Sim1">[36]</xref> with modifications. Briefly, mouse serum samples were heated at 56°C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Two-fold serial dilutions of the sera (1∶10 to 1∶10,240 in RPMI 1640) were mixed in 96-well plates with an equal volume containing 30 PFU of D2Y98P, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr with rocking every 15 min. Each mix (100 µl) was transferred onto BHK monolayers grown in 24-well plates, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The mix was decanted, and plaque assay was carried out as described above. The percentage of plaque reduction was derived relative to the control consisting of virus mixed with uninfected serum: [1- (number of plaques in test wells/number of plaques in control wells) *100]. Fifty percent neutralization titres (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) were determined for each sample by fitting a variable sigmoidal curve in GraphPad Prism 5.00 (GraphPad Software). Data are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution for which PRNT<sub>50</sub> is obtained.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Determination of virus titres in infected mice</title>
<p>Blood samples were collected in 0.4% sodium citrate and centrifuged for 5 min at 6,000 <italic>g</italic> to obtain plasma. The presence of infectious viral particles was determined by plaque assay as described above.</p>
<p>To assess the levels of infectious virus in the tissues from infected mice, the animals were euthanized and perfused systemically with 50 ml sterile PBS. Whole tissue from the brain, intestines, liver and spleen were harvested from individual mice, kept on ice and their wet weights were recorded prior to any further processing. Samples were then trimmed and homogenized using a mechanical homogenizer (Omni) for 5 minutes in 1 ml RPMI 1640 at medium speed on ice. Thoroughly homogenized tissues were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to pellet debris. The supernatant was filter-sterilized using a 0.22 µm diameter pore size filter and the volume was recorded. The level of infectious virus within the filtrate is thus considered representative of the total level of infectious virus present in the harvested organ. Ten-fold serial dilutions of each filtrate (from neat to 1∶10<sup>5</sup>) were assayed in a standard virus plaque assay on BHK-21 cells as described above. Triplicate wells were run for each dilution of each sample. Data are finally expressed as log<sub>10</sub> [mean ± SD] in PFU per gram of wet tissue with a limit of sensitivity set at 1.0 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g of tissue. Five mice per time point per group were assessed. Results are representative of two experiments.</p>

<p>Mice were euthanized, and tissues were harvested and immediately fixed in 10% formalin in PBS. Fixed tissues were paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2i">
<title>Vascular leakage assessment</title>
<p>Vascular leakage was assessed using Evans Blue dye as a marker for albumin extravasation as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schumacher1">[37]</xref> with modifications. Briefly, 0.2 ml of Evans blue dye (0.5% w/v in PBS) (Sigma Aldrich) were injected intravenously into the mice. After 2 hrs, the animals were euthanized and extensively perfused with sterile PBS. Vascular permeability in the tissues was determined visually and quantitatively; the tissues were harvested and weighed prior to dye extraction using N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma; 4 ml/g of tissue wet weight) at 37°C for 24 hrs after which absorbance was read at 620 nm. Data are expressed as fold increase in OD<sub>620nm</sub> per g of tissue wet weight compared to the uninfected control.</p>

<title>Cytokine detection</title>
<p>Cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6) expression levels were measured in individual serum samples using individual detection kits (R&amp;D), according to the manufacturer' instructions.

<title>Survival rate of D2Y98P-infected AG129 mice</title>
<p>To test the infectious potential of the D2Y98P strain, AG129 mice were intraperitoneally (ip.) infected with 10-fold serially diluted viral doses ranging from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> PFU. Survival rates indicated that infection with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU and above induced 100% mortality whereas 20% and 90% survival rates were observed in animals infected with 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>2</sup> PFU, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000672-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, in mice infected with lethal doses, a clear correlation between viral dose and time-of-death was observed, with increased heterogeneity as the infectious dose is lower.</p>

<p>AG129 mice were infected intraperitoneally (ip.) with 10-fold serially diluted viral doses of D2Y98P ranging from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> PFU. Ten mice per group were used. Data are representative of at least 3 independent experiments.</p>

<p>Upon infection with 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> PFU, initial clinical signs included ruffled fur and hunched posture, which further progressed to bloatedness, lethargy, diarrhoea-like symptoms, moribund state and finally death of the animals. None of the mice exhibited paralysis or significant body weight loss during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000672-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, upon infection with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU and below, no signs of diarrhoea were observed and near moribund state, rapid body weight loss was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000672-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Mice were ip. infected with 10<sup>7</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup> (A), or with 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> (B) PFU of D2Y98P. Body weight changes were monitored daily (A) or every other day (B) post-infection (p.i.). Results are expressed as the [mean ± SD] of body weight loss in percentage compared to initial body weight. Ten mice per group were monitored. Results are representative of 2 independent experiments.</p>

<p>Mice ip. inoculated with heat-inactivated D2Y98P (10<sup>7</sup> PFU equivalent) displayed none of the disease manifestations or death. In addition, neither disease manifestation nor transient viremia was observed in immunocompetent Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice ip. infected with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU of D2Y98P (data not shown).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Viremia and antibody titres</title>
<p>Although both viral doses eventually induced 100% mortality in AG129 mice, ip. infection with 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of D2Y98P gave very different disease kinetics, suggesting that different mechanisms and players are involved in the disease progression. We thus decided to further characterize both the “acute” and “delayed” models of DEN infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A growing number of immunocompetent, immunosuppressed and humanized mouse models of DEN infection have been explored, using an increasing number of mouse-adapted or cell-culture passaged DEN virus strains. However, none of these have so far managed to recapitulate all the clinical symptoms and manifestations of DEN disease as observed in humans. As humans and mosquitoes represent the only two natural hosts for DEN virus, it is unrealistic to hope address all the features of DEN pathogenesis in a single mouse model. However, previous studies have shown that it is possible to reproduce, and thus study, one or few aspects of DEN pathogenesis in a specific mouse model of DEN infection defined by a particular mouse background infected with a specific DEN virus strain through a particular route of administration and at a particular infectious dose. For example, a mouse model of DEN hemorrhage has recently been reported through intradermal infection of immunocompetent mice with a high dose of the non-mouse adapted DEN2 virus strain 16681 originally isolated from a DHF patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Chen1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-WuHsieh1">[44]</xref>. Likewise, a humanized mouse strain infected subcutaneously with various DEN virus strains reportedly displayed clinical signs of DEN fever, including fever, viremia, erythema, and thrombocytopenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Mota1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, the AG129 mouse model has allowed the investigation of some aspects of DEN pathogenesis including virus tropism, vascular leakage, and pathogenesis in context of a functional adaptive immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Williams1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, the AG129 mouse background has proven useful for vaccine and drug testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Johnson1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schul1">[32]</xref>. However, the lack of IFN α/β− and γ−signalling draws some limitations and calls for cautious interpretation of the findings and observations made in this mouse model. Furthermore, the susceptibility of AG129 mice to DEN infection appears to greatly depend on the DEN virus strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schul1">[32]</xref> and a limited number only have so far been reported to result in a productive infection with no, few or irrelevant clinical manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Schul1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, administration of high viral doses was necessary to trigger a virulent phenotype which resulted in animal death within few days at the peak of viremia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we describe a non mouse-adapted DEN virus strain, D2Y98P, which is highly infectious in AG129 mice. D2Y98P is a serotype 2 DEN virus strain originally isolated in 1998 from a Singapore DEN-infected patient whose disease status at the time of sample collection, and disease outcome are unfortunately not known. The virus has been exclusively amplified in mosquito cells for less than 20 rounds. Interestingly, an earlier passage (P13) displayed a more attenuated virulent phenotype upon infection of AG129 mice (G. Tan, personal communication). This observation therefore suggests that mutation(s) have occurred in the viral genome upon amplification in mosquito cells that rendered the virus more virulent. Identification of the nucleotide changes between the two virus passages is currently in progress in our laboratory.</p>
<p>Infection of AG129 mice with a high dose (10<sup>7</sup> PFU) of D2Y98P induced an acute lethal DEN infection where the peak of viremia and virus titres in the infected organs coincided with death of the animals, accompanied by cytokine storm, massive organ damage, and severe vascular damage leading to haemorrhage. It is thus likely that in this acute model of DEN infection, the pathological events are a consequence of both virus-induced cell death and massive inflammation reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Basu1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Chaturvedi2">[40]</xref>. Such virulent phenotype is similar to that described previously by Shresta and colleagues using the D2S10 DEN virus strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Shresta2">[30]</xref>. In contrast, infection of AG129 mice with a lower dose (10<sup>4</sup> PFU) of D2Y98P led to a transient asymptomatic systemic viral infection followed by death of the animals few days after viral clearance, similar to the disease kinetic described in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Halstead1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Whitehead1">[38]</xref>. A strong neutralizing IgG antibody response was measured in the infected animals and is likely to be involved in the viral clearance. Although increased vascular permeability (as indicated by increased serum albumin concentration and Evan's blue dye extrusion) was observed in the moribund animals, the actual cause of the animals' death remains elusive. Apparent destruction of the splenic architecture and liver dysfunction at moribund stage are likely to contribute to the sickness. Furthermore, as the disease progressed, infected animals appeared lethargic and displayed reduced motility. This may result in reduced water intake and dehydration of the animal, hence contributing to the sharp body weight loss observed towards moribund stage and consequently leading to animal death.</p>
<p>Widespread immune activation in response to acute DEN infection has been well documented in DEN patients, and circulating levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be elevated in patients with severe DEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Chaturvedi2">[40]</xref>. Likewise, the levels of three key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in DF/DHF, namely IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, were significantly elevated in the D2Y98P-infected AG129 mice and were directly dependent on the initial infectious dose. Consistently, extensive damage of various organs including the spleen, liver and intestines was observed in animals infected with a high viral dose (10<sup>7</sup> PFU). In contrast, lower levels of cytokine production in animals infected with a low viral dose (10<sup>4</sup> PFU) correlated with milder organ damage except for the spleen that appeared at moribund stage, to be as extensively damaged as in animals infected with a high viral dose; the absence of infectious viral particles in the moribund animals excludes a direct virus cytopathic effect but rather suggests some immunological disorder that may arise from the overstimulation of immune cells possibly by persistent viral antigens.</p>
<p>In contrast to the liver and spleen, no histological damage or abnormalities were detected in the brain of animals infected with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU, although infectious viral particles were readily detected in this tissue after systemic perfusion. This observation suggests that the virus is capable of extravasating from the systemic circulation and cross the blood-brain barrier but may not effectively replicate in the brain. Therefore, in this mouse model, and as reported in dengue patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Patey1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Lum1">[47]</xref>, meningitis and/or encephalitis may not contribute significantly to disease severity.</p>
<p>The action of a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and other soluble mediators on endothelial cells has been proposed to affect vascular permeability during DEN infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Basu1">[39]</xref>. Vascular leakage is a hallmark of DHF/DSS leading to hemoconcentration and hemorrhagic manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Binh1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Trung1">[48]</xref>, as observed in mice infected with 10<sup>7</sup> PFU of D2Y98P for whom focal areas of haemorrhage were observed in the liver, and low hematocrit and serum albumin levels were measured. In this animal group, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are likely responsible for the observed severe vascular leakage, particularly in the intestines where no infectious viral particles were detected.</p>
<p>However, in mice infected with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU, neither significant vascular leakage nor hemorrhage was detected at the peak of viremia despite elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α. Instead, increased vascular permeability was clearly observed at moribund stage where the production of these three cytokines has returned to basal level. This observation suggests that other pro-inflammatory cytokines may be involved in the increased vascular permeability observed in this low viral dose infection model. Indeed, in addition to IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α, a number of cytokines, chemokines and other soluble mediators have been demonstrated or proposed to play a role in vascular leakage in DEN disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Basu1">[39]</xref>. Alternatively or additionally, other mediators previously proposed to increase vascular permeability such as immune complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Beynon1">[49]</xref>, nitrite oxide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Basu1">[39]</xref>, or cross-reactive anti-NS1 antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Lin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Cheng1">[7]</xref>, may be at play. Furthermore, hemoconcentration and increased serum albumin level suggests that fluid only but not proteins or cells, leaks from the blood vessels. Increased vascular permeability without morphological damage of the capillary endothelium is believed to be the cardinal feature of DSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Basu1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Beynon1">[49]</xref> and thus appears to be reproduced in this mouse model of DEN infection. Further investigation is however needed to decipher the actual mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Remarkably, thrombocytopenia, a hallmark of severe disease in DEN patients, was not detected in the animals infected with D2Y98P virus, regardless of the initial infectious dose. Transient drop in platelet counts has been previously observed in a number of mouse models of DEN infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Yauch1">[15]</xref> including AG129 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Williams1">[33]</xref>, ruling out the possibility that the lack of IFNγ signalling in these mice would impair the mechanism(s) involved in thrombocytopenia. The absence of thrombocytopenia in our model may thus be inherent to the D2Y98P virus strain. A number of immunological mechanisms and effectors have been proposed to play a role in thrombocytopenia during DEN infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Chen2">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000672-Noisakran1">[53]</xref>, but the differential ability of DEN virus strains to induce thrombocytopenia in a single model of DEN infection has never been investigated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the attractiveness of the D2Y98P strain lies in its ability to induce, without the need for mouse-adaptation and upon peripheral administration of a low viral dose, a virulent phenotype in AG129 mice with a productive viral replication and dissemination accompanied by some relevant clinical manifestations, including disease kinetic, organ damage/dysfunction and increased vascular permeability. This model thus offers the opportunity to further dissect some of the mechanisms involved in DEN pathogenesis with the caveat that AG129 mice are defective in IFN signalling. Furthermore, the induction of a disease kinetic where the time-of-death window is distinct from the viremic phase makes this low viral dose model unique and an attractive platform for assessing the efficacy of DEN vaccine and drug candidates.</p>
