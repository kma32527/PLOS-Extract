<title>Background</title>
<p>The etiologic agent of Chagas Disease is <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. Acute infection results in patent parasitemia and polyclonal lymphocyte activation. Polyclonal B cell activation associated with hypergammaglobulinemia and delayed specific humoral immunity has been reported during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in experimental mouse models. Based on preliminary data from our laboratory we hypothesized that variances in susceptibility to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections in murine strains is related to differences in the ability to mount parasite-specific humoral responses rather than polyclonal B cell activation during acute infection.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Relatively susceptible Balb/c and resistant C57Bl/6 mice were inoculated with doses of parasite that led to similar timing and magnitude of initial parasitemia. Longitudinal analysis of parasite-specific and total circulating antibody levels during acute infection demonstrated that C57Bl/6 mice developed parasite-specific antibody responses by 2 weeks post-infection with little evidence of polyclonal B cell activation. The humoral response in C57Bl/6 mice was associated with differential activation of B cells and expansion of splenic CD21<sup>high</sup>CD23<sup>low</sup> Marginal Zone (MZ) like B cells that coincided with parasite-specific antibody secreting cell (ASC) development in the spleen. In contrast, susceptible Balb/c mice demonstrated early activation of B cells and early expansion of MZ B cells that preceded high levels of ASC without apparent parasite-specific ASC formation. Cytokine analysis demonstrated that the specific humoral response in the resistant C57Bl/6 mice was associated with early T-cell helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine response, whereas polyclonal B cell activation in the susceptible Balb/c mice was associated with sustained Th2 responses and delayed Th1 cytokine production. The effect of Th cell bias was further demonstrated by differential total and parasite-specific antibody isotype responses in susceptible versus resistant mice. T cell activation and expansion were associated with parasite-specific humoral responses in the resistant C57Bl/6 mice.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that resistant C57Bl/6 mice had improved parasite-specific humoral responses that were associated with decreased polyclonal B cell activation. In general, Th2 cytokine responses are associated with improved antibody response. But in the context of parasite infection, this study shows that Th2 cytokine responses were associated with amplified polyclonal B cell activation and diminished specific humoral immunity. These results demonstrate that polyclonal B cell activation during acute experimental Chagas disease is not a generalized response and suggest that the nature of humoral immunity during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection contributes to host susceptibility.</p>
</sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, affects 10–12 million people in Latin America. Patent parasitemia develops during acute disease. During this phase, polyclonal B cell activation has been reported to generate high levels of serum antibody with low parasite specificity, and delayed protective humoral immunity, which is necessary to prevent the host from succumbing to infection. In this manuscript, data show that relatively resistant mice have improved parasite-specific humoral immunity and decreased polyclonal B cell activation compared to susceptible mice. Parasite-specific humoral immunity was associated with differential expansion of B cell subsets and T cells in the spleen, as well as with increased Th1 and decreased Th2 cytokine production. These data suggest that host susceptibility/genetic biases impact the development of humoral responses to infection. Th2 cytokines are generally associated with improved antibody responses. In the context of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of susceptible mice, Th2 cytokines were associated with increased total antibody production concomitant with delayed pathogen-specific humoral immunity. This study highlights the need to consider the effect of host biases when investigating humoral immunity to any pathogen that has reported polyclonal B cell activation during infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The protozoan parasite, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease. Chagas disease is a chronic and debilitating syndrome that affects millions of people in Latin America. Infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> leads to patent parasitemia and systemic spread of the parasite throughout the host during acute phase disease. Immune control resolves patent parasitemia, but tissue infection persists for the life of the host and leads to chronic phase disease in as many as 30 percent of infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Tarleton1">[1]</xref>. Due to the difficulties of human studies, the majority of research regarding immune control of parasite infection has been done in experimental murine models, which develop detectable parasitemia during acute infection followed by chronic tissue parasitism that mimics human disease.</p>
<p>Control of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection depends on clearance of blood stream parasite through both innate and acquired immune mechanisms. Macrophages, NK cells, T and B lymphocytes, and the production of cytokines, which play key roles in regulating both parasite replication and immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, are required to control parasitemia. The depletion or absence of any given innate or adaptive effector mechanism leads to increased parasitemia and susceptibility to disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Kierszenbaum1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Budzko1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Silva1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Tarleton2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Kumar1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Rottenberg1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Sardinha1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Humoral immunity is important for control of parasite infection as B cell depletion leads to increased parasitemia and mice succumb to otherwise non-lethal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Kumar1">[7]</xref>. Adoptive transfer of antibodies from late stage <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infected mice to naïve mice leads to rapid clearance of parasite from circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Brodskyn1">[10]</xref>. Transfers of splenocytes from mice that have recovered from acute phase infection to naïve mice confers protection against lethal <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, which is abolished by removal of B lymphocytes, but relatively insensitive to T cell or macrophage depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Scott1">[11]</xref>. Yet, evidence indicates that the majority of B cells are not parasite-specific during early <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Polyclonal B cell activation that leads to hypergammaglobulinemia and delayed specific humoral immune response is generally accepted as a characteristic of acute phase Chagas disease in humans and is reported in rodent experimental models of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-ReinaSanMartin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Cunningham1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Teixeira1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Brener1">[17]</xref>. The acute phase polyclonal response to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection is associated with delayed specific responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-ReinaSanMartin1">[14]</xref>.

B cell expansion in the spleen and lymph nodes during acute <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection is associated with polyclonal, rather than specific responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio5">[29]</xref>. Fas/FasL mediated apoptosis of parasite specific B cells and immature B cells in the bone marrow (BM) has also been reported in Balb/c mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zuniga1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zuniga2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zuniga3">[32]</xref>.

<p>Marginal zone (MZ) and follicular (FO) B cells constitute two functionally and anatomically distinct B cell subsets within the spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Radwanska1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Malkiel1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Oliver1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Allman1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Suarez1">[40]</xref>. MZ B cells are located at the marginal sinus of the spleen, making these cells first line responders to pathogens in the blood. MZ B cells are more responsive to TI-antigens, respond quickly with natural antibody responses, and generate short-term plasma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Won1">[41]</xref>. MZ are also able to migrate to the follicles and participate in germinal center T cell dependent (TD) reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Song1">[42]</xref>. FO B cells circulate through the lymph and are found in B cell follicles of the spleen. FO B cells respond to TD antigen and can become long-term plasma cells or memory B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Fairfax1">[43]</xref>. Due to their differential location and function, these two B cell subsets can have distinct roles in the development of specific versus polyclonal B cell responses to pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Radwanska1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Malkiel1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Gatto1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Suarez2">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>While mouse models have been informative for analysis of immune responses to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, inbred mouse strains experience variable disease progression and severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Trischmann1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Haolla1">[47]</xref>. Disease progression in these models also differ depending upon the strains of parasite used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Andrade1">[48]</xref>. In general, Balb/c mice are more susceptible to infection compared to C57Bl/6 mice in terms of increased parasitemia and mortality given a similar parasite challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hoft1">[49]</xref>. Kinetic analysis of cytokine production by lymphocytes provides evidence that resistance in C57Bl/6 mice is associated with increased early production of IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hoft1">[49]</xref>. Further studies show that immunization protocols capable of inducing polarized Th1 but not Th2 responses are able to protect Balb/c mice against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> challenge, but transfer of CD4 T cell alone was not enough to confer protection to naïve mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hoft2">[50]</xref>. While these studies indicate that Th1 versus Th2 responses are correlated with protection versus resistance, the complete profile of effector mechanisms leading to increased resistance in Th1 skewed mice has yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In the present study, we analyzed the humoral response to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> experimental infection of susceptible Balb/c versus resistant C57Bl/6 mice. We infected Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice with isolates from Y-strain parasite that generated similar timing and magnitude of initial patent parasitemia. The kinetics, magnitude, and isotype of the parasite-specific and total circulating antibody responses during acute <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection were examined. We further evaluated humoral responses in the spleen and the association of parasite-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) with activation of B cells and expansion of B cell subsets, as well as the expansion and activation of splenic T cells. The combined results of this study demonstrate that resistant C57Bl/6 mice generated parasite-specific humoral responses that were associated with decreased hypergammaglobulinemia, differential kinetics of splenic B cell activation and B cell subset expansion, improved T cell help, and early IFN-γ production compared to more susceptible Balb/c mice.</p>

<title>Parasites and Mice</title>
<p>Balb/c and C57/Bl/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and maintained in specific pathogen free housing. Mice husbandry and procedure protocols were reviewed and performed in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh IACUC. Y-strain parasites were grown in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells and harvested by standard technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Sepulveda1">[51]</xref>. Briefly, 3T3 fibroblasts were infected with <italic>trypomastigote</italic> parasites and cultured for 2 days at 37°C (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 µg/mL gentamicin, to allow infection of the growing cells. On day 3, the media was exchanged and the culture was moved to a 34°C incubator and maintained under anerobic conditions until harvest of the tissue derived trypomastigotes (TCT) from the culture supernatant. To establish models of infection for analysis of kinetics and magnitude of parasite-specific humoral immunity versus polyclonal B cell activation in resistant C57Bl/6 and susceptible Balb/c mice, we evaluated experimental infection using two variants of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Y-strain (Y-US and Y-Br). The LD<sub>50</sub> was established for each model, using intraperitoneal injection of TCT in PBS plus 1% glucose. Survival curves for these infections indicated that the Balb/c mice were much more susceptible to the Y-Br variant, with an approximately 1000 fold higher LD<sub>50</sub>, but succumbed to infection with different kinetics than did C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000733.s001">Figure S1</xref><italic>A</italic>). At similar LD<sub>50</sub>, parasitemia was delayed in Y-Br-infected Balb/c compared to Y-Br-infected C57Bl/6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0000733.s001">Figure S1</xref><italic>B</italic>). In contrast, using the Y-US variant, Balb/c mice experienced initial peak parasitemia comparable with C57Bl/6 mice given a similar LD<sub>50</sub> dose of the Y-Br variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g001">Fig 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In both mouse strains, a dose of parasite equal to approximately 0.25×LD<sub>50</sub> was used to allow direct comparison of humoral responses in a sub-lethal infection of relatively resistant versus susceptible mice. The approximate 0.25×LD<sub>50</sub> dose corresponded to 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> Y-US in Balb/c mice and 6.25×10<sup>3</sup> Y-Br in C57Bl/6 mice. Control mice were inoculated with the same dose of parasite after it had been heat-inactivated at 56°C for 25 minutes. Parasitemia was monitored by applying blood diluted 1/4 in RBC lysis buffer (150mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 10mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 115uM EDTA) to a hemocytometer and counting at 400×. Blood was collected at multiple time-points post infection for analysis by ELISA.</p>

Multiscreen HTS 96-well ELISPOT plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 2.5 µg/mL of rCRP or 5 µg/mL of goat anti-mouse Ig (SouthernBiotech) and incubated overnight. ELISPOT plates were washed with T-PBS and blocked with cRPMI for 2 hrs. Blocking media was removed and cells were plated into the ELISPOT plates (5 wells per sample) at several dilutions. After 5–6 hrs, the cells were washed off with PBS (3×) followed by T-PBS (3×). Secreted antibodies were detected by incubating with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to biotin (16 hrs, 4°C), washing with T-PBS (3–4×), incubation with avidin-peroxidase complex (30 min, RT)(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), washing with T-PBS (3×) and PBS (3×), followed by incubation with AEC ELISPOT substrate (8 min, RT)(BD Biosciences). The reaction was stopped by washing with PBS. Spots were analyzed using ImmunoSpot image acquisition 4.5 and ImmunoSpot 5.0 Professional DC software (ImmunoSpot). The frequency of ASC per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes was determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Slifka1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Slifka2">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Crotty1">[58]</xref>.</p>

<p>Splenocytes were isolated, counted, and plated at 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 96 well plates. Cells were collected by centrifugation (500×g, 5 min, 4°C) and washed with FACS staining buffer (1×PBS with 2.5% FCS, 1% goat serum, and 1% human AB serum). 10<sup>7</sup> cells per mL were incubated with fluorescently labeled abs, diluted in FACS buffer, for 20 min on ice or 5 min at 4°C. Abs used for staining included anti-CD19 (MB19-1), CD3 (17A2), CD69 (H1.2F3), CD86 (GL1), CD21 (eBio4E3), CD23 (B3B4), CD4 (RM4-5, L3T4), CD8a (53-6.7), PanNK (DX5), CD95 (15A7), CD95L (MFL3). For determining population gating on cells with multiple stains, florescence minus one controls were used. For analysis of surface activation, B and T cells were counter stained and doublets were excluded to ensure only the reported lymphocyte population was analyzed. Antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences or eBioscience. Data were collected on an LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). The data were analyzed using bi-exponential transformation for complete data visualization.</p>

<title>Balb/c and C57Bl/6 Models of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Infection</title>
<p>Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice were infected with a sub-lethal parasite dose (0.25 LD<sub>50</sub>) of TCT. The magnitude and timing of the initial peak parasitemia was similar in both models, although Balb/c mice experienced a second wave of parasitemia at day 15 post-infection that was not evident in the C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g001">Fig 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Furthermore, Balb/c mice displayed significant weight loss by day 15 post-infection (p = 0.005, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) that did not rebound until after acute infection (&gt;30 days post-infection), whereas C57Bl/6 mice maintained their weight over the course of infection (p = 0.009, 2-way ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g001">Fig 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).

<p>Parasite-specific antibody responses were evaluated by measurement of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> CRP-specific IgM and IgG following infection of Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice. C57Bl/6 mice developed CRP-specific antibodies by day 20 post-infection (3.3±0.5 fold increase from baseline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g002">Fig 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), whereas Balb/c mice had minimal CRP-specific responses until late in acute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g002">Fig 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Delayed parasite-specific IgG response was also evident when Balb/c mice were inoculated with the low doses of the Y-BR variant (data not shown). In contrast, to the relative delay in CRP specific antibody responses in Balb/c versus C57Bl/6 mice during experimental infection, genetic immunization with CRP resulted in an improved CRP-specific IgG response in Balb/c mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g002">Fig 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the delayed CRP-specific antibody response in Balb/c mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice was not due to an inherent inability of Balb/c mice to respond to CRP antigen, but rather a host-pathogen interaction leading to diminished generation of parasite-specific antibody responses.</p>

In C57Bl/6 mice, an early significant IFN-γ response was evident along with increased IL-6 and IL-10, which then decreased to near control levels by day 15 post-infection. In comparison to C57Bl/6 mice, Balb/c had delayed IFN-γ and IL-6 response, an early IL-10 that persisted to day 15 and increased by day 28 post-infection, and IL-5 levels that were significantly elevated by day 15 and remained so at day 28 post-infection. TNF-α levels increased earlier in C57Bl/6 mice than in Balb/c mice. In addition, Balb/c mice had IL-4 by day 28 post-infection, whereas Balb/c controls and C57Bl/6 mice (infected and control) did not produce detectable IL-4 in their serum (data not shown). These data indicate that C57Bl/6 responded to infection with an early Th1 biased cytokine response, whereas Balb/c mice responded to infection with a more Th2 skewed response.</p>

<p>In Balb/c mice, the percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>int</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup> (phenotypically defined as FO B cells) within the B cell gate decreased to 36±17 percent of controls (p&lt;0.0001) and in C57Bl/6 decreased to 74±41 percent of controls (p = 0.02), which was a significant retention of FO B cells in C57Bl/6 mice compared to Balb/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">Fig 7<italic>C</italic></xref>), although absolute numbers of FO B cells were not significantly different from controls in either model. Analysis of FO B cells within the total B cell blast population indicates that FO B cell blasts represent a higher proportion of the total B cell blasts at day 8 and 15 post-infection in resistant C57Bl/6 mice than in susceptible Balb/c mice (p&lt;0.01 for both time-points) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">Fig 7<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>high</sup>CD23<sup>low/−</sup> splenic B cells (defined as MZ by phenotype) responses also differed in Balb/c mice and C57Bl/6 mice. The percentage of B cells with the MZ phenotype was significantly different in Balb/c versus C57Bl/6 mice (p&lt;0.0001, 2-way ANOVA). While in Balb/c mice, MZ B cells accounted for an increased percentage of the total B cells at d8, in C57Bl/6 mice, the percentage of MZ B cells were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">Fig 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). The percentage of B cells accounted for by MZ remained elevated at all three time-points for Balb/c mice. C57Bl/6 experienced an increased percentage of MZ B cells at d15 post-infection, which then declined by d28 post-infection. Absolute numbers of MZ B cells were significantly different in Balb/c versus C57Bl/6 mice over the course of infection (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">Fig 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). By d8 post-infection, MZ B cell numbers were increased 4.5±2.3 fold above controls in Balb/c mice (p = 0.01). In contrast, MZ B cell numbers were similar to controls in C57Bl/6 mice (0.83±0.29, p = 0.4). MZ B cell numbers were increased at d15 post-infection in C57Bl/6 and then declined, but remained elevated above controls at d28 post-infection. Analysis of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>high</sup>CD23<sup>low/−</sup>IgM<sup>high</sup> B cells showed these same trends of altered B cell numbers (data not shown). The percent of total B cell blasts that were represented by the MZ phenotype followed this same pattern of increased representation in the B cells from susceptible Balb/c mice, significantly more than in the resistant C57Bl/6 mice (p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>low/−</sup>CD23<sup>low/−</sup> B cells numbers and percentages within the B cell gate were expanded in both models by day 8, Balb/c mice experienced further increased numbers and levels measured at d15 post-infection, whereas C57Bl/6 mice did not (p&lt;0.0001, p = 0.002, numbers and percentage of B cells, respectively)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">Fig 7<italic>C</italic></xref>).

<title>Splenic T Cells Expand and Were Activated in Resistant Mice</title>
<p>To determine the expansion and activation of splenic T cells, the number of total T cells and T cell blasts were assessed at days 8, 15, and 28 post-inoculation, comparing T cells in infected mice to control mice receiving heat-inactivated parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g008">Fig 8<italic>A,B</italic></xref>). C57Bl/6 mice had increased T cells at d15 that decreased but remained elevated by d28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g008">Fig 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). This coincided with higher levels of T cell blasts at d15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g008">Fig 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Balb/c mice did not have increased T cells, although T cell blasts were increased at d15. CD69 expression on T cells was significantly increased compared to controls in both models and to a similar extend at day 8 post-infection (3.6±0.3 for Balb/c and 2.9±1.3 for C57Bl/6, p&lt;0.01 compared to control, p = 0.12 between models). CD69 expression diverged at day 28 post-infection, when C57Bl/6 T cells had CD69 levels comparable to controls and Balb/c T cells had 3.2±0.8 fold increased CD69 expression compared to controls (p = 0.0002) and compared to the previous time point (1.9±2.6 p = 0.004). Fas and FasL profiles were significantly different on T cells from Balb/c versus C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g008">Fig 8<italic>C</italic></xref>), especially at d15.

<p>The results presented in this study demonstrate that increased polyclonal B cell antibody responses were associated with decreased parasite-specific humoral immunity and increased disease susceptibility during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Hypergammaglobulinemia was more pronounced in susceptible Balb/c mice and was associated with delayed generation of parasite-specific antibodies. The parasite-specific humoral immunity in the resistant C57Bl/6 mice was concomitant with a Th1-skewed cytokine burst. In comparison, delayed and then maintained Th2-skewed cytokine production in Balb/c mice was associated with polyclonal B cell activation. B cell activation in resistant mice was associated with low levels of total ASC and appreciable parasite-specific ASC in the spleen. Total B cell expansion and activation in the spleen of susceptible mice was associated with the development of high levels of antibody secreting cells (ASC) without detection of parasite-specific response. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g009">Figure 9</xref> provides a model for the association of polyclonal versus parasite-specific antibody with disease severity and cytokine responses in resistant and susceptible mice. Furthermore, analysis of B cell surface markers (CD69, CD86, Fas, FasL, CD21, CD23) indicated differential profiles in the context of polyclonal versus parasite-specific activation in resistant C57Bl/6 versus susceptible Balb/c mice. B cells with the marginal zone (MZ) phenotype were differentially expanded in the spleen of resistant C57Bl/6 mice in association with parasite-specific responses. MZ-like B cells were expanded early and remained elevated in susceptible Balb/c mice. Changes in T cell surface marker expression (Fas, FasL, CD69) and subsets (CD4, CD8, NK) were observed in resistant versus susceptible mice and associated with differential humoral responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As in many experimental models of infection, there are significant differences in susceptibility to pathogens among mouse strains; however the host-pathogen interactions that account for these differences are not completely clear. In the case of <italic>T cruzi</italic> experimental infection, protective cytotoxic CD8 responses and Th1 responses have been well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Padilla1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hoft3">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Tarleton3">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Martin2">[75]</xref>. The extent of B cell activation during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and its association with effective parasite-specific immunity versus adverse polyclonal responses remains unclear.</p>
<p>It has been previously been shown that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> induces polyclonal B cell activation during acute infection and that B cell mitogens are expressed by infectious trypomastigotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-ReinaSanMartin2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-HontebeyrieJoskowicz1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio8">[77]</xref>. It has been postulated that this aberrant B cell response may contribute to a delayed parasite-specific humoral response, thus promoting infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-ReinaSanMartin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio6">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-HontebeyrieJoskowicz1">[76]</xref>. In this study, we examined the humoral responses of two murine strains with differing susceptibility to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection to 1) determine whether induction of polyclonal B cell activation was associated with increased disease susceptibility and 2) determine whether changes in circulating cytokines, splenic B cell function and phenotype, and splenic T cell activation and subset expansion were associated with polyclonal versus parasite-specific humoral responses.</p>
<p>Analysis of total circulating IgG and IgM indicated that resistant C57Bl/6 mice demonstrated increased total IgM followed by an IgM response to a parasite specific antigen (CRP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g002">Fig 2</xref>). The IgM responses in C57Bl/6 mice developed as parasites were cleared from circulation and were followed by a rise in total IgG and then parasite-specific IgG. In contrast, Balb/c mice had very little change in total IgM in the blood post-infection and minimal parasite-specific IgM responses. In contrast to the lack of IgM response, Balb/c mice had an increased hypergammaglobulinemia response compared to C57Bl/6 mice. The increased hypergammaglobulinemia evident in Balb/c mice was associated with a further delay and diminished parasite-specific IgG response compared to C57Bl/6. This lack of a robust IgG response to a parasite specific antigen (CRP) in Balb/c mice during experimental infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was not due to an inherent inability to generate a response to this <italic>T. cruzi</italic> antigen, as evident by the magnitude of the IgG response to CRP after genetic immunization in Balb/c versus C57Bl/6 mice. Rather, these data suggest underlying host-parasite interactions that determine the balance of hypergammaglobulinemia versus the development of parasite specific responses.</p>
<p>As Th responses play a role in the generation of specific immune responses, as well as polyclonal B cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio3">[21]</xref>, we hypothesized that the differential humoral immune response to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection may be associated with differential production of cytokines in these two models. Analysis of circulating cytokines post-infection confirmed the skewing of Balb/c mice toward Th2 responses and the C57BL/6 mice toward Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g003">Fig 3</xref>). These data are in agreement with previous reports that early Th1 IFN-γ responses are associated with resistance to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hoft2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Antunez1">[78]</xref> and that Th2 cytokines, especially IL-4 and IL-10 are associated with susceptibility to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio7">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Kumar2">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Vogt1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Muller1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-AcostaRodriguez1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hiyama1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-BarbosadeOliveira1">[84]</xref>. The results of the present study show that early Th1-skewed cytokine burst was coincident with control of parasitemia and preceded the generation of parasite-specific humoral immunity in resistant C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Susceptible Balb/c mice had a delayed cytokine response, which was Th-2 skewed including IL-5 and IL-4 production, and was associated with delayed parasite-specific responses and exacerbated hypergammaglobulinemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). The apparent delay in cytokine responses and the lack of detectable IL-4 until day 28 post-infection in susceptible Balb/c mice may have been due to rapid consumption of these cytokines, especially IL-4, rather then lack of their production. Overall, these data suggest that the early Th-1 cytokine burst in susceptible mice may have dampened parasite-mediated polyclonal B cell activation, allowing for improved parasite-specific humoral responses, whereas sustained Th-2 cytokine production in susceptible mice may exacerbate parasite-induced polyclonal B cell activation. As B cells have been shown to produce cytokines in response to parasite-derived mitogenic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Bryan1">[85]</xref>, it is possible that B cell activation may account for some of the observed increases in cytokine levels post-infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>.</p>
<p>Cytokines can drive antibody production and influence isotype switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-AcostaRodriguez2">[86]</xref>.The differential production of cytokines in susceptible Balb/c versus resistant C57Bl/6 mice was associated with differential total and parasite-specific IgG isotype response over the course of acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g009">9</xref>). IgG1 and IgG2a made up the majority of the hypergammaglobunemia in Balb/c mice, whereas C57Bl/6 mice had a much lower IgG1 and IgG2a responses and increased total IgG2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g004">Fig 4</xref>). While IgG1 was the most elevated isotype in both mouse models, IgG2a showed a much greater increase from baseline in Balb/c and IgG2b in C57Bl/6 mice. C57Bl/6 mice experienced isotype switching of parasite-specific antibodies to IgG1, IgG2c, IgGb, and IgG3. In contrast, the Balb/c mice had limited isotype switching; the parasite-specific response remained predominately IgG1 and IgG2a out to day 28 post-infection. These data confirm the previously reported trend towards differential IgG isotype responses in resistant versus susceptible mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-elBouhdidi1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-dImperioLima1">[20]</xref> and further support the association of parasite-specific IgG2, particularly IgG2b, with increased resistance to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Brodskyn1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Takehara1">[87]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Powell1">[88]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported B cell expansion in the spleen during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-dImperioLima1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio4">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zuniga2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Marinho1">[89]</xref>. This expansion is increased when intact CD4 T-cell responses are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio3">[21]</xref> and evidence shows that it is dissociated from parasite specific responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio1">[12]</xref>, although some studies report both total and specific B cell responses. In the present study, we performed a detailed analysis of the B cell response to infection and found that although total numbers of B cells were expanded to similar extents in susceptible and resistant mice, the outcome of these expansions were different in terms of production of total and specific IgG ASC, activation status by CD69, CD86, Fas/FasL expression, and B cell subset expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g005">Fig 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g006"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Splenic B cell expansion in susceptible Balb/c mice was associated with increased numbers of B cell blasts, as well as with increased numbers of IgG ASC, without appreciable expansion of parasite specific IgG ASC. In contrast, B cell expansion in resistant C57Bl/6 mice led to moderately increased B cell blast formation, moderate to low levels of IgG ASC, and the formation of parasite-specific IgG ASC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g005">Fig 5</xref>). CD69, a marker of lymphocyte activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Powell1">[88]</xref>, was moderately increased on Balb/c splenocytes throughout infection, whereas in C57Bl/6 mice, CD69 was differentially expressed over the course of acute infection, with an early peak expression that was two fold higher on C57Bl/6 B cells compared to Balb/c B cells. The early rise in CD69 on C57Bl/6 B cells preceded parasite-specific ASC formation, after which CD69 levels decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). These data demonstrated that transient high level CD69 expression preceded parasite-specific B cell activation, while moderate sustained CD69 expression was associated with polyclonal B cell activation. Previous studies have indicated a role for increased CD86 on B cells during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in leading to increased immunoglobulin production through interaction with NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-DeArrudaHinds1">[90]</xref>. In this study, CD86 expression on B cell was not significantly different between these two models early in infection, but diverged later with increased levels of Balb/c B cells at day 28 post-infection concomitant with peak hypergammaglobulinemia in these mice.</p>
<p>Recent studies have indicated that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> causes parasite specific B cells to undergo Fas-FasL mediated fratricide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zuniga1">[30]</xref>. Fas is also expressed on B cells during germinal center reactions, without leading to apoptosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-vanEijk1">[91]</xref>). Our data shows that Fas and FasL were differentially expressed on the surface of B cells in C57Bl/6 versus Balb/c mice during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g006">Fig 6</xref>). In resistant C57Bl/6 mice, increased Fas and FasL positive B cell numbers were associated with CRP-specific IgG ASC. Fas and FasL were also increased on T cells in conjunction with this CRP-specific IgG response in the spleen. Together, these data suggest that the Fas/FasL expression on B cells in C57Bl/6 mice was associated with a productive, germinal-center like, reaction in the spleen. In contrast, elevated Fas/FasL positive B cell numbers in susceptible Balb/c mice were not associated with a parasite-specific response. Rather, the sustained elevated expression of these death ligands may have limited the non-specific expansion of B cells in these mice through B-cell fratricide, as increased activation and blast formation did not lead to overwhelming expansion of B cells during acute infection.</p>
<p>To better understand which B cells account for the observed increase in splenic B cells during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, we evaluated B cell subsets based on CD21 and CD23 expression of CD19+ B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g007">Fig 7</xref>). These markers have previously been used to define splenic B cell subsets ex vivo during microbial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Radwanska1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Malkiel1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Achtman1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Guay1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Belperron1">[69]</xref>. As the expression of these markers may be modulated by activation induced by infection, the definition of these subsets is not definitive. Future studies are necessary to define the affect of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection on these B cell subsets in vivo. For the purposes of this study, B cell subset populations were defined as CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>high</sup>CD23<sup>low/−</sup> (MZ B cells), CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>int</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup> (FO B cells) and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>low</sup>CD23<sup>low/−</sup> cells. In Balb/c mice, B cells retained CD21 expression, but decreased CD23 expression, the low affinity IgE receptor. Susceptible mice had an apparent increase in B cells with the MZ phenotype within total B cells and B cell blasts that was associated with polyclonal rather than parasite-specific humoral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Two possible explanations for the expansion of B cells with the MZ phenotype are that MZ B cells proliferated or parasite activation induced B cells differentiation toward a MZ B cell phenotype. MZ B cells were not expanded early in infection in C57Bl/6 mice. Rather, transient expansion in MZ phenotype within B cells and B cells blasts coincided with the development of parasite-specific IgG ASC in resistant C57Bl/6 mice. The percentages of B cells with a FO phenotype decreased in both models, but were retained to a greater extend in the C57Bl/6 mice, although the variability between mice was quite high, leading to a lack of significant difference in absolute numbers of FO in C57Bl/6 versus Balb/c mice. The relative amount of B cells with the FO phenotype within the B cell blast population was higher during early infection of C57Bl/6 mice compared to Balb/c mice, suggesting that in the context of parasite-specific response B cell blasts retain the FO phenotype to a greater extend than in the context of polyclonal B cell activation. Analysis of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>low</sup>CD23<sup>low/−</sup> cells indicated that Balb/c mice experienced increased expansion of these cells compared to C57Bl/6 mice. The expansion of transitional B cells without parasite-specific ASC in susceptible mice suggests that this expansion results from polyclonal B cell activation rather than parasite-specific humoral immunity. The relatively low representation of this population in the total number of B cell blasts in susceptible mice suggests that perhaps decreased CD23 expression, rather than proliferation led to the relative expansion of this subset compared to controls. All together, these data indicate differential changes in B cell subset phenotype in resistant versus susceptible mice. Further studies are needed to fully define the functional consequence of these apparent B cell subset changes and their contribution to humoral response during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether these differences in humoral response were associated with differences in T cell dynamics in resistant versus susceptible mice, bulk splenic T cells were analyzed for expansion, blast formation, and expression of Fas and FasL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000733-g008">Fig 8</xref>). T cell expansion was coincident with the generation of parasite specific IgG responses at day fifteen post-infection in resistant mice, but remained near control levels in during the polyclonal B cell activation in susceptible mice at this same time-point. CD69 expression on total T cells was similar early during infection for both models. Later in infection, T cells from infected Balb/c mice experienced a second wave of CD69 activation, which was coincident with clearance of parasite from circulation and the first detection of parasite-specific IgG in circulation, although these levels did increase much until later on during infection (after day 36). Low Fas and FasL expression in Balb/c mice suggests that the contribution of T cells to control of B cell numbers via apoptosis was minimal in these mice. The expression of Fas and FasL on T cells coincided with parasite-specific B cell responses in C57Bl/6 mice, suggesting they may have formed a productive association. Further analysis of T cells at this time-point indicated that resistant mice had significantly higher levels of CD4 and NK T cells than susceptible mice, both of which can provide B cell help <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Lang1">[92]</xref>. While previous studies show that lack of CD4 T cells led to decreased polyclonal B cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio3">[21]</xref>, these results suggest that maintenance of CD4 and increased NK T cells may also be important for directing the efficacy of the specific humoral response to parasite antigen. Activation of NK T cells has previously been linked to increased resistance to <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, but depends upon the presence of CD8 and CD4 T cells, as well as IFN-γ production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Duthie1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Duthie2">[94]</xref>. The increased numbers of NK T cells in resistant C57Bl/6 mice is particularly intriguing as they may provide B cell help through direct interaction (CD40L) or rapid cytokine responses, especially IFN-γ, which was produced to a much greater extent in these resistant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Leadbetter1">[95]</xref>. These data provide rationale for further studies to fully define the contribution of CD4 and NK T cells to polyclonal versus parasite-specific humoral immunity during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of susceptible versus resistant mice.</p>
<p>While susceptibility and resistance of Balb/c and C57Bl/6 mice have been documented and explored in terms of cellular and cytokine responses to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> experimental infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Hoft1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Antunez1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Kumar2">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Abrahamsohn1">[96]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Antunez2">[97]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-LeitedeMoraes1">[98]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Planelles1">[99]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Starobinas1">[100]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Tarleton4">[101]</xref>, humoral responses in these studies have been largely neglected. This is the first study to examine both polyclonal and specific humoral responses in these mice in the context of equivalent initial parasitemia. Taken together, the results in this study support the hypothesis that polyclonal B cell activation leading to hyper-IgG responses are associated with increased disease susceptibility and highlights the importance of host-parasite interactions in development of humoral responses to <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. By further characterizing associations between Th1 and Th2 responses, the development of polyclonal versus parasite-specific humoral responses, and the potential contribution of B cell subsets to these processes, this present study provides a more detailed understanding of the development of effective versus detrimental humoral responses during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. Furthermore, these results have implications for vaccine design in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, as host genetic biases that lead to differential polyclonal B cell activation may have profound effects on the development of humoral immunity to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> target antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-ReinaSanMartin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Montes3">[102]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000733-Minoprio9">[103]</xref>.</p>
