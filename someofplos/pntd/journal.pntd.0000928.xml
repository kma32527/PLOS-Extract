<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus indigenous to tropical Africa and Asia. Acute illness is characterized by fever, arthralgias, conjunctivitis, rash, and sometimes arthritis. Relatively little is known about the antigenic targets for immunity, and no licensed vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for the pathogen. While the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito is its primary vector, recent evidence suggests that other carriers can transmit CHIKV thus raising concerns about its spread outside of natural endemic areas to new countries including the U.S. and Europe. Considering the potential for pandemic spread, understanding the development of immunity is paramount to the development of effective counter measures against CHIKV. In this study, we isolated a new CHIKV virus from an acutely infected human patient and developed a defined viral challenge stock in mice that allowed us to study viral pathogenesis and develop a viral neutralization assay. We then constructed a synthetic DNA vaccine delivered by <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation (EP) that expresses a component of the CHIKV envelope glycoprotein and used this model to evaluate its efficacy. Vaccination induced robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, which individually were capable of providing protection against CHIKV challenge in mice. Furthermore, vaccine studies in rhesus macaques demonstrated induction of nAb responses, which mimicked those induced in convalescent human patient sera. These data suggest a protective role for nAb against CHIKV disease and support further study of envelope-based CHIKV DNA vaccines.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chikungunya fever epidemics are sustained by a cycle of human-mosquito-human transmission, with the epidemic cycle being similar to those of dengue and urban yellow fever. While the threat of a pandemic continues to engage the public's attention, the peculiar problems associated with the more immediate and very real seasonal epidemics are also worthy of consideration. Specifically, there are limited viral strains that have been characterized and available for laboratory study as well as limited knowledge of immune responses induced to the virus. In this study, we isolated CHIKV virus from an acutely infected human patient and used this new virus to develop a neutralization assay and a challenge stock, which is effective in a mouse model. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of an envelope-based synthetic DNA-based vaccine to impact viral disease in the mouse model and to generate protective levels of immune responses in nonhuman primates. We observed that this novel vaccine approach generated protective levels of immune responses in both mouse and non-human primate models. We believe that these studies advance the field of Chikungunya vaccine research as well as the study of immune protection to CHIKV.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, and is part of the Semliki Forest virus antigenic complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sergon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Schuffenecker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Lumsden1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Strauss1">[4]</xref>. CHIKV has been responsible for unprecedented, explosive outbreaks during 2004 and 2007 in India and the Indian Ocean islands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Schuffenecker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Strauss1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Epstein1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Borgherini1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Jain1">[7]</xref>. These outbreaks represent the largest documented cases associated with the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-KariukiNjenga1">[8]</xref>. Chikungunya fever, the disease caused by CHIKV, was first recognized in epidemic form in East Africa in 1952-1953 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Lumsden1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Robinson1">[9]</xref> and the viral agent was first isolated at that time from the blood of a febrile patient in Tanzania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Robinson1">[9]</xref>. In the local Swahili dialect, “Chikungunya” means “stooping” or “bending”, which describes the physical position often assumed by CHIKV-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Lumsden1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Robinson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Ross1">[10]</xref>. Since that time, CHIKV has been identified as the agent responsible for major epidemics in both Africa and Southeast Asia and continues to be a re-emerging agent of great interest to public health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sergon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Josseran1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sourisseau1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Simon1">[13]</xref>. Despite its importance as an emerging virus and potential biological weapon, there are no specific licensed vaccines or antiviral treatments for Chikungunya.</p>
<p>Currently, CHIKV is geographically distributed from Africa through Southeast Asia and South America and is principally transmitted to humans through <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Schuffenecker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Dubrulle1">[14]</xref>. Recently, a mutation in the CHIKV envelope (E1-A226V) was found to be directly responsible for the significant recent increase in CHIKV infectivity, and studies confirmed that this single amino acid substitution can influence vector specificity. This finding provides a plausible explanation of how this variant virus caused an epidemic in a region lacking the normal insect vector <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Vazeille1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Santhosh1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>While Chikungunya is not typically associated with human mortality, epidemics often present public health threats due to substantial morbidity, suffering, and loss of economic productivity. The incubation period of the virus ranges between 1–2 weeks and infected individuals usually experience an acute illness with fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, incapacitating polyarthralgia, severe muscle pain, and joint stiffness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Queyriaux1">[17]</xref>. The most prominent clinical feature of CHIKV disease is arthralgia, which can be debilitating and prolonged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Epstein1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Queyriaux1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Farnon1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sam1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Robin1">[20]</xref>. Though the pathogenesis of the virus in humans is not exactly clear, recent findings of CHIKV infection in muscle tissue and macrophages could explain some features of its clinical manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sourisseau1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Farnon1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Couderc1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Ozden1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Labadie1">[23]</xref>. Due to these characteristic clinical symptoms of infection, outbreaks of CHIKV have devastating public health and economic effects.</p>
<p>The first reported outbreak of Chikungunya occurred on Lamu Island, Kenya, in 2004. Later the virus spread to La Reunion Island, infecting more than two hundred thousand individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Josseran1">[11]</xref>, then to other islands in the Indian Ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Higgs1">[24]</xref>, and then finally into India in 2006 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Kalantri1">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, the La Reunion isolate outbreaks were associated with unexpected morbidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Mavalankar1">[26]</xref>. Importantly, exposed travelers returning from the affected areas to Europe, the US, Canada, Hong Kong, and numerous other countries have carried the virus into these new niches where the imported cases were subsequently identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-KariukiNjenga1">[8]</xref>. Although these instances of viral importation were effectively controlled, they serve as a reminder of how easily this agent could be introduced and spread into new geographical locations including industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Thus far, while several vaccines have been developed against this disease, such as a formalin inactivated vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Tiwari1">[27]</xref>, a virus-like particle vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Akahata1">[28]</xref> and a live attenuated vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-McClain1">[29]</xref>, none have advanced to clinical development and therefore illustrate an important area of need. Recently, a novel consensus-based DNA vaccine was developed by our laboratory and reported to be immunogenic in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Muthumani1">[30]</xref>, inducing both measurable cellular and humoral immune responses. However, the neutralizing and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody responses were not examined. While nAb to CHIKV during natural infection in humans are not well understood, recent sero-surveys during outbreaks suggest a protective role for prevention of replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Labadie1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Akahata1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Muthumani1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Wang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Couderc2">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, prior infection is thought to be protective against subsequent CHIKV infection. Therefore, by examination of nAb titers during natural infection in humans, a benchmark for vaccine development in this study, we aimed to establish a correlation with these responses and protection.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we isolated a new viral isolate from an acutely infected patient, and termed PENN CHIKV-2008 (PC-08), and characterized its biology in mice, and also used it to develop an <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assay. Furthermore, we modified our previous DNA vaccine to optimize for the capacity of neutralization by designing a single consensus envelope DNA vaccine construct expressing all three envelope proteins. We compared its effects in mice with a CTL-only-inducing Capsid vaccine in a challenge model. Finally, we compared in non-human primates vaccine-induced immune responses with human CHIKV convalescent sera as a measure of protective immunity.</p>

<title>DNA vaccine construction and expression</title>
<p>The CHIKV DNA constructs pCHIKV-E1, pCHIKV-E2, and pCHIKV-Capsid have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Muthumani1">[30]</xref>. The combined CHIKV-envelope construct was designed with the structural genes E3, E2 and E1 linked together in a single construct with furin cleavage sites between the individual genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Richards1">[34]</xref>. The consensus gene sequences were constructed using the predicted consensus sequences from the sequences available in the NCBI Genbank database and designated as pMCE321. We note that while the 6K protein is also a structural constituent of envelope, we did not include it in our vaccine construct because we sought to create a minimal vaccine construct capable of inducing broadly protective immune responses. The primary role of 6K is postulated to function in the selection of lipids that interact with the transmembrane domains of the glycoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Cho1">[35]</xref>. Consensus sequences were optimized for Env expression, including codon and RNA optimization (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany), a novel leader sequence was added <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Muthumani3">[36]</xref> as were furin cleavage sites to facilitate Env processing as previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Richards1">[34]</xref> and inserted into the pVax1 expression vector (Invitrogen, CA) and designated as pMCE321. DNA preparations were made at Aldevraon (Forgo, ND), as previously described and formulated at 10 mg/ml in water.</p>
<p>Expression of pMCE321 was verified by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Vero and RD cells (1×10<sup>6</sup>cells) were transfected with pMCE321 constructs using the Fugene transfection method (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, proteins were isolated using cell lysis buffer, fractionated on SDS-PAGE (12%), and transferred to nitrocellulose using iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Immunodetection was performed using SNAP i.d. Protein Detection System (Millipore, MA, USA) with specific mouse antiserum and the expressed proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Muthumani2">[33]</xref>.</p>

<p>For immunofluorescence, Vero cells (2×10<sup>5</sup> cells) were seeded in 2-chamber tissue culture treated glass slides (BD Falcon, MA, USA) and transfected with pVax1-E1, pVax1-E2, and pMCE321 vaccine constructs or control pVax1 vector. Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with Glycine/BSA, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-Env IgG antibodies (1∶500 dilution). Excess antibodies were washed off and the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488-anti mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, USA) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C.

<title>CHIK virus extraction</title>
<p>The isolation of virus from patient sera was carried out in Vero cells grown to 90–95% confluence in Eagle's complete medium (MEM) in T-25 tissue culture flasks (BD Falcon, USA). Patient serum (100 µl) was mixed with MEM (400 µl), adsorbed onto the cell culture (after removing the growth medium) for 2 hrs at 37°C, and then replenished with complete growth medium following washing with MEM. The inoculated cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 to 7 days and monitored daily for the development of cytopathic effects (CPE). When CPE was observed in more than 90% of the cells, the flasks were frozen at −80°C, freeze–thawed five times to facilitate cell lysis and virus release, and then centrifuged at 3,000rpm for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The isolate was then passaged five times in Vero cells, titrated, and stored at −80°C. The virus stock was designated as PC-08 (PENN CHIKV strain - 08).</p>

<title>Clinical observation in CHIKV patients</title>
<p>The clinical manifestations caused by the Chikungunya outbreaks in 2005 to 2007 appeared varied and somewhat divergent from those observed in the early outbreak in 1953. In particular, the hemorrhagic tendency of CHIKV infections is not as predominant as that of past outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Enserink1">[46]</xref>. Accordingly, we sought to study serum samples from the recent CHIKV outbreaks and characterize viruses and the humoral responses from acute and convalescent sera of infected patients. During the recent outbreak in India, serum samples were regularly collected from patients with complaints of high fever, chills, headache, vomiting and severe abdominal pain (outpatient department, Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, Chennai, India &amp; at Regional Medical Research Centre (ICMR), Port Blair, India). From this population, thirty patient samples suspected for CHIKV were randomly selected and included in this study; all of the 30 patients from the outbreak area experienced fever lasting 2–15 days with high-grade temperature (38°C to 40°C), and in some patients (23%) accompanied by chills and rigors. Vomiting and abdominal pain (20% of the patients) as well as headache (13% of cases) was also observed. While myalgia or joint pain was seen only in 3% of the patients, rashes or hemorrhages were not observed in this patient population. Furthermore, sore throat and retro-orbital pain as seen in other common viral infections was not prominent in this outbreak. A summary of the clinical and laboratory observations in this CHIKV-infected patient population is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000928-t001">Table 1</xref>. Importantly, 13 samples (43%) were RT-PCR positive to CHIKV primers demonstrating that some contained Chikungunya virus.</p>

<title>Isolation and identification of CHIKV from patient serum</title>
<p>While samples collected during the first 48–72 h of infection are typically ideal for virus isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Akahata1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Couderc3">[37]</xref>, we were able to isolate CHIKV successfully from RT-PCR positive and symptomatic patient samples collected at the 3–4 days post CHIKV infection. Isolation of virus from the serum of a CHIKV positive patient who had a high-grade fever (40°C) lasting for 2 days was verified by the observance of massive cell death (Cytopathic effect: CPE) in Vero cells and by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, the isolated virus induced CPE indicating the presence of infectious CHIKV and successful virus production. To further confirm the identity of the virus that caused CPE, we extracted RNA from the infected cell culture supernatant and performed a one step RT-PCR to amplify a part of the CHIKV E2 gene by reverse transcriptase PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and electron micrographs of CHIKV viral isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g001">Fig.1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Edwards1">[38]</xref>.

<p>Expression of the pMCE321 vaccine constructs <italic>in vitro</italic> was verified by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques. The vaccine constructs expressed strongly in the transfected BHK-21 and Vero cells and the envelope glycoproteins were detected in the pMCE321 transfected lysates by Western blot using envelope E1 antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Further, to evaluate the expression of envelope proteins immunofluorescence techniques were performed with pMCE321 immunized sera in Vero cells transfected with pVax1, pCHIKV-E1, pCHIKV-E2 or pMCE321. Immunofluorescence showed envelope staining of the expressed proteins in the cytoplasm, which strongly suggested immune reactivity to each envelope component of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Further, to visualize the expression of pMCE321, pCHIKV-E1 and pCHIKV-E2, we performed a parallel FACS analysis from transfected cells, and studied the surface expression of envelope proteins. Interestingly, the pCHIKV-E1 and E2 expression profile was almost identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Unlike E1 and E2 sera expression, pMCE321 sera respond to strong envelope expression in transfected cells. These findings demonstrated the ability of the pMCE321 construct to potently express in mammalian cells and that the Abs induced by these constructs were able to react with the individual envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2.</p>

<title>CHIKV envelope vaccine immunogenicity and protection in mice</title>
<p>The ability of pMCE321, to induceCD8<sup>+</sup> CTL responses in mice after three immunizations was determined by IFN-γ ELISpot assay. Expression of all three of the envelope glycoproteins from the single DNA vaccine construct induced detectable cellular immune responses against CHIKV envelope specific peptide pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The results of the IFN-γ ELISpot assay 1 week following the third i.m. immunization (mean count, 1,613±117) for pMCE321 against both peptide pools showed strong cellular immune responses to administered envelope Ag in contrast to the control. pCapsid- or pVax1-immunized mice showed no envelope-specific Ag-specific responses at any point during the study. Capsid-specific T cell responses were induced to the Capsid vaccine. Because of increased T cell responses to the combined CHIKV-Envelope vaccine observed in mice, we anticipated that the Ab responses to combined envelopes would be similarly increased. To examine this, sera collected one week after each immunization were tested by ELISA to detect the induction of Envelope-specific IgG. Interestingly, mice immunized with the pCME321 complex displayed significantly higher levels of envelope-specific serum IgG than mice immunized with E1, E2 or E3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>The combination of CHIKV envelope glycoprotein genes into one vaccine construct, pMCE321, induced measurable levels of neutralizing and HI antibodies which are significantly greater than responses induced by pCHIKV E1 and E2 constructs alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g003">Fig. 3C–D</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Interestingly, we also observed that the E2 and E1 constructs when delivered individually were able to induce high levels of neutralizing Ab responses or HI titers respectively, but not both showing segregation of these functions. Importantly, the pMCE321 construct was able to drive both neutralizing and HI Ab responses at levels higher than either construct on its own. Taken together, these data demonstrate that immunization with the pMCE321 DNA vaccine induced both cellular and humoral immunity in mice.</p>
<p>We next addressed whether levels of CHIKV vaccine-elicited immunity were able to confer protective immunity by virtue of its cellular and neutralizing/HI Ab responses in mice. A virus challenge study was conducted to assess protective efficacy of the pMCE321 envelope vaccine in comparison with a CHIKV-Capsid vaccine which induced cellular responses, but no neutralization or HI responses. CHIKV-challenged mice were monitored daily for 14 days p.i. and outcome of the challenge was evaluated based on the common signs of Chikungunya infection in mice such as reduction in body weight, survival, lethargy, and hind limb weakness reported in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Wang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Ziegler1">[41]</xref>.

Therefore we also analyzed the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in naïve and vaccinated mice post infection and compared the levels to naïve-uninfected mice. Neither IL-6 nor TNF-α were detected in significant amounts in naïve mice; conversely, the production of IL-6 and TNF-α in CHIKV-infected mice (virus) was significantly greater than that in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g004">Fig. 4A–B</xref>). Similarly, secretion of proinflammatory mediators including IL-6 and TNF-α was measured in vaccinated mice and found to be strongly activated in pCapsid-immunized mice. In contrast remarkably lower levels were detected in pMCE321-immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g004">Fig. 4A–B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 versus pCapsid). These data suggest that CHIKV Envelope DNA immunization, and not Capsid vaccination, was more effective in minimizing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that are commonly associated with viral pathology.</p>

<p>Further, signs of disease in the naïve and vaccinated mice infected with the CHIKV isolate were detected and all mice showed a reduction in body weight for a period of 3 days p.i. However, after this initial period, pMCE321-immunized animals exhibited a restoration in body weight on average when compared with either naïve or Capsid-vaccinated animals. While none of the animals died naturally due to infection, the Capsid-immunized and naïve groups continued to lose body weight and were subsequently euthanized over the period of 7–12 days p.i when their body weight loss was greater than 30% of the pre-challenge weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast 100% of the pMCE321 vaccinated animals recovered and survived beyond day 12 p.i. Viremia on day 5 after i.n. infection was also measured in five unvaccinated animals infected with the CHIKV virus (mean titer log<sub>10</sub> 1.5 PFU/ml ±0.42), and vaccinated animals (mean titer log<sub>10</sub> 0.58 PFU/ml ±0.17). The vaccinated animals had significantly lower viremia (<italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001) with no signs of infection and remained apparently healthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>CHIKV DNA vaccination is immunogenic in nonhuman primates</title>
<p>Nonhuman primate studies were performed to determine whether CHIKV DNA vaccination with pMCE321 could elicit cellular as well as humoral responses, characterized by the elicitation of nAb responses. Four rhesus macaques were vaccinated with pMCE321 DNA delivered by <italic>in vivo</italic> EP. As negative controls, three monkeys were vaccinated with the pVax1 control vector. The animals were then monitored for the development of CHIKV Envelope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte and nAb responses.

Three of the four CHIKV pMCE321 DNA-immunized monkeys had detectable envelope -specific functional CTL activity as measured by IFN-γ ELIspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The control plasmid-immunized monkeys remained negative throughout the course of the experiment.

<title>CHIKV induces neutralizing antibodies in humans and correlates with HI-Ab response during infection</title>
<p>We next compared macaque nAb titers with those observed in human patient convalescent sera. Understanding the correlates of immunity during CHIKV infection is likely important for the rational design and development of an effective vaccine. While it is clear that a nAb response appears to be critical for protection against CHIKV infection, as with many infectious diseases like influenza and hepatitis, the levels required to induce sterilizing immunity or protection from disease-related morbidity are currently unknown. Therefore, we tested serum samples from CHIKV-infected individuals to measure levels of nAb activity. Among the thirty patients tested in this study, sixteen patients (53%) showed nAb titers to CHIKV, (titers above 20 titers were considered as positive; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Ziegler1">[41]</xref>), ranging from 40–640 titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Further, the presence of HI Abs to arboviruses including CHIKV was observed in seroepidemiological studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Farnon1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Couderc2">[32]</xref>. However the importance of HI during active CHIKV infection is not well understood. During the recent outbreak investigation, HI Abs were observed in eighteen (60%) of the thirty patients tested in the study. The HI titers varied from 20-1,280 titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Indeed, the HI titer also directly correlated with the levels of nAb in CHIKV infected patients (<italic>r</italic> = 0.9424; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), suggesting that the neutralizing and HI antibodies to CHIKV correlate with the ability of the host to clear the infectious virus during the course of natural infection. The neutralization titer was defined as the highest dilution of serum that prevented virus propagation as determined by CPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000928-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Interestingly, the post-infection nAb titers in convalescent humans were in the same range as the vaccine- induced titers we observed in macaques suggesting its value as a potential model for CHIKV vaccine development.</p>

<p>The mouse and primate immunological data taken together demonstrate that vaccination with pMCE321 induces a strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated cellular response as well as a humoral response (nAb and HI titers) capable of protecting the animals against a lethal challenge. In convalescent human samples we report the presence of significant nAb titers. Taken together, the data is suggestive of the role of antibody responses in protecting against CHIKV.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CHIKV is an emerging pathogen and an important public health concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Schuffenecker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Epstein1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sourisseau1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Simon1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Enserink2">[49]</xref>. Since no licensed vaccine or treatment is available for the pathogen, there is an urgent need for an effective vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Muthumani1">[30]</xref>. In this report, we describe the development of a DNA vaccine construct from our laboratory that expresses three of the CHIKV envelope proteins (E3, E2, and E1), is immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, provides protection in mice, and drives neutralizing titers in primates similar to those observed in human patient convalescent sera.</p>
<p>During the recent outbreak in India, sera were obtained from human patients with suspected CHIKV disease. All patients were from outbreak areas and a total of thirty sera were randomly selected and included in this study. However, the clinical picture reported herein had a different pattern with respect to previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Beasley1">[50]</xref>; this cohort had less severe disease symptoms and the reasons attributed to this could be multifactorial, such as the time of sample collection, the magnitute and types of immune responses mounted by these individuals, and the presence of pre-existing immunity in the outbreak area. RT-PCR confirmed the laboratory diagnosis and most of the patients in the study group were found to be positive, additionally having neutralizing/HI Abs to CHIKV. Virus isolation was successfully accomplished from the serum of a febrile patient and the virus isolate was identified and confirmed as CHIKV by RT-PCR amplifying the partial region of the E2 gene. Further, phylogenetic tree analysis with this sequence revealed a similarity to the Chikungunya strain Ross.</p>
<p>The importance of nAb against a viral infection has been well established and was reported earlier in a recent CHIKV study and also an RRV study, a virus that is similar to CHIKV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Couderc2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Lavillette1">[51]</xref>. Viral clearance was associated with the rapid induction of nAb in the acute phase of infection and loss of nAb after recovery from infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Pestka1">[52]</xref>. The same concepts may also extend to immunity to CHIKV infection. For example, previous reports in populations with high levels of nAb against CHIKV showed low infection rates, possibly due to protective immunity due to prior exposures, thus resulting in subsequent protective immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Schuffenecker1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Queyriaux1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Ng1">[48]</xref>. For instance, a study in northern Malaysia found that 35% of adults had nAbs against CHIKV even though there were no reports of a CHIKV outbreak in Malaysia, during this period of time. Furthermore, serologic surveys in India not linked to a recognized outbreak found a prevalence of 4.4% in the Calcutta metropolis and 15.3% in Andaman and Nicobar Island <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Jain1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Santhosh1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Sr1">[53]</xref>. Hence, it is likely that nAb aid in the reduction of symptoms either by aiding in clearing the virus or by preventing the pathological damage caused by the virus. In the current study, the range of nAb titers observed in the study cohort ranged between 40 and 640. Similarly, the HI titers induced in patients were in parallel with the neutralizing titer with HI titers ranging from 20 to 1,260.</p>
<p>The findings of significant nAb titers in human patient sera during active infection encouraged us to compare the capacity of our CHIKV DNA vaccine to generate nAb. Our previous CHIKV DNA vaccine consisting of the co-delivery of two different plasmids, pCHIKV-E1 and pCHIKV-E2, was capable of inducing levels of neutralizing and HI titers; pCHIKV-E2 induced the production of nAb and pCHIKV-E1 elicited HI Abs response in immunized mice. These findings led us to combine the predominant genes that constitute the entire CHIKV envelope in a single envelope construct (pMCE321) for vaccination. We envisioned such an approach may lead to simultaneously increased cellular responses and humoral responses and likely inducing both neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition Abs. Indeed, the novel envelope construct pMCE321 vaccine drove the cellular response to both E1 and E2 glycoproteins and the magnitude of this response was higher than that seen with individual E1/E2 gene constructs. Moreover, the humoral responses to pMCE321 were also increased when compared to that of the individual pCHIKV-E1 and pCHIKV-E2 constructs.</p>
<p>To assess the protective efficacy of this novel vaccine construct capable of generating both strong cellular and humoral immunity, we conducted a CHIKV challenge study in mice and observed that the PC-08 strain of virus was pathogenic in mice. Specifically, we observed a reduction in body weight, lethargy, hind limb weakness and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Wang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Powers1">[40]</xref>. Following challenge with CHIKV, all of the naïve mice showed severe weight loss from 1-3 days p.i. and showed clinical symptoms like lethargy and hind limb weakness by day 6. However, none of the envelope-based vaccine-immunized mice showed clinical symptoms as pronounced as in the unvaccinated mice. While control mice continued to lose weight over the course of the study and had to be euthanized, the Env-immunized mice rapidly regained weight after the initial 3 days and returned to their normal, pre-challenge state. Overall, these data showed that the new envelope-based vaccine construct pMCE321 was highly effective at protecting against morbidity and mortality in this model. Furthermore, our study also demonstrated an inverse relationship between vaccination and the resulting viremia. Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the amount of virus in the vaccinated mice compared to the unvaccinated mice post-challenge. Similarly, the histopathological evaluation of tissues from the brain, liver, heart, lung and kidney in immunized mice showed minimal or no damage when compared to naïve infected mice. Furthermore, Capsid-immunized mice exhibited symptoms of morbidity as well as mortality likely due to the lack of induction of nAb responses. This protective efficacy may likely be attributed to the high titers of nAb produced in the vaccinated animals similar to the findings in humans where high neutralizing titers have been correlated to better disease prognosis and protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Vazeille1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Queyriaux1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Couderc2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000928-Oliver1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>Due to the induction of strong immunity and protection in mice, we next wanted to assess whether the envelope DNA vaccine (pMCE321) was immunogenic in nonhuman primates. Four rhesus animals were immunized and the cellular and humoral responses were measured. Similar to the immune responses observed in vaccinated mice, CHIKV envelope-specific T cell responses were induced as well as nAb responses in the nonhuman primate cohort. Importantly, the range of neutralization titers observed in these animals was similar to the levels observed in humans during active CHIKV infection. These data demonstrate that the pMCE321 DNA vaccine is immunogenic in nonhuman primates, and was capable of producing titers of nAb which are thought to be protective in humans against disease.</p>
<p>In summary, there are several important findings in this manuscript. We report the isolation of a new isolate of CHIKV from the southern regions of India which we have named PC-08. This isolate is cytopathic in several cell lines as well as primary immune cells. The virus can induce pathogenesis in a mouse challenge model through i.n. challenge and thus should provide a useful <italic>in vivo</italic> model for further study. Furthermore, this viral stock allowed us to scale up a Neutralization assay for CHIKV study. We also report development of a novel single-plasmid envelope-based DNA vaccine; pMCE321 is protective in the mouse challenge model and drives relevant titers of nAb in a macaque model system. Further study of this novel vaccine and protective immunity is warranted.</p>
