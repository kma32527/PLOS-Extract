          <title>Background</title>
          <p>We have demonstrated that vaccination with pDNA encoding cysteine proteinase Type II (CPA) and Type I (CPB) with its unusual C-terminal extension (CTE) can partially protect BALB/c mice against cutaneous leishmanial infection. Unfortunately, this protection is insufficient to completely control infection without booster injection. Furthermore, in developing vaccines for leishmaniasis, it is necessary to consider a proper adjuvant and/or delivery system to promote an antigen specific immune response. Solid lipid nanoparticles have found their way in drug delivery system development against intracellular infections and cancer, but not <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA vaccination. Therefore, undefined effect of cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (cSLN) as an adjuvant in enhancing the immune response toward leishmanial antigens led us to refocus our vaccine development projects.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Three pDNAs encoding <italic>L. major</italic> cysteine proteinase type I and II (with or without CTE) were formulated by cSLN. BALB/c mice were immunized twice by 3-week interval, with cSLN-pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b</italic>, pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b</italic>, cSLN-pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b<sup>-CTE</sup></italic>, pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b<sup>-CTE</sup></italic>, cSLN, cSLN-pcDNA and PBS. Mice vaccinated with cSLN-pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> showed significantly higher levels of parasite inhibition related to protection with specific Th1 immune response development, compared to other groups. Parasite inhibition was determined by different techniques currently available in exploration vacciation efficacy, i.e., flowcytometry on footpad and lymph node, footpad caliper based measurements and imaging as well as lymph node microtitration assay. Among these techniques, lymph node flowcytometry was found to be the most rapid, sensitive and easily reproducible method for discrimination between the efficacy of vaccination strategies.</p>

          <p>This report demonstrates cSLN's ability to boost immune response magnitude of <italic>cpa/cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> cocktail vaccination against leishmaniasis so that the average parasite inhibition percent could be increased significantly.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of leishmaniasis with an annual incidence of approximately 2 million cases and is endemic in 88 countries, including Iran. CL's continued spread, along with rather ineffectual treatments and drug-resistant variants emergence has increased the need for advanced preventive strategies. We studied Type II cysteine proteinase (CPA) and Type I (CPB) with its C-terminal extension (CTE) as cocktail DNA vaccine against murine and canine leishmaniasis. However, adjuvants' success in enhancing immune responses to selected antigens led us to refocus our vaccine development programs. Herein, we discuss cationic solid lipid nanoparticles' (cSLN) ability to improve vaccine-induced protective efficacy against CL and subsequent lesion size and parasite load reduction in BALB/c mice. For this work, we evaluated five different conventional as well as novel parasite detection techniques, i.e., footpad imaging, footpad flowcytometry and lymph node flowcytometry for disease progression assessments. Vaccination with cSLN-<italic>cpa</italic>/<italic>cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> formulation showed highest parasite inhibition at 3-month post vaccination. Immunized mice showed reduced IL-5 level and significant IFN-ã increase, compared to control groups. We think our study represents a potential future and a major step forward in vaccine development against leishmaniasis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Leishmaniasis is one of the most important vector borne infections that can cause a spectrum of diseases, ranging from a clinically silent process to a fatal progressive disease in human. It is a major public health crisis in many countries including Iran resulting in an estimated of 12 million new cases occurrence, each year (World Health Organization website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/soa_parasitic/en/index3.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/soa_parasitic/en/index3.html</ext-link>). This parasitic disease is diagnosed as three clinical forms named cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical manifestation of the disease depends on both the species involved and the host. The tissue lesion in cutaneous form, can last for months or years before healing. An interesting feature is that despite the disappearance of the lesion and resistance to reinfection, residual parasites remain in the host, probably for a very long time, if not forever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Handman1">[1]</xref>. Current curative therapies for cutaneous leishmaniasis are costly, often poorly tolerated and not always effective. This disease is one the few parasitic diseases likely to be controllable with vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Modabber1">[2]</xref>. Generally; vaccination is largely protein-based and requires direct administration of dead or attenuated parasite, recombinant proteins, or virus-like particles. For targets resembling intracellular pathogens like <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, such vaccines generate incomplete immune responses and fail to induce protective affects as usually generate only antibody-mediated (humoral) immune responses and often require periodic booster injections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Modabber1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>. However, cell-mediated immune responses are required for clearance of such parasite and generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cells that kill infected cells. Currently, only attenuated live organism vaccines generate significant cell-mediated immune responses, but these are associated with certain safety concerns and can be difficult to manufacture consistently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Modabber1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>. DNA vaccination offers an attractive alternative to traditional non replicating vaccine strategies. Intracellular production of antigens from delivered DNAs can result in both humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA-based vaccines also offer practical advantages as well, mostly because of the capability of developing countries to cheaply and rapidly produce pDNA from bacteria. Furthermore, it is possible to formulate several antigens from different stages of the parasite life cycle or different subspecies as one shot of vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Carvalho1">[4]</xref>. However, despite decades of research, safe and efficient delivery of pDNA to initiate proper immune responses remains one of the major drawbacks in bringing DNA vaccination into clinical trials. Synthetic particle carrier systems are known as one of the important tools for improvement of current performed DNA vaccines. In such approaches, pDNA is encapsulated into, or complexed via electrostatic interaction with a synthetic carrier, resulting in fabrication of particles with a size ranging from nanometers (nm) to few micrometers. The pDNA release from these particles has proven to be a very effective delivery strategy as the passive targeting to antigen presenting cells (APCs) by size exclusion mechanism, protection from nuclease degradation, cellular uptake enhancement, antigen depot formation at the injection site and controlling the release rates of pDNA that might be important for timing immune responses, are all likely to be occurred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Lipid-based delivery systems represent one of the most advanced drug delivery technologies to date. Different lipid-based adjuvants are introduced and evaluated for pDNA formulation, e.g. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) [based on class I of lipids], liposomes, Transfersomes, niosomes and virosomes [based on class II of lipids] and Micelles, emulsions [based on class III of lipids] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-CoplandM1">[6]</xref>. In general, the common ground of these systems for transfection is the need for cationic lipids such as 1, 2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium (DOTAP) to facilitate pDNA binding. A neutral helper lipid such as L-alpha-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) or cholesterol is also required to increase the transfection properties of the pDNA/lipid complexes. Several authors have administered liposomes, niosomes and other lipid based systems for pDNA delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-CoplandM1">[6]</xref>. But despite offering a number of technological advantages over other existing transfection reagents, SLN utility for DNA vaccination has not been conveniently investigated <italic>in vivo</italic>. As SLN can be manufactured in large scale and under favorable technological parameters without the need for organic solvents and have an acceptable stability that facilitates their manipulation for different processes such as lyophilization and steam sterilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Muller1">[7]</xref>, , they may become a potentially valuable addition and promising alternative to the well-established dossier of non-viral transfection agents leading by cationic liposomes.</p>
      <p><italic>Leishmania</italic> express large quantities of cysteine proteinases (CP) which are members of the papain superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Coombs1">[9]</xref>. In <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<italic>L. major</italic>), two most important CPs have been described. CPA is a type II cysteine proteinase which is expressed at higher level in amastigote stage and stationary phase promastigote. CPB is a type I cysteine proteinase which present maximally at the amastigote developmental stage and is encoded with an unusual C-terminal extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Robertson1">[10]</xref>.The presence of this highly variable CTE differentiates Leishmanial rCPB from the other CPs in the papain superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Robertson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Sakanari1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati1">[12]</xref>. CTE can be glycosylated and partially removed by proteolytic cleavage during processing of the enzyme to its mature form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Sakanari1">[11]</xref>. Hence, CTE fragment is not crucial for enzyme activity and intracellular trafficking, although it is highly immunogenic and responsible for immune evasion and play a role in the diversion of the host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Sakanari1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati1">[12]</xref>. We have reported that antigenic rCTE of <italic>L. infantum</italic> elicitated a predominant IgG2 response in asymptomatic dogs and <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of PBMCs. Immunization with CTE also displayed both type 1 and 2 immune signatures in experimental murine model of <italic>L. infantum</italic> infection and therefore is not protective as a vaccine candidate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we had demonstrated that the <italic>cpa/cpb</italic> cocktail is more protective against cutaneous leishmanial infection than the separate forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati3">[14]</xref>. Therefore, there was still a need to study the effect of CTE deletion in this cocktail vaccine against <italic>L. major</italic>.</p>
      <p>Despite the proven antigenicity and immugenicity of these DNA vaccine candidates, the largest drawback of this kind of vaccination is the obscurity in intracellular delivery of pDNA that causes low levels of gene expression (transfection) which in turn limits the resulting immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Greenland1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, pDNA must use with a proper and safe formulation in order to coordinate innate and adaptive immune responses and generate strong immunity.</p>
      <p>Recently, several immunoadjuvants like BCG, G-CSF and CpG-ODN and also various delivery systems like PLGA microspheres and liposomes have been used to potentiate the immune responses against <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Mutiso1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Herein, we used cationic solid-lipid nanoparticle (cSLN) as a non viral transfection agent for delivery of the cocktail DNA vaccine. In our previous studies, cSLN formulation as a delivery system have revealed comparable efficiency/cytotoxicity ratio to linear PEI-25 kDa-pDNAs polyplexes, protected <italic>cpa</italic>, <italic>cpb-<sup>CTE</sup></italic> and <italic>cpb</italic> genes from extracellular enzymatic degradation and also exhibited considerable low cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Doroud1">[17]</xref>. In this study, these characterized formulations of cocktail vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immune induction potential in BALB/c mice as sucesptible animal model.</p>

Samples were then homogenized using a high shear homogenizer (IKA®, Germany) at 18,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. cSLN dispersion was obtained by direct cooling of hot O/W microemulsion on an ice-bath while stirring at 1000 rpm. cSLNs were washed by centrifugation (6000 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, three times) using 100 kDa Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore, Schwalbach/Ts, Germany) to purify the suspension from the excess amounts of surfactant. Endotoxin concentration in the cSLN formulation was determined by limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay (LAL Kit, Charles Riever Endosafe, T2092 CTK7, and USA).The physicochemical stability of the formulations were evaluated at 4±1°C, 25±1°C at dark for 1 month at regular time intervals via observation of any changes in suspension clarity, particle size and zeta potential assessments.</p>

        <title>Disease progression monitoring by five different techniques revealed the efficacy of S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> cocktail DNA vaccination</title>
        <p>The efficacy of cocktail pDNA vaccines containing pDNAs encoding CPA/CPB, CPA/CPB<sup>-CTE</sup>, and the same cocktail pDNA vaccines formulated with cSLN (S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup>) were evaluated by their capability to induce protection against <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection in the BALB/c mice model. It is worth to mentin that, no apparent sign of local intolerance such as redness, swelling, bruising, pain observed at the site of injection 1 and 24 hr after vaccine administration. Parasite inhibition in different groups was assessed on both FP and LN of animals. For this purpose, dynamic measurement with a metric caliper, parasite load determination by flowcytometry and imaging techniques were done on the infected mice FP. In parallel, the parasite load was assessed in the LN via microtitration and flowcytometry methods.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g001">Figure 1</xref>, FP swelling of seven different groups of mice n = 10)was measured after a challenge inoculation with EGFP-transfected stationary phase promastigotes of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. All the mice which have received the empty cSLNs (G5), pDNA vector without any insert formulated with cSLN (G6) or PBS (G7); showed significant lesions by 7 weeks post-challenge. There was a significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) difference between animals received formulation S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> (G1 and 3) and animals immunized with non-formulated cocktail vaccines (G2 and 4) at 9<sup>th</sup> week post challenge. The latter groups did not show any significant difference with the control groups. There was also a significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 difference between group 1 and 3, confirming that the higher level of protection observed in group 3. However, this difference between the cocktail vaccine compositions was not significant in group 2 and 4 and this difference could not be simply described due to the presence of CTE in the texture of the S<sub>p</sub>a/b cocktail vaccine. It seems that utilizing cSLNs for the formulation of pDNAs could potentiate the manifestation of this difference between the vaccine compositions. Vaccination with cSLN-pDNA encoding <italic>cpa</italic>, <italic>cpb</italic> (G 1) or cSLN-pDNA encoding <italic>cpa</italic>, <italic>cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> (G3) delayed FP swelling when compared to immunization with cSLN and PBS (G5 and 7), at this time point. For a certain time, immunization with the pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b</italic> and pcDNA-<italic>cpa/b<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> cocktail vaccines had a significant effect in delaying FP swelling. However, this effect was not long lasting and 9 weeks after challenge, there was a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) in protective effect between groups 3 and all of the other groups including group 1. Furthermore, the mean FP lesion size in group 1, was still significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) lower than that in the control groups. Totally, vaccination with a cocktail of <italic>cpa</italic>, <italic>cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> formulated with cSLNs (G3) resulted in control of the infection progress compare to the control groups as all of the animals in this group developed significantly smaller FP lesions (2.02±0.7 mm) at 9<sup>th</sup> week after challenge.</p>

        <p>To assess the reliability of this conventional and time consuming experiment at 9<sup>th</sup> week post challenge, we also detected EGFP-expressing <italic>L. major</italic> in the FPs of mice using fluorescence imaging system that is supposed to give a precise two-dimensional image from the extent of infection, independent of the inflammatory responses at the FP injection site. This experiment enabled us to clearly detect the parasite load in the infected FPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). As shown in this Figure, the GFP fluorescence in the control group of animals was not localized to the site of the inoculation and the parasites spread to the whole FP. We also observed that the increasing thickness of the infected FPs was not correlated with the intensity enhancement of the detected GFPs in the tested animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The sum green intensity (pixel) from the imaging studies were higher in infected FP of the control groups. Furthermore, only group 3 of the tested animals revealed significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 4) lower GFP intensity compare to the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>The infection progression was also followed by determining the total parasite load in the LNs of challenged mice at 9 weeks post-infection by the microtitration method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and flowcytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). According to microtitration method and compare to control groups, parasite load in the LNs of vaccinated groups with S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> (G3) decreased significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The expression of EGFP in the LNs was readily evident from the intense green fluorescence of the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The parasites reside inside the LN cells were quantified by monitoring EGFP expression via flowcytometry analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, Group 1 and 3 both expressed significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, n = 3) lower percent of EGFP that is correlated with the least amastigote parasite existence in the lymphatic cells.

        <p>It is noteworthy that, the rate of infection in all groups was in concordance with the delay in the appearance of lesions, the thickening peaked at 9 weeks post-infection and the parasite load in the LNs and FPs determined by microtitration, flow cytometry and imaging methods. Mice vaccinated with formulated cocktail plasmids i.e. S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> (G1 and G3) showed a significant decrease in the FP tissues parasite load as well as LN, compared to the control groups. The ability of the vaccines to inhibit the infection progress and parasite replication [parasite inhibition (PI) %] was predicted according to the assessment of the FPs and LNs parasite load via imaging and flow cytometric method in terms of the decrease in intensity of green fluorescence observed in vaccinated animals, as well as parasite burden of the FPs and LNs by flowctometry and microtitration method. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>, the given rates were calculated by comparing the precentage of fluorescence intensity or parasite burden in FPs and LNs of vaccinated mice to the lowest and highest intensity of fluorescence in the non vaccinated groups. Average of PI% rates were more expressive, when FP imaging and LN flow cytometric techniques were used. The average PI% in G3 was significantly higher than other vaccinated groups when determined by different methods, executed on FPs and LNs. The mean average of parasite reduction in this group was 87.11% (IC95%, 85.9–88.33) by FP imaging, 65.64% (IC95%, 61.29–69.98) by FP flow cytometry, 41.43% (IC95%, 35.05–47.81) by LN microtitration and 86.77% (IC95%, 87.78–85.75) by LN flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>). The profile of the alteration in the PI% results in all of the vaccinated groups were correlated with the results of the LN parasite burden via microtitration assay and footpad swelling. Neither imaging nor flow cytometry assays could discriminate between the parasite inhibition results of G1 and G3 of the vaccinated animals, when manipulating the animals' footpads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cocktail DNA vaccination with S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulation encoding CPA, CPB<sup>-CTE</sup> enhanced the IFN-γ production</title>
        <p>In order to compare the induced immune responses by different DNA cocktail vaccination strategies and explore the protective effects against <italic>L. major</italic> challenge in BALB/c mice, IFN- γ and IL-5 production were assessed after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of LN cells with both <italic>Leishmania</italic> soluble antigen (SLA) and recombinant CPs, pre and post challenge. According to IFN-γ production, pooled cells from three mice of groups 1, 2, 3 produced significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) higher levels compared to control groups before infection in response to the rCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Although group 3 produced higher amounts of IFN-γ (522.98±11.99 pg/ml), but was not significantly higher than the other vaccinated groups. Low IFN-γ production was detected in supernatants of LN cells of all three control groups in response to rCPs, before challenge. At 9<sup>th</sup> weeks post challenge, the rprotein specific IFN-γ production level increased only in group 1 and 3 of the animal vaccinated with S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulations, respectively. Although, the difference in IFN-γ production level was only significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), in group 3 (773.29±16.78 pg/ml) of animals compared to control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). No IL-5 was detectable in the supernatant of cells from all groups after stimulation with rCPs before challenge (data not shown). In contrast, significant levels of IL-5 were detected in the supernatant of cells from group 5, 6 and 7, in response to rCPs SLA at 9<sup>th</sup> week after infection, compared to all the vaccinated groups of animals (G1, 2, 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). There were no significatnt difference in Con A-induced cytokine production, among the tested groups.</p>

        <title>CP-specific production of IgG2a correlated with protective effect of cocktail DNA vaccination with S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup></title>
        <p>To compare IgG isotypes in protected and non protected vaccinated groups, sera were collected before and 9 weeks after challenge and assessed for IgG1 and IgG2a. To determine the antibody specificity, all sera of vaccinated and control mice were pooled and assayed by ELISA method before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g007">Fig. 7A, B and C</xref>) and after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g007">Fig. 7D, E and F</xref>) challenge with <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes. As it is shown in these Figures, the group of mice that developed an effective protective response (e.g., group 3) had substantially higher levels of CPA-specific IgG2a antibody compared to unprotected mice, both before (n = 13) and after (n = 10) challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g007">Fig. 7A, C</xref>). This is consistent with the results obtained above that SLN formulated cocktail DNA vaccine encoding <italic>cpa</italic> and <italic>cpb</italic><sup>-<italic>CTE</italic></sup> (S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup>) preferentially induced a Th1 response. According to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>, higher levels of CPB-specific IgG2a was produced in G1 and 2 of the vaccinated mice. This might be described by the immunogenic nature of CTE fragment.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although vaccination in the endemic populations is the most cost-effective tool to diminish the burden of <italic>Leishmaniasis</italic>, an effective vaccine to control this disease is not commercially available yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Modabber1">[2]</xref>. It is unlikely that an effective anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine based on the use of a single antigen will be achieved. This might be due to the complex and biphasic life cycle of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite. Therefore, a rational approach toward developing an effective cocktail vaccine should be the use of extracellular and intracellular parasite antigens resulting in a valuable cumulative immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati3">[14]</xref>. In this regard, ease of combining different pDNA vaccine candidates has made genetic vaccination an attractive platform for vaccination strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>, .</p>
      <p>However in most cases, even multivalent or cocktail DNA vaccines have failed to achieve the required level of protection possibly due to the lack of an appropriate delivery system and/or adjuvant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Mutiso1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for development of new, safe and improved adjuvant and/or delivery systems to enhance the immunogenicity of the available vaccine candidates. There are versatile conflicting reports about DNA vaccination effectiveness against leishmaniasis. Most of DNA vaccine candidates have been tested as single vaccine regimens, but there are also some reports about using combination of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Handman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>. Up to date despite of the heterogeneity of vaccination protocols, mean average of parasite load reduction was determined to be 59.24% (IC95%, 47.75–70.73) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>. This might be due to the reason that adjuvants and delivery systems were rarely added to the formulations containing candidates of the mentioned third-generation vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>. Approved adjuvants for human vaccines are poor inducers of antigen-specific Th1 responses that are necessary for an intra cellular parasite like <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-ColerR1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, several strategies, including live vectors; saponins; Freund's and montanide ISA 720 water-in-oil emulsions; oil-in-water emulsions (MF59); dendritic cells (DC) and liposomes have been utilized in different studies and trials to deliver antigens and redirect the immune responses towards desired Th1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Reed1">[22]</xref>. However, most of these failed to provide both long-term immunity and safety for human vaccines.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is still crucial to develop a potentiated delivery system with Th1 stimulating, safe and cost-effective properties for such a promising vaccination technology. Nanoscale vehicles are able to boost the quality and magnitude of an immune response in a predictable, designable trend that can be applied for wide-spread use of genetic vaccination, for developing vaccines for diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is currently managed only through relatively ineffectual therapeutic regimens. Nanoparticles as vaccine delivery systems, promote bioactive vaccine candidate protection against extracellular degradation and modulate cellular and humoral immune responses via targeting antigens to APCs such as DCs and therefore would be potentially useful as effective vaccine adjuvants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Greenland1">[15]</xref>. Cationic lipid-based systems could be formulated as emulsions, liposomes or cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (cSLN). These Lipid-based delivery systems are able to protect the nucleic acid payload and significantly reduce its degradation and extend its activity, improve the pDNA pharmacokinetic characteristics and thus induce more potent immune responses due to a depot effect in which persistence of pDNA at the site of delivery allows uptake by local immune cells, enhance intracellular uptake and delivery to target APCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Greenland1">[15]</xref>. Amongst these, SLNs have offered a number of technicopractical advantages including proper storage stability, easy production procedure, steam sterilization and lyophilization possibility and acceptable safety profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Muller1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Joshi1">[8]</xref>. In regards to vaccination studies, significant enhancement was reported when using cSLN-pDNA formulation for cholera toxin and lipid A delivery so that well tolerated particles with sizes greater than 100 nm exhibited higher adjuvant activity enhancing both T-helper types of immune responses compared to the FIA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Joshi1">[8]</xref>. Hence, in this study we considered SLN for formulating <italic>cpa</italic> and cp<italic>b</italic> or <italic>cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> genes. In our previous study, these genes as DNA prime boost vaccination regimen have induced partial protective responses in susceptible BALB/c mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati3">[14]</xref>. Heterologous prim-boost immunization approaches have complex logistics and high costs associated with manufacturing a second vaccine platform. Therefore, utilizing a suitable delivery system might be an important strategy to eliminate the need for boosting with the recombinant proteins and enhance third generation vaccine's potency by preventing rapid elimination of the administered pDNA from the circulation. In this regard, cSLN formulations were prepared and characterized regarding their size, zeta potential, nuclease protection, <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection efficiency, and cell viability, in our earlier report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Doroud1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To assess the cSLN utility prospect as a leishmanial vaccine delivery system, we exploited GFP-transfected <italic>Leishmania</italic> for generating experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice. This model was reported as a novel dynamic immunopathogenic tool allowing visualization and correlation of fluorescence intensity with parasite burden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Mehta1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Bolhassani1">[24]</xref>. Some concerns might be raised according to an anti-GFP immune response which could be induced against expressed GFP by the parasites. Several studies indicated that no immune responses have been detected in animals immunized with recombinant EGFP. In other words, recombinant EGFP is not able to stimulate APCs, nor do it induce a significant T-cell response or anti-EGFP antibody production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Cuadros1">[25]</xref>. In our investigations for precise judgment about the feasibility of this delivery system, we looked for a more rapid, sensitive and easily reproducible method to predict average parasite inhibition (PI) in the FP and LN of the vaccinated animals. Therefore, different techniques were used in this regards and the outcomes were correlated to the conventional standard caliper-based method and microtitration parasite burden as well as cytokine and antibody responses to choose the most sensitive, precise and less time-consuming technique for following <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, in mice model. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>, to evaluate the protection rate; FP swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and flowcytometric analysis on the FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) were assessed in immunized mice and the results were compared to each other and the control groups. The LN parasite burden was also determined by microtitration conventional method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), at the same time point. The results demonstrated that the size of lesion in mice immunized with S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> at week 9 post challenge were significantly (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05) smaller compared to control groups. Interestingly, the mice immunized with <italic>cpa/cpb</italic> and <italic>cpa/cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> had also revealed significant difference in FP swelling compared with the group of mice immunized with the formulated cocktail of pDNA<italic>-cps</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the groups of mice received non-formulated cocktail vaccines. The same results were obtained through LN analysis by microtitration and flowcytometry. The mentioned methods disclosed the significant PI discrepancy between S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulations, while FP analysis couldn't discriminate the effective vaccination strategy between these formulations. However, although FP caliper and LN microtitration based procedures were accurate, precise and capable of differentiation between effective formulations in terms of tissue prasitism, they were time-consuming, rather difficult and not absolutely reproducible as the risk of operator errors are more probable in these experiments. Therefore according to the presented data, it seems that parasite inhibition can be directly estimated by flowcytometry analysis performed on LN cells; as a more rapid, sensitive, and easily reproducible method for screening anti <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine candidates and delivery systems.</p>
      <p>The number of viable <italic>L. major</italic> was quantitated in the FPs and LNs of vaccinated groups of mice after challenge and compared to the control groups, and used as an indication of the protection rate or average parasite inhibition percent (PI%). The significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) higher mean PI% was seen in group 3 (73.36±15.94%) which was immunized with S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulation. This result further revealed the adjuvant effect of the cSLN for potentiating the immunogenicity of this genetic vaccination strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">4A and B</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>). It seems that a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> cocktail vaccine induced lower levels of the protection and needs a suitable delivery system to maintain and enhance its immunoprotective activity (44.38±12.59%). This obtained protection rate is in accordance with the percents of reduction of parasite load, reported to obtain with DNA vaccination, without a booster injection (59.24%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-PalatnikdeSousa1">[3]</xref>. However, despite using cSLN, S<sub>p</sub>a/b formulation couldn't provoke the same PI%. as did S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> (58.31±17.61%). This difference could be better described by the antigenic nature of the pDNAs used in this experiment and further confirms our previous results that CTE is highly immunogenic but not protective and more favorable to direct the immune system responces towards Th2 type. Based on the presented data, cSLN formulation conferred immunoprotecting activity to a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> genes which were non-immunoprotecting in their free form, and possibly enhance the immunostimulatory activity of these genes, by effectively inducing TLR-9 mobilization in the endosomal compartment. According to the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>, despite utilizing highly sensitive methods to determine parasite burden, there was no significant difference between <italic>cpa/cpb</italic> and <italic>cpa/cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic> cocktail DNA vaccines (G2 vs G4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, the discrepancy between these cocktails was significant when they were formulated with cSLN and the parasite burden was determined by LN manipulation (G1 vs G3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>). This data further supports the importance of the lymph nodes as one of the most relevant tissues involved in the parasite-host interface during the stages of <italic>L. major</italic> infection as the cellular and humoral immune responses in the LN are able to better describe the major immunological changes due to parasite persistence during infection. Therefore, LN may reflect the profile of the host's immune response and the parasite burden intensity throughout <italic>L. major</italic> infection via both conventional (microtitration) and novel (flow cytometry) techniques. PI% were singnificantly different between the groups received formulated and non formulated cocktail vaccines (G1 <italic>vs</italic> G2 and G3 <italic>vs</italic> G4). These results emphasis induction of the immune responses by using delivery systems in such an extent that even the effect CTE deletion could be detectable in the disease progression.</p>
      <p>To further evaluate the precision of the obtained data, the cytokines produced by antigen-specific T-cells, were evaluated to determine the profile of an elicited antibody response. IL-5 is associated with high levels of IgG1, whereas production of IgG2a is dependent on IFN-γ. Our results demonstrated that the immune response elicited by S<sub>p</sub>a/b and S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulations was dominantly Th1 response denoted by the higher ratio of IFN-γ/IL-5 secretion after stimulation with SLA and rCPs. However this ratio was significantly higher in S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> vaccinated animals. This ratio is approximately 3-fold higher when SLN has been used as a delivery system. T-cell immunogenicity of CPs had been shown in previous studies, where immunizations with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> recombinant CP resulted in the development of a potentially protective Th1 cell line, and that recombinant CPB from <italic>L. major</italic> efficiently induced CD8+ T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Coombs1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati4">[26]</xref>. Therefore, SLN proceeded as a Th1 stimulator adjuvant and increased the cocktail vaccine efficiency in elicitation of protective responses.</p>
      <p>IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers were also used as an indicator of Th2 and Th1 immune responses, respectively. The significantly (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05) highest IgG2a was seen in the sera of group 3 of mice immunized with S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> before challenge against recombinant CPA compared to other groups. This might be an indication that CTE-domain deletion in S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulation redirected the immune responses toward increasing IgG2a production. However, using cSLN formulation for this cocktail vaccine consequently induced a more potent antibody response compared with free pDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g007">Fig. 7A, C and G</xref>3, G4). At week 9<sup>th</sup> after challenge, the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in mice vaccinated with S<sub>p</sub>a/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulation (G3) was correlated with a Th1 response and further confirmed that could induce a potent Th1 type of immune response and protection against leishmaniasis, at least in murine model. Only G3 showed significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) highest ratio of IgG2a/IgG1, revealing the induced protection in this group confirmed by a significant smaller FP swelling (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), lower LN parasite load (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), highest IFN-γ/IL-5 ratio (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and maximum average of parasitic inhibition percent by flowcytometry and imaging methods.</p>
      <p>Despite, using cSLN as a delivery system, the immune responses to the selected antigens (<italic>cpb</italic> and <italic>cpb<sup>-CTE</sup></italic>) of the cocktail vaccine were differed. Generally, the titres of specific antibodies raised by DNA vaccination are lower than those obtained after vaccination with a recombinant protein. As it is shown in this study antibodies are induced to a very low extent against CPB<sup>-CTE</sup>, especially in comparison to antibody levels against CPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g007">Fig. 7B, D</xref>). This is definitely attributed to the presence of immunogenic CTE-domain in the vaccine formulations administered to G1 and G2 that affect the character and potency of the responses against defined antigens in the mentioned cocktail vaccines. As a part of our experiments, we have performed an ELISA test in which pooled sera of G1 and G2 were tested against CPB<sup>-CTE</sup> and sera of G3, G4 tested against recombinant CPB. As a result, G1 and G2 revealed reduced antibody responses while G3, G4 did not show any difference in antibody responses (data not shown). Thus, to avoid presenting exaggerated responses in the benefit for Spa/b<sup>-CTE</sup> formulation, the presented data show the results of the experiment in which each group plated against its own set of antigens. Therefore, CTE-domain deletion is shown to be an appropriate approach to design a protective vaccine candidate against <italic>L. major</italic> as well as <italic>L. infantum</italic> infectious challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Rafati2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Above mentioned protective Th1 response demonstrated in G3 that was characterized by increased titres of IgG2a in sera and elevated IFN-γ production by LN cells both before and after challenge, was further supported by the report by Brewer J M <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that lipid vesicles with a mean diameter &gt;225 nm preferentially induces Th1 responses in BALB/c mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Brewer1">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, pcDNA-<italic>cps</italic> also possesses several immunostimulatory CpG motifs within pcDNA3.1 vector backbone. These CpG motifs might also facilitate priming of CTL responses by activating DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Klinman1">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, this effect is often temporary because of the rapid degradation of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Greenland1">[15]</xref> and consequently repeated administrations or much higher doses are required to achieve the desired effects. Moreover, the pDNA delivery to the intracellular compartments for recognition by TLR-9 is hardened <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Wilson1">[29]</xref> without a delivery system, as shown for G2 and G4. Therefore, we can conclude that cSLN as a delivery systems improved the storage stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Doroud1">[17]</xref>, transfection efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Doroud1">[17]</xref> and immunostimulatory effects of pDNA-<italic>cps</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001236-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>This was possibly the result of pDNAs protection from nuclease activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, as we have previously reported this potential <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Doroud1">[17]</xref> and facilitation of pDNAs delivery to the cytoplasm because of cSLN positive zeta potential and the presence of cholesterol domains in cSLN formulation that enhances transfection efficiency by facilitating membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Doroud1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Xu1">[30]</xref>. In addition, phagocytosis of cSLN-pDNAs by APCs as well as localization of them in the draining LNs occurs easily following SC administration due to the composition and physicochemical characterization of these nanoparticles. The presence of Tween 80 in the formulation enhances this phenomenon as recently Seeballuck and co-workers have also demonstrated that, this surfactant would increase lymphatic uptake by promoting chylomicron formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Seeballuck1">[31]</xref>. Since the draining LNs contain a greater number of cells that express TLR9, localization of pDNAs in the draining LNs possibly will be an important mechanism by which cSLN formulation has enhanced the immunological activity of these antigens. Another important aspect in this formulation could be the presence of DOTAP in this cSLN formulation that can also activate the dendritic cells through a common binding partner with LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Vangasseri1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, this formulation not only act as a delivery system but also as an adjuvant for <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine by improving the uptake of loaded antigens and also stimulating immune cells in specific way.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this paper clearly demonstrates that cSLN is a promising and adaptable delivery system that can be modified rationally towards specific vaccine targets by varying composition. Simplicity, reproducibility and the scale up possibility of the manufacturing process together with the appropriate immunostimulatory effects of this formulation as a delivery system might be utilized to create a stronger protective vaccine in combination with <italic>Leishmania CPs.</italic> The current data, in murine model of <italic>L. major</italic> infection, showed promising role of cSLN as an adjuvant to enhance stronger immune response against <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. The mean average of parasite load reduction for such a cocktail pDNA vaccination was determined to be 38% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001236-Handman1">[1]</xref>. Here in this study, we report that the percent of parasite inhibition by a particulate cocktail DNA vaccination technology could be increased up to 73.36±15.95%, according to the precise methods for parasite burden determination in the different organs of the challenged animals via both conventional (i.e. microtitration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and more novel (i.e. flow cytometry, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g004">4B</xref> and imaging, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001236-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) techniques. In the entire mentioned techniques parasite burden gave a discriminative view among control groups and S<sub>p</sub>b<sup>-CTE</sup> vaccinated animals. Amongst the disscussed methods, direct LN flowcytometry was found to be the most rapid, sensitive, and easily reproducible method for screening vaccination strategies. These promising data warrant further investigations in this regard. Our future studies are being designed to expand cSLN passive targeting to an active targeting to increase the vaccination efficiency. Coating cSLN harbouring pDNA-cps with ligands (such as mannan) are our main future visions to increase the cellular immune responses.</p>
