          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The saliva of sand flies strongly enhances the infectivity of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in mice. Additionally, pre-exposure to saliva can protect mice from disease progression probably through the induction of a cellular immune response.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We analysed the cellular immune response against the saliva of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> in humans and defined the phenotypic characteristics and cytokine production pattern of specific lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Additionally, proliferation and IFN-γ production of activated cells were analysed in magnetically separated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells against the saliva of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> was demonstrated in nearly 30% of naturally exposed individuals. Salivary extracts did not induce any secretion of IFN-γ but triggered the production of IL-10 primarily by CD8+ lymphocytes. In magnetically separated lymphocytes, the saliva induced the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which was further enhanced after IL-10 blockage. Interestingly, when activated CD4+ lymphocytes were separated from CD8+ cells, they produced high amounts of IFN-γ.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Herein, we demonstrated that the overall effect of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> saliva was dominated by the activation of IL-10-producing CD8+ cells suggesting a possible detrimental effect of pre-exposure to saliva on human leishmaniasis outcome. However, the activation of Th1 lymphocytes by the saliva provides the rationale to better define the nature of the salivary antigens that could be used for vaccine development.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects millions of people worldwide and is caused by protozoa of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic>. The parasite is transmitted during sand fly bites. While probing the skin for a blood meal, vectors salivate into the host's skin. Sand fly saliva contains several components that increase hemorrhage and interfere with the host's inflammatory response. Data obtained in mice originally indicate that immunization against saliva protected from leishmaniasis supporting possibility that leishmaniasis could be prevented by a vaccine based on sand fly saliva. Herein we investigated the nature and the importance of the cellular immune response developed against sand fly saliva by individuals at risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis due to <italic>Leishmania major</italic>. We demonstrated that the immunity against saliva is dominated by the activation of lymphocytes producing a suppressive cytokine called IL-10. These data may preclude the protective effect of sand fly saliva pre-exposure in humans. Further experiments revealed that the production of IL-10 masked the presence of a second kind of lymphocytes producing IFN-γ, a rather protective cytokine. The latter finding highlights the importance of the identification of the proteins activating the latter lymphocytes in order to develop vaccines based on selected proteins from the saliva of sand flies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Leishmaniasis includes a heterogeneous group of diseases that are caused by protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic>. The disease ranges from asymptomatic infections to self-limiting cutaneous lesion(s) or fatal visceral forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Herwaldt1">[1]</xref>. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites are transmitted to the vertebrate hosts by the bite of sand flies. During parasite inoculation in the host's skin, the vector injects the saliva that contains a large number of pharmacological components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Ribeiro1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Sacks1">[4]</xref>. Several observations indicate that sand fly saliva is crucial in the establishment of leishmaniasis and disease pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Titus1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Belkaid1">[7]</xref>. The mechanism by which the vector's saliva enhances leishmania infection remains to be clarified. Sand fly saliva contains potent antihemostatic and vasodilatator compounds as well as potentially immunomodulatory molecules that can directly down-modulate macrophage effector functions and facilitate the establishment of the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Hall1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Waitumbi1">[9]</xref>. The exacerbating effects of saliva may also be related to the early release of epidermal interleukin-4 (IL-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Belkaid1">[7]</xref>. Alternatively, it could be ascribed to the development of an adaptive immune response that would favor the commitment of a Th2 immunity against <italic>Leishmania</italic>. In mice, pre-exposure to saliva completely abrogated the effects of the sand fly saliva and protected the host from disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Belkaid1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Kamhawi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Morris1">[11]</xref>. This protective effect correlated with a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and an early and increased <italic>in situ</italic> production of IFN-γ and IL-12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Kamhawi1">[10]</xref>. Further experiments demonstrated that immunization with PpSP15 (gi|15963509) from <italic>P. papatasi</italic> saliva resulted in protection which was not ascribed to a humoral immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Valenzuela1">[12]</xref>. Altogether, these data strongly supported the possibility that leishmaniasis could be prevented by vaccinating against sand fly saliva and suggest that the protective effect of the saliva might be associated with cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the data about the cellular immune responses are scarce. Herein, we analyzed the cellular immune response against the saliva of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> developed in individuals naturally exposed to sand fly bites and demonstrated that the overall effect of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> saliva was dominated by the activation of peripheral IL-10-producing CD8+ cells. Strikingly, the activation of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T lymphocytes has been revealed after neutralization of IL-10 production or depletion of CD8 lymphocytes.</p>

        <p>Cells were cultured in 96-well plates in cell culture medium at 0.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in a final volume of 200 µL and incubated with SGE (1gland/mL) or SLA (10 µg/mL) with or without anti-IL-10 or isotype control in a 5%CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere at 37°C. The optimum condition for PBMC proliferation against SGE was determined in our laboratory in preliminary experiments. We thus stimulated cells with different concentrations of salivary gland extracts (0.25 gland/mL, 0.5 gland/mL, 1 gland/mL and 2 gland/mL) for 3, 4 and 5 days and the optimal results (highest index of proliferation corresponding to the ratio of cpm in stimulated condition / unstimulated one) were obtained with 1 gland/mL during five days. For proliferation studies, the uptake of (<sup>3</sup>H) thymidine (Amersham, Saclay, France) was measured 18 hours after adding 0.4 µCi/well. Cells were harvested and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter (Rack Beta; LKB Wallace). Results were expressed as a proliferation index: mean counts of triplicates in antigen-stimulated cultures /mean counts of triplicates in unstimulated cultures.</p>

The optimum condition for the proliferation test has been determined previously (namely, stimulation with 1 gland/ml of SGE during five days of culture) <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001345.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</bold> We designated as positive SGE proliferation the cases exhibiting an index of PBMC proliferation against the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> above 2. We thus demonstrated that 11 out of 36 donors exhibited positive SGE proliferation <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.

The percentage of individuals with positive SGE proliferation was higher in the group of donors living in endemic area of leishmaniasis than in donors living in northern parts of Tunisia (9 out of 26 donors versus 2 out of 10 donors). The difference was, however, not significant <bold>(p&gt;0.05).</bold></p>

            <p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 36 volunteer donors; 10 donors (B1 to B10) were from a non endemic region for ZCL and 26 individuals (B11 to B36) were from endemic areas. PBMC (0.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were stimulated in 96-well plates with salivary gland extracts at one gland/ml during five days. Proliferative responses were assessed by (<sup>3</sup>H) thymidine uptake. Results were expressed as an index of proliferation (mean counts of triplicates in antigen-stimulated cultures /mean counts of triplicates in unstimulated cultures) in all tested individuals. We designated as positive SGE proliferation the cases exhibiting an index of PBMC proliferation above 2. The indices of proliferation obtained in such donors were relatively low with a median of 3.2 but significantly higher than those obtained in donors with negative SGE responses (p&lt;0.0001).</p>

        <p>To better define the features of the cellular population activated by the salivary gland extract, we focused our study on five representative donors (identified as B2, B6, B11, B12 and B20) from the group of donors showing proliferative response against SGE.

        <p>The detection of specific CD8+ T cells was rather unexpected. The induction of granzyme B was assessed after SGE stimulation to determine whether these cells displayed cytotoxic functions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>, granzyme B was detected in almost 11% of unstimulated CD8+ T lymphocytes. The percentage of granzyme-B-producing-CD8+ cells did not increase after SGE stimulation (median percentage of 7.62% in stimulated versus 7.15% in unstimulated cells, p&gt;0.05). This suggests that SGE did not activate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. By contrast, the percentage of IL-4-producing CD8+ T lymphocytes increased after SGE stimulation from a mean percentage of 2.03% to 4.87% further supporting that activated CD8+ T cells are Th2 cells <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref><bold> and not shown)</bold>.

        <p>To better define the subsets of T cells that were activated by the saliva of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic>, the same experiments were subsequently performed on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes magnetically separated from PBMC of donors that exhibited proliferative responses to SGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>, SGE induces the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Blocking the production of IL-10 significantly enhanced the proliferation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. This suggests that the activated CD8+ T cells produce high amounts of IL-10 inhibiting subsequently their own proliferation. By contrast, SGE induced a considerable proliferation of CD4+ T cells that was only slightly enhanced after IL-10 blockage <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. SGE did not induce any IFN-γ production by CD8+ T lymphocytes confirming that the specific CD8+ T lymphocytes were not Th1 cells <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. However, when the PBMC was depleted from CD8+ T cells and stimulated with SGE, they produced a high amount of IFN-γ and this was further increased when IL-10 was neutralized <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Intracytoplasmic analyses performed in donors B2, B6, B11, B12 and B20 confirmed that the neutralization of IL-10 as well as the depletion of CD8+ cells induces the production of IFN-γ by stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref><bold> and not shown)</bold>. The percentage of IFN-γ-producing cells within the stimulated-CD4 T cells varied from 0.93% to 1.54% when IL-10 was blocked and from 0.89% to 1.81% after CD8-depletion. Furthermore, the mean of fluorescence of IFN-γ staining of the activated-CD4 T cells increased after IL-10 blockage or CD8-depletion <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001345-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref><bold> and not shown)</bold>. For instance, in CD4 T cells from CD8-depleted PBMC, the mean fluorescence of IFN-γ staining increased from 21.4 to 34.7 after IL-10 blockage. Altogether, these results demonstrate that SGE induces the activation of CD8+ T cells of Th2 phenotype as well as Th1-polarized CD4+ T lymphocytes that are probably suppressed by IL-10- producing CD8+ T cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous studies in mice suggested that salivary components can be used to design vaccines able to control <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection and stressed the role of cellular immunity as correlate for protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Kamhawi1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Valenzuela1">[12]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Oliveira1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Gomes1">[17]</xref>. In humans, few data have been obtained on cellular immunity against sand fly saliva in volunteers experimentally exposed to the bites of uninfected <italic>P. papatasi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Belkaid2">[18]</xref> or <italic>Lutzomyia longipalpis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Vinhas1">[19]</xref>. In the present study, we analyzed the cellular immunity developed by naturally exposed individuals against <italic>P. papatasi</italic> sand fly saliva and demonstrated that salivary gland extract from uninfected sand flies induces the activation of IL-10 and IL-4-producing CD8+ T cells as well as IFN-γ-secreting CD4+ T lymphocytes.</p>
      <p>Since there is no standard for the identification of individuals immunized against the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic>, our strategy consisted of studying individuals who have high risk of contact with the vector of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. The studied population comprised individuals living in an endemic area of <italic>L. major</italic> transmission in Tunisia and thus at risk of being exposed to sand fly bites. We also included individuals who live in non endemic areas of cutaneaous leishmaniasis as the presence of <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> has also been reported in these areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Chelbi1">[13]</xref>. We first assessed the proliferation and cytokine secretion of PBMC after stimulation with salivary gland extracts. A specific proliferative response of PMBC was evident in nearly 30% of donors. A similar percentage (24%) has been recently confirmed in a large number (n = 425) of individuals naturally exposed to sand fly bites (Kammoun et al. in preparation). Interestingly, the proliferative response was more frequently observed in individuals with a cellular immunity against <italic>Leishmania</italic>, a result that might reflect a more frequent exposure to sand fly bites in endemic areas. The positive cellular response against SGE was also reported in two out of the ten volunteers living in Tunis, corroborating the data reporting the presence of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> in the northern parts of Tunisia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Chelbi1">[13]</xref>. Except for the donor B7 who has been accidentally exposed to <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens while manipulating parasites in the laboratory, 15 individuals exhibit positive proliferation against SLA but did not develop any cellular response to SGE. Such donors, however, developed specific antibodies against saliva as demonstrated by ELISA and/or Western blot analysis <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001345-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref><bold>),</bold> thus indicating a previous contact with the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic>. For such donors, it seems that there was no correlation between the antibody and the cellular response. To our knowledge, the proliferative immune response toward the saliva of sand flies was not previously described in the literature although several works reported the presence of specific antibodies in people naturally exposed to sand fly bites. One possible explanation is the dominance of IL-10 production in response to the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic>. This IL-10 will inhibit both proliferation and IFN-γ production of CD4 T cells. Furthermore, humans are outbred and therefore very diverse in term of pattern of immune response.</p>
      <p>In contrast with results showing an increased production of IFN-γ at the inoculation site in mice sensitized with <italic>P. papatasi</italic> salivary proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Kamhawi1">[10]</xref>, our data did not detect any IFN-γ production by stimulated PBMC at all tested time-points. Noticeably, monitoring cytokine production by PBMC either on supernatant cell culture or using intra-cytoplasmic analysis revealed an increased synthesis of IL-10. The induction of IL-10 by sand fly saliva was previously reported in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Norsworthy1">[20]</xref>. The production of IL-10, particularly by innate effectors such as macrophages, may explain the enhancing effect of the saliva on leishmania infectivity. Accordingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have demonstrated that the saliva from either <italic>P. papatasi</italic> or <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> exhibit immunosuppresive effects on macrophages and reduce the nitric oxid production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Hall1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Waitumbi1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Costa1">[21]</xref>. The latter effect was ascribed to adenosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Katz1">[22]</xref>, an immunomodulatory component of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> saliva known to induce IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Hasko1">[23]</xref>. In humans, however, little is known about the cytokine pattern activated by sand fly saliva. While the saliva of <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> can activate both IFN-γ and IL-10 synthesis in stimulated PBMC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Vinhas1">[19]</xref>, the salivary gland lysates from <italic>P. papatasi</italic> inhibit the production of IFN-γ from <italic>L. major</italic>-stimulated PBMC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Rogers1">[24]</xref>, an effect which may be ascribed to IL-10. Interestingly, in our study, blocking IL-10 enhanced the proliferation of stimulated PBMC suggesting that IL-10 production may explain the relatively low rate of PBMC proliferation and perhaps the difficulty of detecting a proliferative response against SGE either in humans or in mice (unpublished data). Accordingly, Rohousova et al. reported an inhibitory effect of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> saliva on lymphocyte proliferation in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Rohousova1">[25]</xref>. Yet, despite the fact that IL-10 suppresses the proliferation of PBMC, we demonstrated that the production of IL-10 was mainly detected in the cells, which proliferated in response to SGE. Such paradoxical data could be easily explained. In fact, the induction of IL-10 by SGE could be illustrated only in patients who were previously exposed to <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> bites and so exhibiting proliferative responses to SGE. Interestingly, in one donor who exhibited a moderate production of IL-10 by stimulated PBMC, the cell proliferation was demonstrated only when the effect of IL-10 was blocked. In a current prospective work studying the cellular immune response of four hundred donors living in endemic areas of leishmaniasis in Tunisia, similar results were obtained and in approximately 10% of donors, the proliferative response of SGE-stimulated PBMC was revealed after IL-10 neutralization (Kammoun et al. manuscript in preparation). Interestingly, the five donors included in our study to define the phenotype of activated cells by SGE have been chosen as they covered the different range of proliferation against saliva and were demographic matched to the remaining donors of the cohort. Among them, four were in contact with <italic>Leishmania</italic> while one was not. The cellular immune response against the saliva was comparably dominated by IL-10 production whatever the donor has been in contact with the parasite or not. Indeed, the level of IL-10 in the supernatant of SGE stimulated PBMC was similar in the 5 donors <bold>(data not shown)</bold>. Although SLA and SGE do not activate the same effector cells, some experiments in which PBMC were co-stimulated with both antigens were performed. Adding SLA did not change the pattern of immune response against SGE that remained dominated by IL-10 <bold>(data not shown)</bold>.</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, our analysis of the activated cells revealed that CD8+ T lymphocytes were a major source of IL-10 synthesis. Detection of T CD8+ specific T cells was rather unexpected and the analysis of IL-4 expression confirmed the Th2 phenotype of these cells. This is the first account in which SGE-specific CD8+ T cells of Th2 phenotype were reported in humans. In mice, Mbow et al. reported a direct enhancing effect of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> saliva on IL-4 expression in the absence of <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Mbow1">[26]</xref>. Another study revealed large numbers of IL-10 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in draining lymph node of mice injected with SGE. However, since SGE was co-injected with the parasite, the direct effect of the saliva remains uncertain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Norsworthy1">[20]</xref>. In donors with positive proliferation against SGE, a significant percentage of CD3 negative cells (detected on the lymphocyte gate) also produced IL-10 when stimulated with SGE. Preliminary experiments using CD14 and CD16 staining suggest that these cells were not monocytes or NK cells. B lymphocytes could be a possible cellular source of IL-10. Analysis of such hypothesis is under progress as it could bring new insights consistent with the recent literature showing the role of regulatory B lymphocytes in autoimmunity and infectious diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Mauri1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Fujimoto1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Compelling data suggest that the protective effect of pre-exposure to saliva in mice results from the skewing of the anti-leishmania immunity towards a Th1 protective response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Kamhawi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Valenzuela1">[12]</xref>. Strikingly, our experiments showed that in donors exhibiting proliferative response against SGE, the presence of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T lymphocytes could be revealed after neutralization of IL-10 production or depletion of CD8 lymphocytes. This indicates that the overall effect of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> saliva, which is dominated by the production of IL-10, may inhibit the activation of the specific Th1 cells. One may thus expect that the recall of IL-10-producing T lymphocytes in individuals previously sensitized with sand fly saliva would lead to the commitment of the immunity to <italic>Leishmania</italic> towards a Th2 response. This would be consistent with the lack of a protective effect of the pre-exposure to sand fly saliva in humans. Accordingly, epidemiological data indicate that the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Old World is high in endemic areas despite the common occurrence of bites from uninfected sand flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Rohousova2">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that the presence of antibodies against the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> in individuals living in endemic areas of ZCL in Tunisia was associated with an increased risk of disease [H. Louzir, personal communication, 15]. In the current prospective work mentioned above, monitoring either the cellular and humoral immune response against sand fly saliva in people living in endemic areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis throughout several transmission seasons could provide some clues regarding the effect of such immunity on the natural history of leishmaniasis. Strikingly, the effect of pre-exposure to saliva on the outcome of leishmaniasis in humans may differ from the reported effect in mice. Even in mice, conflicting results were obtained when the saliva of other species of sand flies was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-deMoura1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, a recent report from Rohousova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Rohouov1">[31]</xref> gave an attractive explanation to the conflicting data between the possible non-protective role of sand fly bites suggested by observations from the field and the experimental data on mice. Indeed, the authors showed that the protective effect of pre-exposition to <italic>Phlebotomus duboscqi</italic> bites was limited to short-term exposure while a long-term exposure regimen to saliva, a scheme close to what occur in naturally exposed individuals to sand fly bites, was not protective. The authors hypothesized that an immunization with a large antigen load tends to skew the immune system towards a Th2 response, which could not be associated with protection.</p>
      <p>Saliva is composed of a large broad of proteins. Variations in the protein composition and antigenicity of the saliva from different sand fly species may account for the conflicting results obtained from different studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Volf1">[32]</xref>. Genetic differences between hosts may also underlie the disparity of the immune responses elicited by salivary proteins from the same sand fly species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Gomes1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-WardCollin1">[33]</xref> and may perhaps explain the putative differential effects of the <italic>P. papatasi</italic> saliva between humans and mice. Additionally, the sand fly saliva may elicit a response that differs from that elicited by its separate proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Oliveira1">[16]</xref>. For instance, distinct pattern of immune response could be induced by different salivary proteins from <italic>P. papatasi</italic> resulting in contrasting outcomes of <italic>L. major</italic> infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Oliveira1">[16]</xref>. PpSP15 had a protective effect, which correlated with a Th1 anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> immune response whereas PpSP44 (gi|15963519) exacerbated the disease. Our data indicate that the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> can stimulate human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with contrasting cytokine profiles thereby suggesting the implication of different salivary components in the activation of these populations. Defining these salivary proteins would be crucial to predict their specific effects on the outcome of leishmaniasis and to determine potential vaccine candidates.</p>
      <p>Salivary antigens that are introduced in the host skin are drained to the lymph node where the immune response is triggered after activation of circulating lymphocytes. Reactivation of an acquired immunity against the saliva may lead to protection or exacerbation of <italic>L. major</italic> infection by skewing the immunity against the concomitantly inoculated <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens to a Th1 or Th2 pattern, respectively. Several data obtained in mice suggested that the immunity against sand fly saliva might also act on <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection by creating an inhospitable <italic>in situ</italic> environment for the establishment of parasites. Hence, it would be critical to characterize the nature and phenotype of cells that are recruited <italic>in situ</italic> following exposure to bites of uninfected sand flies.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first account that describes the different features of the adaptive cellular immunity against the sand fly saliva in humans. When tested in the whole PBMC, salivary gland extracts from <italic>P. papatasi</italic> induced a low rate of proliferation, which contrasted with significant levels of IL-10 and the absence of IFN-γ. Preliminary results suggest that the CD8+ T cells activated by the saliva of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> could be γδ T lymphocytes and that the target components might be adenylated antigens as recently described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-Vantourout1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001345-MookerjeeBasu1">[35]</xref>. These data need however further confirmation. Whatever the target salivary component triggering the activation of IL-10 producing cells, this pattern of immune response may favor the <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection and facilitate the multiplication of the parasite co-injected with the saliva. Our data also demonstrated the activation of specific IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells that was revealed after the separation of T cell subsets. This is of great interest as it provides a new rationale for immunological approaches targeting the salivary components activating a Th1 response that could be useful for vaccination against leishmaniasis.</p>
