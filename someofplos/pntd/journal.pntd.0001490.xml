        <p>Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi (<italic>S.</italic> Typhi) and is a major health problem especially in developing countries. Vaccines against typhoid are commonly used by travelers but less so by residents of endemic areas. We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing to investigate the population structure of 372 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi bacteria isolated from typhoid patients during a typhoid disease burden study and Vi anti-typhoid vaccine trial in Kolkata, India. Approximately sixty thousand people were enrolled for fever surveillance for 19 months prior to, and 24 months following, vaccination of one third of the study population against typhoid (May 2003–December 2006, vaccinations given December 2004). We detected a diverse population of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi, including 21 different genetic forms (haplotypes) of the bacteria. The most common (69%) were of a haplogroup known as H58, which included all multidrug resistant isolates (bacteria resistant to the antibiotics chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole). Resistance to quinolones, a class of antibiotics commonly used to treat typhoid fever, was particularly high among a subgroup of H58 (H58-G). Vi vaccination did not obviously impact on the haplotype distribution of the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi circulating during the study period.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Salmonella <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhi (<italic>S.</italic> Typhi) is the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever, which affects more than 20 million people each year, resulting in over 200,000 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Crump1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Ochiai1">[2]</xref>. As <italic>S.</italic> Typhi is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, the typhoid fever burden falls almost exclusively in developing areas where sanitation is poor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Crump1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kothari1">[3]</xref>. The current mainstay of typhoid fever treatment is antimicrobial therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Parry1">[4]</xref>, however resistance to antimicrobials is common among <italic>S.</italic> Typhi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Chau1">[5]</xref>, leading to prolonged bacterial clearance times and treatment failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Crump2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Wain1">[7]</xref>. Children and young adults are the most vulnerable population for developing typhoid fever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Crump1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Karkey1">[9]</xref> and can be protected by vaccination against <italic>S.</italic> Typhi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Fraser1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>. However while vaccines against <italic>S.</italic> Typhi are frequently used by travelers to typhoid endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Whitaker1">[12]</xref>, they are yet to be effectively harnessed for the protection of local, typhoid endemic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-DeRoeck1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>S.</italic> Typhi is a highly clonal bacterium estimated to have entered the human population on a single occasion approximately 50,000 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kidgell1">[14]</xref>. We have recently identified hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi chromosome that are suitable for rapidly and informatively subtyping <italic>S.</italic> Typhi populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Roumagnac1">[16]</xref>. As recombination is rare in <italic>S.</italic> Typhi, SNP typing allows individual <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolates to be assigned unequivocally to unique haplotypes. Importantly, as haplotypes are defined by phylogenetically informative sequence variation, SNP typing also reveals information about genome sequence and the evolutionary relationship between isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Roumagnac1">[16]</xref>. As our SNP panel is designed to allow inference of phylogenetic relationships, it does not target SNPs that are likely to be under selection, such as drug resistance loci. SNP haplotyping studies in localized areas where typhoid is endemic, including Jakarta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Baker1">[17]</xref>, Kathmandu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Baker2">[19]</xref>, the Mekong Delta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt3">[20]</xref> and Nairobi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref>, have revealed that the typhoid burden in endemic areas is usually attributable to a diverse population of differentiable <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes, co-circulating within the local human population. These studies also revealed the clonal expansion of a <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplogroup, H58, in South East Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Roumagnac1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt3">[20]</xref>, as well as in Nairobi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During 2003–2004, a typhoid burden study was conducted in a typhoid endemic area of Kolkata, India <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Dutta1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Dutta2">[23]</xref>. This was followed by a large-scale, cluster-randomized phase IV trial to determine the efficacy of the injectable Vi polysaccharide vaccine (Typherix, GlaxoSmithKline) among the local population (&gt;60,000 persons). The study site was divided into 80 geographic clusters (40 clusters each randomly assigned to Vi vaccine or inactivated hepatitis A vaccine as a control) and in December 2004, eligible residents were vaccinated (mean 60% of the population vaccinated in each cluster) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>. The primary results of the trial, namely 61% efficacy among vaccinees and indirect protection within and around Vi vaccinated geographic clusters, have been published elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Ali1">[24]</xref>. Surveillance for fever was conducted uninterrupted throughout May 2003–December 2006, and typhoid fever was confirmed by positive blood culture of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Dutta1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Dutta2">[23]</xref>. A total of 372 typhoid cases were confirmed by blood culture during the study period, including 197 during the post-vaccination period. All <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolates produced Vi during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>, however Vi expression is tightly regulated in <italic>S.</italic> Typhi growing on laboratory media and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Janis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Tran1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Santander1">[27]</xref> and we consequently hypothesised that selection against Vi expression in Vi immunized individuals might result in differential efficacy of Vi vaccine against different <italic>S.</italic> Typhi phylogenetic lineages. Here we present an analysis of the 372 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolates collected during the study period, including SNP haplotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility profiling, analysis of intra-household transmission and determination of Vi vaccine efficacy for the most common circulating haplotypes.</p>

The institutional review boards at the International Vaccine Institute, the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, and the Indian Council of Medical Research approved the protocol and monitored the progress of the studies. All subjects provided written informed consent for vaccination and oral informed consent for blood culture (for children, informed consent was provided by their guardian). The assayed isolates represent all confirmed typhoid cases during the study period May 2003 to December 2006, among subjects who were present in the field area at baseline, including 10 cases in non-vaccinees that were not included in the original vaccine report due to incomplete demographic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>.

The former was performed using a GoldenGate custom array according to the manufacturer's standard protocols (Illumina, USA), covering 1,500 loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001490.s001">Table S1</xref>) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref>. Briefly, DNA samples were arrayed in a 96-well plate along with a negative control (water) and positive control (sequenced Typhi), assayed using two custom oligo pools (200 SNPs included on both arrays for quality control) using the Illumina GoldenGate platform and analyzed using Illuminus-P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref>. Sequenom assays of 100 loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001490.s001">Table S1</xref>) were performed using the iPLEX Gold assay (Sequenom Inc, USA), designed using the MassARRAY Assay Design software version 3.1 (Sequenom Inc, USA) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Baker2">[19]</xref>. Samples were amplified in multiplexed PCR reactions before allele specific extension. Allelic discrimination was obtained by analysis with a MassARRAY Analyzer Compact mass spectrometer. Genotypes were automatically assigned and manually confirmed using MassArray TyperAnalyzer software version 4.0 (Sequenom Inc, USA).</p>

        <title>Temporal patterns and the effect of vaccination on the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi population</title>
        <p>The incidence of typhoid fever remained high throughout the four-year study period, with a median of seven cases per month and no clear seasonal pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A total of 168 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi were isolated during May 2003–November 2004 (19 month pre-vaccination period), 7 during December 2004 (vaccination period) and 197 during January 2005–December 2006 (24 month post-vaccination period). The same haplotypes dominated throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g002">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the burden of typhoid fever in Kolkata was the result of a diverse range of co-circulating haplotypes. One exception to this pattern was a peak in typhoid cases in November 2005 involving 27 infections, of which 21 were <italic>S.</italic> Typhi H58-B consistent with a small outbreak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g002">Figure 2</xref>), although no spatial clustering was evident. Only 2 of the 21 H58-B cases in this month occurred in clusters assigned to Vi vaccine, suggesting the vaccine was effective in providing protection during the outbreak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>As previously reported, the incidence of typhoid fever during the two years following vaccination was &gt;60% lower among individuals who received the Vi typhoid vaccine than those who received hepatitis A vaccine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Sur2">[11]</xref>. Our haplotype data indicates this overall reduction was due to a statistically significant reduction in isolation rate across all <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes (H58, H42 and others, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t001">Table 1</xref>). All <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolated during the study, including those from individuals who had been vaccinated with Vi (‘breakthrough cases’), reacted strongly with commercially available Vi antisera (BD diagnostics, USA) in an agglutination test, indicating that all strains could express the vaccine target Vi. The 34 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolates from breakthrough cases belonged to several distinct SNP haplotypes and were also diverse in terms of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes from households with multiple typhoid infections</title>
        <p>There were 22 households from which multiple <italic>S.</italic> Typhi were isolated by blood culture (21 households with 2 positive cultures; 1 household with 3 positive cultures, total 45 positive cultures; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t004">Table 4</xref>). For three of these households, the paired isolates resulted from two blood cultures from the same individual, taken 3–5 weeks apart and thus representing possible cases of relapse or re-infection. Each of these isolate pairs displayed identical <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes and resistance phenotypes, consistent with relapse as opposed to re-infection with a distinct haplotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t004">Table 4</xref>). However different <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes were involved in each pair of these relapse cases, and displayed different antimicrobial resistance profiles (H14, Nal<sup>R</sup>; H58-G, MDR; H64, Nal<sup>R</sup>+MDR).</p>

        <p>In the remaining 19 households with multiple cases, <italic>S.</italic> Typhi was isolated from different individuals, thus representing distinct typhoid cases within the same household. Among these, twelve households had more than one typhoid case occurring within two months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t004">Table 4</xref>). In nearly all of these households, the same <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotype (displaying same resistance phenotype) was isolated from both cases, consistent with direct transmission between household members or a shared environmental source such as food or water (10/12 households, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t004">Table 4</xref>, p = 0.039 using Binomial test with equal probability of same or different haplotypes). Among households in which a second typhoid case occurred more than two months after the first, the later infection was most often caused by a distinct <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotype (5/7 households, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t004">Table 4</xref>). To examine whether Vi vaccination reduced intra-household transmission, we compared the proportion of cases for which apparent transmission was observed in the same household (defined as the same <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotype isolated from another member of the household one week to two months after the initial case), among Hepatitis A and Vi clusters in the post-vaccination period. While it is possible that two typhoid cases caused by the same haplotype in the same household could result from shared exposure to a common source of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi, it is more likely that infections separated by more than a week constitute transmission events. Using this definition of household transmission, six percent (8/135) of cases in the Hepatitis A cluster were linked to putative transmission within a household, while none of the 59 cases in the Vi cluster were obviously linked to transmission. While the numbers are low, this provides weak evidence for protection against person-to-person or direct transmission by the Vi vaccine (p = 0.045 using Fisher's exact test), which may be via direct protection of vaccinated individuals and/or indirect protection via herd immunity in clusters assigned to the Vi vaccine. The distribution of haplotypes among these likely transmission events was no different to that of haplotypes among all Hepatitis A clusters during the post-vaccination period (5 cases, 8% for H58-B; 1 case, 6% for H580-G; 1 case, 4% for H42; p = 1 using Fisher's exact test). Thus there is no evidence that any particular haplotype is more likely to be transmitted person-to-person.</p>

        <title><italic>S.</italic> Typhi populations in Kolkata and other typhoid endemic areas</title>
        <p>SNP typing of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolated during 2003–2006 revealed a diverse range of haplotypes co-circulating in the study site, an urban slum area in eastern Kolkata. A similar level of diversity has been observed in previous studies in typhoid endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Baker1">[17]</xref>, . The dominant <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes were subtypes of H58, collectively accounting for 70% of all <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolated during the four-year study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The dominance of H58 has been reported in recent studies of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi infections in other typhoid endemic areas including Kathmandu, Nepal (69% H58, 2003–2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt2">[18]</xref>, the Mekong Delta, Vietnam (98% H58, 2004–2005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt3">[20]</xref> and Nairobi, Kenya (87% H58, 2001–2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref>. However there does appear to be greater diversity within the H58 group in Kolkata. We identified 11 distinct H58 haplotypes, including four with high frequency among <italic>S.</italic> Typhi from Kolkata (18–150 isolates each) including the ancestral node (A) and nodes from both major lineages of H58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In neighbouring Nepal, two hospital-based studies of S. Typhi found 61–69% of isolates belonged to a single subtype of H58 lineage II, H58-G, and few other H58 isolates were detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Baker2">[19]</xref>. In the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, a large hospital-based study found 95% of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolated from adults and children with typhoid fever belonged to one of three closely related H58 lineage I subtypes, H58-C, -E1 and -E2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt3">[20]</xref>. In that study, differentiation of the three subtypes was possible because the genome of an isolate from the study had been sequenced for the purpose of SNP discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt1">[15]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Diversification and differentiation within <italic>S.</italic> Typhi H58</title>
        <p>The H58 subtypes that were common in the present study in Kolkata are internal nodes of the H58 phylogenetic tree described by the assayed SNPs (A, B, G, H64, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is not particularly surprising, since SNP discovery for our assays did not include analysis of any Kolkata strains, with the exception of two isolates of the H64 haplotype (actually part of the H58 group, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g001">Figure 1</xref>) which were included in mutation detection within 200 gene fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Roumagnac1">[16]</xref> but not at a genome-wide scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt1">[15]</xref>. Since SNPs accumulate locally over time as bacteria replicate, we would expect that there is more diversity in the Kolkata <italic>S.</italic> Typhi population than we are able to detect in our SNP assays (i.e. mutations have occurred locally at genomic positions that we did not assay). If more Kolkata isolates had been included in SNP discovery, we would be able to differentiate among Kolkata isolates at higher resolution. This is known as SNP ascertainment bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Pearson1">[32]</xref>, and implies that diversity which has accumulated in the local <italic>S.</italic> Typhi H58 population of Kolkata in the last decade or so is being collapsed into just a few haplotypes using our SNP typing method. Despite this, the fact that both major H58 lineages and the ancestral node were detected at high frequency in Kolkata indicates that H58 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi has been present in this location for some decades. This is similar to the pattern observed in Kenya where both H58 lineages have been observed at high frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref>, but quite unlike Vietnam or Nepal where lineage I or II dominated, respectively.</p>

        <title>Antimicrobial resistance</title>
        <p>In this study, as in others, antimicrobial resistance was frequent among H58 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi. All MDR isolates were from the H58 group, similar to recent observations in Vietnam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt3">[20]</xref>, Kenya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Kariuki1">[21]</xref> and global collections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001490-Holt4">[33]</xref>. Nal resistance was frequent among all H58 subtypes except H58-B (25% of H58-B; 95% of all other H58, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t002">Table 2</xref>), although it was also frequent among common non-H58 haplotypes H42 (46%) and H14 (76%). Interestingly, <italic>S.</italic> Typhi H42 was also common in the Nepal study (19% of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi), yet Nal resistance in that location was observed only among H58-G isolates. Taken together, these observations suggest that while MDR is now largely restricted to H58 <italic>S.</italic> Typhi, Nal resistance arises frequently in <italic>S.</italic> Typhi of a diverse range of haplotypes.</p>

        <title>Household clustering of typhoid</title>
        <p>Several households experienced more than one typhoid infection during the study. Among multiple cases occurring in the same household within a 2-month period, nearly all (10/12) were caused by identical infecting <italic>S.</italic> Typhi haplotypes, consistent with intra-household transmission or a common source (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t004">Table 4</xref>). In the post-vaccination period, eight such putative transmission events were detected in control clusters (assigned to Hepatitis A vaccine) and none were observed in Vi vaccine clusters, possibly reflecting protection via vaccination and/or herd immunity in these clusters. Three cases of relapse were identified (two infections with the same haplotype in a single individual). Although each pair of relapse isolates had an identical haplotype the haplotype was different in each individual, although all exhibited some form of antimicrobial resistance (Nal<sup>R</sup> and/or MDR), suggesting that relapse may be associated with antimicrobial failure.</p>

        <title>Impact of the Vi vaccine</title>
        <p>In addition to providing a snapshot of the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi population circulating in a localized region of Kolkata, this study offers the first insight into the impact of the introduction of Vi typhoid vaccine upon a local <italic>S.</italic> Typhi population. Our data indicate the incidence of all haplotypes of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi was similarly reduced among Vi vaccinated individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001490-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolated from Vi vaccinated individuals included several distinct haplotypes, which could be further differentiated by antimicrobial resistance phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001490-t003">Table 3</xref>). All <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolates expressed Vi during laboratory culture. Thus, it is likely that ‘breakthrough’ cases of typhoid fever among vaccinees is due to subtle variations in the regulation of Vi expression <italic>in vivo</italic> and/or to host factors, and not to lineage-associated differences in Vi expression.</p>

        <p>The <italic>S.</italic> Typhi population responsible for typhoid fever in Kolkata is genetically and phenotypically diverse, displaying a wide range of haplotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes.
