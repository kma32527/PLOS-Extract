        <p>The large extracellular loop of the <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> tetraspanin, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, when fused to a thioredoxin partner and formulated with Freund's adjuvants, has been shown to be an efficacious vaccine against murine schistosomiasis. Moreover, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 is uniquely recognised by IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>3</sub> from putatively resistant individuals resident in <italic>S. mansoni</italic> endemic areas in Brazil. In the present study, we expressed <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 at high yield and in soluble form in <italic>E. coli</italic> without the need for a solubility enhancing fusion partner. We also expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> a chimera called <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B, which consisted of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 fused to the immunogenic 5B region of the hookworm aspartic protease and vaccine antigen, <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1. <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 formulated with alum/CpG showed significant reductions in adult worm and liver egg burdens in two separate murine schistosomiasis challenge studies. <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B afforded significantly greater protection than <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 alone when both antigens were formulated with alum/CpG. The enhanced protection obtained with the chimeric fusion protein was associated with increased production of anti-<italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 antibodies and IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ from spleen cells of vaccinated animals. Sera from 666 individuals from Brazil who were infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> were screened for potentially deleterious IgE responses to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2. Anti-Sm-TSP-2 IgE to this protein was not detected (also shown previously for <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1), suggesting that the chimeric antigen <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B could be used to safely and effectively vaccinate people in areas where schistosomes and hookworms are endemic.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>There are currently no vaccines available to combat helminth (worm) infections in humans. The most devastating of the diseases caused by human helminths are schistosomiasis (or bilharzia) and hookworm disease. By fusing one of the lead schistosomiasis vaccine antigens, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, with a protective fragment from one of the lead hookworm vaccine antigens, <italic>Na-</italic>APR-1, we have produced a chimeric vaccine, termed <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2/5B that might provide protection against two debilitating and co-endemic neglected tropical diseases. <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B provided increased protection compared to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 alone when formulated with human approved adjuvants and tested in a mouse model of schistosomiasis. Moreover, IgE against <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 or <italic>Na-</italic>APR-1 has not been detected in the blood of residents from an area in Brazil that is endemic for schistosomes and hookworms, indicating that vaccines based on these molecules would be unlikely to generate allergic reactions in recipients from developing countries.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Schistosomiasis ranks among the most important infectious diseases in tropical regions, resulting in a loss of between 4.5 and 92 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) annually and almost 300,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hotez1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-King1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-vanderWerf1">[3]</xref>. High rates of post-treatment reinfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hotez1">[1]</xref>, the inability of periodic chemotherapy to interrupt transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-King2">[4]</xref>, the exclusive reliance on praziquantel as the only chemotherapeutic option <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Bergquist1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-McManus1">[6]</xref> and the unsustainability of mass drug administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Clements1">[7]</xref> has led to the development of new anti-schistosomiasis control measures, inlcuding vaccines, to complement existing initiatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Bergquist1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Bergquist2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Gray1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Molecules lodged in the apical membrane of the schistosome tegument represent vulnerable targets for immunological attack by host antibodies due to their intimate association with the host immune system. One such family of molecules – predicted by proteomic analyses of the schistosome tegument to be accessible to host immunoglobulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Braschi1">[10]</xref> – is the tetraspanin integral membrane proteins. Tetraspanins contain four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops that are predicted to interact with exogenous ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Loukas1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref>. Indeed, the second extracellular loop of one of these schistosome tetraspanins, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, has proven to be an effective anti-schistosomiasis vaccine, eliciting 57–64% protection in mice vaccinated with the antigen followed by challenge with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref>. Other schistosome tetraspanins are protective in mouse models of schistosomiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Braschi1">[10]</xref>, including <italic>Sm</italic>23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Dadara1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Dadara2">[14]</xref> and <italic>Sj-</italic>TSP-2, an <italic>S. japonicum</italic> orthologue of <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Yuan1">[15]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 was strongly recognised by IgG1 and IgG3 from putatively resistant but not from chronically infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref>, further highlighting the promise of this antigen as a subunit vaccine against human schistosomiasis.</p>
      <p>The tegument of adult and schistosomula of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is thinner and distinctly more vacuolated compared to controls after <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with <italic>Sm-tsp-2</italic> double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran2">[16]</xref>. Moreover, injection of mice with schistosomula pre-treated with <italic>Sm-tsp-2</italic> dsRNA resulted in the recovery of 83% fewer parasites from the mesenteries compared to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran2">[16]</xref>, highlighting the importance of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 in proper tegument development and worm survival, and providing a potential mechanism by which the vaccine exerts its protective effect.</p>
      <p>In an earlier study, we reported the production of a chimeric form of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, consisting of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 fused to the immunodominant and neutralizing 5B region of the hookworm aspartic protease <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1, termed <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Pearson1">[17]</xref>. Hookworm infection and schistosomiasis caused by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> are co-endemic in much of sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil, and there is potential interest in developing a vaccine that targets both of these high prevalence and high disease burden helminths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hotez2">[18]</xref>. <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1/5B is a 40 amino acid fragment of the protease that contains an immunodominant alpha helix, A<sub>291</sub>Y, which is the target epitope recognized by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that are capable of neutralizing the catalytic activity of <italic>Na-</italic>APR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Pearson1">[17]</xref>. <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1/5B could not be produced in soluble form, but when fused to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, it was produced in soluble form by <italic>E. coli</italic> and induced antibodies upon vaccination that neutralized the enzymatic activity of <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1; the chimera is currently under investigation as a hookworm vaccine. Using a mouse model of schistosomiasis, we explored the efficacy of the <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B chimera in comparison to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 alone when both antigens are formulated with alum/CpG. Given the recent safety concerns of helminth vaccines that elicit an IgE response in individuals residing in an endemic area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Diemert1">[19]</xref>, we also assessed the recognition of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B by IgE from individuals chronically infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, a crucial step in determining whether or not this antigen could be used to safely and effectively vaccinate people in areas endemic for both hookworms and schistosomes.</p>

Women who were evidently pregnant, or who tested positive on a urine pregnancy test received treatment for all helminth infections after the end of the pregnancy or the termination of breast-feeding.</p>

        <title>Parasitological survey</title>
        <p>The parasitological survey and blood draw were performed during April-July 2004, the results of which can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001564-t001">Table 1</xref>. Subjects were asked to provide two fecal samples on two separate days, which were examined qualitatively by formalin-ether sedimentation. Helminth-positive samples were then examined by Kato–Katz fecal thick smear to quantify the intensity of infection, as eggs per gram of feces (epg). Two slides were counted from each day's sample, i.e. 2–4 slides from each individual, as some individuals only provided one sample. Individuals who were egg-positive by sedimentation but negative by Kato-Katz were assigned a count of 3 epg, half the Kato-Katz detection limit. Hookworm was exclusively <italic>N. americanus</italic>. Adults or children positive for gastrointestinal nematodes were offered a single 400 mg dose of albendazole and individuals infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> were treated with praziquantel. Egg-negative individuals were not treated. Treated individuals were examined post-treatment to confirm treatment efficacy, and offered repeat treatment(s) until egg-negative.</p>

        <p>Approximately 20 ml of blood was collected from 666 volunteers in siliconized tubes for separation of serum. In brief, the level of IgE against <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 was measured by indirect ELISA using Polysorp 96-well microtiter ELISA plates (NUNC F96, Fisher Scientific) which were incubated overnight at 4°C with antigen (1 µg/ml in 0.15 M PBS, pH 7.2). After washing with PBST, the plates were blocked for 2 hours at RT with 250 µl of PBST/3% BSA. One hundred microliters of sera (1∶25 in PBST/3% BSA) were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4°C, then the plates were washed with PBST and 100 µl of mouse biotin-conjugated monoclonal anti-human IgE FC (Human Reagent Laboratory, Baltimore, MD) (1∶200 in PBST/3% BSA) was added to the plates. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at RT and then washed with PBST. Plates were developed by adding o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 0.05 M phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 5.0) plus 30% hydrogen peroxide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 minutes at RT in the dark. Fifty microliters of 2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added to stop the colorimetric reaction, which was read at a wavelength of 490 nm on a SpectraMax 340 PC (Molecular Devices) microplate reader. SOFTmax Pro for Windows was used for the analysis and storage of data.</p>

        <p>Mice vaccinated with alum/CpG adjuvanted <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 and <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2/5B mounted strong <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2-specific IgG responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001564-t002">Table 2</xref>). IgG<sub>1</sub> responses dominated and IgG<sub>2a</sub> responses were generally weak (not shown). Pre-challenge IgG endpoint titers (four-fold serial dilutions) ranged from 256,000–1,024,000 for <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 vaccinated mice and 256,000–4,096,000 for <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2/5B vaccinated mice. At necropsy (post-challenge), titers had waned to 64,000–256,000 for <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 vaccinated mice and 64,000–1,024,000 for <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2/5B vaccinated mice. Mean and median anti-<italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 antibody titers were higher in the group vaccinated with <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B (means 486,400 vs 1,450,667; medians 256,000 vs 1,024,000), implying that mice vaccinated with the chimera made a stronger antibody response against the <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 region of the immunogen, and increased titers were not due to anti-5B antibodies. No obvious association between antibody titer and parasite burden was detected. Of the mice vaccinated with <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2/5B, two mice had no worms, one mouse had two worms and one mouse had four worms. All four mice had the lowest liver egg burdens and high antibody titers (≥1,024,000). However, two other mice had equally strong antibody titers but had higher parasite burdens (29 and 34 worms), precluding determination of a robust correlation between worm burdens and antibody titers.</p>

        <title>Vaccine-induced protection against parasite challenge is associated with parasite-specific IFN-γ production</title>
        <p>Splenocytes from vaccinated and challenged animals were restimulated with SEA and SWAP to assess the cytokine responses to vaccination and parasite challenge. Levels of IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ from splenocytes were elevated in all infected animals compared to uninfected MBP-vaccinated animals when restimulated <italic>ex vivo</italic> with SEA and SWAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001564-g006">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that infection-related cytokine responses were produced, although responses to SEA were generally higher. SEA and SWAP-specific IL-4 responses tended to increase in <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B-vaccinated animals compared to control (MBP-vaccinated) infected animals, however this only reached significance with SWAP restimulation. IL-10 production in response to SWAP, but not SEA, was also increased due to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B vaccination. IFN-γ production in response to both SEA and SWAP were also highly significantly increased (P&lt;0.01) in response to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B vaccination.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have previously demonstrated that the large extracellular loop of the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> tegument tetraspanin, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, when linked to a thioredoxin fusion partner and formulated with Freund's adjuvants, is an efficacious vaccine antigen, eliciting high levels of protection in a murine schistosomiasis model of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref>. Herein, we show that modified and chimeric forms of the <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 vaccine antigen are also protective, even when formulated with a human-approved adjuvant combination, and that a schistosomiasis vaccine based on <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 (or <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B) satisfies additional selection criteria for progression into clinical trials, such as safety concerns around the potentially deleterious effects of pre-existing IgE responses in helminth endemic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hotez1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Diemert1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There is a paucity of funding - driven by the lack of a commercially viable market - available for the production of vaccines against the neglected tropical diseases, and so a vaccine antigen must be amenable to low-cost manufacture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hotez3">[22]</xref>. Despite attempts at optimisation of production of these two antigens being preliminary at best, both <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 and <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B have been expressed at yields that, at this initial stage, may be indicative of cost-effective up-scaling and clinical development. Indeed, <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 has been recently produced in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> fermentation cultures in our laboratory at a yield or over 500 mg/L (data not shown) and efforts are currently underway to express <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B in a similar fashion.</p>
      <p>We recently suggested that the presence of a pre-existing human serum IgE response to a helminth vaccine antigen is a down-selection criterion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hotez1">[1]</xref> when considering a molecule for progression towards clinical trials because of the safety risks involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Diemert1">[19]</xref>. No detectable levels of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2-specific IgE were found in individuals chronically infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, despite very strong IgE responses to proteins found within SEA. This is also the case for the hookworm antigen, <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Pearson2">[23]</xref>, the origin of the 5B domain in <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B. Despite the absence of a detectable IgE response, previous studies have shown that humans from schistosome- and hookworm-endemic areas mount IgG<sub>1</sub> responses to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref> and <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Pearson2">[23]</xref>, indicating that both antigens are recognized by the immune system in a natural infection. What determines the isotype response (IgG vs IgE) mounted by an infected individual to a helminth antigen is multifactorial and an unresolved topic of debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Fitzsimmons1">[24]</xref>. What is clear, however, is the potential danger of developing a vaccine based on an antigen that is the target of a naturally acquired IgE response in the target population.</p>
      <p>Of the two test groups, mice vaccinated with <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B had the highest level of protection against experimental schistosomiasis. We initially hypothesized that this increased protection was due to cross-reactive epitopes within the 5B region of hookworm <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 and its <italic>S. mansoni</italic> orthologue, <italic>Sm</italic>-catD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Brindley1">[25]</xref>. However, numerous attempts to show binding of anti-<italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B to recombinant <italic>Sm</italic>-catD and schistosome extracts using Western blotting and immunoprecipitation coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (A. Dougall and A. Loukas, unpublished) were unsuccessful. Anti <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B did, however, bind strongly to recombinant <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 and inhibited the ability of the enzyme to cleave a synthetic substrate in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Pearson1">[17]</xref> and has likewise been shown to neutralise the hemoglobinase capacity of <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 in this study; indeed, the 5B region of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B is highly immunogenic and was the target of a panel of IgG<sub>1</sub> mAbs raised to recombinant <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Pearson1">[17]</xref>. Production of a chimeric antigen comprising <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 and the 5B region of <italic>Sm</italic>-CatD from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> instead of <italic>Na</italic>-APR-1 is currently underway in our laboratory and may have the additional benefit of being able to induce an antibody-mediated neutralization of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 in the tegument and <italic>Sm</italic>-CatD in the gut of the intra-mammalian stages of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Given the absence of an obvious cross-reactive schistosome epitope for antibodies to the <italic>Na-</italic>APR-1/5B fragment, we therefore sought to confirm whether the increased protection obtained with <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B compared to <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 alone was due to the increased size and therefore increased immunogenicity of the chimera. When microtiter plates were coated with <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 and probed with antisera from mice immunized with <italic>Sm-</italic>TSP-2 or <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B, the IgG endpoint titers were higher on average for the group immunized with <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B, implying that vaccination with the larger immunogen resulted in an increased TSP-2-specific antibody titer. We also noted that individual mice with the highest antibody titers had the fewest worms, as highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001564-t002">Table 2</xref>. Studies are also in progress to determine whether the chimeric protein generates similar levels of protection against hookworm infection caused by <italic>Necator americanus</italic>.</p>
      <p>Restimulation of splenocytes from vaccinated and infected mice prior to necropsy showed a general increase in both Th2 (IL-4), regulatory (IL-10) and Th1 (IFN-γ) responses to parasite antigens, which was especially marked in increased IFN-γ production by mice vaccinated with <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B compared to those vaccinated with the control non-parasite protein MBP. This implies that every animal was effectively challenged, indicating that the recovery of very few or no parasites in some mice was not due to an unsuccessful infection but successful vaccination. These data also suggest that Th1 cytokines have a role in the protective response against schistosomiasis, a finding that has been documented in infection studies with the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Hewitson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Wynn1">[27]</xref> and vaccination experiments with recombinant vaccine candidate antigens from the tegument such as Sm29 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Cardoso1">[28]</xref> and Sm14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Garcia1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A caveat of using human-approved adjuvants to test vaccine antigens in the early stages of process development is that the full potential of a candidate antigen may not be realized due to the increased immunostimulatory properties of adjuvants containing mycobacteria and other toxic components, such as Freund's adjuvants. However, the levels of protection reported herein for <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2/5B were similar to those reported for Freund's formulated thioredoxin-<italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2, and well exceed the 40% benchmark set by the WHO for progression of an antigen into clinical trials irrespective of the adjuvant used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Bergquist3">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 immunolocalizes to the surface of schistosomula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran2">[16]</xref> and adult worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref> and has been found in the outer tegument of mature schistosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Braschi1">[10]</xref> in abundance using proteomic techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-CastroBorges1">[31]</xref>. The ultrastructural morphology of adult worms and schistosomula treated <italic>in vitro</italic> with <italic>Sm-tsp-2</italic> double-stranded RNA displayed a distinctly vacuolated and thinner tegument compared to controls, suggesting that <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 may play a pivotal role in tegument development in the early stages of intra-mammalian development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran2">[16]</xref>. These insights into <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 function, along with the apparent importance of humoral immunity in anti-<italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 vaccination, lead us to hypothesize that the surface of the schistosomulum and adult fluke are potential sites of immune attack where these crucially important membranes are being opsonized by anti-<italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 antibodies for further attack by complement, antibody-dependent cellular mechanisms, or both. We are currently exploring the immunologic mechanisms responsible for vaccine-induced efficacy using genetically modified mice.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2-based vaccine antigens reported in this study appear to exhibit all the early-stage characteristics of a vaccine targeting developing countries where schistosomiasis is endemic, based on their ease of production, absence of IgE reactivity, preferential recognition by resistant humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran1">[12]</xref>, essential nature of the protein for parasite survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Tran2">[16]</xref> and vaccine efficacy in animal models. These features, coupled with the recent finding of a lack of polymorphism between geographical isolates of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2 throughout Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001564-Cupit1">[32]</xref> provide a compelling argument for the use of <italic>Sm</italic>-TSP-2-based antigens as safe and effective anti-schistosomiasis vaccines. These additional studies also open the door to exploring more than a single helminth target with a single antigen.</p>
