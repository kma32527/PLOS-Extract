          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Recombinant KSAC and L110f are promising <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine candidates. Both antigens formulated in stable emulsions (SE) with the natural TLR4 agonist MPL® and L110f with the synthetic TLR4 agonist GLA in SE protected BALB/c mice against <italic>L. major</italic> infection following needle challenge. Considering the virulence of vector-transmitted <italic>Leishmania</italic> infections, we vaccinated BALB/c mice with either KSAC+GLA-SE or L110f+GLA-SE to assess protection against <italic>L. major</italic> transmitted via its vector <italic>Phlebotomus duboscqi</italic>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Mice receiving the KSAC or L110f vaccines were challenged by needle or <italic>L. major</italic>-infected sand flies. Weekly disease progression and terminal parasite loads were determined. Immunological responses to KSAC, L110f, or soluble <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen (SLA) were assessed throughout vaccination, three and twelve weeks after immunization, and one week post-challenge.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Following sand fly challenge, KSAC-vaccinated mice were protected while L110f-vaccinated animals showed partial protection. Protection correlated with the ability of SLA to induce IFN-γ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup>CCR7<sup>low</sup> effector memory T cells pre- and post-sand fly challenge.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>This study demonstrates the protective efficacy of KSAC+GLA-SE against sand fly challenge; the importance of vector-transmitted challenge in evaluating vaccine candidates against <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection; and the necessity of a rapid potent Th1 response against <italic>Leishmania</italic> to attain true protection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite and transmitted by the bite of an infective sand fly. Despite the importance of this disease there is no vaccine available for humans. Studies have shown that vector-transmitted infections are more virulent, promoting parasite establishment and abrogating protection observed against needle-injected parasites in vaccinated mice. KSAC and L110f, derived from <italic>Leishmania</italic>-based polyproteins, protected mice against the needle-injected parasites. Here, we tested the two molecules for their capacity to protect mice against cutaneous leishmaniasis transmitted by an infective sand fly. Our results show that KSAC, but not L110f, confers protection against <italic>Leishmania</italic> transmitted by sand fly bites where protection was correlated to a strong immune response to <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens by memory T cells before and after sand fly transmission of the parasite. This is the first report of a <italic>Leishmania</italic>-based vaccine that confers protection against a virulent sand fly challenge. Our results support the importance of screening <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine candidates using infective sand flies before moving forward with the costly steps of vaccine development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease endemic in 98 countries with an estimated 350 million people at risk and an estimated burden of 2,357,000 disability-adjusted life years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-WHO1">[1]</xref>. Visceral leishmaniasis is fatal if left untreated, and the morbidity and stigma caused by cutaneous leishmaniasis is significant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Desjeux1">[2]</xref>. Current treatment is dependent on long-term therapy with toxic drugs, most requiring parenteral administration and hospital supervision.</p>
      <p>A vaccine against leishmaniasis is feasible because infection with certain species, including <italic>L. major</italic>, or exposure to live <italic>Leishmania</italic> (leishmanization) leads to a long-term protection in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Belkaid1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Greenblatt1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Nadim1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Handman1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Uzonna1">[7]</xref>. Unfortunately, there is no commercial vaccine available for humans despite the presence of an extensive list of vaccine candidates shown to be protective in various animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Costa1">[8]</xref>. With the exception of two vaccine candidates, a synthetic glycovaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Rogers1">[9]</xref> and autoclaved <italic>L. major</italic>+CPG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters1">[10]</xref>, all <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccines tested to date were challenged with needle inoculation of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite. L110f and KSAC, two fusion polyproteins, in various combinations with appropriate adjuvants were shown to confer strong protection against cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in mice following conventional needle challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Bertholet1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Goto1">[12]</xref>. None of these vaccines were challenged by infected sand fly bites, the natural route of transmission. For protection against <italic>L. major</italic>, the L110f and KSAC-containing vaccines were tested separately in susceptible BALB/c mice followed by an infected sand fly challenge.</p>
      <p>Both susceptible and resistant mice strains have been used to study the immunology of leishmaniasis and the protective effect of potential <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Liew1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Muller1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Kedzierski1">[15]</xref>. It has been long established that protection from <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites requires the induction of a Th1 immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Reiner1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Sacks1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Scott1">[18]</xref>. BALB/c mice produce a polarized Th2 type immune response against <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. and are used extensively to test <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Webb1">[19]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that protective antigen/adjuvant formulations in this model system are good vaccine candidates since they have to overcome the natural Th2 bias of this strain.</p>
      <p>Recently, Peters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters2">[20]</xref> demonstrated that transmission of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites by sand fly bites generates a specific innate immune response involving a sustained recruitment of neutrophils that promotes parasite establishment. Additionally, the authors demonstrated that vector transmission of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites can abolish protection observed in vaccinated mice following needle challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the current work, we use a natural sand fly challenge model in BALB/c mice to test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the two fusion proteins L110f and KSAC formulated with GLA-SE against <italic>L. major</italic> transmitted by the bite of its natural sand fly vector <italic>Phlebotomus duboscqi</italic>.</p>

A distinctly different response was observed in L110f+GLA-SE-immunized mice where pre-challenge IFN-γ production was low to undetectable after stimulation with either SLA or L110f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001610-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas IFN-γ was readily detectable after challenge with infected flies. Post-challenge, 57 ng/ml of IFN-γ and 222 ng/ml were produced in L110f-immunized mice in response to SLA and L110f, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001610-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Overall, antigen-stimulated splenocytes produced a low level of IL-10 compared to the relatively high concentration of IFN-γ produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001610-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>). The highest levels of IL-10 were produced by spleen cells of KSAC-immunized mice pre-challenge with infected flies (&gt;3.3 ng/ml and 1.7 ng/ml with SLA and KSAC stimulation, respectively) compared to post-challenge levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001610-g004">Figure 4A</xref>); post-challenge levels were reduced to &lt;1 ng/ml following stimulation with either SLA or KSAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001610-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Similar to IFN-γ, IL-10 was not detectable in L110f+GLA-SE immunized mice pre-challenge and produced 1.2 and 2.4 ng/ml IL-10 after stimulation with SLA and L110f, respectively, after sand fly challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001610-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The <italic>Leishmania</italic>-derived polyproteins L110f and KSAC have been extensively studied. L110f or its first generation antigen Leish-111f (equivalent to the clinical antigen LEISH-F1) and KSAC elicited protective immunity against <italic>L. major</italic> as well as <italic>L. infantum</italic> in rodent models of infection initiated by needle challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Bertholet1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Goto1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Coler2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Coler3">[27]</xref>. Both antigens are well-defined and used in formulation with MPL®-SE or GLA-SE, adjuvants suitable for human use.</p>
      <p>Here, we vaccinated BALB/c mice using the same protocol used by Bertholet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Bertholet1">[11]</xref> for L110f and Goto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Goto1">[12]</xref> for KSAC with the exception of the exclusive use of a stable emulsion containing GLA, a synthetic glucopyranosyl lipid A molecule similar to the naturally derived MPL® <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Coler1">[21]</xref>. The objective was to test whether vaccination of mice with either antigen is equally protective against challenge by <italic>L. major</italic>-infected <italic>P. duboscqi</italic> sand flies. This work is relevant to the value of these antigens as vaccines; particularly following findings by Peters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters2">[20]</xref> demonstrating that parasite transmission by vector bite induces a specific innate immune response, which promotes the establishment of <italic>L. major</italic> infection. The authors went further to demonstrate that the virulence of vector-transmitted infections overcomes the protection observed against a needle challenge of vaccinated mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When BALB/c mice were challenged with infected sand flies, the KSAC+GLA-SE-vaccinated animals were protected from infection by both a laboratory-maintained parasite and a more virulent strain that was recently isolated from a soldier in Iraq (WR-2885). The partial protection observed in L110f-vaccinated mice following either needle or fly challenge with the Friedlin-V1 strain was abrogated when the mice were challenged with sand flies carrying the virulent WR-2885 strain. These data are consistent with the reported increase in virulence of a vector-transmitted infection and emphasize the need to test promising vaccines in vector-transmission models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Peters2">[20]</xref>. Additionally, the data draw attention to the importance of the virulence of the parasite strain used in challenge experiments particularly for vaccine studies.</p>
      <p>It is important to point out that the clinical forms of L111f and L110f (LEISH-F1 and LEISH-F2, respectively) delivered with MPL®-SE were safe and immunogenic in healthy subjects with and without histories of previous infection with <italic>L. donovani</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Chakravarty1">[28]</xref>.

Both Leish-111f and Leish-110f demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in dogs with canine leishmaniasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Miret1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Trigo1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, L110f should not be overlooked as a valuable vaccine in our fight against leishmaniasis.</p>
      <p>Based on present and previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Goto1">[12]</xref> KSAC and GLA-SE used together show considerable promise as a preventive vaccine. Vaccinated mice were mostly pathology-free after challenge with either the Friedlin V1 or WR2885 <italic>L. major</italic> strains. Additionally, vaccinated mice were protected in a delayed challenge 12 weeks after the last vaccination using infected sand flies, indicative of the generation of long-lasting immunity. Protection was associated with a consistently positive IgG2a∶IgG1 ratio for KSAC. Interestingly, in L110f-immunized mice that were partially protected, this ratio fluctuated from negative to neutral at 62 days and 12 weeks post-vaccination, respectively. Such antibody fluctuation may reflect stabilization of antibody levels over time and further emphasizes the importance of testing the efficacy of the immune response to a vaccine in a delayed challenge. Of note, both KSAC and L110f generated a Th1-biased cell-mediated immunity. This was demonstrated by the predominant antigen-specific IFN-γ response (relative to the IL-10 response) of spleen cells from vaccinated mice one week post-challenge. However, L110f-vaccinated mice did not mount an immune response to SLA nor to pre-challenge stimulation of spleen cells with antigen. This finding is distinct from that of Bertholet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Bertholet1">[11]</xref> where they demonstrated a balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response to L110f plus GLA-SE or MPL-SE, a sizable induction of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells, and good protection with both vaccines when challenged by needle. We cannot account with certainty for the apparent discrepancy between our immunogenicity results with L110f+GLA-SE and those of Bertholet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Bertholet1">[11]</xref> and other reports using L111f/L110f+GLA-SE or +MPL-SE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Coler2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Skeiky1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001610-Darrah1">[34]</xref>. One difference between these studies and ours is the time chosen for pre-challenge analysis. In any case, the reduced protection we observed against the two <italic>L. major</italic> strains tested using L110f+GLA-SE correlate well with the relatively weak shift to a Th1 response that was observed after vaccination, but before parasite challenge. In contrast, splenocytes from KSAC+GLA-SE-vaccinated mice responded well to stimulation with antigen and, more importantly, to stimulation with SLA pre- and post- challenge by infected bites. KSAC-immunized mice generate a pool of effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> T cells specific to KSAC that was efficiently stimulated with SLA both before and after a sand fly challenge. These results suggest that the rate and magnitude of the immune response are important for the generation of protection against a virulent sand fly-transmitted infection. Additionally, the observed differences in the protective effect of L110f and KSAC, both formulated with GLA-SE, against vector-challenge may be related to other factors such as antigenicity, accessibility or amount of the natural proteins making up these polypeptides.</p>
      <p>Recent studies (S. Bertholet, personal communication) have shown that lower doses of adjuvant (GLA-SE) are more efficient at inducing long-lived CD4 memory responses, especially with L110f as an antigen (data not shown). This could indicate that optimal adjuvant doses vary for different antigens and might need to be titrated accordingly. The KSAC results reported here demonstrate that the synthetic TLR4 agonist GLA can be a powerful tool to direct a shift from Th2 to a Th1-type response, necessary to combat a vector-transmitted <italic>L. major</italic> infection.</p>
      <p>In summary, the BALB/c mouse model was used in our experiments because it is especially susceptible to <italic>L. major</italic> infection as a result of its genetically determined Th2 immune response. We observed that immunization with KSAC in combination with the TLR4 agonist GLA in stable emulsion overcomes the Th2 bias of BALB/c mice, generating a robust, cell-mediated Th1 immune response in these mice. This immunological activation results in solid protection against vector-transmitted <italic>L. major</italic> infection, protection that is comparable to the one observed following needle challenge. As anticipated, immunization conditions (using L110f+GLA-SE) that produced a more modest immune response with a less dramatic shift from a Th2 to a Th1 response was less protective.</p>
      <p>KSAC, a defined <italic>Leishmania</italic>-based vaccine candidate shows protection against a sand fly challenge, and this protection was produced in combination with the clinically viable adjuvant GLA-SE. With these encouraging results, more work is needed to test the protective nature of these vaccine components in more relevant models of cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p>
