          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. A therapeutic antibody against the viral envelope (E) protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We generated seventeen novel mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high reactivity against E protein of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two mouse models even in post-exposure trials.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>We used novel epitope mapping strategies, by combining phage display with VLPs, to identify the important A-strand epitopes with strong neutralizing activity. This study introduced potential therapeutic antibodies that might be capable of providing broad protection against diverse DENV-2 infections without enhancing activity in humans.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a serious health threat despite the availability of supportive care in modern medicine. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of DENV would be powerful research tools for antiviral development, diagnosis and pathological investigations. Here we described generation and characterization of seventeen mAbs with high reactivity for E protein of DENV. Four of these mAbs showed high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection in mice. The monoclonal antibody mAb DB32-6 showed the strongest neutralizing activity against diverse DENV-2 and protected DENV-2-infected mice against mortality in therapeutic models. We identified neutralizing epitopes of DENV located at residues K310 and E311 of viral envelope protein domain III (E-DIII) through the combination of biological and molecular strategies. Comparing the strong neutralizing activity of mAbs targeting A-strand with mAbs targeting lateral ridge, we found that epitopes located in A-strand induced stronger neutralizing activity than those located on the lateral ridge. DB32-6 humanized version was successfully developed. Humanized DB32-6 variant retained neutralizing activity and prevented DENV infection. Understanding the epitope-based antibody-mediated neutralization is crucial to controlling dengue infection. Additionally, this study also introduces a novel humanized mAb as a candidate for therapy of dengue patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in humans and an increasing public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 50–100 million cases of dengue fever (DF) and 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) occur every year, and 2.5 billion people are at risk of dengue infection globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Guzman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Halstead1">[2]</xref>. Dengue infection may lead to fever, headache and joint pain in milder cases but may also lead to the more severe life-threatening DHF/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) has plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic manifestations, possibly leading to shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Kalayanarooj1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Whitehead1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of approximately 11 kb genome of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, a family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. It has four genetically and antigenically related viral serotypes: DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4. Flaviviruses encode a single polyprotein processed by host and viral protease to produce three structural proteins, including capsid (C) protein, precursor membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) protein, and seven nonstructural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Rice1">[5]</xref>. The E protein, a 53 kDa glycoprotein important for attachment, entry, and viral envelope fusion, can bind to cellular receptors and induce neutralizing antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Pierson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Pokidysheva1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The DENV consists of an icosahedral ectodomain, containing 180 copies of the E protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Kuhn1">[8]</xref>. E protein monomer contains three structural and functional domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Modis1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Roehrig1">[10]</xref>. E protein domain I (E-DI) is a central β-barrel structure. E protein domain II (E-DII) is organized into two long finger-like structures and contains the flaviviruses conserved fusion loop. E protein domain III (E-DIII) has an immunoglobulin-like fold and may mediate interactions between the virus and the receptors on the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Mukhopadhyay1">[11]</xref>. Studies of the biological characteristics and epitope specificities of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have elucidated the antigenic structure of flavivirus E proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Crill1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Rajamanonmani1">[15]</xref>. Serotype-specific mAbs with neutralizing activity against DENV-2 have been found to be located on the lateral ridge of E-DIII and the subcomplex-specific mAbs recognized A-strand of E-DIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Roehrig2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lok1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-SukupolviPetty1">[17]</xref>. Antibody-mediated neutralization has been found to alter the arrangement of viral surface glycoproteins that prevent cells from viral attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lok1">[16]</xref>. Binding of an antibody to the viral surface can interfere with virus internalization or membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Pierson1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Primary DENV infection is believed to provide lifelong immunity against re-infection with the same serotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Halstead2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Gubler1">[19]</xref>. However, humoral immune responses to DENV infection are complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Crill2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Schmidt1">[22]</xref>, and may exacerbate the disease during heterologous virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Halstead2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Gubler1">[19]</xref>. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in dengue pathogenesis results from the increase in the efficiency of virus infection in the presence of non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing concentrations of anti-E or anti-prM immunoglobulins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Dejnirattisai1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Halstead3">[23]</xref>. The attachment of antibody-virus complex to such Fcγ receptor-bearing cells as monocytes and macrophages can lead to an increased virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Halstead2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Littaua1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Huang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A better understanding of the neutralizing epitopes may facilitate the generation of new antibody-based therapeutics against DENV infection. In this study, we generated several mAbs against DENV-2. We found that serotype-specific anti-E-DIII mAbs played an important role in the neutralization of virus infectivity. Studies of the neutralizing epitopes found the strongest mAbs to be DB32-6 and DB25-2, both DENV-2 serotype-specific antibodies. These two mAbs recognized the A-strand of E-DIII at residues K310 and E311, respectively. Humanized DB32-6 mAb efficiently neutralized DENV-2 infection in a therapeutic mouse model and its variant version prevented enhancing activity.</p>

Female 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized with 10<sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu) of DENV-2 (16681). The DENV-2 was purified from viral culture supernatant using 4G2 (an anti-E protein mAb)-coupled protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow gel. After four inoculations with the same concentration of antigens, the splenocytes from the immunized mouse spleen were harvested and then fused with mouse myeloma NS-1 cells. Fused cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, HAT medium and hybridoma cloning factor (Roche) in 96-well tissue culture plates. Two weeks after fusion, culture supernatants were screened by ELISA. Selected clones were subcloned by limiting dilutions. Hybridoma clones were isotyped using a commercially isotyping kit (Southern Biotech) by ELISA. Ascites fluids were produced in pristine-primed BALB/c mice. mAbs were affinity-purified by standard protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) according to manufacturer's directions.</p>

Western blot analysis and IFA showed that, of the 17 mAbs recognizing E protein, 10 mAbs (DB2-3, DB9-1, DB13-19, DB21-6, DB22-4, DB23-3, DB27-3, DB33-3, DB39-2 and DB42-3) targeted to E-DI-II and 2 mAbs (DB25-2 and DB32-6) recognized E-DIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g001">Figures 1D–1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001636-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, 5 mAbs could not be identified by these two assays.</p>
        <p>We evaluated the ability of mAbs to inhibit DENV-2 infection in BHK-21 cells using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Ten mAbs had neutralizing activity with 50% PRNT (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) concentrations ranging from 0.14 µg/ml to 33 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001636-t001">Table 1</xref>). DB32-6 was found to be a DENV-2 serotype-specific mAb against E-DIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g001">Figures 1A, 1B and 1E</xref>) and was the most efficient at neutralizing DENV-2 infection at a PRNT<sub>50</sub> concentration of 0.14 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, it could completely inhibit the infection at a lower concentration of 1.2 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The mAb DB25-2 was found to be a DENV-2 serotype-specific mAb against E-DIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g001">Figures 1A, 1B and 1E</xref>) and to neutralize DENV-2 at a PRNT<sub>50</sub> titer of 1.2 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These findings indicate that serotype-specific mAb DB32-6 against E-DIII was the most potent in neutralizing DENV infection. Some serotype-specific mAbs, such as DB2-3 and DB23-3 against E-DI-II and DB25-2 against E-DIII showed strong neutralizing activity. Many complex reactive mAbs showed moderate-to-poor neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001636-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Two different mouse models were used to assess whether DB32-6 could efficiently protect mice against DENV-2 challenge. Protection assay of neutralizing mAbs was performed with ICR strain 2-day-old suckling mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Sabin1">[41]</xref>. Mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 20 µl of DENV-2-mAb mixture containing 1×10<sup>4</sup> pfu (25-fold LD<sub>50</sub>) of DENV-2 with neutralizing mAbs at concentrations of 1, 10 or 100 µg/ml. Generally, the non-neutralizing antibody normal mouse IgG (NMIgG) treated group showed paralysis, ruffling, and slowing of activity around 6 to 9 days. This was followed by severe sickness leading to anorexia, asthenia and death within 9 to 17 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figures 2B and 2C</xref>). In contrast, mAbs DB32-6 at a concentration of 10 µg/ml protected 93% of the mice from the lethal challenge of DENV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). mAbs 3H5, DB23-3, DB2-3 and DB25-2 had survival rates of 75%, 76%, 72% and 71%, respectively. DB42-3 and DB13-19 had survival rates of 46% and 28%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The neutralizing mAbs showed a significant delay of the onset of paralysis and death relative to the NMIgG. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of the highly protective mAb DB32-6, we administered 100 µg/ml or 1 µg/ml to infected suckling mice. The survival rates for DB32-6 at 100 µg/ml or 1 µg/ml were 100% and 89%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

The DB32-6 prophylactically treated group showed 100% protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2D</xref> left).

        <p>The 17 immunopositive phage clones that were highly reactive with DB32-6 were amplified and phage DNA was isolated for DNA sequencing. All of the phage clones displayed 12 amino acid (aa) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g003">Figure 3D</xref> left). Phage-displayed peptide sequences selected by DB32-6 had the consensus motifs of histidine (H)-lysine (K)-glutamic acid (E)-tryptophan (W)/tyrosine (Y)-histidine (H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g003">Figure 3D</xref> left).

        <p>To further confirm the neutralizing epitopes, we developed various E protein epitope-specific variants VLPs and screened loss-of-binding VLP mutants for identification of critical recognition residues. Using this strategy, we found that DB32-6 lost its VLP binding activity when the residue K310 in the A-strand of E-DIII was changed to alanine (K310A) or glutamine (K310Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g004">Figure 4A</xref> left).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>mAbs of DENV have served as powerful research tools for antiviral development and pathological investigations. Here, we newly generated and characterized 17 mAbs with high reactivity against E protein of DENV-2. Several mAbs had potent neutralizing activity. The neutralizing epitopes were identified using a combination of strategies, including phage display, computational structure analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Bublil1">[49]</xref>, and high-throughput epitope mapping of VLPs. From these results, the A-strand of E-DIII was found to be important in neutralizing DENV-2 than the lateral ridge of E-DIII. mAb DB32-6 which had the strongest neutralizing activity against various strains of DENV-2 was humanized and modified to abrogate the ADE phenomenon. The mAb DB32-6 was demonstrated to increase the survival rate in two mouse models even after DENV-2 infection.</p>
      <p>Based on previous epitope mapping results, several epitopes have been shown to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies against individual flaviviruses that situated in E-DIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Roehrig2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Oliphant1">[50]</xref>. Investigation of neutralizing epitopes on the E proteins may provide the framework for a detailed understanding of both specific mechanisms of the viral infection as well as the identification of the specific DENV domain that attaches to a cellular receptor. Phage display is useful in the identification of B-cell epitopes, including linear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Liu1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Wu2">[51]</xref> and conformational epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Chen2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Liu2">[45]</xref>. However, these epitopes need to further elucidation using other methods. Combining different strategies provided a fast and reliable evidence for identifying epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g004">4</xref>). To date, few mAbs possess better neutralizing activity than 3H5, which has been shown to bind to residues K305, E383 and P384 at the lateral ridge of E-DIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-SukupolviPetty1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Crill2">[20]</xref>. DB32-6 had higher neutralizing activity than 3H5. Neutralizing epitope of DB32-6 was mapped on K310 residue in A-strand of E-DIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Neutralizing epitope of another mAb DB25-2 was mapped on E311 residue in A-strand of E-DIII, too (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes located in the A-strand of E-DIII induced stronger neutralizing activity than those located on the lateral ridge of E-DIII. We aligned different DENV-2 genotypes and found that the K310 and E311 were frequently observed in DENV-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001636.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The K310 may be important to DENV-2. Thus by binding DB32-6 to K310, it lead to dramatic neutralized DENV-2. To determine whether DB32-6 can neutralize diverse genotypes of DENV-2 is a critical step in evaluating the potential of therapeutic development in the future.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that the strongly neutralizing mAb, subcomplex-specific 1A1D-2 and cross-reactive 9F12 recognized residues at K305, K307 and K310 in A-strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Rajamanonmani1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-SukupolviPetty1">[17]</xref>. Our mAb DB32-6 is a serotype-specific neutralizing mAb that recognized residue K310 but not residues K305 or K307. Although K310 is considered as a subcomplex-specific epitope, DB32-6 is a serotype-specific mAb. There may be other regions that affect the binding of DB32-6 to DENV-2. We found that by mutating residue I312, DB32-6's binding activity was reduced by 50% (data not shown). Residue I312 may be a minor epitope of DB32-6. Moreover, 1A1D-2 is a temperature dependent mAb due to its needs for dynamic motion on the virion surface to neutralize virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lok1">[16]</xref>. Different from 1A1D-2, DB32-6 is temperature independent. When DB32-6 was incubated with DENV at 4°C, it still exhibited significant neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g006">6</xref>). As expected, when incubating the DENV and DB32-6 at 37°C, DB32-6 showed better efficacy than it did at 4°C (data not shown). The residue K310 on the surface of DENV-2 may be accessible to DB32-6 binding. Additionally, DB32-6 had high binding affinity (0.12–0.18 nM) to DENV-2. Based on the above finding, the residue K310 induce serotype-specific mAbs and is crucial in the neutralization of virus infectivity.</p>
      <p>Antibodies to E-DI-II tend to be more cross-reactive and less potent in neutralization of dengue infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Beltramello1">[39]</xref>. However, there are fewer antibody concentrations capable of recognizing E-DIII than there are that recognize E-DI-II in dengue patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Crill2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Beltramello1">[39]</xref>. Wahala et al. studied the human immune sera of DENV infection and found the E-DIII binding antibodies to play a minor role in DENV neutralization, similar to West Nile virus-infected human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Wahala1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Throsby1">[53]</xref>. The mAbs that bind to E-DIII expresses potent neutralizing activity, but only a few of them exist in serum of the patients infected with DENV or WNV. Combining the information from both mice and human mAbs studies of DENV infection is critical to understanding the complex mechanism behind the humoral immunity following natural DENV infection. According to one previous study, the immunoglobulin populations recognizing residues K310, E311 and P364 in dengue fever patients were much larger in IgM than in IgG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Crill2">[20]</xref>. The strong neutralizing IgG made up a small proportion of the antibody in dengue patients. de Alwis et al. has conducted an in-depth analysis of the human mAbs derived from memory B-cells of patients infected with primary DENV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-deAlwis1">[54]</xref>. After the epitope mapping of anti-DENV-2 human mAbs, the strong neutralizing mAb 10.16 was mapped to K305, K310 and E311 in the A-strand. Together, the finding above suggest that the highly protective epitopes K310 and E311 in mouse play a role in humans as well.</p>
      <p>We also identified several E-DI-II specific mAbs with high to no neutralizing activity. Serotype-specific mAbs (DB2-3 and DB23-3) with potent neutralizing activity were found to recognize E-DI-II of DENV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001636-t001">Table 1</xref>). Some studies have identified highly neutralizing and protective antibodies against JEV and DENV located in E-DI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Goncalvez3">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lai2">[56]</xref> Currently, we are in the process of identifying the neutralizing epitopes of DB2-3 and DB23-3. mAbs that broadly cross-react with other flaviviruses are in E-DII near the fusion loop, which is immunodominant antigenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Crill2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lai1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Goncalvez1">[42]</xref>. Binding an antibody to DENV can change the rearrangement of the E protein, which may neutralize or enhance viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lok1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Sultana1">[57]</xref>. The high or no neutralizing activity of our mAbs can be used help identify neutralizing or immunopathogenic epitopes in the E protein. Studies that explore the mAbs mediated neutralization mechanism and mAbs dependent enhancement are currently underway.</p>
      <p>The mouse models for dengue infection developed to date do not represented the entirety of the pathogenesis of human dengue infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Yauch1">[58]</xref>. Developing of mouse models to studying its pathogenesis is important but challenging. We used two models, suckling mice protection assay and <italic>Stat1</italic>-deficient <italic>(Stat1<sup>−/−</sup>)</italic> mouse model with different DENV-2 strains through intracerebral or intraperitoneal inoculation to evaluate the neutralizing activity of DB32-6 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g006">6</xref>). Our findings suggested that mAb DB32-6 might effectively block virus entry. However, disease manifestation of suckling mice is not relevant to dengue disease in humans since DENV infections in humans rarely involve the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Yauch1">[58]</xref>. The <italic>Stat1</italic>-deficient mice are genetically mutated and not immunocompetent, hence they are not representative of the wild types' immune response to DENV. However, their survival rates might reflect the therapeutic potential of these mAbs. The results from these mouse models showed that the therapeutic potential of this newly generated mAb DB32-6 is worth further investigation.</p>
      <p>In the absence of an effective dengue vaccine, neutralizing antibodies can be used as a passive immunotherapeutic strategy for treating dengue. Previous studies of humanized antibodies against DENV were derived from two chimpanzee Fab fragments: humanized IgG1 1A5 cross-neutralizing DENV-1 and DENV2 and humanized IgG1 5H2 specific against DENV-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Goncalvez1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Goncalvez2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Lai2">[56]</xref>. Our newly generated hDB32-6 was derived from murine mAb. However, when developing antibody-based therapy, ADE phenomenon is a major concern. Modification of Fc structure in an antibody can prevent Fcγ receptors binding and inhibit ADE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001636-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Beltramello1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001636-Goncalvez2">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our studies show that the serotype-specific mAbs targeting the A-strand of E-DIII could serve as a dramatic neutralization determinant. Through testing in different mouse models, we have successfully generated a mAb hDB32-6 variant with high therapeutic potential against diverse DENV-2 strains without inducing ADE. Such an antibody-based therapy may help control severe dengue in the future.</p>
