        <p>Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease threatening 350 million people from endemic regions. The available drugs for treatment are inadequate, with limitations such as serious side effects, parasite resistance or high cost. Driven by this need for new drugs, we developed a high-content, high-throughput image-based screening assay targeting the intracellular amastigote stage of different species of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in infected human macrophages. The <italic>in vitro</italic> infection protocol was adapted to a 384-well-plate format, enabling acquisition of a large amount of readouts by automated confocal microscopy. The reading method was based on DNA staining and required the development of a customized algorithm to analyze the images, which enabled the use of non-modified parasites. The automated analysis generated parameters used to quantify compound activity, including infection ratio as well as the number of intracellular amastigote parasites and yielded cytotoxicity information based on the number of host cells. Comparison of this assay with one that used the promastigote form to screen 26,500 compounds showed that 50% of the hits selected against the intracellular amastigote were not selected in the promastigote screening. These data corroborate the idea that the intracellular amastigote form of the parasite is the most appropriate to be used in primary screening assay for <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Leishmaniasis, one of the most neglected tropical diseases, affects over 2 million people each year. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala-azar, is caused by the protozoan parasites <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> and <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> and is fatal if left untreated. Because existing treatments are often ineffective due to parasite resistance and/or toxicity new drugs are urgently needed. Leishmaniasis is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected sandfly. In the insect vector, parasites exist as flagellated forms—promastigotes, which infect macrophage cells of the human host, where they differentiate to round forms known as amastigotes. Amastigotes and promastigotes are substantially different from a molecular perspective. Drug discovery for leishmaniasis has traditionally been complicated by the unavailability of validated drug targets and of relevant drug assays. Whole cell-based assays have been widely used, as they bypass the need for a validated target. However, they use the insect form of the parasite; indeed, the human form, the intracellular amastigote, is difficult to obtain in the laboratory in quantities compatible with drug screening. We describe here the technical advances that made it possible to adapt the intracellular amastigote form of <italic>L. donovani</italic> to a drug assay compatible with high-throughput screening.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease caused by parasites of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic>, with clinical manifestations ranging from localized cutaneous ulcers to systemic visceral organ damage. The visceral form of the disease is the most severe and is lethal if not treated. The organs targeted by the parasites are determined mainly by the infecting parasite species and the patient's immune system. In the human host, the parasite is able to infect different cell types, with macrophages as the final host in which the parasites differentiate from promastigotes into amastigotes and multiply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Antoine1">[1]</xref>. Leishmaniasis is endemic to 88 countries in tropical and sub-tropical areas and threatens 350 million people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There is no available vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-deOliveira1">[3]</xref>, and the drugs used for treatment have major drawbacks, including parasite resistance and high toxicity, with strong side effects for the patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Alvar1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Chappuis1">[5]</xref>. New drugs or formulations are therefore urgently needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Croft1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Murray1">[7]</xref>. High-throughput screening (HTS) is an efficient way of identifying active compounds among large numbers of small molecules, thereby feeding drug discovery pipelines with new candidates and optimizing both research costs and time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Bleicher1">[8]</xref>. High-content screening (HCS) combines the efficiency of HTS with information-rich assays to provide several measures of a compound's effect in the assay system. The requirements for HCS assays include quantifiable and reproducible measurements of compound activity compared to standard reference drugs in concentrations achievable in serum/tissues, handling of ultra-small (nanogram) amounts of compound, and adaptation of the assay to standard microplate formats and laboratory automation platforms.</p>
      <p>Here we report the development and validation of a protocol for <italic>in vitro</italic> drug screening and automated image mining for leishmaniasis using the intracellular amastigote form of <italic>Leishmania</italic> to infect human macrophages. We applied an image-based approach and developed computer-assisted algorithms to interpret the infection and quantify the activities of the anti-parasitic compounds. Other assays in medium- to high-throughput format have already been developed for anti-leishmanial drug screening using promastigotes (insect forms) or axenic amastigotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-StGeorge1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Shimony1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Sharlow1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-SiqueiraNeto1">[12]</xref>. While these forms of the parasite are easier to adapt to an HTS assay format, promastigotes are not representative of the human disease, and the use of axenic amastigotes as a model of intracellular amastigotes is controversial because amastigotes are exclusively intracellular <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Pescher1">[13]</xref>. To confirm the importance of the parasite stage used in an HTS assay with a large number of compounds, we compared screening data for a subset of 26,500 compounds obtained using either this newly developed assay or a previously developed HTS assay that used the promastigote form of the parasite.</p>

        <p>To visualize amastigote replication, differentiated THP-1 cells were seeded on coverslip slides in 24-well plates (8×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) and infected with 4×10<sup>6</sup> parasites in a final volume of 200 µl RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS 12 hours after parasite addition. To detect DNA replication, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used. A mixture of 1 mM BrdU and 1 mM deoxycytidine (dC) was added to the infected THP-1 culture and incubated for 12 hours. The cultures were then washed with PBS, fixed with cold 100% methanol for 5 minutes and air dried for 5 minutes at room temperature. Next, 1.5 M HCl prepared in PBS was added to the samples and incubated for 15 minutes, followed by PBS washing and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes. After another PBS wash, the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with mouse anti-BrdU conjugated monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, 1∶400 dilution) in PBS containing 4% BSA, washed 3 times with PBS and further incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, 1∶400 dilution), 2 µM DAPI (Sigma D9564) and 2.5 µM Syto60 (Invitrogen MOP-S-11342) in PBS containing 4% BSA. The samples were washed 3 times with PBS and mounted over slides with Vecta-shield (Vector H-1000). Staining was visualized with a Leica confocal TCS SP2 fluorescence microscope, taking pictures in different focal planes (z-stack). Imaris (Bitplane) software was used to develop the 3D model after acquisition of a series of images in different focal planes.</p>

        <p>The anti-leishmanial reference drugs used were amphotericin B (Sigma A9528), miltefosine (Merck 475841), paromomycin sulfate (Sigma P9297) and sodium stibogluconate (Sigma S5319). The reference drugs and tested compounds were added 24 hours after infection and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 days. The cells and parasites were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with 5 µM Draq5 (Biostatus DR50200) in PBS. Fluorescent images (4 images per well) were acquired from each assay well using an Opera confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer) with a 635 nm laser at 20× lens magnification.</p>

        <p>The acquired images were analyzed with an Image Mining (IM) platform developed in-house. The IM software directly accessed the databases of image acquisition platforms and created a flow of images, which were sequentially analyzed by dedicated algorithms developed as plugins of the software. The results of all analyses were stored in a centralized database.</p>
        <p>Using a simple DNA staining technique to permit the use of wild-type parasites without any reporter gene was interesting because its quantification relied solely on the accuracy of the image analysis, and it permitted various parasite species to be used without the need for genetic manipulation. The DNA staining proved to be a simple and stable cell marker, and the image analysis software plugin that was developed took into account both the accuracy and speed constraints of HCS. Several methods were tested, and some steps were necessary to detect cells and parasites to obtain a robust separation between the positive and negative controls. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1</xref> presents a flow chart of those steps.</p>

        <p>The quantification of the infection ratio consisted of cell segmentation based on nuclei and parasite detection components. The two components were processed independently from the same raw input image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and merged to identify individual cells and assign detected parasites to each cell object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1J</xref>).</p>
        <p>The cell segmentation was as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1B–E</xref>): the raw input image was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Buades1">[14]</xref> of standard deviation 5, which roughly corresponds to the radius of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Then, the local extreme detection method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Kuijper1">[15]</xref> was applied to the smoothed image to extract local maxima points, which indicated the number and positions of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Subsequently, the inner boundaries of the individual cells were identified by computing the Voronoi diagram <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Karavelas1">[16]</xref> on the foreground area using the previously obtained set of local maxima as seed points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Finally, a foreground mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) was applied to the Voronoi diagram image to remove background area. For the parasite detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1F–I</xref>), the algorithm calculated the higher 50% cumulative intensity level of the raw input image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), used a threshold cut-off in the image based on the intensity level to remove background area and the cytoplasm of cells to isolate nuclei and parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>) and, finally, used the connected component labeling method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Suzuki1">[17]</xref> to filter out nuclei objects and other artifacts by detecting as parasites the connected component objects that were simultaneously larger than 4 pixels and smaller than 15 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1I</xref>). The final result from a processed image is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Fig. 1J</xref>), with cell detection and segmentation merged with parasite detection.</p>

        <p>The screening assay was based on the use of late-stage promastigote <italic>Leishmania</italic> cultures to infect differentiated THP-1 macrophages and the quantification of the infection ratio 4 days after compound addition.

The use of 5- or 6-day-old late-log-phase promastigote cultures resulted in higher infection ratios because of the enrichment of metacyclic promastigotes in the culture media, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-daLuz1">[23]</xref>.

        <p>Reference drugs and assay compounds were added to the plate 24 hours after infection. The protocol was intended to select compounds active against intracellular amastigotes. To demonstrate that within this time interval the late stage promastigotes had been phagocytized by macrophages and had differentiated into amastigotes within the macrophages, we visualized the intracellular replication of the parasite using a BrdU incorporation assay. The presence of incorporated BrdU, as detected by immunofluorescence, demonstrated that 24 hours after infection, the intracellular parasites were indeed differentiated into amastigotes and were replicating inside the host cell. This result validated the protocol of adding compounds 24 hours after infection to target intracellular amastigotes. The same replication assay was also performed 4 days after infection. Pictures were taken in different focal planes, and a 3D model was built, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s007">Movie S1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> shows snapshots of the 3D model.

        <title>Assay optimization and HTS adaptation</title>
        <p>When high throughput is considered for biological experiments, the assay must be adapted to best fit the requirements of the large scale. However, to compare results from different laboratories, we developed a <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection standard protocol adapted to an HCS/HTS method, with the potential for implementation on a smaller laboratory scale without the need for automation. To define this standard protocol, several conditions were tested to find the highest and most reproducible infection ratio, using <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasites to define and validate the assay. The parasite containers were one of the tested variables, comparing a T175 flask with a 1.0 L Erlenmeyer bottle under agitation, being the latter the best option (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also tested the effect of PMA concentration and incubation time on THP-1 cell differentiation, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s002">Figure S2</xref>, showing that 50 ng/ml yielded best results. The method for releasing differentiated THP-1 cells was also important for the preservation and integrity of the cells, and different approaches were tested, being trypsinization the chosen method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To evaluate the pharmacological relevance of the assay, we tested four different anti-leishmanial reference drugs in our system: amphotericin B, miltefosine, paromomycin and sodium stibogluconate. Dose-response curves (DRC) were determined in three independent experiments, with four replicates used to define the EC<sub>50</sub>s. The results for each reference drug are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001671-t001">Table 1</xref>. The EC<sub>50</sub>s of all of the reference drugs were comparable to the reported values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Seifert1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Vermeersch1">[24]</xref>, thus validating this new assay system for compound screening. Miltefosine is a known anti-cancer drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-vanBlitterswijk1">[25]</xref>, and, at the EC<sub>100</sub> dose, cytotoxicity was observed for the THP-1 host cell, an acute monocytic leukemia cell line. Sodium stibogluconate did not eliminate intracellular parasites in the experiment; this compound is known to be poorly active <italic>in vitro</italic>, and its slow effect was incompatible with the exposure time window for our experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-daLuz1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Rijal1">[26]</xref>. Paromomycin was not efficient either in eliminating intracellular <italic>L. donovani</italic> from the THP-1 host; its activity was inconsistent, and it was inactive in some experiments, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Seifert1">[19]</xref>. This variability is not acceptable for HTS purposes. We chose amphotericin B as a reference drug in the screening assay because it had an EC<sub>50</sub> in the target range for new active compounds (nanomolar), was stable, was not cytotoxic up to 20 µM and showed reproducible results. In addition, amphotericin B is a first-line drug used for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in many endemic countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Alvar1">[4]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Assay automation and HTS validation</title>
        <p>Because the assay was conducted with live parasites and host cells over multiple days, a fully automated (<italic>i.e.</italic>, unattended) protocol was not feasible. However, several time-consuming and repetitive steps in the assay were automated, enabling a potential throughput of ∼20,000 wells per screening day. An infection batch of host cells and parasites was added to the plates with a bulk dispenser (Wellmate, Thermo Scientific). The plates were then loaded onto the automated platform for compound addition, incubation and reading (all automated steps).</p>
        <p>The first step in automation is the scale-up of the assay. In this case, cells and reagents were prepared at the same scale as the one to be used during an HTS campaign and compared to the results for a small scale preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Each of the liquid handling devices to be used in the automation process was individually validated for accuracy and reproducibility. The assay validation consisted of the simulation of 3 independent screening days using only control plates. Each run was composed of 20 plates, 10 DRC plates containing amphotericin B as the reference drug and 10 DMSO plates as the negative control. The validation was performed on a cell::explorer™ automated platform with an Opera confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer) for imaging.</p>
        <p>The validation run using the semi-automated screening method and the results indicated that the assay was robust, both within a screening day and across screening days. Within a screening day, the number of THP-1 cells in both the DMSO controls and the amphotericin B (EC<sub>100</sub>) wells was similar, indicating that the cell number was consistent between the control and DMSO wells, within a plate and across multiple plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Based on the infection ratio, there was a clear window between the DMSO controls and amphotericin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This window was consistent throughout the validation day and across multiple validation days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The assay also showed a consistent EC<sub>50</sub> in the range of 0.3 µM for the reference compound, amphotericin B, between screening days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). The Z' factor within a validation day and across multiple days was 0.5, indicating that the assay was high quality.

An independent screen was performed using the same compound library (26,500) at 20 µM against <italic>L. donovani</italic> using the new infection assay described in this study. The number of hits based on a 55% activity cut-off (3 standard deviations from the negative control average), no cytotoxicity against differentiated THP-1 (based on cell counting) and an EC<sub>50</sub>&lt;20 µM was 123 compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s006">Figure S6</xref>), coincidently almost the same number of hits selected in the promastigote screening. From the 123 hit compounds, 62 showed activity against promastigotes. We also confirmed these data, in which only 51% of the hits obtained from the intracellular amastigotes (24 compounds out of 47 hits) were also active against the promastigote form, by screening a focused library of 4,000 kinase and phosphatase inhibitors using <italic>L. donovani</italic> (data not shown). The results from the 26,500 compounds are illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001671.s006">Figure S6</xref> and provide evidence that performing screens with intracellular amastigote forms would increase the probability of finding compounds active against the human form of the parasite (amastigote) and would be the most appropriate way to find compounds that exclusively target the intracellular form that infects the host cell.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>HTS technology has been primarily associated with target-based assays. This approach requires substantial efforts prior to screening to identify and validate a target involved in the disease process. Once a target is identified and validated, compounds can be screened against it to identify inhibitors in either biochemical (e.g., purified enzyme) assays or cell-based (e.g., receptor internalization) assays. For non-infectious diseases, for which protein targets are known, a target-based screening approach is very relevant. In contrast, targeting the causative infectious agent as a whole is an interesting approach for parasitic or other infectious diseases. Indeed, if one considers the field of antibacterials, target-based screens have been fairly unsuccessful in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Payne1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We describe here the development of a new screening assay to identify new compounds active against <italic>Leishmania</italic>. This assay selects for a specific phenotype (absence or reduction of parasites in macrophage host cells), and this parameter is used to measure compound activity; all potential targets will thus be exposed to the tested compounds, thereby increasing the probability of finding active compounds with different modes of action in an optimized fashion.</p>
      <p>Reporter genes have been successfully developed for anti-leishmanial HTS by various research groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Sereno1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Dube1">[29]</xref>. However, a major drawback of current reporter assay approaches was the need for continuous drug selection to maintain expression of the reporter gene over time. For <italic>Leishmania</italic>, this is particularly true for both episomal transient transfection and integrated transgenes, because the parasite has high genomic plasticity and a high recombination ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Squina1">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, the use of selection drugs can be problematic because they may directly or indirectly interact with the tested compound, interfering with the screening results. Recently, two independent research groups presented stable modified <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites expressing GFP that are suitable for compound testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Pulido1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Bolhassani1">[32]</xref>. Although engineered parasites are an invaluable tool in drug screenings, the use of wild-type organisms should be prioritized whenever possible because of potential for modifications in the general metabolism of the organism, due to expression of the transgene, resulting, for example, in a loss of virulence, as reported by de Toledo and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-deToledo1">[33]</xref> and as observed during this study with GFP-expressing <italic>L. donovani</italic> (data not shown). The use of wild-type parasites allows for the anti-leishmanial activity of compounds to be evaluated against different species of parasites, including clinical isolates, without the need for any genetic modification of these parasites. This approach required the development of a new tool for the image analysis of the parasite-infected cells: because DNA staining was the chosen method, the image analysis algorithm used had to identify each host cell as an isolated object, while also detecting intracellular parasites, all from the same image channel. Cell segmentation was the first challenge. By choosing the Voronoi diagram method, we were able to identify the inner boundaries of individual cells. The foreground mask applied to the Voronoi diagram image was then used to remove the background area, excluding all extracellular parasites from the analysis. The foreground mask was defined by pixels with intensity greater than 50. We observed that, given the stability of the image statistics across the screen and the good contrast between foreground and background, a fixed value was a robust way of separating foreground and background across the entire set of images. We tested several precise segmentation methods, such as region growing or a watershed algorithm, to measure the influence of the methods on the analysis results, and concluded that there was no significant difference in the infection ratio when precise segmentation methods or Voronoi diagrams were used. However, computational cost was much lower when we used the Voronoi diagram. In addition, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites could be detected inside the boundaries of each cell in the same image.</p>
      <p>Image-based processing is a promising approach for chemical screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-Carpenter1">[34]</xref>. In our study, using a single channel for fluorescence labeling of both the host cells and parasites considerably simplified the technical complexity of the assay, but created a computational challenge for selectively classifying cells and parasites from the same fluorescence signal channel. An algorithm was developed and implemented to automatically process the readout images, allowing the analysis of the huge amount of data generated from the screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001671-g002">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The development of an accurate tool to quantify the infection ratio enabled the measurement and comparison of compound activity against the intracellular stage of the parasite. This result, in addition to validating the biological model by confirming that replicative intracellular <italic>L. donovani</italic> can infect a human macrophage cell line, establishes this system as the most relevant and promising for the discovery of new compounds for leishmaniasis treatment.</p>
      <p>In addition to the infection ratio and parasite number, another parameter widely used to assess compound cytotoxicity is the number of host cells. Potentially toxic compounds that affect replication or cell multiplication will not be detected as toxic based on host cell counting because THP-1 cells usually do not replicate after differentiation, resulting in a constant cell number. However, compounds that induce necrosis or apoptosis or interfere with the adherence of the macrophages to the surface will be interpreted as toxic because of the low host cell number.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this newly developed standard protocol for the <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection model allowed the screening of 200,000 compounds at 20 µM for anti-parasitic activity in a high-throughput mode using optimal conditions, to be reported elsewhere. A subset of this library (26,500 compounds) has also been screened at 10 µM by our group against the promastigote form of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites in a fluorimetric assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-SiqueiraNeto1">[12]</xref>. Approximately 50% of the hits found in the intracellular amastigote assay were not found in the hit list obtained against the promastigote form. Conversely, only 4% of the hits from the promastigote screen were active against the intracellular amastigote. Even though the screenings used different species of parasites (<italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes and <italic>L. donovani</italic> intracellular amastigotes), we consider this difference relevant because we recently obtained similar data when screening a focused library of 4,000 compounds using only the <italic>L. donovani</italic> strain. These data are in accordance with recently published work from Muylder et al., which shows that using the promastigote form in a primary screen leads to a great number of hits that are likely to be inactive on the amastigote, and misses active compounds that are only found when using the intracellular amastigote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001671-DeMuylder1">[35]</xref>. Taken together, these results illustrate that a substantial number of compounds may be specifically active against intracellular amastigotes and would only be selected as true positive hits if tested in this screening system, supporting the proposal that the intracellular amastigote model is the most appropriate for drug discovery in leishmaniasis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the development and validation of this HTS protocol for <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection of human macrophages without the need for a reporter gene is a major breakthrough in the field of leishmaniasis drug discovery. It fills a major gap and should allow the screening of diverse and focused compound library sets, opening up a new avenue for the identification of new compound series, which are critically needed to develop new drugs for the treatment of Leishmaniasis. The combination of a infection model with image-based analysis has proven to be a relevant method for screening compounds for their activity against the intracellular amastigote <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, this protocol is well established for HTS and may be used on a smaller scale, such as in 96-well plates or even in lower throughput, in any research laboratory to test single compounds and/or natural product extracts.</p>
