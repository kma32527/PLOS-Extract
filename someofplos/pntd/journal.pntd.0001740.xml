          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Scorpion venom induces systemic inflammation characterized by an increase in cytokine release and chemokine production. There have been few experimental studies assessing the effects of scorpion venom on adipose tissue function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>To study the adipose tissue inflammation (ATI) induced by <italic>Androctonus australis hector</italic> (<italic>Aah</italic>) venom and to assess possible mechanisms of ATI, mice (n = 6, aged 1 month) were injected with <italic>Aah</italic> (0.45 mg/kg), toxic fraction of <italic>Aah</italic> (FTox-G50; 0.2 mg/kg) or saline solution (control). Inflammatory responses were evaluated by ELISA and cell sorting analyses in adipose tissue 45 minutes and 24 hours after injection. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the regulation of genes implicated in glucose uptake. The titers of selected inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were also determined in sera and in insulin target tissues. The serum concentration of IL-1β rose 45 minutes after envenomation and returned to basal level after 24 hours. The pathophysiological effects of the venom after 24 hours mainly involved M1-proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue combined with high titers of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Indeed, TNF-α was strongly induced in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. We studied the effects of <italic>Aah</italic> venom on genes implicated in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Insulin induced a significant increase in the expression of the mRNAs for hexokinase 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in control mice; this upregulation was completely abolished after 24 hours in mice envenomed with <italic>Aah</italic> or FTox-G50.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our findings suggest that <italic>Aah</italic> venom induces insulin resistance by mechanisms involving TNF-α-dependent Map4k4 kinase activation in the adipose tissue.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Androctonus australis hector</italic> (<italic>Aah</italic>) is the scorpion most frequently causing serious human envenomation. In Algeria, <italic>Aah</italic> is responsible for approximately 50,000 cases of scorpion envenomation per year. The <italic>Aah</italic> sting causes multi-system failure that may be fatal; the manifestations include cardiopulmonary abnormalities, lung edema and inflammation. In addition, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia have been described in scorpion-envenomed animals. The mechanisms causing systemic and local inflammation are poorly understood. Here, we report that <italic>Aah</italic> venom causes pronounced upregulation of <italic>TNF-α, IL1-β</italic> and <italic>IL-6</italic> expression in the adipose tissue, exacerbating inflammation. As the inflammatory state intensifies, 24 hours after envenomation, <italic>TNF-α</italic> and other factors are upregulated, and <italic>Map4k4</italic> expression increases, blunting the insulin response in adipocytes by decreasing Hexokinase 2 expression. Administration of TNF-α inhibitor following the envenomation reduces Map4k4 expression and restores glucose uptake in adipose tissue. These findings provide coherent evidence linking <italic>Aah</italic> venom-induced adipose tissue inflammation to insulin resistance. The value of TNF-α inhibitors as a treatment complementary to anti-scorpion venom immunotherapy should be evaluated clinically.</p>

Several studies report that the sympathetic nervous system regulates the expression of several adipo-cytokines through adipocyte beta-adrenergic receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Bartness1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Fu1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Adipose tissue secretes various cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6 and adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin involved in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Hotamisligil1">[8]</xref>. Overproduction of TNF-α in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle contributes to insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Plomgaard1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, TNF-α can stimulate the production of other cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6 and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP1), which can induce insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Fasshauer1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Sartipy1">[11]</xref>. TNF-α selectively stimulates the expression of a key component of its own signaling pathway, Mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase isoform 4 (Map4k4), through a TNFR1-dependent mechanism to induce insulin resistance in adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Tesz1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia have been reported in scorpion envenomed animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Choudhry1">[13]</xref>. Although the biological activity of scorpion venom on insulin resistance is clearly established, the mechanisms involved are unknown. We have investigated the effects of scorpion venom on glucose uptake in adipose tissue. We tested the contribution, if any, of TNF-α to the modulation of insulin sensitivity after envenomation. We found that following venom injection, TNF-α increases Map4k4 expression in adipose tissue, promoting insulin resistance. The use of a chemical inhibitor (etanercept) of TNF-α binding to its receptor reduced Map4k4 expression and restored the glucose uptake in adipose tissue following envenomation.</p>

        <title>Impaired glucose tolerance and decreased action of insulin on the peripheral tissues of <italic>Aah</italic> venom- and FTox-G50- injected mice</title>
        <p>We tested whether total <italic>Aah</italic> venom and its toxic fraction (FTox-G50) caused glucose intolerance. Young adult mice (1 month-old) were injected with <italic>Aah</italic> venom or FTox-G50, and fasted for 6 hours during the day. Fasting blood glucose levels were significantly higher in <italic>Aah</italic> venom- and FTox-G50-treated mice than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001740-g001">Figures 1A, 1C</xref>). Following glucose injection, blood glucose levels were twice as high in envenomated mice as in control mice. The glucose level in mice injected with <italic>Aah</italic> venom returned to the basal level after 120 min whereas blood glucose levels remained elevated in mice injected with FTox-G50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001740-g001">Figures 1A, 1C</xref>; P&lt;0.001). Glucose intolerance can result from the absence of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or a decreased action of insulin in the peripheral tissues, or both. We therefore assayed plasma insulin in mice injected with <italic>Aah</italic> venom and FTox-G50 after 45 min and 24 hours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001740-t002">Table 2</xref>). Forty-five min after envenomation, the plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in mice injected with <italic>Aah v</italic>enom or FTox-G50 (0.6 to 1.66 µg/l and 0.61 to 2.41 µg/l, respectively), than in controls (0.28 to 0.48 µg/l). This hyperinsulinemia persisted for 24 hours after envenomation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001740-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, <italic>Aah</italic> venom and FTox-G50 block the action of insulin, resulting in glucose intolerance.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Scorpion venoms contain a diversity of neurotoxins, including two major polypeptide populations. One consists of several classes of long-chain peptides (60–70 amino acid residues) affecting Na<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Gordon1">[17]</xref>, and the other includes short-chain toxins affecting K<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Huys1">[18]</xref>, Cl<sup>−</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-DeBin1">[19]</xref> and Ca2<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Valdivia1">[20]</xref>. All these toxins have direct effects on the ion permeability of excitable cells. The venom of the scorpion <italic>Buthus occitanus tunetanus</italic> (<italic>Bot</italic>) also contains compounds that activate other cell functions in non-excitable cells, such as adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-DriraChaabane1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Soudani1">[22]</xref>. The addition of <italic>Bot</italic> venom to the culture media of 3T3-L1 adipocytes or freshly dissociated rat adipocytes rapidly increases lipolysis, as indicated by glycerol release, and does so in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Soudani1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this work, we demonstrate that scorpion venom can reduce insulin sensitivity in mice. This further strengthens the idea that venom may cause insulin resistance, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Choudhry1">[13]</xref>. Our findings confirm present reports that scorpion venom induces systemic and local inflammation. In particular, we demonstrate that following envenomation, the expression pattern of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) changes substantially in adipose tissue concomitant with infiltration by pro-inflammatory macrophages. Interestingly, TNF-α treatment reduces Map4k4 expression and restores glucose uptake in adipose tissue following envenomation. These observations suggest that decreased insulin sensitivity in mice injected with venom is mainly driven by TNF-α.</p>
      <p>Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia have been described in scorpion envenomed animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Choudhry1">[13]</xref>. We observed increased in fed glucose levels 45 min after <italic>Aah</italic> envenomation. This hyperglycemia did not worsen over the subsequent hours following envenomation, although the hyperinsulinemia persisted many hours after envenomation. Possibly this persistence of hyperinsulinemia, most likely as a result of increasing β-cell hyperplasia, serves to compensate and regulate the glucose level such that it returns to normal values.</p>
      <p>The effects of inflammation and infiltration of macrophages on adipose tissue function and insulin resistance have been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Hotamisligil2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Weisberg1">[24]</xref>. Macrophage recruitment into adipose tissue plays a key role in the etiology of diet-induced insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Weisberg1">[24]</xref>. The phenotypes exhibited by tissue macrophages correspond to a M1–M2 polarization state: M1 cells are defined as activated pro-inflammatory macrophages and M2 cells comprise an anti-inflammatory macrophage population. We observed that the total number of M2 cells that are positive for F4/80 and CD11b but negative for CD11c expression in l adipose tissue did not increase following envenomation, whereas the number of M1-like macrophages (F4/80 high, CD11b high, CD11c+) increased significantly. These results are consistent with the view that these proinflammatory CD11c+ macrophages are the cause of the macrophage-linked component of inflammation/insulin resistance; indeed genetic deletion of these cells is sufficient to normalize obesity-induced inflammation, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Manaios1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the increased numbers of M1-like macrophages in adipocyte tissue in mice injected with venom explains the elevated secretion of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β and thereby contributes to the low grade inflammation and insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>Adipocytes secrete a number of molecules, including leptin, TNF-α, IL-6, and resistin, that modulate peripheral insulin sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Hotamisligil1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Fasshauer2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-McGillicuddy1">[28]</xref>. Consistent with this, we found that TNF-α concentrations in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were increased following injection of <italic>Aah</italic> venom or the FTox-G50 fraction. TNF-α stimulates the expression of key components of its own signaling pathway, notably Map4k4, through a TNFR1-dependent mechanism to induce insulin resistance in adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Tesz1">[12]</xref>. Another study has shown that insulin resistance can be abolished by Map4k4 silencing in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Bouzakri1">[16]</xref>. Here, we show that venom injection significantly increased Map4k4 gene expression and that inhibition of TNF-α significantly reduced <italic>Map4k4</italic> gene expression in adipose tissue. The specificity of TNF-α action on Map4k4 is due to the unique phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 SAP kinase that leads to activation of the transcription factors c-JUN and ATF2, which in turn are required for the regulation of Map4k4 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Tesz1">[12]</xref>. Our observations are consistent with these findings and indicate that the decreased insulin sensitivity observed following FTox-G50 injection is mediated by an increase in the TNF-α concentration in adipose tissue, which selectively stimulates the expression of Map4k4 to cause insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>It may be an oversimplification to attribute adipose tissue inflammation to the effect of a single cytokine: it is likely that several cytokines act collectively to amplify the inflammatory response of adipose tissue. Indeed, we have demonstrated that the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in adipose tissue were increased by <italic>Aah</italic> venom and FTox-G50 treatment. However, note that although TNF-α increased in skeletal muscle after 24 hours of envenomation, no significant changes in IL-1β and IL-6 levels were detected. The major adipocytokines IL-1β and TNF-α act synergistically to enhance NFkB activation and secretion of IL-6 in adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-McGillicuddy1">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, the ability of TNF-α to induce IL-6 secretion is blunted in IL-1RI−/− adipose tissue, suggesting that TNF-α-induced IL-6 is in part mediated by IL-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-McGillicuddy1">[28]</xref>. The ability of TNF-α to induce IL-6 secretion has also been demonstrated in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Bouzakri1">[16]</xref>. It is therefore plausible that increased IL-6 expression in adipose tissue after envenomation may be due to TNF-α production, suggesting that TNF-α and IL-1β work in concert to cause insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms of activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue following envenomation remain unclear. Adipose tissue in rodents is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, which can regulate lipolysis, fat cell number, and the secretion of some adipocytokines, such as TNF-α and MCP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Bartness1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Fu1">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system in mice increases following envenomation, an effect mediated by catecholamines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Bartness1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Fu1">[7]</xref>. In addition, the activity of sympathetic nervous system can contribute to insulin resistance through effects of catecholamines on adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Bartness1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-Fu1">[7]</xref>. Nevertheless, our results do not rule out the possibility that the expression of adipocytokines is regulated through β-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological profiles of molecules acting more selectively on β-adrenergic receptor subtypes strongly suggest that the lipolytic action of <italic>Bot</italic> venom mainly involves the β2/β1 subtype of adrenergic receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001740-DriraChaabane1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we report that <italic>Aah</italic> venom and its toxic fraction induce M1-like macrophages accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance in adipose tissue. We demonstrate an increase in TNF-α release causing upregulation of Map4k4 expression that disrupts the normal metabolic function of adipose tissue and thereby leads to insulin resistance. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of TNF-α in animals injected with scorpion venom may restore metabolic function and subsequently improve insulin sensitivity. This study provides consistent evidence linking adipose tissue inflammation to the insulin resistance induced by <italic>Aah</italic> venom. We believe that it would be useful to assess the value of TNF-α inhibitors for the complementary treatment of scorpion envenomation.</p>
