      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parasitic protozoa are important agents of human and veterinary diseases, which are widely distributed throughout the world. The parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, which is the causal agent of the human disease known as Chagas disease, affects approximately 8 million people and causes more than 14,000 deaths per year in Latin America. It is estimated that in Brazil there are around 2 million individuals infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001749-Secretaria1">[1]</xref>. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> has a complex life cycle involving both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in three well-defined developmental stages: (1) amastigotes, which are the proliferative forms found inside the vertebrate host cells; (2) epimastigotes, which are the proliferative forms found in the intestine of the invertebrate host; and (3) trypomastigotes, which are highly infective and originate from the amastigotes at the end of the intracellular cycle following their release into the intercellular space and into bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001749-Tyler1">[2]</xref>. Trypomastigotes also arise from epimastigotes in the posterior regions of the digestive tract of the invertebrate host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001749-Pollock1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present work aims to use a cell biologic approach to create multimedia materials that present basic aspects of the life cycle of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and the morphology of its various developmental stages, as well as some biological processes such a division, motility, and endocytic activity.</p>
      <p>The current teaching method is based upon formal lectures using classic material with little emphasis on the use of three-dimensional (3D) animation models. In this report, we present new instructional material with modern schemes and dynamic models that include 3D animations (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pntd-0001749-box001">Box 1</xref>). These educational tools will be useful for a broad audience, which includes students in face-to-face and distance education, teachers, researchers, and any member of the general public that are interested in parasites. As an instructional tool, the animations are more effective than the static graphics for teaching dynamic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001749-Tversky1">[4]</xref>. Studies in biology courses have shown that animations lead to increased student understanding and retention of cell biology information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001749-McClean1">[5]</xref>.</p>

            <title>General view depicting the stages of amastigote division by binary fission.</title>
            <p>(A) In the preliminary phase of cell division, the nucleus displays condensed chromatin and a single nucleolus. (B) The early phase of the division process begins with the decondensation of chromatin and the disappearance of the nucleolus. (C) In the equatorial stage, there is early lateral growth of the kinetoplast and the appearance of a new basal body. This change is followed by the appearance of an arranged set of ten dense plaques in the equatorial region of the nucleus. These plaques are associated with an intranuclear spindle formed by microtubules. (D) The early elongational phase begins with the splitting of dense plaques, which migrate toward the nucleus poles. The nucleus elongates, and the spindle microtubules modify their distribution. The new flagellum emerges from the flagellar pocket. (E) In the final phase of elongation, the split dense plaques begin to migrate toward the nucleus poles, which exhibit an hourglass shape. This form represents the last stage of nucleus constriction. (F) In the reorganizative phase, the microtubules fade out in a stepwise fashion, the nucleolus begins to reconstitute, and the chromatin begins to condense. In this phase, the nuclei and kinetoplasts are already individualized. (G) At the stage of constriction, cytokinesis occurs and culminates with the formation of two independent amastigotes (H).

            <p> (A) Endocytosis occurs in two sites of macromolecular ingestion: the cytostome-cytopharinx complex and the flagellar pocket. (B) In cytostome-cytopharinx complex the macromolecules migrate through the cytopharynx and are internalized via small vesicles, which are formed in the final portion of the cytopharynx. (C) Subsequently, the macromolecules cross through the early tubular endosomal network and are delivered to a reservosome (D). (E) The macromolecules are also internalized via vesicles that form in the flagellar pocket. (F) The endocytic pathway continues through a network of long tubules and vesicles extending to the posterior end of the cell body, returning to the opposite direction and eventually merging with the reservosome. (G) Our model also suggests that cruzipain molecules, as well as other proteases, are processed and leave the Golgi complex. (H) Vesicles containing these molecules also interact with the endocytic pathway and are transported to reservosomes. These images were made based on micrographs of transmission electron microscopy.</p>

(E) At the most posterior region, many of the epimastigotes transform into metacyclic trypomastigotes and adhere to the cuticle lining the epithelium of the rectum and the rectal sac of the insect.

        <title>The Interaction of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> with Vertebrate Host Cells</title>
        <p>As part of the life cycle, the infective trypomastigote and amastigote forms of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> interact with different types of cells in the mammalian hosts, such as macrophages, muscle cells, epithelial cells, and neurons. This interaction has been studied in some detail in cell culture (both phagocytic and non-professional phagocytic cells). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001749-g009">Figures 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001749-g010"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001749-g011">11</xref> and the next three videos illustrate the macrophage interactions with the non-infective epimastigotes as well as the infective amastigote and trypomastigote forms. For epimastigotes, the destruction of the intravacuolar parasite occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001749-g009">Figure 9</xref>, video: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imbebb.org.br/conteudo.asp?idsecao=247" xlink:type="simple">http://www.imbebb.org.br/conteudo.asp?idsecao=247</ext-link>). In trypomastigotes, fusion of the lysosomes with the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) occurs even during gradual transformation of trypomastigotes into amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001749-g010">Figure 10</xref>, video: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imbebb.org.br/conteudo.asp?idsecao=246" xlink:type="simple">http://www.imbebb.org.br/conteudo.asp?idsecao=246</ext-link>).
