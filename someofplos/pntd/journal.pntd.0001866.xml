          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>To understand the basis for this difference we examined differential gene expression of human monocyte-derived macrophages following exposure to <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic>. Gene activation profiles were determined using macrophages from healthy volunteers cultured with or without stationary phase promastigotes of <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic>. Significant changes in expression (&gt;1.5-fold change; p&lt;0.05; up- or down-regulated) were identified at 0.5, 4 and 24 hours. mRNA abundance profiles varied over time, with the highest level of activation occurring at earlier time points (0.5 and 4 hrs). In contrast to observations for other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, most significantly changed mRNAs were up- rather than down-regulated, especially at early time points. Up-regulated transcripts over the first 24 hours belonged to pathways involving eicosanoid metabolism, oxidative stress, activation of PKC through G protein coupled receptors, or mechanism of gene regulation by peroxisome proliferators via PPARα. Additionally, a marked activation of Toll-receptor mediated pathways was observed. Comparison with published microarray data from macrophages infected with <italic>L. (Leishmania) chagasi</italic> indicate differences in the regulation of genes involved in signaling, motility and the immune response.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Results show that the early (0.5 to 24 hours) human monocyte-derived macrophage response to <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic> is not quiescent, in contrast to published reports examining later response times (48–96 hours). Early macrophage responses are important for the developing cellular response at the site of infection. The kinetics and the mRNA abundance profiles induced by <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic> illustrate the dynamics of these interactions and the distinct biologic responses to different <italic>Leishmania</italic> species from the outset of infection within their primary host cell.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites cause a spectrum of diseases (cutaneous, visceral and the deforming forms—chronic cutaneous and mucocutaneous) known as leishmaniasis. The macrophage, a key cell in the immune system, is the cellular target of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites in the mammalian host. Previous studies showed the responses of monocytederived macrophages from naturally infected humans to infection with <italic>Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis</italic> were key to adaptive immune responses and clinical outcome. Consequently, an mRNA microarray approach was employed to assess the changes in macrophage gene expression over time (0.5 to 24 hours) induced by <italic>L. panamensis</italic>. The highest level of gene expression induction occurred early (0.5–4 hours); the early pathways (groups of genes) activated included those involved in the innate immune response (signaling, phagocytosis, TLR activation, and inflammatory). Early gene activation is presumed to be important for the developing cellular milieu at the site of infection. By 24 hours post-infection the dominant pathways involved metabolic functions. However, a comparison of the macrophage response to <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic> to that of <italic>L. (L.) chagasi</italic> (causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis) at 24 hours revealed a differential up-regulation of genes (cell adhesion, signaling, and inflammation) in response to these species. These observations underscore the distinct biology of different <italic>Leishmania</italic> species from the outset of infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Leishmania</italic> species are obligate intracellular parasites, of extensive public health importance in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. <italic>Leishmania</italic> organisms produce a wide spectrum of diseases.Depending upon the species initiating infection and on the immunological status of the host, disease manifestations range from simple cutaneous to chronic cutaneous, mucocutaneous, diffuse cutaneous and visceralleishmaniasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Farrell1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Peters1">[4]</xref>. Overall control of leishmaniasis has been associated with amoderate type1 CD4 response (IFNγ); whereas excessive down-regulation of this response through the action of various type 2 associated cytokines (e.g. IL-13, IL-10, IL-4) has been related with disease exacerbation.</p>
      <p>However, the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis remain to be fully understood.Notably parasites in the <italic>Leishmania (Viannia)</italic> subgenus, which are prevalent in Central and South America and are associated with cutaneous (limited and chronic) as well as mucocutaneous disease, have not been extensively studied. Consequently, the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis are not as yet well characterized. In the case of mucosal disease, a hyperinflammatory response (IFNγ, TNFα) is evident with a down-regulation of IL-10R expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Pirmez1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Faria1">[8]</xref>. In contrast, a mixed cytokine response is observed across the spectrum of cutaneous infection (asymptomatic to chronic) caused by <italic>L. (Viannia)</italic> parasites, both IL-10 and IL-13 have been implicated in disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Bosque1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gaze1">[7]</xref>, . Recent studies utilizing a murine model of chronic infection havecorroboratedthe mixed cytokine response and role of IL-13 and IL-10 in the pathogenesis of<italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Castilho1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Differences in parasite gene expression patterns and differences in virulence factors (between various <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and between strains of the same species) undoubtedly contribute to the variation in leishmanial disease manifestations. However, genomic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Peacock1">[14]</xref> and indeed RNA expression profiles between the promastigote (insect stage) and amastigote (intracellular mammalian stage) have revealed a limited number of differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Akopyants1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Saxena1">[17]</xref>. Whereas the relationships between developmentally regulated <italic>Leishmania</italic> genes and parasite virulence or disease associated pathology are of interest, an alternate approach involves the investigation of parasite interactions with host cells. Such studies can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of the host-parasite dynamic.</p>
      <p>Central to the host-<italic>Leishmania</italic> relationship is the macrophage. These cells are fundamental to host defense through their functions in phagocytosis, destruction of the parasites and antigen presentation. <italic>Leishmania</italic> evade the host immune response and replicate inside macrophages establishing a long-term-infection, influencing macrophage gene expression and consequently, the microenvironment in which they persist. The macrophage response to infection is clearly involved in determining susceptibility/resistance in murine leishmaniasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Blackwell1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gomes1">[22]</xref>.

        <title>Time course and response to infection/exposure</title>
        <p>The infection of macrophages with a parasitic protozoan, such as <italic>Leishmania</italic>, is a complex event involving multiple cellular processes (including phagocytosisand the induction of cell signaling), that result in the expression of cytokines, and chemokines, and that ultimately impact upon the induction of the host immunological response (adaptive immunity). Furthermore, monocyte-derived macrophage physiological and metabolic responses change in response to the parasitism. In order to examine the development of the initial <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic> promastigote – monocyte-derived macrophage interaction, we studied the changes in gene transcripts at 0.5, 4 and 24 hours of infection/exposure using monocyte-derived macrophages from six healthy non-immune donors. Confounding adaptive immune response by residual lymphocytes was obviated by choosing donors known to live in areas non-endemic for leishmaniasis who were determined to be non-responsive to leishmanial antigen.</p>
        <p>MDM transcripts that were significantly up- or down-regulated as a consequence of interaction with <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001866-g001">Figure 1</xref>) included more than 500 genes. This response was attenuated at later time points. Notably, at the earliest observational points (0.5 and 4 hours of infection/exposure), a total of 523 and 587 genes, respectively, were found to be up-regulated, whereas by 24 hours this number had declined to 388. The geometric mean of fold-change in expression of the up-regulated transcripts also decreased with time going from 4.39 (0.5 hours) to 3.21 (4 hours) and 2.53 (24 hours). The number of transcripts that were significantly down-regulated remained relatively constant in response to infection/exposure with 43, 32 or 50 transcripts down-regulated at 0.5, 4 or 24 hours, respectively. In addition, the overall geometric mean-fold magnitude of transcript down-regulation was similar overtime (0.0636 (0.5 hours), 0.0366 (4 hours), 0.0486 (24 hours)). Whereas 26 gene transcripts were consistently down-regulated, the expressions of 55 transcripts were observed up-regulated at all three time points. Many of the consistently up- or down-regulated mRNAs encoded proteins involved in cell signaling or gene regulation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001866.s002">Table S2</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>Consistent with the apparent dampening of the response to infection between 4 and 24 hours after infection, the number of highly up-or down-regulated transcripts (expression&gt;5-fold) decreased with time. At 0.5 hours post-infection/exposure, 210 transcripts were found to be highly (≥5-fold) changed, whereas at 4 or 24 hours of infection the number of highly changed transcripts decreased to 151or 104, respectively. It was notable that amongst the highly regulated transcripts, many were changed at only one time point, with 105, 49 and 23 genes being unique to the 0.5, 4 and 24 hour time points, respectively, underscoring the changing dynamic of the macrophage response.</p>
        <p>Although fewer transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001866-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>) were down-regulated than up-regulated, a higher proportion of the down-regulated transcripts were consistently down-regulated (52 to 81%, dependent on the time point).Genes encoding these transcripts (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001866.s002">Table S2</xref></bold>)primarily encoded molecules involved in regulation of cell signaling (protein kinases, phosphatases) or molecular transport. Additionally, some of the genes whose expression was down-regulated in <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic> infected MDMs encoded proteins potentially affectingthe host's immunological control of the invading parasite. These include the receptor for MCP-1 (a known activator of macrophage mediated leishmanial killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Ritter1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Vasquez1">[39]</xref>) and the extracellular matrix protein, spondin 2, which has been shown to be involved in the initiation of the innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-He1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Li1">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>During the first 24 hours of infection, the majority of changes were transient; the gene expression profiles reflected a changing dynamic of the host-parasite interaction over the first 24 hours of infection.

        <p>The increase in expression between 30 minutes and 4 hours detected by microarray was corroborated by qRT-PCR for 4/5 of the genes. Although the fold changes in gene expression were more pronounced for some transcripts in the microarray (i.e. IL1-β, PTGS2), this variation is likely attributable to either the differences between hybridization versus qRT-PCR based amplification methods or by the fact that the experimental samples used for qRT-PCR were generated using PBMCs from individuals different than those employed for the microarray analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Rajeevan1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Su1">[44]</xref>. Notably, the range of the fold-increases (95% confidence levels) found was consistent for the two methods.</p>
        <p>In most cases the direction of change at the different time intervals was the same by both methods, although the expression of PTGS2 was up-regulated maximally at the 0.5 hour time point by qRT-PCR, whereas the transcript level was higher at the 4.0 hour time point according to the microarray analyses. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. The involvement of prostaglandin synthesis is consistent with other studies of macrophage infection/exposure with <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Afonso1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gregory1">[46]</xref> as well as our observations of the engagement of the Peroxisome Proliferators via PPARα (0.5, 4 and 24 hours) and Prostaglandin Synthesis and Regulation (GenMapp) pathways (4 and 24 hours)(<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001866.s003">Table S3</xref></bold>).

        <title>Pathway analysis</title>
        <p>To determine the biological processes at play, pathway analyses examining the co-ordinate regulation of specific gene groups were performed for each time point. The genes activated and the correlative pathways illustrate the dynamic nature of the <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic>-MDM interaction <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001866.s003">Table S3</xref></bold>).The outcome of pathway analysis at the three time points post-infection/interaction is consistent with sequential responses after phagocytosis. Thus, the pathways coordinately regulated are more similar at the 0.5 hour and 4.0 hours time points than at the 24 hour time point. The pathways induced early in infection/interaction participate in the induction of signal transduction due in part to phagocytosis. It should be noted that all pathways indicated were up-regulated, with respect to the transcripts analyzed.</p>
        <sec id="s3c1">
          <title>Pathways consistently up-regulated in response to <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic> infection/exposure</title>
          <p>Certain biological pathways were consistently up-regulated throughout the first 24 hours of infection/interaction. Those pathways continuously engaged include: 1) eicosanoid metabolism, 2) oxidative stress, 3) cadmium induces DNA synthesis and proliferation in macrophages, 4) activation of PKC through G protein coupled receptor and 5) mechanisms of gene regulation by peroxisome proliferators via PPARα.</p>
          <p>The oxidative stress response pathway elements elicited in response to infection/interaction primarily involved genes participating in the anti-oxidant response rather than the simultaneous up-regulation of genes involved in the repression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Interestingly at 24 hours, the mRNA products of SOD genes were increased 1.65 to 2.4 fold, at the same time as the transcripts encoding monoamine oxidase (MAO-A; 2.3fold), consistent with the preferential production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Notably, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> itself has been shown to regulate the transcription factor function of nuclear factor I (NFI) and hence, cytochrome P450 1A1(CYP1A1) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Morel1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Morel2">[48]</xref>, leading to the repression of ROS producing systems.The apparent activation of the oxidative stress response could indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages, in reaction to infection are protecting themselves against secondary effects of ROS generated to control the parasite. Such findings could lead to speculations as to whether this response enhances the survival of the macrophage or the parasite or both.</p>
          <p>Enhanced expression of transcripts of genes involved ineicosanoid metabolism could lead to an increased production of prostaglandins as well as the up-regulation of receptors for these mediators (prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, prostaglandin E receptor1, thromboxane A2 receptor). Although prostaglandins have known proinflammatory effects, prostaglandins are also known to induce the production of IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Harizi1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-BenBaruch1">[50]</xref>. Overall, evidence suggests that the activation of this pathway, as observed for other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, could lead todampening of the host defense to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Castes1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Matte1">[57]</xref>.</p>
          <p>The significance of the G-receptor activation pathway up-regulation likely relates to processes involved in phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Niedergang1">[58]</xref> and receptor-mediated signaling (NF-kB, protein kinase C, phospholipdase c and calcium-mediated) intrinsic to infection/uptake that have been reported to be induced by phagocytosis of non-infectious particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Niedergang1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Flannagan1">[59]</xref>. PPARα gene induction is associated with fatty acid metabolism and involves the up-regulation of ApoA and lipoprotein lipase, as well as LXRα and cJUN. PPARα expression can lead to the suppression of inflammatory mediators and potentially the development of alternately activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Crisafulli1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Hua1">[63]</xref>.

          <p>Up-regulated expression of transcripts encoding toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway proteins was evident at 0.5 hours andat 4 hours post-infection/interaction (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). TLRs have been implicated in the infections of other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<italic>L. major, L. amazonensis</italic>, and <italic>L. donovani</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Kropf1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Becker1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Liese1">[67]</xref>.</p>
          <p>TLR receptors are important elements of the innate response and can be key to the developing adaptive immune response. The leishmanial surface lipophsophoglycan (LPG) has been shown to interact with TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-deVeer1">[65]</xref>. However, <italic>L. (Viannia)</italic> parasites express low levels of LPG (10–20-fold less than other species of <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Muskus1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Soares2">[69]</xref>). Further, our recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gallego1">[70]</xref> indicate that <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic> elicits a response through TLR4 and intracellular TLR, which leads to the production of cytokines (such as TNFα) as early as 4 hours post-infection. It is possible that other TLRs known to be activated by other species of <italic>Leishmania</italic>, such as TLR9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Flandin1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Liese1">[67]</xref>, may also be involved in this response. As the P-8 proteoglycolipid complex that has been found to activate TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Whitaker1">[71]</xref> is not expressed by <italic>L. (Viannia) spp.</italic> parasites (McMahon-Pratt, unpublished observations), the ligand responsible for TLR4 activation remains to be determined. Interestingly, transcripts associated with the NFkB activation are up-regulated at the 0.5 and 4 hour time points and NF-κB activation has been found to up-regulate TLR2 expression. Increased expression of TLR2 has in fact been observed in human macrophages upon infection with <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gallego1">[70]</xref>. Hence TLR modulation represents a potential mode of either therapeutic or preventative intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Badaro1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Puig1">[76]</xref> to modulate leishmaniasis. A further understanding of these parasite-host interactions is important for the development of such approaches.</p>
          <p>Pathway analyses suggested that there are pronounced changes in expression of proteins relevant to signal transduction and macrophage activation in response to phagocytosis and infection by <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic>. Up-regulated expression of MAP kinases and NF-kB suggested that these pathways might be activated and similar increases in transcripts encoding several immunological mediators such as IL-6 and TNFα were consistent with this possibility. Increased expression of NF-kB, TNFα and IL-6 are also consistent with the TLR engagement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gallego1">[70]</xref>. Interestingly, TNF has also been reported to be selectively induced in the response of murine dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Carvalho1">[77]</xref> to <italic>Leishmania (V.) braziliensis</italic>. Both IL-6 and TNFα have been implicated in the pathology associated with human infection by members of the <italic>L.

          <title>Pathways up-regulated 24 hrs after infection by <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic></title>
          <p>Although the up-regulation of transcripts along some pathways was still evident, by 24 hours post-infection the magnitude of changes observed in many transcripts had diminished overall. The decreased response is consistent with what has been reported for the responses of macrophages at later times (24 to 96 hours) post-infection with other species of <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Ettinger1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Chaussabel1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Buates1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Gregory1">[46]</xref>. However, and in contrast to previous reports at 24 hours post-infection, many transcripts encoding genes related to the host immune response were still up-regulated in response to <italic>L. (Viannia) panamensis</italic> (CCL24 (eotaxin), TRAIL R1, IL3R, integrin β8, integrin β3(CD61), CD109), as well as cellular signaling (GTP binding protein, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP),Tec protein tyrosine kinase, phospholipase D2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAPK/ERK kinase kinase kinase 3), N-myristoyltransferase 2). Furthermore, by 24 hours post-infection, increased expression of genes involved in some metabolic pathways had become evident (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001866.s003">Table S3</xref></bold>). The nature of these metabolic pathways suggested changes in the cellular requirement for energy metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis and anti-oxidants (glutathione pathway). These changes are consistent with macrophage adaptation for the increased metabolic requirements in cells supporting the maintenance and replication of the intracellular <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>
          <p>Overall, the variation in gene regulation with time is critical in evaluating the macrophage responses to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection/interaction, as the initial innate immune responses are important for determining the inflammatory and ultimately acquired immune responses. Generally however, only one time point (generally ≥16 hours post-infection; well after these responses have diminished) has been examined in evaluatingthe response of human macrophages to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection/interaction. The conclusions from these studies have emphasized the poor/limited responses observed. However, it is clear that at earlier time points after interaction/infection a strong innate immunological response is induced. Further, microarray studies of macrophage infection with other organisms has revealed that there can be a temporal variation/progression with respect to gene induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Rodriguez1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Kim1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Weiss1">[84]</xref>, with an early induction of key immunological genes, that are not evident at later times post-interaction/infection. In this study, a dampening of the response was also noted with time. At 4 hours post-interaction/infection, there is a significant activation of genes involved in cell signaling and the innate immune response yet by 24 hours post-infection, the cells appear to be adapting to parasitism and changes in the metabolic features of the cell become evident. It should be noted that some of the down-regulation of innate immune/inflammatory response-related genes at 24 hours maybe an inevitable result of the <italic>in vitro</italic> system employed for these studies; since the diversity of cell types recruited during infection <italic>in vivo</italic> (and their contributory cytokines/chemokines) that would have further impact on the macrophage response are absent. The induction of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways is consistent with the mixed cytokine profile found in the acquired immune response to infection with <italic>L. (Viannia)</italic> parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-GomesSilva1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Faria1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Diaz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Castilho1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Castellucci1">[81]</xref>. Consequently, it is likely that this early response is important in determining the eventual host response to infection and may be representative of the potential acquired immune response that might develop.</p>
          <p>Finally, it should be stated that up-regulated gene expression of proteins along any pathway does not necessarily indicate that the function of this pathway is enhanced. Indeed, some transcripts could be increased because of a signal to activate a pathway whereas others could be compensatory and result from a need to modulate the up-regulated expression of an opposing pathway. The microarray data provides a panoramic view of pathways that may be involved in the cellular response to parasite invasion, but the actual nature of this response (as demonstrated for the TLR pathway response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-GomesSilva1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Faria1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Diaz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Castilho1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Castellucci1">[81]</xref>) should be further evaluated before conclusions are drawn.</p>

This is significant, as the macrophage response diminishes with time and it would be expected that fewer transcripts would remain elevated in the case of <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic>. Indeed, the dominant response to <italic>L. (L.) infantum/chagasi</italic> was down-regulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Ettinger1">[2]</xref>.

        <p>However, the mRNA levels for two genes, WAS protein family, member 2 (WASF2) and Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RAPGEF1) in contrast to down-regulation after infection with <italic>L. infantum/chagasi</italic>, were up-regulated in response to <italic>L. panamensis</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001866.s004">Table S4A</xref></bold>).

      <p>Prior studies of macrophage transcriptome indicate that changes in MDM gene expression in response to external stimuli (numbers of genes; inflammatory, anti-inflammatory) are highly variable and dependent upon the particle (inert or pathogen) ingested and nature of the exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Ehrt1">[91]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001866-Bourdonnay1">[94]</xref>. After interaction or infection with <italic>L. (V.) panamensis</italic>, results of the current report suggest that the early responses (0 to 4 hours) lead to up-regulation of transcripts contributing to an inflammatory state of the host macrophage. Specifically transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell signaling, inflammation and notably genes involved in the TLR pathways are co-coordinately up-regulated. Simultaneous increased expression of genes associated with anti-inflammatory responses including eicosanoid pathway and transiently IL-10 suggests that a critical balance may be required (between the inflammatory-anti-inflammatory pathways of the macrophage). It is possible that the level of these responses will determine the nature of the acquired immune response that develops and ultimately the outcome of infection or disease. These results substantiate significant differences between the macrophage responses induced by different <italic>Leishmania</italic> species. The macrophage provides critical functions throughout leishmaniasis, including antigen-presentation, parasite containment, and suppression or activation of nearby immune cells through released modulators. Consequently the observed differences in macrophage gene expression may contribute to the host-parasite dynamic in the different forms of leishmaniasis caused by <italic>L. panamensis</italic> and <italic>L. chagasi/infantum</italic>.</p>

Five pathways were consistently activated throughout the first 24 hours of infection: (1) eicosanoid metabolism, 2) oxidative stress, 3) cadmium induced DNA synthesis and proliferation in macrophages, 4) activation of PKC through G protein coupled receptor and 5) mechanisms of gene regulation by peroxisome proliferators via PPARα). Pathway analysis was performed to identify significantly affected pathways using the pathway database from the Yale Center for Statistical Genomics and Proteomics. The cutoff to cluster similar expressed genes in a significant pathways were 1.5× fold difference between the fluorescence signal intensity from a non-infected control and the <italic>L.(Viannia) panamensis</italic>-infected macrophage with a significance level of ≤0.05. The maximum co-ordinate activation appears at 4 hours; while at 24 hours, pathway analyses indicate ongoing metabolic changes.</p>
