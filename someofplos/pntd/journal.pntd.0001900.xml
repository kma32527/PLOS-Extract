          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Hookworm infections are one of the most important parasitic infections of humans worldwide, considered by some second only to malaria in associated disease burden. Single-dose mass drug administration for soil-transmitted helminths, including hookworms, relies primarily on albendazole, which has variable efficacy. New and better hookworm therapies are urgently needed. <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> crystal protein Cry5B has potential as a novel anthelmintic and has been extensively studied in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Here, we ask whether single-dose Cry5B can provide therapy against a hookworm infection and whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanism-of-action studies are relevant to hookworms.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>To test whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> invertebrate-specific glycolipid receptor for Cry5B is relevant in hookworms, we fed <italic>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic> hookworm adults Cry5B with and without galactose, an inhibitor of Cry5B-<italic>C. elegans</italic> glycolipid interactions. As with <italic>C. elegans</italic>, galactose inhibits Cry5B toxicity in <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic>. Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which controls one of the most important Cry5B signal transduction responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, is functionally operational in hookworms. <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> hookworms treated with Cry5B up-regulate p38 MAPK and knock down of p38 MAPK activity in hookworms results in hypersensitivity of <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> adults to Cry5B attack. Single-dose Cry5B is able to reduce by &gt;90% <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> hookworm burdens from infected hamsters, in the process eliminating hookworm egg shedding in feces and protecting infected hamsters from blood loss. Anthelmintic activity is increased about 3-fold, eliminating &gt;97% of the parasites with a single 3 mg dose (∼30 mg/kg), by incorporating a simple formulation to help prevent digestion in the acidic stomach of the host mammal.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Hookworm infections are one of the great parasitic diseases of our time, infecting more than half a billion people worldwide and are a significant source of iron-deficient anemia. Although mass drug administrations to eliminate hookworms from children and pregnant women are being deployed, all the drugs for treatment we have lack full potency against the parasites and are showing signs of reduced efficacy. Crystal proteins, like Cry5B, made by <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> are as a class considered safe to vertebrates and have been shown to have efficacy against intestinal roundworms like hookworms. Here we show that the key mechanistic details of how Cry5B functions in hookworms is conserved with that of the model free-living roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which has implications for confirming Cry5B safety in vertebrates and for enhancing Cry5B efficacy against roundworms. Furthermore, we show that Cry5B works effectively as a single-dose drug against hookworm infections in hamsters and can be formulated to increase its efficacy, eliminating 97% of the parasites in a single dose. These results advance the development of a novel, safe single-dose therapy for hookworm infections in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hookworms (<italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic>, <italic>Necator americanus</italic>, and, less commonly, <italic>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic>) are major soil-transmitted helminths (nematodes, roundworms) that parasitize humans, infecting 576–740 million people globally and are the leading source of iron-deficient anemia in endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bethony1">[1]</xref>. Hookworms are estimated by some to be second only to malaria in terms of disease burden by a parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Hotez1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Hotez2">[3]</xref> where they are associated with ∼22 million disability adjusted life years). Hookworm infections lead to blood loss and anemia that most significantly impacts children and pregnant women leading to growth and cognitive stunting in children and increased risk of death or low birthweight babies during pregnancy. For mass drug administration against soil-transmitted helminths like hookworms, the current drug of choice is albendazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Keiser1">[4]</xref>. The single-dose cure rate with albendazole for hookworm infection is variable with an average of about 70%, leaving clear room for improvement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Keiser2">[5]</xref>. More worrisome are increasing numbers of reports with lower efficacies of albendazole and possible resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Humphries1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Soukhathammavong1">[7]</xref>. Resistance to the class of drugs to which albendazole belongs is already rampant in veterinary medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kaplan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Sutherland1">[9]</xref>. Past experiences with infectious diseases (<italic>e.g.</italic>, malaria) has taught us that reliance on one drug for treatment of hundreds of millions of infected peoples inevitably leads to treatment failure.</p>
      <p>One promising group of alternative anthelmintics is roundworm-active crystal proteins, in particular Cry5B, made by <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Hu1">[10]</xref>. Three 14 mg/kg Cry5B doses administered once/day for three days resulted in an 89% reduction in <italic>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic> hookworm burdens in hamsters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Cappello1">[11]</xref>. <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> is a zoonotic hookworm species, closely related to the major human parasite <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic>, and is emerging as an important human parasite in Southeast Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Conlan1">[12]</xref>. <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> infections in hamsters are also considered a good model for hookworm disease in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bungiro1">[13]</xref>. Cry5B is also effective against <italic>Heligmosomoides bakeri</italic> (<italic>polygyrus</italic>) roundworm infections in mice as a single 90 mg/kg dose was able to reduce parasite burdens by 70% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Hu2">[14]</xref>. It was furthermore shown that Cry5B rapidly degrades in simulated gastric fluids, suggesting that protection of Cry5B from gastric fluids should increase its efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Hu2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The response of the free-living roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to Cry5B has been extensively studied and analyzed, including via genetic screens, microarray analyses, whole-genome RNAi analyses, and characterization of innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Marroquin1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Los1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Chen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bellier1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bischof1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Huffman1">[21]</xref>. Cry5B has been demonstrated to function as a pore-forming protein that intoxicates via binding to invertebrate-specific glycolipid receptors on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Griffitts1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Griffitts2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Griffitts3">[24]</xref>. One of the key innate immune pathways activated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by Cry5B is the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK pathway), evidenced by increased phosphorylation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> p38 upon treatment with Cry5B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bischof1">[20]</xref>. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway is important for <italic>C. elegans</italic> since loss of the pathway via genetic mutation or knock-down RNA interference (RNAi) results in &gt;100-fold hypersensitivity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to Cry5B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Huffman1">[21]</xref>. Although the mechanism of Cry5B action in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been extensively studied, there has been no work in parasitic roundworms apart from the finding that Cry5B is able to bind glycolipids isolated from the hookworm <italic>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Cappello1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we investigate whether the mechanism of action of Cry5B in <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> hookworms is conserved with its mechanism of action in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We furthermore investigate whether single-dose Cry5B (<italic>vs.</italic> three doses over three days previously reported) can have efficacy against hookworm infections since single-dose therapy is the standard for mass drug administration against hookworms. Finally we test whether a simple formulation designed to neutralize acidic gastric fluid might increase Cry5B efficacy against hookworm infections <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Conservation of mechanism of Cry5B action between hookworms and <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
        <p>To address whether the mechanism of action of Cry5B in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is conserved in hookworms, we first asked if the functional reliance of Cry5B activity on the invertebrate glycolipid receptor is the same in hookworms as it is in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This functional reliance was addressed by asking if the toxicity of Cry5B to the parasite can be reduced using galactose, a sugar that competes with Cry5B binding to glycolipid receptors, but not reduced using glucose, a sugar that does not compete with Cry5B binding to glycolipid receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Griffitts1">[22]</xref>. We treated <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> adults <italic>in vitro</italic> with Cry5B alone, Cry5B in the presence of 100 mM glucose, and Cry5B in the presence of 100 mM galactose. In the presence of 100 mM glucose or 100 mM galactose (but no Cry5B), <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> adults are healthy at 48 hr, similar to no-sugar controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). With the addition of 10 µg/mL Cry5B, <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> adults become intoxicated, most evident by physical shrinking, ruffling of their cuticle, and loss of motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Addition of 100 mM glucose does not alter the ability of Cry5B to intoxicate hookworm adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) but addition of 100 mM galactose has pronounced protective effects, partly rescuing intoxication in the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Similar results were found using 50 mM galactose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0001900.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <p>Second, we tested the effect of reducing or eliminating p38 MAPK function on adult hookworms treated with Cry5B.

Whereas the parasites are healthy in the presence of inhibitor alone and show only small-moderate levels of intoxication at this low dose of Cry5B alone, treatment of the parasites with Cry5B in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor results in death of 100% of the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g002">Figure 2</xref> B).

Dose-dependent effects could be seen with parasite reductions of 65%, 79%, and 93% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; relative to water control P = 0.0006, &lt;0.0001, &lt;0.0001 respectively).

        <title>Buffering Cry5B increases efficacy</title>
        <p>Since Cry5B rapidly degrades in simulated stomach fluid (&gt;99% of the protein is digested in 4 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Hu2">[14]</xref>), we hypothesized that neutralization of stomach acid would inhibit the activity of pepsin, decrease the digestion of Cry5B in stomach, and improve its anthelmintic efficacy. We therefore, simultaneous with the above experiments, included two additional groups: one in which we gavaged infected hamsters with 150 mM Tris pH 8.5 buffer as control and another in which we gavaged 3 mg Cry5B in 150 mM Tris pH 8.5. The purpose of the basic buffer was to fully or partially neutralize stomach acid. Whereas, relative to water controls, pH 8.5 buffer alone did not affect worm burdens (P = 0.45), fecal egg count (P = 0.52), or hemoglobin levels (P = 0.95), 3 mg (∼30 mg/kg) of Cry5B gavaged in pH 8.5 buffer showed dramatic improvements on reducing hookworm burden and hookworm disease relative to either placebo control (water or pH 8.5 buffer). Relative to pH 8.5 buffer alone, 3 mg Cry5B in pH 8.5 buffer results in 97% reduction in intestinal worm burden, 100% reduction in fecal egg counts, and significant improvement in hemoglobin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001900-g003">Figure 3A, B, C</xref>; P≤0.0001 for each).</p>
        <p>Gavage of 3 mg Cry5B in pH 8.5 buffer showed better efficacy than gavage of 3 mg of Cry5B in water relative to worm burdens (97% reduction vs. 79% reduction), fecal egg counts (100% reduction vs. 77% reduction), and hemoglobin levels (16.2 vs. 14.6 g/100 ml). A direct comparison between results with 3 mg Cry5B in water and 3 mg Cry5B in pH 8.5 buffer indicate that the additional decrease in intestinal worms burdens is just out of the range of statistical significance (P = 0.064; 1-tailed T-test unequal variances), but that the additional difference in fecal egg counts is statistically significant (P = 0.0094; 1-tailed T-test unequal variances). The level of disease reduction seen with 3 mg Cry5B in pH 8.5 buffer was similar to levels seen with 10 mg Cry5B treatment in water (unbuffered), suggesting that this method of neutralizing stomach acid results in ∼3-fold increase in efficacy.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate here the functional conservation of Cry5B action against the hookworm <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> and the free-living nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Co-incubation of hookworms with Cry5B and galactose, which in <italic>C. elegans</italic> competes with Cry5B to binding to the glycolipid receptors, reduces Cry5B activity in <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> as it does in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Griffitts1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, Cry5B treatment induces activation of p38 MAPK in hookworms as it does in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bischof1">[20]</xref>. Strikingly, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway in hookworms results in increased activity of Cry5B, as it does in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Huffman1">[21]</xref>. To our knowledge, this finding represents the first time that experimental inhibition of a hookworm pathway results in increased activity of an anthelmintic.</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that invertebrate-specific glycolipid receptors are functionally important for Cry5B activity in hookworms as they are in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This finding is important since these receptors are not found in vertebrates and since it provides a molecular basis of Cry5B safety in vertebrates.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our results indicate that key knowledge about how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to Cry5B (<italic>i.e.</italic>, via p38 MAPK) applies to how hookworms respond to Cry5B. The conservation of functional action with <italic>C. elegans</italic> is important since there is a wealth of information about how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to Cry5B action, including more than 100 genes that, when knocked down, result in hypersensitivity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to Cry5B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Los1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Chen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bellier1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Bischof1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Huffman2">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, of these more than 100 hypersensitivity genes, four of them are conserved in nematodes (including parasites) but lacking in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Kao1">[16]</xref>. Given our results, which indicate that Cry5B molecular response pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can apply to hookworms, then these genes represent targets for knock-down by RNAi or drug development that would safely and significantly potentiate Cry5B action. This approach represents a forward-design for synergistic anthelmintic therapy. Instead of looking for synergy amongst existing drugs, a treatment could be developed specifically to produce a synergistic effect by inhibiting genes involved in roundworm innate protection against Cry5B.</p>
      <p>We also demonstrate here that single dose Cry5B can produce a near complete cure of <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> hookworm infections in hamsters. Doses of either 10 mg (∼100 mg/kg) in water and 3 mg (∼30 mg/kg) in pH 8.5 buffer results in 93 and 97% reductions in worm burdens respectively and in complete elimination of parasite egg production.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, use of pH 8.5 buffer versus water significantly improved the ability of Cry5B to eliminate parasite egg production and resulted in lower parasite burdens. Our results using a basic buffer to deliver better efficacy are consistent with neutralization of stomach acid and pepsin digestion as being important for optimization of Cry5B therapy. With regards to therapeutic application, our results suggest that the absence of a period at low pH leads to greater retention of Cry5B activity. In practice, this could be achieved by encapsulation of the protein during the passage through the stomach to protect it from acid (<italic>e.g.</italic>, by applying a simple, cheap enteric coating to a capsule containing Cry5B).</p>
      <p>Our results compare favorably with another new anti-hookworm drug under development, K11777, which showed 90% clearance of parasites at a dose of 100 mg/kg (compared to 97% clearance for Cry5B at ∼30 mg/kg, which, on a molar level is &lt;800X that of K11777 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Vermeire1">[28]</xref>). Cry5B is predicted to be very safe for human therapy as Cry proteins, famous for their use as insecticidal proteins in sprays and transgenic crops, are generally considered non-toxic to vertebrates and as the receptor for Cry5B in roundworms are invertebrate-specific glycolipids (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Cappello1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Griffitts1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001900-Betz1">[29]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, our results demonstrate that Cry5B can be a highly effective single-dose therapy for <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> hookworm infections in hamsters (97% parasite clearance), that inclusion of a basic buffer increases the therapeutic activity of the protein, that Cry5B - invertebrate-specific glycan interactions are apparently important for Cry5B action in hookworms, and that the key p38 MAPK Cry5B defense pathway, which operates in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, also operates in hookworms. These results advance the development of Cry5B as a novel, safe, highly-effective single-dose therapy against hookworms and potentially many other intestinal roundworm infections.</p>
