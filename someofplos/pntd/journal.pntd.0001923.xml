      <abstract>
        <p>Ebola virus (EBOV), family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, emerged in 1976 on the African continent. Since then it caused several outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans with case fatality rates up to 90% and remains a serious Public Health concern and biothreat pathogen. The most pathogenic and best-studied species is <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (ZEBOV). EBOV encodes one viral surface glycoprotein (GP), which is essential for replication, a determinant of pathogenicity and an important immunogen. GP mediates viral entry through interaction with cellular surface molecules, which results in the uptake of virus particles via macropinocytosis. Later in this pathway endosomal acidification activates the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL), which have been shown to cleave ZEBOV-GP leading to subsequent exposure of the putative receptor-binding and fusion domain and productive infection. We studied the effect of CatB and CatL on <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> replication of EBOV. Similar to previous findings, our results show an effect of CatB, but not CatL, on ZEBOV entry into cultured cells. Interestingly, cell entry by other EBOV species (<italic>Bundibugyo</italic>, <italic>Côte d'Ivoire</italic>, <italic>Reston</italic> and <italic>Sudan ebolavirus</italic>) was independent of CatB or CatL as was EBOV replication in general. To investigate whether CatB and CatL have a role <italic>in vivo</italic> during infection, we utilized the mouse model for ZEBOV. Wild-type (control), <italic>catB<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>catL<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted ZEBOV with no difference in virus replication and time to death. In conclusion, our results show that CatB and CatL activity is not required for EBOV replication. Furthermore, EBOV glycoprotein cleavage seems to be mediated by an array of proteases making targeted therapeutic approaches difficult.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>It is currently believed that Ebola virus (EBOV) enters cells via macropinocytosis following which, the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL) cleave the viral glycoprotein (GP) allowing exposure of its core receptor-binding and fusion domain thus facilitating subsequent infection. We studied the effect of CatB and CatL on <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> EBOV replication. Our results demonstrate a reduction of <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (ZEBOV) entry upon selective inhibition of CatB, but not CatL in cell culture. Interestingly, all other EBOV species enter the cells efficiently when CatB and/or CatL activity is blocked. Moreover, when wild-type (control), <italic>catB<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>catL<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were infected with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted ZEBOV, all animals were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with no difference in virus replication and time to death. Therefore, we conclude that EBOV replication is dispensable of CatB and CatL, and proteolytic processing of GP can also be mediated by other endosomal proteases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Members of the family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are the causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fever in central Africa and a major public health threat in their endemic areas. Worldwide concern relates to the importation of infected individuals and the potential use of filoviruses as biothreat pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez1">[1]</xref>. All current MARV strains belong to the <italic>Lake Victoria marburgvirus</italic> species, while Ebola virus (EBOV) strains are attributed to five different species: <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (ZEBOV), <italic>Sudan ebolavirus</italic> (SEBOV), <italic>Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus</italic> (CIEBOV), <italic>Reston ebolavirus</italic> (REBOV) and <italic>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</italic> (BEBOV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Towner1">[2]</xref>. The species vary in their pathogenicity for humans with ZEBOV being most pathogenic (up to 90% case fatality rate), followed by SEBOV and BEBOV with about 50% and &gt;25% case fatality rates, respectively. CIEBOV and REBOV cause lethal infections in nonhuman primates, but have not yet been associated with fatal human cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Towner1">[2]</xref>. Although EBOV (mainly ZEBOV) and MARV have been extensively studied <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, today there is neither a licensed vaccine nor treatment available.</p>
      <p>EBOV entry into target cells is still not fully understood and remains a focus of ongoing research. While a number of attachment factors seem to facilitate EBOV entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Takada1">[3]</xref>, so far no specific cell surface receptor molecule has been identified. Recently, it was shown that the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is required for ZEBOV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Carette1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Cote1">[5]</xref>. NPC1 is a ubiquitously expressed endosomal membrane protein involved in the fusion and fission of endosomes and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Goldman1">[6]</xref>, and its deficiency has been shown to impact on HIV-1 particle release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Tang1">[7]</xref>. Its presence in the endosome fits the current EBOV entry model based on macropinocytosis, a cellular pathway proposed to be the main uptake mechanism of EBOV particles into cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Saeed1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Aleksandrowicz1">[10]</xref>. Previously, Chandran <italic>et al.</italic> identified the cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and cathepsin L (CatL), which are also present in endosomes, as important factors for ZEBOV entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Chandran1">[11]</xref>. According to the current model, cleavage of the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) by CatB is necessary for exposure of the core receptor-binding domain and fusion machinery, otherwise buried in the GP structure, to initiate fusion of the viral and the endosomal membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Schornberg1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez2">[14]</xref>. Subsequently, the viral genome along with the replication complex is released into the cytoplasm where replication and virus progeny production occur.</p>
      <p>CatB and CatL are members of a family of 11 human cysteine proteases. Both proteases are highly abundant, broadly expressed and exhibit nonspecific proteolytic activity within lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Rossi1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Barrett1">[16]</xref>. CatB has been associated with TNF-α induced liver damage and seems to play a critical role for the development of pancreatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Guicciardi1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Halangk1">[18]</xref>. Despite these facts, <italic>catB<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are phenotypically similar to wild-type control mice and fully immunocompetent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Halangk1">[18]</xref>. CatL is important for epidermal homeostasis and the regulation of the hair cycle and as such <italic>catL<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are hairless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Roth1">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, CatL is involved in MHC II-mediated antigen presentation in epithelial cells of the thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Nakagawa1">[20]</xref>. Consequently, <italic>catL<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have reduced numbers of CD4+ T helper cells, which are however fully functional. A double knockout mouse lacking CatB and CatL has been generated but is not viable long enough for experimental use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sevenich1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Felbor1">[22]</xref>. To determine the importance of cathepsins in viral infections, various inhibitors of endosomal acidification, cathepsin or specifically CatB and CatL activity have been used <italic>in vitro</italic>. In these studies the role of cathepsins have been demonstrated to be important for the entry of reovirus, SARS-CoV, henipaviruses and ZEBOV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Chandran1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Ebert1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Diederich1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we show that while CatB mediates ZEBOV entry <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is not important for entry and replication of any other EBOV species. We further show that <italic>in vivo</italic> replication of mouse-adapted ZEBOV (MA-ZEBOV) is independent of CatB and CatL, indicating that both of these cathepsins are not required for ZEBOV replication <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

Then 50 µl plain DMEM with 100 focus forming units (ffu) virus were added and kept for one hour at 37°C. After three washes with plain DMEM a 1∶1 mixture of 2.4% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and 2× Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 4% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine was added containing the appropriate concentration of inhibitor (BafA1 100, 50, 25, 10 nM; CA074 (CatB) 100, 50, 25, 10 µM; CatL-inhibitor V 10, 5, 2.5, 1 µM). SARS infected cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet and plaques were counted three days after infection. Four days after infection EBOV inoculated cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and removed from BSL4 following standard operating procedures. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized and foci were stained with a rabbit anti-VP40 antibody (kindly provided by Y.

        <title>ZEBOV entry <italic>in vitro</italic> is CatB-mediated</title>
        <p>The observation that entry of ZEBOV into Vero E6 cells is CatB- and CatL-dependent was initially described in 2005 by Chandran and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Chandran1">[11]</xref>. For further analysis of ZEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells we performed a different <italic>in vitro</italic> assay based on foci reduction using the same inhibitors. Cells were seeded and treated with various lysosome and cathepsin inhibitors for one hour, infected with ZEBOV wild-type (wt) for one hour, covered with carboxymethyl cellulose containing inhibitors and fixed after incubation for 4 days. The number of foci was determined by immunostaining. Only the inhibition of CatB resulted in significantly reduced virus entry, whereas CatL proteolytic activity did not appear to be obligatory for ZEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells, although CatL is highly expressed in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Diederich1">[27]</xref>. SARS-CoV was used as a CatL-dependent control virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Simmons1">[26]</xref> to verify the activity of the CatL inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition to ZEBOVwt, we also tested a furin cleavage site knockout ZEBOV (ZEBOV-Fko) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Neumann1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Neumann2">[29]</xref> and the MA-ZEBOV in this assay to determine whether furin cleavage of the glycoprotein or mutations caused by the adaptation process of the virus to mice would influence the requirement for cathepsin cleavage. Both viruses entered Vero E6 cells in a CatB-dependent manner similar to ZEBOVwt and were not affected by the presence of the CatL inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These results show that the uptake of all tested viruses occurred by utilizing the cellular endocytotis machinery as indicated by the inhibitory effect of Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an endosomal acidification inhibitor. Furthermore, proteolytic processing of the ZEBOV-GP by furin is not a prerequisite for cathepsin cleavage in the virus maturation or entry process. In addition, mutations throughout the viral genome acquired during the adaptation process of ZEBOV to the mouse have no influence on ZEBOV uptake.</p>

        <title>The role of CatB in cellular uptake differs among Ebola virus species</title>
        <p>Our data on ZEBOV only partially support previously published observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Chandran1">[11]</xref>, but confirm more recent studies claiming that CatB, rather than CatL, plays a role in ZEBOV entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Wong1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Martinez1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, we studied the role of cathepsin cleavage on virus entry for BEBOV, CIEBOV, REBOV and SEBOV using a representative strain for each EBOV species. Foci reduction assays were performed and evaluated as described above. Infection of all viruses was reduced in the presence of BafA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), confirming that endosomal acidification plays a critical role during the entry process of all these EBOVs. Interestingly, only the maximum concentration of the CatB inhibitor had an effect on BEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells, whereas CIEBOV, REBOV and SEBOV produced foci independent of the presence of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The entry of none of the EBOVs was affected by the CatL inhibitor. This data suggests that CatB is not equally important for the entry of other EBOVs and seems to have a selective effect on ZEBOV and a limited effect on BEBOV entry.</p>

        <title>ZEBOV replication is largely independent on cathepsin B cleavage</title>
        <p>After confirmation that CatB has a role in ZEBOV entry we analyzed virus replication in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors. Vero E6 cells were treated with inhibitors (BafA1 100 nM; CatB 100 µM; CatL 10 µM) for one hour prior to ZEBOVwt infection (MOI = 1). After unbound virus was washed away the cells were covered with medium containing inhibitor (BafA1 50 nM; CatB 50 µM; CatL 5 µM), samples were taken at the indicated time points and stored at −80°C for virus titration. Virus titers were determined on Vero E6 cells using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) assay and calculated using the Reed and Muench formula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Reed1">[31]</xref>. The results demonstrate that ZEBOV replicates to similar titers in the presence of CatB or CatL inhibitor (difference less than 1 log); the presence of both inhibitors reduced ZEBOV replication by about 1 log. This indicates that the CatB inhibitory effect on entry is likely compensated for by other cellular proteases. However, BafA1 reduces virus growth by more than 2 logs, showing that endosomal acidification is important for efficient ZEBOV entry and replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g003">3A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study demonstrates that CatB, but not CatL, mediates ZEBOV uptake into Vero E6 cells. This observation is only partially in line with the initial <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrating both CatB and CatL dependent uptake of ZEBOV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Chandran1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez2">[14]</xref> and supports more recent studies showing that only CatB mediates ZEBOV entry into target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Wong1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Martinez1">[35]</xref>. In addition, we could demonstrate that post-translational furin cleavage of ZEBOV-GP into the fragments GP<sub>1</sub> and GP<sub>2</sub> is not a prerequisite for cathepsin processing. This result does not come as a big surprise considering earlier studies reporting that ZEBOV replication and pathogenicity were independent of furin cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Neumann1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Neumann2">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, all other EBOV species tested in our study seem to enter Vero E6 cells in a CatB- and CatL-independent manner suggesting that other endosomal proteases might functionally replace CatB in virus entry. This finding is in disagreement with recently published data showing that cell entry of VSV- and HIV-1-based pseudotype particles expressing different EBOV-GPs is CatB-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Misasi1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Gnirss1">[39]</xref>. Interestingly, one of these studies also showed that cell entry of infectious SEBOV (strain Gulu) was CatB- and CatL-independent as we could demonstrate here for a different SEBOV strain (strain Boniface) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Misasi1">[38]</xref>. The discrepancies among our data and some of the previously published reports might be explained by the differences in size and shape of particles as well as the mechanism of particle uptake. HIV-1 particles are largely spherical and the mechanism of uptake is receptor mediated through the interaction of its surface glycoprotein gp160 with CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Wilen1">[40]</xref>. VSV particles are short and bullet-shaped and cell uptake occurs via the endocytic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Albertini1">[41]</xref>. In the infectious ZEBOV context the interactions of GP with VP24 and VP40 (missing in pseudotype particles) may further influence the cellular uptake mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Sanchez2">[14]</xref>, altogether suggesting that HIV-1- and VSV-based pseudotype particle entry could be different from those of filovirus particles, which are extremely long and filamentous in shape and mainly utilize macropinocytosis for particle uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Saeed1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Aleksandrowicz1">[10]</xref>. In addition, the CIEBOV-GP used to produce VSV-based pseudotype particles in one study lacked the mucin-like domain, which could have had impact on the GP structure and thus might have affected cleavage and entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Misasi1">[38]</xref>. In our view this highlights the need for confirmation of data obtained from pseudotype particle systems by live EBOV infections or at least by the use of EBOV-like particles. Finally, cell type and origin may also influence CatB- and CatL-mediated cleavage as studies were performed in different cell lines.</p>
      <p>For SARS-CoV entry, which is reported to be highly CatL-dependent, it has been shown that expression of the cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can overcome the block in SARS-CoV infection and replication caused by CatL inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Bertram1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Shulla1">[45]</xref>. Moreover, signaling of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) has initially been associated with CatB, CatL and CatK activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Asagiri1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Matsumoto1">[47]</xref>. However, studies using bone marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells derived from cathepsin knockout mice did not identify a single cathepsin as an essential factor for TLR9 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Ewald1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Park1">[49]</xref> and rather point towards a role of other endolysosomal proteases, such as asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Ewald2">[50]</xref> for activation. Thus, it seems reasonable to speculate that in the absence of CatB and CatL, such as in corresponding knockout mice, other endosomal proteases will mediate EBOV-GP cleavage enabling cathepsin-independent EBOV entry into target cells.</p>
      <p>Previous reports have shown that EBOV-GPs were also processed by cathepsins in MEFs indicating that mouse CatB and CatL are functionally active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Chandran1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001923-Misasi1">[38]</xref>. Here we have demonstrated that, similarly to ZEBOVwt, cell entry by MA-ZEBOV into Vero E6 cells was CatB-dependent but CatL-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, both EBOVs replicated to high titers in MEF cell lines independent of CatB and/or CatL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g003">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). Therefore, we used the mouse disease model to investigate the effect of these cathepsins on ZEBOV replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. C57BL/6 mice (genetic background), CatB or CatL knockout mice (<italic>catB<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>catL<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) did not show an increased susceptibility to viral infection in general as determined here with VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g004">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). In contrast, all knockout and C57BL/6 mice infected with MA-ZEBOV succumbed to infection with no difference in disease progression and time to death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) or viral loads in liver, spleen and blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001923-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) demonstrating that MA-ZEBOV replication <italic>in vivo</italic> is CatB- and CatL-independent.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our studies indicate that CatB and CatL are not absolutely required for EBOV replication. For yet unknown reasons, CatB seems to play a more considerable role in ZEBOV uptake than it does for any other EBOV species. EBOV seems to have evolved to use a broader spectrum of endosomal proteases to ensure GP cleavage and thus facilitates successful infection of target cells. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting single proteases are unlikely to be beneficial to combat EBOV infections.</p>
