          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is responsible for acute febrile polyarthralgia and, in a proportion of cases, severe complications including chronic arthritis. CHIKV has spread recently in East Africa, South-West Indian Ocean, South-Asia and autochthonous cases have been reported in Europe. Although almost all patients are outpatients, medical investigations mainly focused on hospitalised patients.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Here, we detail clinico-biological characteristics of Chikungunya (CHIK) outpatients in Reunion Island (2006). 76 outpatients with febrile arthralgia diagnosed within less than 48 hours were included by general practitioners during the CuraChik clinical trial. CHIK was confirmed in 54 patients and excluded in 22. A detailed clinical and biological follow-up was organised, that included analysis of viral intrahost diversity and telephone survey until day 300. The evolution of acute CHIK included 2 stages: the ‘viral stage’ (day 1–day 4) was associated with rapid decrease of viraemia and improvement of clinical presentation; the ‘convalescent stage’ (day 5–day 14) was associated with no detectable viraemia but a slower clinical improvement. Women and elderly had a significantly higher number of arthralgia at inclusion and at day 300. Based on the study clinico-biological dataset, scores for CHIK diagnosis in patients with recent febrile acute polyarthralgia were elaborated using arthralgia on hands and wrists, a minor or absent myalgia and the presence of lymphopenia (&lt;1G/L) as major orientation criteria. Finally, we observed that CHIKV intra-host genetic diversity increased over time and that a higher viral amino-acid complexity at the acute stage was associated with increased number of arthralgia and intensity of sequelae at day 300.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>This study provided a detailed picture of clinico-biological CHIK evolution at the acute phase of the disease, allowed the elaboration of scores to assist CHIK diagnosis and investigated for the first time the impact of viral intra-host genetic diversity on the disease course.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus is responsible for acute febrile polyarthralgia and, in a proportion of cases, complications including chronic arthritis. Since 2005, it has massively re-emerged in the Old World. Although the large majority of patients are outpatients, the most detailed studies have focused previously on hospitalised patients (<italic>i.e.</italic>, severe cases). Here, we report the detailed clinico-biological characteristics of ‘standard’ clinical presentations in patients followed-up by general practitioners in Reunion Island (2006) during the CuraChik clinical trial. At the onset of the disease, two stages were observed: <italic>(i)</italic> a ‘viral stage’ during the first 4 days, associated with an acute febrile polyarthralgic syndrome and a subsequent rapid clinical improvement; the main clinico-biological characteristics during that period were used to elaborate supportive chikungunya diagnostic scores, (<italic>ii</italic>) a ‘convalescent stage’ (days 5–14) with no detectable viraemia but a slower clinical improvement. Woman and elderly patients were found at risk for more symptomatic forms of the disease at both the acute and late stages (day 300) and we observed that the viral intra-host genetic diversity increased over time and that a higher viral amino-acid complexity at the acute stage was associated with more symptomatic illness at the late stage of the disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus (genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, family <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> = <italic>Stegomya aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> = <italic>Stegomya albopicta</italic>), that causes Chikungunya fever (CHIK), an acute febrile illness characterized by severe and often debilitating arthralgia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staples1">[1]</xref>. CHIKV was first isolated in 1952 in East-Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Robinson1">[2]</xref>. The name ‘Chikungunya’ refers to the stooped posture that develops in an individual as a result of arthritic symptoms and comes from the Bantu language of the Makonde people (Tanzania and Mozambique) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Robinson1">[2]</xref>. Until recently, knowledge of CHIK clinical features was based on its first description in the 1970s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Brighton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Fourie1">[4]</xref>. Since 2005, CHIK outbreaks of unprecedented magnitude have occurred in South-Asia and the Indian Ocean islands, including Reunion Island with an estimated 266,000 cases, accounting for roughly one third of the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Gerardin1">[5]</xref>. In 2007, a viraemic traveller from India introduced CHIKV into northern Italy, resulting in an outbreak with 292 suspected cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Rezza1">[6]</xref>. Thus, CHIK constitutes a serious threat numerous tropical and temperate areas due to the fact that <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is now widespread, notably in Southern-Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Rezza1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Grandadam1">[7]</xref>, and displays seasonal synchronicity within potential endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Charrel1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although almost all CHIK patients are outpatients, most clinical and laboratory investigations of CHIK focused on hospitalised patients (<italic>i.e.</italic> mostly with severe presentations that represented a very small proportion of total infections) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Borgherini1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staikowsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Taubitz1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-1">[12]</xref>. Our attempts to describe the clinical and biological features of chikungunya acute disease took advantage of data collected during the CuraChik clinical trial, performed on Reunion Island during the 2006 Indian Ocean outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-deLamballerie1">[13]</xref>. CuraChik provided a unique opportunity to collect detailed clinical and biological information from CHIKV infected patients with the most common forms of clinical presentation, recruited by general practitioners.</p>

Curachik (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00391313" xlink:type="simple">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00391313</ext-link>) was a randomised double blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial aiming at evaluating the efficacy and safety of chloroquine as therapeutic treatment of CHIK <bold>(study protocol available on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002004.s001">File S1</xref>)</bold>.</p>
          <p>This trial included adult patients (18–65 years old, men and women), who volunteered to take part in the study, residing in Reunion Island, having a typical presentation of acute CHIK (defined by acute febrile arthralgia) diagnosed within less than 48 hours. Exclusively general practitioners (GPs) enrolled the eligible patients.</p>
          <p>Clinical data were collected from three sources: <italic>(i)</italic> a daily auto-questionnaire from day 1 (D1) to day 14 (D14); <italic>(ii)</italic> three consultations with a GP on D1, day 7 (D7) (mean 6.4, SD = 1.4) and day 25 (D25) (mean 26.5, SD = 9.8); <italic>(iii)</italic> a telephone questionnaire on day 100 (D100) (mean 130.5, SD = 28.1) and day 300 (D300) (mean 300.7, SD = 13.8).</p>
          <p>Biological data were collected from the analysis of blood samples on D1, D3, D6 and D16. The extraction of nucleic acids and CHIKV specific RT-PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Pastorino1">[15]</xref> were carried out from all samples (D1, D3, D6 and D16). Tests for the presence of CHIKV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM were performed at D1, D6 and D16 by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (according to a procedure previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Moureau1">[16]</xref>).</p>
          <p>The case definition of CHIKV positive patients relied on the association of a CHIKV specific positive RT-PCR on D1 and seroconversion on D16. CHIK negative patients tested negative for CHIKV genome on D1 and showed no evidence of seroconversion on D16.</p>

          <p>Ten patients with a variety of clinical and biological presentations and a positive CHIKV RT-PCR diagnostic test were selected within the placebo subgroup. The extraction of nucleic acids was performed from D1 and D3 sera using the EZ1 virus MiniKit (virus card 2.0) and an EZ1 biorobot (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For all patients (n = 10), a 692-nucleotide fragment within the E1 gene (positions 10138–10829) was amplified using the high fidelity Eppendorf One-Step RT-PCR kit and primers CV1F (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTATCGCTTGATTACATCACG-3′</named-content>) and CV1R (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGCTTCCGGTATGTCGATG-3′</named-content>). This fragment includes amino acidsspanning position E1/226. The mutation A226V has been reported to confer a virus adaptation to <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Santhosh1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Tsetsarkin1">[18]</xref>. Analysis was also performed for samples collected at D3 for 2 patients still viraemic at this time. Amplification products were purified (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit), subjected to 3′ end adenosine addition (<italic>Taq</italic> polymerase, Invitrogen), ligated into the cloning vector pCR 2.1 and transformed into TOP10 competent cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol (TA Cloning, Invitrogen). An average of 45 clones per serum sample was sequenced directly from the plasmid using the T7 promoter primer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′</named-content>).</p>
          <p>Sequences were analysed with the Sequencher software and aligned with ClustalX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Jeanmougin1">[19]</xref>. For a given sample, the sequence of each clone was compared with the most common sequence using the Mega 4.1 programme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Tamura1">[20]</xref>. Differences in nucleotide and protein sequences were analysed according to different clinical, biological or demographic parameters. Sequence divergence was evaluated using the pairwise distance among nucleotide (π nt) and amino acid (π aa) sequences. The mean ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions per site was estimated using the pairwise method of Nei and Gojobori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Nei1">[21]</xref> in MEGA. For the analysis of intra-host genetic diversity, the sequence of each clone was compared to all other clones for each human serum. The percentage of variable nucleotide sites (number of variable nt sites/number of nt sites), of nucleotide mutations (number of nt mutation/number of nt sequenced), and of mutant clones (number of clones with mutation/total number of clones) was calculated, as well as the π nt, π aa, dN, dS and dN/dS parameters.</p>

          <title>Statistical analysis and diagnostic score</title>
          <p>To assess factors relating to clinical presentation and laboratory abnormality during CHIK on D1 and D300, we performed univariate analysis, for qualitative factors with Fisher's exact test and for continuous factors using the Mann Whitney nonparametric test. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman nonparametric test. Following the Mickey and Greenland approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Mickey1">[22]</xref>, variables with P-values &lt;0,2 were retained and entered into backwards stepwise multivariate linear regression models (logistic, Gaussian or Poisson regression depending on the dependent variable, respective percentage, continuous or count variable), following the Mickey and Greenland approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Mickey1">[22]</xref>. The standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the odds ratio (OR) (logistic regression), the linear regression coefficient (β) (Gaussian regression) and the Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR, Poisson regression) were estimated.</p>
          <p>To compare the intra-host diversity and the available clinical and laboratory data, we performed correlation analyses using the Spearman nonparametric test.</p>
          <p>Finally, we evaluated the possibility of generating a diagnostic score of CHIK on the first day of monitoring, by comparing the clinical and biological features of CHIKV positive and negative samples. Any factor for which a Pearson's chi2 or Fisher test was &lt;0.2, was included in multivariate analysis (hierarchical log-linear model) to study the adjusted relationship between different variables and their interactions. Sensitivities (Se), specificities (Sp), predictive values - positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) - were estimated and yielded a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC).</p>
          <p>All statistical analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS statistic 19 software.</p>
          <p>For multivariate analysis, the alpha probability threshold of significance was 0.05.</p>

        <p>Amongst 76 patients included at D1, the diagnosis of CHIKV was confirmed in 54 patients (CHIKV+ve patients) and excluded in 22 patients (CHIKV−ve patients). Since the clinical and biological assessment at D1 was obtained prior to the beginning of the treatment, all CHIKV+ve patients could be used for analysis at the time of inclusion. By contrast, only the patients who received the placebo (27 CHIKV+ve and 13 patients CHIKV−ve, placebo group) were used to describe the evolution of the disease.</p>

Box plot is a representative diagram of continuous variables. The bottom and the top of the box are the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, the band near the middle is the median and the ends of the whiskers are the 1.5 inter-quartile of the lower and upper quartile. The data not included between the whiskers are plotted as an outlier with small circles (if between 1.5 to 3 inter-quartile of the lower or upper quartile) or with a star (if higher than 3 inter-quartile of the lower or upper quartile). The outliers are tagged with their patient numbers to follow them at different time period. * Clinical assessment at D1 was obtained from all CHIKV+ve patients (N = 54) during the Reunion island outbreak 2005–2006.

          <p>Factors that showed a direct relationship in univariate and multivariate analyzes with CHIK diagnosis were W, MCP, MYOPAIN and lymphopenia. CHIKV+ve and CHIKV−ve patients were not statistically different for the impact on quality of life at the acute stage.</p>
          <p>Finally, the probability (p) of having been infected by CHIKV has been estimated, using logistic regression, as follows:</p>
          <p>p = 1/(1+exp(4.139)×exp(−3.666×lymphopenia)×exp(−1.940×MCP+)×exp(−2.341×W+)×exp(−2.700×MYOPAIN)). Each covariate was validated if equal to 1, otherwise 0. Tested on our cohort, the ROC curve had an AUC = 0.93 (p&lt;0.001), with Se = 90%, Sp = 85%, PPV = 94% and NPV = 77% using a 0.579 probability threshold value.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we could calculate a clinical score relying only on clinical symptoms (<italic>i.e.</italic>, excluding lymphopenia) : p = 1/(1+exp(1.609)×exp(−1.450×MCP+)×exp(−1.732×W+)×exp(−2.044×MYOPAIN)). Tested on our cohort, the ROC curve had an AUC = 0.81 (p&lt;0.001) and with Se = 76%, Sp = 73%, PPV = 87% and NPV = 55% using a 0.717 probability threshold value.</p>
          <p>Noticeably, in both scores, the variable Handpain (pain on MCP and/or PIP) could be used instead of the MCP variable with similar results.</p>
          <p>Finally, these results were used to propose a clinical and clinico-biological score usable in ambulatory practice by GPs (see on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). The values of the score presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g004">Figure 4</xref> represented, in our cohort, the predicted probability of having been infected by CHIKV, with each score.</p>

              <p>These scores were based on patients who reported fever and arthralgia for less than 48 hours. * MCP+: arthralgia on at least one metacarpophalangeal joint. * W+: arthralgia on at least one wrist. We propose a clinical score based exclusively on clinical data (W+, MCP+ and Myalgia absent or minor) and a clinico-biological score that further includes lymphopenia (&lt;1G/L). The result of the score represents the predicted probability to have chikungunya (see calculation of scores in the main text).</p>

For the 10 D1 sera, the average proportion of mutant clones observed was 35.6%, the mutations occurred in 10 (1.4%) to 27 (3.9%) sites of the 692 nucleotides sequenced and the average proportion of non-synonymous mutations was 73.2%. Forty-eight (24%) mutations were observed more than once (41 twice, 7 in three clones). The transition/transversion ratio was 5.8 (219∶38). The average dN/dS ratio (that illustrates selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Holmes1">[23]</xref>), was 1.03 and 0.16 at the intra-host and inter-host level, respectively. Over a total of 519 clones studied, the A226V mutation was found in all but one clone (99.8%) and in-frame stop codons were identified in 2 clones (0.4%).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have reported a prospective study on Reunion Island of 54 adult outpatients, examined by general practitioners during the 2006 CHIK outbreak. These outpatients represent ‘standard’, ‘mild’, clinical presentations (the basis for inclusion was a recent presentation associating fever and arthralgia), which did not require hospitalisation or specific treatment for complications. Such patients represent the majority of cases: the proportion of hospitalised patients during the CHIKV 2005–2006 outbreak in Reunion Island was estimated to be 0.3% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-1">[12]</xref> whilst the majority of medical investigations were dedicated to hospitalised patients. Thus our knowledge of severe presentations is currently more accurate than that of common presentations that do not require hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>On Reunion Island, the epidemiological surveillance system was based, at first, on active and retrospective case detection around the reported cases, and then relied on a sentinel network of general practitioners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Renault1">[24]</xref>. Accordingly, some clinical data regarding outpatients could be collected from cases notified through either the epidemiological surveillance system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Renault1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Paquet1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Brottet1">[26]</xref>, or community based cross sectional survey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Gerardin2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-deAndrade1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Soumahoro1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko3">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko4">[33]</xref>. However, the unique aspect of the current study relies on the detailed clinical and virological follow-up of such patients. It included laboratory confirmation of CHIKV infection (based on RT-PCR and seroconversion), a clinical follow-up at the acute phase (associating daily auto-questionnaires and medical consultations), and late assessments (by telephone until day 300). The study took place at the end of the outbreak (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the enrolment was performed by practitioners who had previously managed approximately one third of the population infected by the virus), and there is no evidence that another arbovirus (<italic>e.g.</italic> dengue virus) has been circulating in Reunion Island during this period.</p>
      <p>This study has obvious limitations. Firstly, a low patient count: 54 patients, with a confirmed CHIKV infection, was studied on day 1 (inclusion), but the follow-up was performed for only 27 of these patients, corresponding to the placebo arm of the clinical trial. Secondly we could not exclude a potential impact of a placebo effect during the follow-up. Thirdly, 22 patients with a negative diagnosis of CHIK (of whom 13 received placebo) were also included but, regarding outpatients and mild presentations, the aetiology of their disease could not be further investigated. Finally, the number of patients for which in depth analysis of intra-host viral genetic diversity was analysed was low (10 patients) and, despite interesting and statistically significant results, this specific aspect will deserve in the future analysis from a larger cohort.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>Assessment at inclusion</title>
        <p>The clinical presentation of CHIK at inclusion revealed a quite severe impact of the disease on quality of life, with more than half of the patients' scores &lt;30/100. It conformed with the canonical presentation previously reported in Reunion Island and in the recent Indian reports, which included fever and symmetrical poly-arthralgia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Borgherini1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staikowsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Queyriaux1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Kannan1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Chopra1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Ray1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Doke1">[38]</xref>. However, this simplistic association (fever+polyarthralgia) seems to perform modestly for the specific diagnosis of CHIK: in a retrospective serologic survey of the CHIK outbreak in Mayotte Island <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko1">[28]</xref>, the PPV was as low as 74%. In our study, despite the great recent clinical experience of general practitioners, the PPV was similar (71%).</p>
        <p>Looking into further details, it appears that arthralgia was most commonly observed in small joints (<italic>i.e.</italic>, wrists, ankles, hands) and knees, as reported from both in- and outpatients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Borgherini1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staikowsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-deAndrade1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Queyriaux1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Vijayakumar1">[39]</xref>. More precisely, this study highlighted the massive number of arthralgic joints (16, on average) and the specific importance of <italic>(i)</italic> small joint pain such as MCP/PIP or wrist and <italic>(ii)</italic> a minor or absent myalgia for the diagnosis of CHIK at the onset of the disease.</p>
        <p>This strongly suggests that a convenient diagnostic score may profitably guide the diagnosis of CHIK at the acute stage of the disease. We proposed a very simple and purely clinical score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>) which reached 87% PPV in our population (<italic>i.e.</italic>, outpatient 18 to 60 years old, examined before the second day of illness). For convenience, results were categorised as ‘probable’, ‘possible’ and ‘not probable’.</p>
        <p>Our data also highlighted the high level of viral load (1.2×10<sup>9</sup> RNA copies/ml on average) at inclusion. It was slightly higher than in other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staikowsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Laurent1">[40]</xref>, possibly due in the current study, to the very short delay between onset of disease and inclusion. Viral load at D1 significantly increased with age but no relationship with clinical presentation or co-morbidity could be identified. In contrast with previous studies dedicated to hospitalised patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Borgherini1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Win1">[41]</xref>, we did not identify a relationship between the level of CRP and transaminases, a reduction of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil level or other biological abnormalities, and the intensity and number of arthralgia or the quality of life at D1. However, as previously reported from inpatients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staikowsky1">[10]</xref>, we observed that lymphopenia (&lt;1G/L) was closely related to the level of viraemia. It constituted an important clue for the diagnosis of CHIK as illustrated by our clinico-biological score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>), which again, classified the patients as ‘probable’, ‘possible’ or ‘not probable’, as a function of the probability to be infected by CHIKV, based on clinical presentation and lymphocyte count. The PPV of this score reached 94% in our population, for a threshold of 0.579.</p>

        <title>Evolution of the disease</title>
        <p>The most original input from the CuraChik protocol was the detailed information collected (patient self-assessment from D1 to D14, medical consultations (D1, D7, D25), biological analyses (D1, D6, D16)), which altogether provided an accurate description of the evolution of patients during the acute stage of the disease.</p>
        <p>Deciphering these data indicated that the acute disease includes 2 distinct stages</p>
        <list list-type="roman-lower">
          <list-item>
            <p>the first (D1–D4, ‘viral stage’) was associated with viraemia, <italic>i.e.</italic>, clinical symptoms that reflect the viral ‘burst’ and the initiation of innate immunity, associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Labadie1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Hoarau1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Chow1">[44]</xref> such as interferon-α and IL-6 but also IL-1Ra, IL-12, IL-15, IP-10 and MCP-1. This is in coherence with results from Chow et al., who extended the ‘acute phase’ of the disease until D4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Chow1">[44]</xref>. In all cases in the current study, this response was associated with a rapid decrease of viremia from D1 to D3 (39.6% of patients remained viraemic at D3). In parallel, the clinical presentation improved promptly: the daily self-assessment, showed a rapid decrease of the number of arthralgic joints (from 16 to 9) <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g003"><bold>Figure 3a</bold></xref><bold>)</bold> and all quality of life parameters dramatically improved <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>From day 5 to day 14 (‘convalescent stage’), all patients had no detectable viraemia, but improvement was slower, considering both quality of life scores <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref><bold>)</bold> or rheumatic parameters <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g003"><bold>Figure 3a, 3b</bold></xref><bold> and supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002004.s002">figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002004.s003">movie S1</xref>)</bold>. The initial symptoms (<italic>e.g.</italic>, fever and shiver that fell from &gt;80% at D1 to 10% at D7) receded but by the D7 medical visit &gt;40% of patients had persistent arthralgia, asthenia, myalgia or headache. Dermatological signs were more often identified on D7 than D1 <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002004-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, in coherence with studies reporting skin lesions mostly after disease onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Bandyopadhyay1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Thiruvengadam1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Riyaz1">[47]</xref>. This observation may provide an explanation for the large range of frequency of dermatological signs in the literature (from 10% to 86%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Fourie1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Soumahoro1">[30]</xref>. Previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Chow1">[44]</xref> showed that, by day 10, a number of inflammatory mediators (including interferon-α, IL-6, IL-1Ra, IL-12, IL-15, IP-10 and MCP-1) had significantly decreased, at least in patients with initial high viraemia.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>However, despite clinical improvement, it is probable that immune mechanisms are still involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Roques1">[48]</xref> at this stage. The final outcome (complete clinical recovery or persistent pain and chronic joint inflammation) appears likely to depend upon a series of genetic, viral and immunologic factors that operate at the acute and convalescent stages. On Reunion Island <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Hoarau1">[43]</xref> and India <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Vijayakumar1">[39]</xref> but not Singapore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Chow1">[44]</xref>, late complications were associated with severe acute disease. Here, in agreement with the clinical pattern observed on Reunion Island, patients with a high number of arthralgic joints at disease onset reported more frequently persistent arthralgia at D300.</p>
        <p>The early and convalescent immune response may be, in addition to putative yet uncharacterised viral factors, modulated by innate (genetic) and acquired factors. The latter certainly include age, which appears in many studies to be a major determinant of the clinical presentation and outcome. Here, we found that an increase of age was an independent risk factor for symptomatic illness at the time of disease onset (number and intensivity of joint pains) and at D300 (number of cases with persistent arthralgia). At D300, the patients who did not report recovery and who reported persistent arthralgia were significantly older. These results are consistent with studies on hospitalised patients and Indian report which reported that elderly patients more frequently presented with atypical feature or a severe course <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Staikowsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Economopoulou1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Tandale1">[50]</xref> with persistent arthralgia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Vijayakumar1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Hoarau1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Economopoulou1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Tandale1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Manimunda1">[51]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Genetic factors presumably trigger different immune responses which may account for the inter-individual and inter-ethnic variability of clinical presentation. Amongst them, gender is of specific interest. A single report mentioned a higher susceptibility of males, to CHIKV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Kumar1">[52]</xref> but globally, previously published data suggest that symptomatic CHIK is more frequent in women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Kannan1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Doke1">[38]</xref>. On Reunion Island, women were over-represented based on reported cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Renault1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Paquet1">[25]</xref> whereas cross sectional studies, based on representative groups of the population, found similar seroprevalence values in females and males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sissoko3">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Gerardin3">[53]</xref>. In two other studies, at the late stage of the disease, female gender was associated with persistent arthralgia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Win1">[41]</xref> or light cerebral disorder or fatigue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Gerardin2">[27]</xref>. In the current study, females were independently associated with a high number of painful joints at disease onset and at D300. They also reported non-recovery more frequently at D300. It is difficult at this stage to distinguish between gender-related specific clinical susceptibility and a different perception of the disease in males and females.</p>
        <p>The interplay between the immune response and viral evolution most probably constitutes an important issue for disease outcome. A non-primate animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Labadie1">[42]</xref> showed that CHIKV could persist much longer than previously believed and such persistence may imply the existence of specific adapted variants, or at least depend on the kinetics of viral clearance by the immune system. To our knowledge, no study had previously described the intra-host genetic diversity of CHIKV in human samples. We observed that CHIKV was represented in serum by a variety of closely related genomes and that genetic diversity increased over time and was correlated with the decrease of viral load. This observation relied on the analysis of sequential serum samples from 2 patients, but was also supported by the analysis of other sera for which analysis of the intra-host genetic diversity of CHIKV was made available: the later the serum was sampled, the higher was the intra-host genetic diversity, based on percentage of mutant clones and average π aa and dN. These data are consistent with a mechanism in which acute infection produced an accumulation of mutations over time (resulting in an increased intra-host genetic diversity), associated with a lower number of virions and, possibly, an increased potential for persistence. Interestingly, we found that a higher amino-acid complexity at the acute stage was associated with increased reporting of arthralgia and intensity of sequelae at D300. This may indicate that the immunological processes associated with the initial viraemia decline or are partly circumvented, thus enhancing the opportunity for onset of virus persistence and long term clinical complications. In an experimental model, Coffey <italic>et al.</italic> previously observed that a CHIKV variant with high fidelity polymerase produced truncated viraemia and lower organ titres and suggested that reduced genetic diversity impacts negatively on virus fitness in both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Coffey1">[54]</xref>. Moreover in the macaque model, long-term CHIKV infection was observed in joints, muscles, lymphoid organs, and liver which could explain the long-lasting CHIK symptoms observed in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Labadie1">[42]</xref>. Altogether, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that CHIKV displays increased intra-host diversity which may be associated with prolonged viraemia, higher organ viral load and an increased risk of chronic disease. If this is the case, such mechanisms appear to be quite different from those previously observed in the case of dengue fever, where lower intra-host diversity has been associated with more severe cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Descloux1">[55]</xref> On the other hand, our results appear more closely related to previous reports on the relationship between intra-host genetic diversity, fitness and virulence in the examples of chronic infections by induced HIV or HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Lee1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002004-Sullivan1">[57]</xref>. Some additional studies are needed to further characterise the intra-host genetic diversity of CHIKV at the acute phase of the disease. Sequential analysis provided by New Generation Sequencing tools may provide a more accurate picture of this diversity and allow a powerful analysis of the relationship between the structure and evolution of intra-host viral genetic diversity and the clinical evolution of CHIKV infected patients.</p>
