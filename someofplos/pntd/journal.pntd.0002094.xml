        <p>Antibody responses are thought to play an important role in control of <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infections, yet little is known about the phenotype and function of B cells in human schistosomiasis. We set out to characterize B cell subsets and B cell responses to B cell receptor and Toll-like receptor 9 stimulation in Gabonese schoolchildren with <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection. Frequencies of memory B cell (MBC) subsets were increased, whereas naive B cell frequencies were reduced in the schistosome-infected group. At the functional level, isolated B cells from schistosome-infected children showed higher expression of the activation marker CD23 upon stimulation, but lower proliferation and TNF-α production. Importantly, 6-months after 3 rounds of praziquantel treatment, frequencies of naive B cells were increased, MBC frequencies were decreased and with the exception of TNF-α production, B cell responsiveness was restored to what was seen in uninfected children. These data show that <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection leads to significant changes in the B cell compartment, both at the phenotypic and functional level.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people and especially children in developing countries. It causes general hyporesponsiveness of the immune system, which until now has predominantly been described for various T cell subsets as well as dendritic cells. B cells in this context have not yet been investigated. To address this question, we phenotyped B cell subsets present in peripheral blood from <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infected and uninfected schoolchildren living in an endemic area in Lambaréné, Gabon. Children with schistosomiasis had an increased frequency of various memory B cell subsets, including subsets associated with B cell exhaustion, and a concomitant decrease in naive B cells. To study the effect of <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection on B cells in more detail we isolated peripheral blood B cells and found that B cells from infected children had a reduced capacity to proliferate and produce TNF-α in response to both B cell receptor and Toll-like receptor stimulation. These results provide new insights into the role of B cells in the host immune response to schistosomiasis and may provide a novel target for therapeutic strategies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Schistosomiasis is a major parasitic disease of humans in the developing world, with over 200 million people infected worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-World1">[1]</xref>. As with other chronic helminth infections, schistosomes cause widespread immune activation and deregulation leading to general T cell hyporesponsiveness supporting the long term survival of the parasite and minimizing immunopathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Burke1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Allen1">[4]</xref>. Resistance to schistosomiasis is only gradually acquired and is attributed to cumulative exposure to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Woolhouse1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Yazdanbakhsh1">[6]</xref>. Mice vaccination experiments with radiation-attenuated <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae showed less protection against re-infection in µMT B cell-deficient mice than in wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Jankovic1">[7]</xref>, and the transfer of serum from infected rodents to naive animals can protect against infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Sher1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Mangold1">[9]</xref>, suggesting that antibodies are important for protection against infection. In human infection, protective IgA, IgE and IgG levels have been demonstrated against adult worm antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Vereecken1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Khalife1">[11]</xref>, and resistance to (re-) infection is correlated with an increased ratio between IgE and IgG4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-McManus1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, expression of CD23, the low affinity IgE receptor which can be strongly up-regulated by IL-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Pene1">[13]</xref>, is also correlated with development of resistance to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> re-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Mwinzi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Black1">[15]</xref>. While B lymphocytes support the establishment of the strong Th2 profile associated with helminth infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Harris1">[16]</xref>, more recently they have also been shown to play an active regulatory role in the course of <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-vanderVlugt1">[17]</xref> mostly effecting T cell responses.</p>
      <p>In general, immunological memory is characterized by its ability to respond more rapidly and robustly to re-infection and is dependent on the generation and maintenance of memory B cells (MBCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Crotty1">[18]</xref>. Memory B cells, originally defined as CD27<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Agematsu1">[19]</xref>, can be further characterized into additional subsets by co-staining with IgD into non-switched MBCs (CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup>), switched MBCs (CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>−</sup>) and double negative MBCs (CD27<sup>−</sup>IgD<sup>−</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Klein1">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, co-staining with CD21 can be used to separate classical MBCs (CD27<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup>) from activated MBCs (CD27<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>) and atypical MBCs (CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Moir1">[21]</xref>. Based on these markers, naive B cells can be classified as CD27<sup>−</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup>or CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup>. Recent studies have shown that chronic HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Moir1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Moir2">[22]</xref> as well as exposure to and infection with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss2">[24]</xref> are associated with the expansion of atypical or ‘exhausted’ MBCs (CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>). These cells are characterized by high expression of the inhibitory receptor FCRL4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Ehrhardt1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Ehrhardt2">[26]</xref>, and it has been suggested that this population may contribute to diminished pathogen-specific antibody responses in infected individuals. Other chronic infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Sugalski1">[27]</xref> have also shown perturbations in the distribution of peripheral B cells subsets, most notably within the memory B cell compartment suggesting that MBCs may play a role in disease pathogenesis as well as insufficient immune response to combat the disease.</p>
      <p>Ligation of the B cell receptor (BCR) by its cognate antigen leads to the production of antibodies and, depending on the cytokines produced by Th cells, to further antibody isotype switching and affinity maturation. B cells can also express a variety of innate receptors, most notably Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and can play a significant role in innate immune responses as B cells upregulate activation markers, proliferate and secrete cytokines upon engagement of these receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Booth1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-BekeredjianDing1">[29]</xref>. Importantly, TLR stimulation can also potentiate the T cell-dependent production of antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Nemazee1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Pasare1">[31]</xref>. TLR9 is highly expressed in human B cells and is ligated by bacterial DNA motifs containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that TLR9 stimulation is sufficient to directly induce both naive and memory B cell proliferation and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Jiang1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Bernasconi1">[33]</xref>. In addition, the role of B cells in innate immune responses has gained further interest as several studies have demonstrated a pathogenic role for B cells independent of their ability to produce antibodies. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are associated with abnormally increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production by B cells, including TNF-α. Importantly TNF-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Anolik1">[34]</xref>, along with more recently IL-17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Mbow1">[35]</xref>, is also one of the key cytokines involved in schistosome-induced pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Henri1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Booth2">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently there is little information on the composition of the peripheral blood B cell compartment or the concomitant adaptive and innate functionality of B cells during the course of human <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection. In this study, we compared the circulating B cell subsets in peripheral blood of schistosome-infected and uninfected Gabonese schoolchildren and their B cell response to BCR and TLR engagement.</p>

        <p>In April 2008 we initiated a study to investigate the effect of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection on B cell phenotype and function.

Frequencies of unstimulated B cells that produced TNF-α, expressed CD23 or were positive for Ki-67 did not differ between infected and uninfected children. As TNF-α production and CD23 expression levels were highest following CpG stimulation, with no significant enhancement when combined with anti-IgG/IgM co-stimulation, we focused on CpG stimulations for comparison between infected and uninfected children. TNF-α-producing B cell frequencies were significantly lower in infected children as compared to uninfected children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and this was not upregulated upon treatment.

The proportion of switched MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and double negative MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) was significantly increased in schistosome-infected children and these levels were significantly reduced to levels comparable to the uninfected control group following treatment.

The proportion of activated MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) was significantly increased and there was a trend toward a higher percentage of atypical MBCs (p = 0.058) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) in peripheral blood of schistosome-infected children and levels of both were significantly reduced following clearance of infection. Similarly the level of naive B cells was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) following treatment, while no differences were found in the proportion of classical MBCs either between the groups or at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). While CD10, a marker of immature and germinal center B cells, was not included in these panels separate analysis showed the level of immature and germinal center B cells within our population to be ∼2.75% (median) with no differences between schistosome-infected and -uninfected children, 2.7% and 2.8% respectively (p = 0.798). To study the nature of atypical MBCs (CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>), we determined the expression levels of HLA-DR and FCRL4, a cell surface marker that is characteristic for exhausted MBCs. In line with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Ehrhardt1">[25]</xref>, FCRL4 was expressed at significantly higher levels on atypical MBCs compared to classical MBCs (CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>) and naive B cells (CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup>) in uninfected children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002094.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).

        <title>B cell subset inflammatory cytokine response, activation and proliferation</title>
        <p>To investigate whether changes in TNF-α, Ki-67 and CD23 observed in total B cells were attributed to specific B cell subsets, we extended our flow cytometry analysis to include the various B cell subsets defined by CD21 and CD27 expression, first gating on CD10<sup>−</sup> B cells. Isolated B cells were stimulated with anti-IgG/IgM, CpG or a combination of the two and stained for the expression of intracellular TNF-α and Ki-67 and surface CD23. We found that CpG stimulation alone or in combination with anti-IgG/IgM resulted in significant loss of CD27 expression (data not shown); as a result it was no longer possible to differentiate the four B cell subpopulations with the same criteria as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. We therefore focused on anti-IgG/IgM-stimulated cells, as here we could still distinguish the four B cell populations and analyzed the responses of the various B cell subsets in uninfected children. We found very high frequencies of TNF-α-producing activated MBCs, followed by classical MBCs and atypical MBCs and observed the lowest frequencies among naive B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). When comparing the various B cell subsets for their ability to respond to BCR engagement between infected and uninfected children, we observed significantly less TNF-α<sup>+</sup> activated MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and classical MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and a trend for lower levels in the naive B cells and atypical MBCs in the infected children (data not shown). These data reflect the reduced TNF-α production in the total B cell population observed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and likewise the levels of TNF-α following treatment were not restored to levels observed in the uninfected children for any of the subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g006">Figure 6B, C</xref>). These data point at a reduced capacity of B cells from infected children to produce TNF-α in response to anti-IgG/IgM stimulation which extends to all B cell subsets studied. While classical MBCs had higher frequencies of CD23 and Ki-67 expressing cells, no differences were observed between infected and uninfected children for any of the subsets or upon treatment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although many studies have investigated the types and frequencies of various immune cell subsets, including T cells and DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Grogan1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Nausch1">[49]</xref>, little is known about the human B cell compartment during the course of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection. In the present study, we have analyzed innate and antibody-driving pathways in total B cells and different peripheral B cell subsets and compared their responses between infected and uninfected Gabonese schoolchildren. We found that <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection leads to changes in B cell function as well as alterations of the total B cell compartment and these changes are not restricted to a single B cell population.</p>
      <p>When evaluating B cell functionality, we found significantly lower frequencies of TNF-α-producing and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> proliferating B cells in <italic>S. haematobium-</italic>infected children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g002">Figure 2D and F</xref>). Interestingly, Ki-67<sup>+</sup> B cell frequencies were restored to levels comparable to uninfected children following anti-schistosome treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), but TNF-α levels remained significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The downregulation of TNF-α and B cell proliferation in <italic>S. haematobium</italic> positive children may be a result of immunomodulation induced by the parasite to prolong its survival. This would be in line with studies showing that TNF-α might play an important role in immunity to helminths: TNF-α production by B cells was necessary for sustained antibody production and establishment of protective immunity to <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Wojciechowski1">[50]</xref>. Moreover, B-cell derived TNF-α has been shown to enhance IFN-γ production by T cells in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>-infected mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Menard1">[51]</xref> and it is thought that an effective Th1 response is key to natural acquisition of resistance against <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-McManus1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-CorreaOliveira1">[52]</xref>. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that the long lasting reduction in B cell capacity to produce TNF-α, as demonstrated post-treatment, may in part contribute to the slow development of resistance to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection, although presence of other unknown concomitant viral or fungal infections may also play a role.</p>
      <p>In the current study we analyzed CD23 as a TLR activation marker on B cells, however CD23 is also correlated with the development of resistance to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Mwinzi1">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, cross-linking of CD23-bound IgE by antigen may induce cellular activation and increased IgE production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Onguru1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Griffith1">[54]</xref>. Repeated rounds of treatment and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> re-infection led to a gradual increase in CD23 expression and resistance in a cohort of Kenyan children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Black1">[15]</xref>. This seems partly in contrast to our results, as the elevated CD23 levels in infected children are reduced after treatment. However in the Kenyan cohort levels of CD23 expression were evaluated in fresh whole blood samples while here we measured CD23 expression on stimulated B cells as a marker of B cell activation. Baseline levels of CD23 expression on <italic>ex-vivo</italic> PBMCs in our population did not differ, however CD23 levels following treatment were not measured. It would therefore be of interest to measure the dynamics of CD23 expression in our population longitudinally following multiple rounds of treatment.</p>
      <p>Perturbations in the frequency of various B cell subsets have been demonstrated in a number of disease states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Anolik1">[34]</xref> and here we found an increase in the switched MBCs, the double negative MBCs and activated MBCs, as well as a trend toward a higher percentage of atypical MBCs and a concomitant decrease of naive B cells in schistosome-infected children. All populations were restored to levels observed in uninfected children following treatment. It is unclear whether the increase in naive B cells following treatment is due to <italic>de novo</italic> generation of B cells from the bone marrow, expansion of the pre-existing naive B cell population or results from a decrease in the levels of the other subsets.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that in HIV- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Moir1">[21]</xref> and malaria-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss2">[24]</xref> an exhausted/atypical memory B cell population (CD27<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>−</sup>), was greatly expanded and that these cells were hyporesponsive and had a decreased ability to differentiate into antibody secreting cells, contributing to the diminished pathogen-specific antibody responses in infected individuals. Likewise, it has been suggested that double negative (CD27<sup>−</sup>IgD<sup>−</sup>) MBCs, which are increased in SLE, might be exhausted/terminally differentiated memory B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Bulati1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-RodriguezBayona1">[56]</xref>. In chronic <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection we similarly see an expansion of both double negative and atypical MBCs. The overlap between these two MBC subpopulations, their capacity to produce schistosome-specific antibodies or the exact characteristics of their ‘exhausted’ state are currently not clear.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless it is interesting to note that schistosome-infected children carry higher frequencies of IgG<sup>+</sup> double negative (CD27<sup>−</sup>IgD<sup>−</sup>) MBCs compared to uninfected children, whereas no differences are observed in the levels of IgM<sup>+</sup> or IgA<sup>+</sup> DN MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, no differences were observed in total serum IgM, IgA nor IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3, whereas significant differences were only observed in IgG4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002094-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, serum levels of IgG4 were significantly decreased following treatment and correlated with a concomitant decrease in the frequency of the DN MBCs, suggesting that the increase in IgG<sup>+</sup> DN MBCs may be predominantly due to an increase in IgG4-expressing B cells. As IgG4 is associated with susceptibility and IgE with resistance to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection, it would be of interest to study these isotypes on the different memory B cell populations in exposed but resistant individuals. These studies could shed further light on the various ways in which <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection modulates the immune response providing further information for the design of an effective vaccine.</p>
      <p>Although the function of double negative and atypical MBCs is not yet clear in the context of <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection, it is tempting to speculate that these may be expanded as a result of the chronic nature and strong immunomodulation of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection. These memory B cells may limit the associated pathology while at the same time limiting the effectiveness of the immune response against the parasite. Indeed, a protective role against malaria infection has been proposed for atypical MBCs through regulation of the host's immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Weiss2">[24]</xref>. This parallels FCRL4<sup>+</sup> tissue-like MBCs in lymphoid tissue, which may protect against invading pathogens directly or indirectly through the secretion of cytokines and their influence on other immune cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Ehrhardt1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Ehrhardt2">[26]</xref>. A recent study has highlighted the dual nature of B cells in immune responses demonstrating that the same B cells may play both a regulatory (IL-10) or pathogenic (IL-6) role depending on the signals received <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002094-Barr1">[57]</xref>. It would be of interest to investigate concomitantly the production of both IL-6 and IL-10 by the various MBC subsets and naive B cells to see the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory B cell responses during <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection.</p>
      <p>As demonstrated above <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection leads to significant changes in B cell function as well as alterations of the B cell compartment in peripheral blood of infected children as compared to healthy controls. Further studies are needed to define whether these changes in the frequency of the various subsets have functional consequences and what their role is in the immune response against <italic>S. haematobium</italic>.</p>
