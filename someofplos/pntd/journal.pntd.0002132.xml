      <abstract>
        <p>The peritrophic matrix (PM) plays a key role in compartmentalization of the blood meal and as barrier to pathogens in many disease vectors. To establish an infection in sand flies, <italic>Leishmania</italic> must escape from the endoperitrophic space to prevent excretion with remnants of the blood meal digestion. In spite of the role played regarding <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival, little is known about sand fly PM molecular components and structural organization. We characterized three peritrophins (PpPer1, PpPer2, and PpPer3) from <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic>. PpPer1 and PpPer2 display, respectively, four and one chitin-binding domains (CBDs). PpPer3 on the other hand has two CBDs, one mucin-like domain, and a putative domain with hallmarks of a CBD, but with changes in key amino acids. Temporal and spatial expression analyses show that <italic>PpPer1</italic> is expressed specifically in the female midgut after blood feeding. <italic>PpPer2</italic> and <italic>PpPer3</italic> mRNAs were constitutively expressed in midgut and hindgut, with <italic>PpPer3</italic> also being expressed in Malpighian tubules. <italic>PpPer2</italic> was the only gene expressed in developmental stages. Interestingly, <italic>PpPer1</italic> and <italic>PpPer3</italic> expression are regulated by <italic>Le. major</italic> infection. Recombinant PpPer1, PpPer2 and PpPer3 were obtained and shown to display similar biochemical profiles as the native; we also show that PpPer1 and PpPer2 are able to bind chitin. Knockdown of <italic>PpPer1</italic> led to a 44% reduction in protein, which in spite of producing an effect on the percentage of infected sand flies, resulted in a 39% increase of parasite load at 48 h. Our data suggest that PpPer1 is a component for the <italic>P. papatasi</italic> PM and likely involved in the PM role as barrier against <italic>Le. major</italic> infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>For a successful development within the midgut of the sand fly vector, <italic>Leishmania</italic> must overcome several barriers imposed by the vector that include the digestive proteases secreted within the midgut following a blood meal by the insect, the need to escape from the endoperitrophic space, and attachment to the midgut epithelia to prevent excretion with the remnants of the blood meal. The sand fly peritrophic matrix (PM) constitutes an important barrier against the establishment of <italic>Leishmania</italic> within the sand fly and if trapped within the PM these parasites will be passed along with the remnants of the blood meal. Despite the role of sand fly PM on <italic>Leishmania</italic> development, characterization of its molecular components and assessment of their roles against <italic>Leishmania</italic> are lacking. Thereby, we performed the molecular characterization of three <italic>P. papatasi</italic> peritrophins named PpPer1, PpPer2, and PpPer3. Overall, we demonstrated that: (1) PpPer3 displays a putative CBD domain that might have undertaken neo-functionalization, (2) <italic>PpPer1</italic> and <italic>PpPer3</italic> genes display differential gene expression upon <italic>Le. major</italic> infection; and (3) PpPer1 seems to be an important component for the function of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> PM as a barrier against <italic>Le. major</italic> infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Leishmaniasis is a neglected vector-borne disease caused by several different species of <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Herwaldt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao1">[2]</xref>. Current estimates of the distribution of leishmaniasis worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Alvar1">[3]</xref> indicate that endemic transmission occurs in 98 countries, with an approximate incidence of 500,000 new human cases are diagnosed annually, and 350 million people are at risk of becoming infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-TDRWHO1">[4]</xref>. The DALY (or disability adjusted life years) burden for leishmaniasis is 2 million <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-TDRWHO1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Leishmania</italic> are digenetic parasites, developing in a suitable mammalian host and within the sand fly vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Kamhawi1">[5]</xref>. To date, over 90 species of phlebotomine sand flies have been proven or incriminated as vectors of <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-WHO1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to survive and successfully establish an infection in the sand fly, <italic>Leishmania</italic> must overcome many barriers (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao1">[2]</xref>). First, and following ingestion with the blood meal, transitional stage <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes must survive a proteolytic attack by digestive enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta1">[7]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Secundino1">[10]</xref>. Upon developing into the promastigote stage, parasites (nectomonads) escape from the endoperitrophic space after PM breakdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Sdlov1">[11]</xref> and attach to the midgut epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Kamhawi2">[13]</xref>, in both cases to prevent excretion following the digestion of the blood meal. It has also been shown that an anterior plug prevents premature migration of nectomonads to anterior midgut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Secundino1">[10]</xref>. As parasites develop into metacyclic promastigotes, they must detach from the midgut and migrate towards the foregut and the cardia (or stomodeal valve area). At the cardia, it has been shown that <italic>Leishmania</italic>-secreted chitinase damages the stomodeal valve preventing its normal function, and forcing the sand fly to regurgitate the contents of the gut as it attempts to blood feed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Schlein2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Rogers1">[15]</xref>. It is widely accepted that regurgitation carries <italic>Leishmania</italic> onto the skin of the vertebrate host, and this is the principal mechanism of parasite transmission.</p>
      <p>Regarding the sand fly PM, earlier findings suggested that it serves as a barrier against <italic>Leishmania</italic> development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Walters1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Feng1">[17]</xref>. These results were further supported by feeding the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin to <italic>P. papatasi</italic> and showing that <italic>Leishmania major</italic> remained trapped inside a thicker PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta1">[7]</xref>. These latter studies also revealed a dual role for the sand fly PM in protecting as well as serving as barrier to <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the PM is an important component of sand fly vector competence.</p>
      <p>Despite its importance, little is known about the molecular components of the sand fly PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Jochim1">[19]</xref>, or their roles during infection with <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>
      <p>Here, we characterized three peritrophins, PpPer1, PpPer2, and PpPer3, previously identified in the midgut of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao2">[18]</xref>. PpPer1 and PpPer2 are likely involved in the formation of the PM scaffold, as suggested by their expression profiles and ability of the respective recombinant proteins to bind exogenous chitin. PpPer3 on the other hand may be involved in mechanisms related to protection of the epithelia, as this peritrophin displays a mucin domain and is expressed in both gut tissues and Malpighian tubules. We also investigated the role of the sand fly PM as a barrier for <italic>Leishmania</italic> development. Our results indicate that reduction of PpPer1 expression levels leads to an increase in <italic>Le. major</italic> load in <italic>P. papatasi</italic>. Altogether, our results suggest that PpPer1 plays a significant role in <italic>Le. major</italic> development within the vector midgut.</p>

        <p>All sand flies used were <italic>P. papatasi</italic> (PPIS strain) reared at Department of Entomology, Kansas State University, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-CoutinhoAbreu1">[30]</xref>. For the adult flies 3-to-5 day-old insects were used in the experiments described below.</p>
        <p>Blood feeding of sand flies was performed using two methods: 1) direct feeding on anesthetized (100 mg/kg of ketamine; and 3 mg/kg xylazine) BALB/c mice; and 2) using glass feeders filled with heat-inactivated mouse blood or heat-inactivated mouse blood mixed with 5√ó10<sup>6</sup> <italic>Le. major</italic> amastigotes/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-CoutinhoAbreu1">[30]</xref>. Flies that were fed directly on the anesthetized mouse were used in the RT-PCR assays. The feeding of flies using the glass feeders was for flies used in real time PCR analyses, and for the flies injected with dsRNA. Only fully engorged sand flies were used.</p>
        <p><italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> dissections, RNA isolations, and cDNA syntheses were performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-CoutinhoAbreu1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Total RNA obtained from various tissues from adult females were dissected and pooled as follows. For midguts, five tissues from sugar fed (0 h) were dissected and combined. Likewise, five blood fed midguts also were dissected and combined at each of the following time points: 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h, and 144 h post blood meal (PBM). Pools of adult carcasses, hindguts, heads plus salivary glands, ovaries, and Malpighian tubules were made from tissues obtained from single sand flies dissected at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h, and 144 h PBM. The pool of fat bodies was made from single flies dissected at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 36 h PBM. RNAs from developmental stages were obtained from pools of 20 eggs, 10 L1 larvae, and five each for stages L2, L3, L4, and five pupae. cDNAs obtained from RNA samples from pooled tissues were used in RT-PCR reactions described below.</p>
        <p>For the real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, <italic>P. papatasi</italic> midguts were dissected from flies that fed either on blood or blood plus <italic>Le. major</italic> (glass feeders) at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h PBM. cDNAs obtained from eight RNA samples representing individual midguts from each of the three time points were used for real time PCR reactions below.</p>

        <p>The complete cDNA sequences of <italic>P. papatasi PpPer1</italic>, <italic>PpPer2</italic>, and <italic>PpPer3</italic> were previously identified and published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao2">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p><italic>PpPer1</italic> open read frame (ORF) is 792 bp long, encoding a protein of 263 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 28 kDa for the mature protein, and an acidic pI (4.84). Putative <italic>N</italic>- and <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation at residues N29 and T211, respectively, are expected to add to the molecular weight of the secreted protein. PpPer1 displays a predicted signal peptide (amino acid residues 1‚Äì18), suggesting the protein is secreted into the midgut lumen. Four type-A CBDs (PpPer1 CBD consensus sequence: CX<sub>13‚Äì19</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>9‚Äì10</sub>CX<sub>12</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>C) are also present in the mature protein. In addition, two putative HRM were identified at amino acid residues 182‚Äì183 in the third CBD (Pp1CBD3 residues 44 and 45 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and at residues 209‚Äì210 in the fourth CBD (Pp1CBD4 residues 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

Pp1CBD1, Pp1CBD2, Pp1CBD3, and Pp1CBD4 are PpPer1 CBDs. Pp2CBD1 is the single CBD in PpPer2. Pp3CBD1 and Pp3CBD2 are the two CBDs identified in PpPer3. Lulo1CBD1, Lulo1CBD2, Lulo1CBD3, and Lulo1CBD4 are the four CBDs in LuloPer1. Lulo2CBD1 and Lulo3CBD1 are the single CBDs in LuloPer2 and in LuloPer3, respectively. Ll3CBD1 and Ll3CBD2 are CBDs in LlPer3. Pp3put and Ll3put are putative domains similar to CBDs identified in <italic>P. papatasi</italic> PpPer3 and in <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> Ll3Per3. Such putative domain sequences also were identified in the N-terminal region of <italic>C. felis</italic> PL1 - CfPl1put; <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> conserved hypothetical protein - Cq16put; and <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Ae51put, Ae45put, and Ae52put.

        <p><italic>PpPer2</italic> ORF is 270 bp coding for a predicted 7.8 kDa mature protein with a single type-A CBD (consensus sequence: CX<sub>18</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>9</sub>CX<sub>12</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>C). Predicted <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation at amino acid residues N19 and N77 are also expected to increase the molecular weight of the protein. PpPer2 is an acidic protein (pI 4.25), with a single putative HRM at residues 22 and 23 of the predicted CBD (corresponding to residues 1 and 2 of Pp2CBD1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The presence of a signal peptide with cleavage site between amino acids A17 and A18 suggests the protein is secreted into the midgut lumen.</p>
        <p><italic>PpPer3</italic> is 313 bp with two CBDs. Unlike PpPer1 and PpPer2, PpPer3 has a mucin-like domain rich in serine (18.2%), threonine (36.4%), proline (12.1%), and glutamine (12.1%) residues in addition to two type-A CBDs (PpPer3 CBD consensus sequence: CX<sub>11</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>11‚Äì13</sub>CX<sub>12</sub>CX<sub>4‚Äì8</sub>C). The predicted molecular weight of the mature PpPer3 is 32 kDa. Moreover, this peritrophin has a neutral-to-basic pI (7.75). As a large number of residues (281T, 285T, 286T, 292S, 293T, 294T, 295T, 296T, 300S, 301S, 302S, 303T, 304T, 305T, 306T, 307T, 309S, 310S) within the mucin-like domain are predicted to be <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylated, PpPer3 molecular mass is expected to be significantly greater. Two additional features of PpPer3 are the presence of a 57-residue long linker between the first (Pp3CBD1) and second (Pp3CBD2) CBDs, and an N-terminal sequence containing eight cysteine residues (Pp3put, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although the Pp3put sequence displays a type-A CBD signature (CX<sub>10</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>11</sub>CX<sub>14</sub>CX<sub>10</sub>C) similar to other CBDs in <italic>P. papatasi</italic> peritrophins, it was not recognized as a <italic>bona fide</italic> CBD by standard bioinformatics' tools. Two predicted HRM were identified at residues 138‚Äì139 (corresponding to residues 29 and 30 in Pp3CBD1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and 150‚Äì151 (residues 44 and 45 in Pp3CBD1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>) in the first PpPer3 CBD while a single HRM was predicted in residues 262‚Äì263 (residues 44 and 45 in Pp3CBD2) in the second PpPer3 CBD sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>According to the multiple sequence alignment between <italic>P. papatasi</italic> and <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> peritrophin CBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the six conserved cysteine residues characteristic of type-A CBDs are present. Interestingly, the numbers of amino acid residues between the second and third cysteines, and between the fourth and fifth cysteines were the least variable. In addition, aromatic residues Y and F corresponding to positions 25 and 26 between the second and third cysteines, and position 48 between the fourth and fifth cysteines were detected. Regarding the HRM sites, most are co-localized with the first and fourth cysteine residues.</p>
        <p>Pp3put, a putative CBD domain present in the N-terminal portion of <italic>P. papatasi</italic> PpPer3 peritrophin, displays two extra cysteine residues at positions 18 and 53, and two residue insertion (PY) between the fourth and fifth conserved cysteines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This putative CBD domain displays neither HRM motifs nor aromatic residues at positions 25, 26, and 48. Interestingly, other insect peritrophins with features similar to Pp3put were also identified by searching the GenBank database against this putative CBD domain from <italic>P. papatasi</italic>.</p>
        <p>A phylogenetic analysis suggests a single clade for the Pp3put and Ll3put domains from sand flies (<italic>P. papatasi</italic> and <italic>L. longipalpis</italic>), the Ae45put, Ae52put, and Ae51put from <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the Cq16put from <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, and the CfPL1put from <italic>C. felis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g002">Figure 2</xref>, blue box).

Posttranslational modifications (e.g., glycosylation) likely were responsible for the increased molecular weight detected for the recombinant proteins. Interestingly, mass spec analysis of rPpPer2 indicated a major peak at 9.2 kDa, with a minor peak at 18.4 kDa, suggestive of dimerization of this protein (not shown). In contrast, the Western blot showed the presence of bands at approximately 16 kDa and 20-to-24 kDa in rPpPer2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002132-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we characterized three peritrophins of the sand fly <italic>P. papatasi</italic> thought to be involved in the formation of the PM in adult females. In addition, as the PM is an important component of vector competence in sand flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Walters1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Feng1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-CoutinhoAbreu1">[30]</xref>, we assessed the role of PpPer1 as a molecular barrier against <italic>Le. major</italic> development.</p>
      <p>Different than PpPer1 and PpPer2, PpPer3 is a mucin-like peritrophin with two CBDs and a mucin-like domain rich in serine, threonine, glutamine, and proline residues. Mucin-like domains are predicted to be heavily <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylated that contributes to a gel-like consistency for the PM, critical to their role in protecting the midgut epithelia from abrasion, hydrolytic enzymes, heavy metals, and pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Sarauer1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Wang1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to their role in PM formation, peritrophins are also known to participate in detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Devenport1">[40]</xref>. In the mosquito <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, the mucin-like peritrophin AeIMUC was shown to bind heme <italic>in vitro</italic> via heme-regulatory motifs (HRM), while it also bound chitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Devenport1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RaymsKeller1">[41]</xref>. HRMs are predicted for all three <italic>P. papatasi</italic> as well as the <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> peritrophins, suggesting a role for these proteins in heme binding and detoxification in sand flies.</p>
      <p>We identified the CBDs present in the three peritrophins from <italic>P. papatasi</italic> and those identified in <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> sequence databases as type-A CBDs displaying the molecular hallmarks required for chitin binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Tellam1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Hegedus1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Shen1">[43]</xref>. Chitin binding hallmarks include six conserved cysteine residues (with a conserved number of residues between each conserved cysteines matching the consensus sequence for type-A CBDs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Tellam1">[23]</xref>, and conserved aromatic amino acids residues predicted to interact with chitin fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Tellam1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Shen1">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the two putative CBDs Pp3put and Ll3put display the six conserved cysteines interspaced by the characteristic length expected for type-A CBDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Tellam1">[23]</xref>, amino acids other than aromatics are found in these putative domains. In addition, the Pp3put and Ll3put CBDs display two extra cysteines at residues 20 and 54 and have an unusual two-peptide insertion between the fourth and fifth conserved cysteines. Such features are in contrast with all the other <italic>bona fide</italic> sand fly type-A CBDs that display a conserved number of amino acids between the fourth and fifth cysteines (12 residues), and lack the extra cysteines present in the putative domains. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Pp3put and Ll3put CBD domains underwent some type of neo-functionalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Hahn1">[44]</xref>, and that such change might also have occurred in peritrophins of other insects, such as the cat flea and mosquitoes. This hypothesis is to some extent supported by our findings that PpPer3 (which has the Pp3put domain) also is expressed in the Malpighian tubules, and by the lack of binding of rPpPer3 to chitin (see below). Although the latter may be due to other factors, the expression in tissues other than the sand fly gut is suggestive of an additional function for this protein. Future functional characterization of these putative domains, both in <italic>P. papatasi</italic> and in <italic>L. longipalpis</italic>, will shed light on their functions.</p>
      <p>We also obtained recombinant rPpPer1, rPpPer2, and rPpPer3 and confirmed the ability of rPpPer1 and rPpPer2 to bind colloidal chitin and thus likely be involved in the formation of PM1 in <italic>P. papatasi</italic>.</p>
      <p>Our assessment of temporal and spatial expression of the <italic>P. papatasi</italic> peritrophins demonstrated that <italic>PpPer1</italic> expression is midgut-specific and blood-induced, resembling the transcriptional profile of <italic>PpChit1</italic>, a midgut specific <italic>P. papatasi</italic> chitinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao3">[32]</xref>. The PpPer1 protein appears to be secreted in the midgut at an earlier time point (24 h PBM) following a blood meal than PpChit1, whose activity peaks between 48 h and 72 h PBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-CoutinhoAbreu1">[30]</xref>. Nonetheless, these patterns of protein expression are consistent with the functional roles of PpPer1 and PpChit1 in PM formation and degradation, respectively.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the results observed for <italic>PpPer1</italic>, <italic>PpPer2</italic> and <italic>PpPer3</italic> mRNAs are expressed prior to blood feeding (constitutively), and their expression is not limited to the midgut: PpPer2 is expressed in the midgut and hindgut; while PpPer3 is expressed in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules. Although peritrophin expression in hindguts and/or Malpighian tubules have also been detected in the cat flea <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Gaines1">[45]</xref> and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Beyenbach1">[46]</xref>, the physiological roles of peritrophins in these tissues have not been determined. Regarding the constitutive expression patterns of <italic>PpPer2</italic> and <italic>PpPer3</italic>, the corresponding proteins might not be translated in the same fashion. In <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the peritrophin <italic>AeIMUCI</italic> is constitutively expressed, and yet the protein is only detected in blood fed midguts and up to 24 h PBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Devenport1">[40]</xref>. <italic>PpPer2</italic> also is expressed in larval stages, similar to <italic>AeIMUCI</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RaymsKeller1">[41]</xref>. However, following our assessment of midgut lysates for native peritrophin expression, it became evident that at least for PpPer1, protein expression in the midgut correlates with mRNA expression. Native PpPer1 is readily detected at 48 h PBM, matching its peak of mRNA expression. For native PpPer3, we observed significant levels of protein at 48 h, and lower amounts at 72 h and 96 h PBM. This profile correlates at least partially with the mRNA expression profiles observed.</p>
      <p>To assess whether or not <italic>Le. major</italic> infection is capable of modulating <italic>P. papatasi</italic> peritrophin gene expression, we compared <italic>PpPer1</italic>, <italic>PpPer2</italic>, and <italic>PpPer3</italic> mRNA levels between <italic>Le. major</italic> infected and blood fed midguts. Although <italic>Le. major</italic> infection was not able to modulate <italic>PpPer2</italic> expression profile, <italic>PpPer1</italic> and <italic>PpPer3</italic> expression levels changed significantly upon infection. Regulation of peritrophins was suggested by previous transcriptome analyses studies of both <italic>P. papatasi</italic> and <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Jochim1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Telleria1">[47]</xref>. The expression of <italic>PpPer1</italic> was up-regulated at 24 h post-infection whereas <italic>PpPer3</italic> mRNA levels were reduced at 24 h and 48 h post-infection. Up-regulation of <italic>PpPer1</italic> by <italic>Le. major</italic> may assist in protecting the parasite against proteolytic enzymes (parasite advantage), or may be a response by the sand fly in order to possibly reduce permeability of the PM (disadvantageous to the parasite). Whether one or multiple signals secreted by the parasite or present in the infected blood are involved in this regulation still needs to be determined. Similarly, regarding <italic>PpPer3</italic>, whether differential gene expression in infected midguts was parasite-mediated, or a vector-induced defensive response against infection, needs to be further investigated.</p>
      <p>The role of the <italic>P. papatasi</italic> peritrophin PpPer1 in <italic>Le. major</italic> development in <italic>P. papatasi</italic> midgut was assessed via RNA interference (RNAi). PpPer1 was chosen for RNAi experiments because it was shown to be expressed exclusively in the midgut, and only after blood feeding.</p>
      <p>The sand fly PM is thought to fulfill two apparently opposing roles (protection and barrier) when it comes to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao1">[2]</xref>. That sand fly PM protects <italic>Le. major</italic> against digestive enzymes early in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta1">[7]</xref> initially suggested to us that a potential alteration of the PM scaffold, increasing its permeability by the knockdown or removal of one or more peritrophins, would lead to killing of parasites. The injection of dsPpPer1 into <italic>P. papatasi</italic> thorax reduced <italic>PpPer1</italic> mRNA and PpPer1 protein levels by 45%. Although no difference in the prevalence of infected sand flies was observed at 48 h post-infection (not shown), PpPer1 knockdown led to a significant increase (39%) in <italic>Le. major</italic> load in <italic>P. papatasi</italic> midguts. One possibility to explain these results is that a PM with increased permeability may allow a greater influx of digestive enzymes to the endoperitrophic space, turning blood meal digestion faster and making nutrients more readily available for <italic>Le. major</italic> multiplication. Although increased <italic>Le. major</italic> load in <italic>PpPer1</italic> knockdown also was noted at 96 h post-infection (22%), this increase was not statistically significant. Our results showing that knockdown of PpPer1 with concomitant increase in parasite load at 48 h post infection do not exactly contradict those of Pimenta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Pimenta1">[7]</xref>. In that case, killing of <italic>Leishmania</italic> was induced by the complete lack of the PM by addition of exogenous chitinases to the blood meal which might also have affected the parasite's own chitinase. In contrast, here, we specifically knocked down a single peritrophin but, overall, the PM was still present likely leading to the distinct outcome between the two studies: killing of <italic>Leishmania</italic> versus increased load. Future studies to assess the changes in PM porosity caused by the knockdown of PpPer1 and how such changes may affect the flow of digestive proteases and nutrients in and out of the endoperitrophic space will help clarify these issues. Recently, Araujo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-Arajo1">[48]</xref> showed that adding chitinase to the blood meal led to accelerated egg-laying by sand flies and a reduction of the total eggs laid per females, and it was likely associated with a speedier acquisition of nutrients due to the lack of the PM. Conversely, current data from our laboratory (not shown) indicate that feeding flies with antisera targeting the sand fly midgut chitinase PpChit1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002132-RamalhoOrtigao3">[32]</xref> leads to a delay in egg laying after blood feeding and an increase the number of eggs laid per female. Taken together these results suggest that the integrity and the permeability of the PM interfere with the development of <italic>Leishmania</italic> as well as with fitness in sand flies.</p>

Lysate from 10 <italic>P. papatasi</italic> midguts dissected 48 h PBM (native proteins) (A), and rPpPer1 (B), rPpPer2 (C) and rPpPer3 (D) were fractionated using HPLC. The A<sub>280</sub> absorption spectra for the eluted samples following HPLC fractionation were obtained and 10 ¬µl from each fraction were placed on nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with specific antisera (A and D) or with anti-His antibodies (B and C). Numbers on the A<sub>280</sub> spectra refer to retention time for each peak. (A) Dot blots containing midgut lysate fractions were incubated with anti-PpPer1 (1) and anti-PpPer3 (2) antisera, respectively. (D) Dot blot was incubated with anti-PpPer3 antisera. Numbers on top of dot blots refer to each fraction collected (fractions were blotted vertically).</p>
