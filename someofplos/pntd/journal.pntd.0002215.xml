<abstract>
<p>Despite the devastating impact of mosquito-borne illnesses on human health, surprisingly little is known about mosquito developmental biology, including development of the olfactory system, a tissue of vector importance. Analysis of mosquito olfactory developmental genetics has been hindered by a lack of means to target specific genes during the development of this sensory system. In this investigation, chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles were used to target <italic>semaphorin-1a (sema1a)</italic> during olfactory system development in the dengue and yellow fever vector mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Immunohistochemical analyses and anterograde tracing of antennal sensory neurons, which were used to track the progression of olfactory development in this species, revealed antennal lobe defects in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown fourth instar larvae. These findings, which correlated with a larval odorant tracking behavioral phenotype, identified previously unreported roles for Sema1a in the developing insect larval olfactory system. Analysis of <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown pupae also revealed a number of olfactory phenotypes, including olfactory receptor neuron targeting and projection neuron defects coincident with a collapse in the structure and shape of the antennal lobe and individual glomeruli. This study, which is to our knowledge the first functional genetic analysis of insect olfactory development outside of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, identified critical roles for Sema1a during <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval and pupal olfactory development and advocates the use of chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles as an effective means of targeting genes during post-embryonic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> development. Use of siRNA nanoparticle methodology to understand sensory developmental genetics in mosquitoes will provide insight into the evolutionary conservation and divergence of key developmental genes which could be exploited in the development of both common and species-specific means for intervention.</p>

<p>Although mosquitoes transmit many of the world's deadliest diseases, mosquito developmental biology has been grossly understudied. To address this issue, we have begun to develop the dengue and yellow fever vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> as an emerging model for understanding mosquito developmental genetics. In this investigation, we analyze development of the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> olfactory system, a tissue of vector importance which is critical for recognition of human blood meal hosts and many other essential behaviors. We used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which were delivered through chitosan nanoparticle feedings to larvae, to target the axon guidance gene <italic>semaphorin-1a (sema1a)</italic>. Loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> resulted in a variety of larval and pupal olfactory system defects, and these defects correlated with an odorant tracking behavioral phenotype. This study revealed that <italic>sema1a</italic> function is required for proper olfactory system development, and these findings advocate the use of chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles as an effective means of targeting genes in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A lack of functional genetic analyses in vector mosquitoes has prevented us from gaining insight into how the process of development is regulated in these insect vectors of human disease. To address this problem, we have begun to functionally characterize the development of the dengue and yellow fever vector mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons1">[1]</xref>. Here, we investigate development of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> olfactory system, a sensory system which is critical for detection of human blood meal hosts and many other vital behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Hallem1">[2]</xref>. Gross morphological descriptions of the developing <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> olfactory system were described over three decades ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Raminani1">[3]</xref>, but detailed characterization of the development of this tissue through analysis of molecular marker expression has not yet been reported. Moreover, genetic regulation of olfactory system development has not been well-characterized in mosquitoes or in any other arthropod species outside of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p>
<p>Sequencing of the mosquito genomes has opened new avenues in vector biology research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Holt1">[4]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Arensburger1">[6]</xref>. Recent studies have provided insight into the function of odorant receptor (OR) genes in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Bohbot1">[7]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Grant1">[10]</xref>, but genes that are essential for the proper development of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> olfactory system have not yet been identified. Members of the Semaphorin (Sema) family of axon guidance molecules regulate the development of a number of tissues in a variety of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Flannery1">[11]</xref>. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Sema1a, a transmembrane member of this family initially studied in the context of the embryonic ventral nerve cord, is required for proper development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal olfactory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Kolodkin1">[12]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>. The convergence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the same receptor onto specific glomeruli, a common organizing principle in animal olfactory systems, is regulated by Sema1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Bashaw1">[16]</xref>. Genetic mosaic analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which differential levels of Sema1a expression are detected among glomeruli, demonstrated that loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> results in axon misprojection phenotypes in subclasses of ORNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Sweeney1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, graded Sema1a expression in the antennal lobe is required for the proper targeting of projection neuron dendrites into the antennal lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Komiyama1">[13]</xref>. Although Sema1a expression has been detected in the developing <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> olfactory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Eickhoff1">[17]</xref>, the function of Sema1a during pupal olfactory development has not yet been assessed in insects other than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Our recent studies have revealed differences between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> development, including differences in the <italic>sema1a</italic> loss of function embryonic nerve cord phenotypes in the two species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons2">[18]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Haugen1">[20]</xref>. These studies suggest that while knowledge of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> development can serve as a springboard for understanding <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> development, it will be critical to functionally examine the roles of developmental genes directly in mosquito pupae. Unfortunately, assessing the function of genes in insect pupae is technically very challenging, and few have attempted such experiments.</p>
<p>While recent studies have increased our understanding of pupal olfactory system development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Rodrigues1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Brochtrup1">[22]</xref>, the genetics of larval nervous system development, and more specifically development of the larval olfactory system, is largely unexplored in most insects. The insect larval olfactory system mimics the architecture of the pupal and adult olfactory system, but is reduced in cell number and therefore less complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Gerber1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Xia1">[24]</xref>. This reduced complexity makes the larval antennal lobe an ideal tissue in which to track olfactory system development. Given that pupal olfactory system defects are known to result from loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Komiyama1">[13]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>, it is possible that Sema1a may also regulate olfactory development in insect larvae. However, this hypothesis has not yet been examined in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or mosquitoes. Furthermore, early larval antennal lobe development has not been characterized in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and detailed characterization of this process would therefore need to precede analysis of gene function in this tissue.</p>
<p>The <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome contains a single ortholog of <italic>D. melanogaster sema1a</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Behura1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Haugen1">[20]</xref>, which is the focus of this investigation. It was hypothesized that this axon guidance gene would regulate neural targeting in the developing larval and pupal olfactory system of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Here, we use molecular marker analysis and anterograde dye fills to characterize olfactory system development in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae and pupae. We then use chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle gene targeting to investigate the function of <italic>sema1a</italic> during <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> olfactory development. The results of this investigation indicate that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval and pupal olfactory system development can be disrupted through chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle targeting of <italic>sema1a</italic>.</p>

<p>Knockdown of <italic>sema1a</italic> was achieved via chitosan/siRNA-nanoparticle feedings.

<p>Application of cross-reactive antibodies has enabled visualization of components of the developing brain of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Mysore1">[28]</xref>. These antibodies were used to examine olfactory development in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae. The presumptive antennal lobe is visualized as a dense region marked by staining with a pan-neuronal antibody (anti-HRP) in third instar larvae (L3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Fig. 1A.1</xref>). At this time, monoclonal antibody (mAb) nc82 labeling of the synaptic neuropil marker Bruchpilot initiates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Fig. 1A.1</xref>). By the late fourth instar larval (L4) stage, mAb nc82 detects the antennal lobe as a distinct neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Fig. 1B.1</xref>) and marks the region targeted by antennal ORNs (see below). At the mid-pupal stage (24 hours after puparium formation, APF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Fig. 1C.1</xref>) the antennal lobe is morphologically distinct, suggesting that the ORNs have targeted (starting from 9‚Äì12 h APF) to their respective glomeruli within the antennal lobe and synapsed with second order projection neurons. From this stage (24 hours APF) until emergence as adults, morphological examinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Mysore1">[28]</xref> have suggested that the antennal lobe undergoes structural refinement and fine-tuning of these established connections.</p>

<p>Knockdown of <italic>sema1a</italic> was assessed in mosquitoes fed with nanoparticles containing a mixture of <italic>sema1a</italic>-targeting siRNA<sup>1198</sup> and siRNA<sup>890</sup> (A, C, E). qRT-PCR experiments (A) demonstrated that <italic>sema1a</italic> levels were significantly reduced in whole L4 knockdown (KD) animals as compared to control-fed animals (p&lt;0.01, N‚Ää=‚Ää5, where N is the number of biological replicates). Nearly complete loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> transcript expression is observed in the brain of an L4 animal fed with chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles targeting <italic>sema1a</italic> (C; compare to control-fed animal in B). Arrowheads mark the antennal lobes in B and C, and brains are oriented dorsal up in both panels. Knockdown could also be detected through anti-Sema1a antibody staining 24 hours APF (E1). In control-fed pupae, Sema1a protein (D1) is detected in a wild-type lateral to medial gradient expression pattern 24 hours APF. The nearly complete loss of Sema1a expression observed in an animal fed with chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles targeting <italic>sema1a</italic> results in glomeruli malformation (visualized with mAb nc82 staining in E2, levels are increased to view glomerular structures; compare to control-fed animals in D2). Merge images are shown in D3 and E3. Images in D and E are a compilation of 5 confocal sections so as to ensure that the gradient is not an artifact of natural tissue curvature.

<title><italic>sema1a</italic> is required for larval antennal lobe development</title>
<p>A combination of anterograde labeling of antennal sensory neurons and histochemical marker analyses was used to examine antennal lobe development in L4 nanoparticle control-fed vs. <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals. In chitosan/siRNA control-fed L4 animals, antennal sensory neuron tracts enter the developing antennal lobe region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4B.1</xref>), which is marked through mAb nc82 co-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4B.3</xref>).

<title>Larval antennal lobe defects in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals.</title>
<p>In wildtype (A) and control-fed (B) L4 larvae, antennal sensory neurons innervate the antennal lobe (marked by dotted yellow circle throughout the figure), which is labeled by mAb nc82 staining (A3, B3). Serotonergic projection neurons are marked by 5HT staining in the antennal lobes of these animals (A2, B2; overlays of all three labels are shown in A4 and B4). <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (C‚ÄìE) show a reduction in the number of antennal neurons (C1, D1, E1) targeting the antennal lobe, which is marked by reduced mAb nc82 synaptic neuropil staining (C3, D3, E3; weak levels are slightly increased in these panels so that the antennal lobe staining can be viewed). Reduced anti-serotonin 5HT staining of projection neurons is also observed in knockdown animals (C2, D2, E2; overlays of all three labels are shown in C4, D4, and E4). Comparable antennal lobe <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown phenotypes are observed in animals fed with siRNA<sup>1198</sup> (D), siRNA<sup>890</sup> (E), or a combination of the two (<italic>sema1a</italic> KD in C).

<p>Anterograde labeling experiments demonstrated that fewer antennal sensory neurons innervate the developing antennal lobe in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown L4 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C.1</xref>). This reduction did not appear to result from death of sensory neurons, which still expressed appropriate markers in their cell bodies (data not shown). <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown L4 larvae were also assessed through staining with mAb nc82 and anti-5HT antibodies. <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown individuals display a decrease in overall expression of both markers within the antennal lobe region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C.2,3</xref>; compare to control-fed animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4B.2,3</xref>). These data correlated well with the reduced number of ORNs innervating the antennal lobe in these knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C.1</xref>). Although antennal lobe defects were detected in 44% of <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (n‚Ää=‚Ää35), antennal lobe defects were not observed in any control-fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>; n‚Ää=‚Ää69). Furthermore, all of the <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown phenotypes described above were detected in knockdown larvae that were fed either a combination of siRNA<sup>890</sup> and siRNA<sup>1198</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) or animals that were fed with either individual siRNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). These results suggested that the observed phenotypes result from loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> expression and are not likely a result of off-site targeting by either siRNA.

<title>Larval antennal neuron targeting defects in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals.</title>
<p>In the larval antennal lobe, antennal gustatory neurons (red arrowhead) target the antennal lobe and project ventrally (oriented down in all panels) toward the subesophageal ganglion. These neurons target properly in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (C‚ÄìJ). In wildtype (A) and control-fed (B) L4 larvae, a subset of antennal sensory neurons innervating the antennal lobe send projection neurons dorsally (oriented up in all panels) to a target region (marked by blue arrows) in the SuEG. These neurons do not target properly to the SuEG in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (C‚ÄìJ). Phenotypic categories observed include: antennal neurons failing to innervate outside of the antennal lobe (C, D; 38% of phenotypes; n‚Ää=‚Ää38), neurons (yellow arrowheads) stopping short of the SuEG target (E, F; 19% of phenotypes), extension beyond the target region (blue arrows) within the SuEG (G, H; 24% of phenotypes), and extraneous branching within the SuEG (I, J; 19% of phenotypes). All four phenotypes were detected in animals fed with siRNA<sup>890</sup> alone (H, J), siRNA<sup>1198</sup> alone (D, F), or a combination of the two siRNAs (referred to as <italic>sema1a</italic> KD in C, E, G, and I), although only a subset of these results are included here. These phenotypes were never observed in wildtype larvae (A) or those that were fed with control siRNA nanoparticles (B). Scale bar‚Ää=‚Ää25 ¬µm.</p>

These results suggested that the synaptic neuropil had not formed properly in these animals, in which a collapse in the structure and shape of the antennal lobe and individual glomeruli as compared to control individuals was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7C.3</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">7B.3</xref>). These phenotypes directly correlated to <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Although 32% of <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown pupae (n‚Ää=‚Ää24) displayed antennal lobe defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), no such defects were detected in control-fed animals (n‚Ää=‚Ää51; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), which resembled wildtype pupae reared on a normal diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).

<title>Analysis of vector mosquito olfactory system development</title>
<p>We recently began to address the need for developmental research in mosquitoes through the pursuit of functional developmental genetic studies in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons1">[1]</xref>. Our work led to the publication of methodology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons4">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Haugen2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons5">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons6">[38]</xref> that was utilized to study gene function in the developing embryonic nerve cord, in which Sema1a regulates axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Haugen1">[20]</xref>. These investigations represented to our knowledge the first reported targeted knockdowns of embryonic genes in any vector mosquito species. In this investigation, analysis of <italic>Aae sema1a</italic> was extended to the larval and pupal stages, in which its function was characterized during olfactory development. The genetics of olfactory system development has not been functionally assessed in insects other than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The ability of insects to adapt to their many environments is exhibited in a wealth of morphological and functional adaptations in their peripheral sensory organs and central nervous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Hansson1">[39]</xref>. To date, the exploration of genetic mechanisms underlying this diversity has been hindered by a lack of functional genetic analyses of arthropod nervous system development outside of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Hansson1">[39]</xref>. In the case of vector mosquitoes, which are responsible for some of the worst scourges of humankind, exploring neural diversity is not only of academic interest, but it is also of medical and socioeconomic importance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Manguin1">[40]</xref>. This investigation has paved the way for further analysis of developmental genes that regulate olfactory system development in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Moreover, this study advocates the broader use of chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles to characterize post-embryonic developmental gene function in mosquitoes and potentially other arthropods.</p>

<title>A requirement for Sema1a in the developing <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval antennal lobe</title>
<p>Although pupal olfactory phenotypes are known to result from loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Komiyama1">[13]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>, this study is the first to our knowledge to document a requirement for Sema1a during insect larval antennal lobe development. Insect larval nervous system developmental genetics has not been extensively characterized outside of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. As observed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Gerber1">[23]</xref>, the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval olfactory system mimics the architecture of the adult, but is reduced in cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Figs. 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g003">3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g006">6A</xref>). This reduced complexity facilitated detailed examination of olfactory development in wildtype and <italic>Aae sema1a</italic> knockdown animals. Knockdown of <italic>sema1a</italic> resulted in a variety of larval antennal lobe defects, including a decrease in the number of neurons targeting the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C.1‚ÄìE.1</xref>). Reduced staining for serotonin (projection neuron marker; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C.2‚ÄìE.2</xref>) and also mAb nc82, a marker of the synaptic neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C.3‚ÄìE.3</xref>) was noted. These results are likely indicative of a reduction in the number of synapses found in the antennal lobe of <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown larvae.</p>
<p>These severe <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown antennal lobe phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C‚ÄìE</xref>) correlated with a yeast attractant behavioral defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002215-t002">Table 2</xref>). It is of course difficult to be absolutely certain that the antennal lobe defects in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4C‚ÄìE</xref>), which are fairly extensive, are the only contributor to the behavioral phenotype observed. Although our screening of gustatory neuron targeting and locomotor function assessment did not uncover any such defects in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Figs. 4C.1‚ÄìE.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g006">6C‚ÄìJ</xref>), feeding behavior is complicated, and Sema1a expression is detected in other portions of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Fig. 1A.2, B.2</xref>), including the optic lobe (Mysore et al., in preparation), that may also contribute to the <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown larvae's decreased attraction to yeast. Still, the results of these behavioral assays correlate well with the severe antennal lobe defects observed in <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Sema1a is required for glomeruli formation in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic></title>
<p>Genetic mosaic analyses in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> demonstrated that Sema1a functions nonautonomously to ensure that pupal ORNs target to glomeruli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Sweeney1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>. Although we of course lack the genetic tools to perform comparable mosaic analyses in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, whole organism siRNA knockdown experiments show the effects of a more broad scale knockdown of <italic>Aae sema1a</italic> on antennal lobe formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g002">Figs. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g008">8B</xref>), something which is not assessed in mosaic analyses. These knockdown experiments demonstrated that <italic>Aae</italic> Sema1a is required for sorting of ORNs into specific glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7C.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g008">8B.1</xref>). Interestingly the phenotypes observed in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pupal stages, including a lack of distinct glomeruli structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g002">Figs. 2E.2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g008">8B</xref>), are consistent with the model proposed for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Sema1a function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>. Previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Sweeney1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref> suggested that Sema1a acts non-cell autonomously as a repellant to regulate sorting of different classes of ORNs expressing various OR proteins, and thereby promoting the segregation and formation of protoglomeruli. Due to the lack of comparable genetic tools in mosquitoes, one cannot adequately address whether <italic>Aae</italic> Sema1a functions cell autonomously or non-cell autonomously. However, comparable to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, differential Sema1a expression is detected among neighboring glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Figs. 1C.3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g002">2D.1</xref>). As discussed by Latteman <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Lattemann1">[15]</xref>, this differential Sema1a expression pattern may provide local positional information during class-specific axonal convergence.</p>
<p>Komiyama <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Komiyama1">[13]</xref> demonstrated that graded levels of Sema1a expression in the antennal lobe of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are responsible for proper projection neuron dendritic targeting into the antennal lobe, which is critical if odorant information is to be properly relayed to higher order brain structures. Dendritic targeting could not be properly assessed in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> antennal lobe due to technical limitations. However, loss of <italic>Aae sema1a</italic> resulted in a decrease in 5HT-labeling of projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7C.2</xref>) and mAb nc82-labeling of the synaptic neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g007">Fig. 7C.3</xref>), suggesting that the number of synapses in the pupal antennal lobe is reduced. Furthermore, as discussed above, a graded pattern of Sema1a expression is detected in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pupal antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g001">Figs. 1C.3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g002">2D.1</xref>), and it is therefore possible that the function of Sema1a in dendritic targeting is conserved between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Moreover, Sweeney <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Sweeney1">[14]</xref> demonstrated that degenerating larval ORNs direct adult projection neuron dendrite targeting. It is therefore possible that the defects observed in ORNs of <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g004">Figs. 4C‚ÄìE</xref>) may also impact projection neuron dendritic targeting at later stages of olfactory development in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.</p>

<title>siRNA chitosan/nanoparticle gene targeting in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic></title>
<p>This study demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, that chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle-mediated gene targeting can be used to disrupt olfactory system development in insects. We had previously used microinjection as a means of delivering custom-designed siRNAs into <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Clemons2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Haugen1">[20]</xref>. However, embryonic microinjections are not an effective means of assessing the larval functions of genes that are lethal when targeted in embryos. Microinjection of larvae and pupae can be used to deliver siRNAs, and we found that microinjection of <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown siRNAs did in fact generate significant knockdown of <italic>sema1a</italic> transcripts in L4 larvae (not shown). However, we ultimately opted to pursue knockdown through chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle feeding, which is technically less challenging, allowed for the inclusion of more animals per replicate, and could also potentially be implemented in the field. Furthermore, the nanoparticle knockdown strategy is less stressful to the organism than microinjection, a particular advantage when behavioral assays follow knockdown experiments, as was the case in this investigation.</p>
<p>The average <italic>sema1a</italic> knockdown levels generated through chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle feeding in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are in line with those reported by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Zhang1">[26]</xref>, who used this strategy to knockdown chitin synthase genes in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. In this investigation, <italic>sema1a</italic> expression levels were examined in individual animals through <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and protein staining. These studies demonstrated that within the population of knockdown animals, one finds individuals with nearly complete loss of <italic>sema1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g002">Figs. 2C, E.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g003">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g005">Fig. 5D, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002215-g008">8B</xref>) in the developing olfactory system. Thus, use of chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles allowed for generation of the equivalent of a <italic>sema1a</italic> conditional null mutant in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Furthermore, co-staining for Sema1a expression allowed us to identify and score phenotypes specifically in these animals with the greatest levels of knockdown. This greatly simplified phenotype analyses which can be complicated by the variable levels of knockdown that inevitably accompany whole organism RNAi experiments. Moreover, these experiments demonstrated that the central and sensory nervous systems are not refractory to siRNAs. Thus, chitosan siRNA nanoparticle gene targeting is a useful tool for analysis of olfactory system development in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and it will be useful to study knockdown efficiency with respect to additional gene targets. It is likely that this technology could be implemented to study olfactory system development in additional arthropod species, and it would be interesting to investigate the relative effectiveness of this knockdown strategy in a variety of different arthropod tissue types. It may also be possible to improve upon the existing nanoparticle RNAi methodology (for example by modifying the feeding strategy, using different types of nanoparticles, or different types of siRNAs) to increase knockdown efficiency.</p>
<p>As suggested by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002215-Zhang1">[26]</xref>, chitosan-based dsRNA nanoparticles could be used for pest control. Chitosan nanoparticles are non-toxic to insects and appear to require nothing more than particle ingestion to target genes of interest in mosquitoes. The results of our investigation build upon their observations by using chitosan/nanoparticle RNAi to disrupt development of the mosquito olfactory system, a tissue of vector importance, and also by extending this methodology to another vector mosquito species, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Moreover, in our investigation, nanoparticles were used to deliver siRNAs as opposed to longer pieces of dsRNA. Custom siRNAs can be produced commercially in mass, which would facilitate their use in integrated vector management strategies if obstacles such as cost and delivery could be addressed. Also, given the short length of siRNAs, it is easier to design them to be both gene and species-specific, which decreases the chances of off-site targeting, an advantage that is helpful both at the bench and perhaps even one day, in the field.</p>
