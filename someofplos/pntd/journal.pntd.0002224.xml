<p>Infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> causes chronic disease in C57BL/6 mice, in which cutaneous lesions persist for many months with high parasite burdens (10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> parasites). This chronic disease process requires host IL-10 and FcγRIII. When <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes are released from cells, surface-bound IgG can induce IL-10 and suppress IL-12 production from macrophages. These changes decrease IFN-γ from T cells and nitric oxide production in infected cells, which are both required for <italic>Leishmania</italic> control. However, antibodies targets and the kinetics of antibody production are unknown. Several groups have been unsuccessful in identifying amastigote surface proteins that bind IgG. We now show that glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs) of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> are recognized by mouse IgG1 by 6 weeks of infection, with a rapid increase between 12 and 16 weeks, consistent with the timing of chronic disease in C57BL/6 mice vs. healing in FcγRIII-deficient mice. A single prominent spot on TLC is recognized by IgG, and the glycolipid is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol containing a branched mannose structure. We show that the lipid structure of the GIPL (the <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acid) is required for antibody recognition. This GIPL is abundant in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes, rare in stationary-phase promastigotes, and absent in <italic>L. major</italic>, consistent with a role for antibodies to GIPLs in chronic disease. A mouse monoclonal anti-GIPL IgG recognizes GIPLs on the parasite surface, and induces IL-10 from macrophages. The current work also extends this mouse analysis to humans, finding that <italic>L. mexicana</italic>-infected humans with localized and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis have antibodies that recognize GIPLs, can bind to the surface of amastigotes, and can induce IL-10 from human monocytes. Further characterization of the target glycolipids will have important implications for drug and vaccine development and will elucidate the poorly understood role of glycolipids in the immunology of infections.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> is a single-celled parasite that causes chronic skin disease in humans and mice. Antibodies on the surface of parasites lead to the production of a protein called interleukin-10 (IL-10), which blocks an effective immune response needed to kill parasites and resolve skin lesions. In mice, IL-10 is required to maintain chronic, non-healing lesions. Parasite surface targets of these antibodies have not been identified. Using biochemical and immunologic techniques, we have shown that antibodies bind to parasite surface glycolipids (molecules with sugars that are anchored to the membrane by lipids), rather than to protein targets. We have determined some basic structural features of these glycolipids and shown that antibodies to them bind the surface of parasites and can induce IL-10 from mouse cells. We have extended this work to humans by showing that people infected with this parasite also make antibodies that bind to these glycolipids and to the surface of parasites, and that can induce IL-10 from human white blood cells. Further characterization of these glycolipids may have important implications for the development of a drug or vaccine for this and related parasite infections, and may shed light on poorly understood immunologic pathways by which glycolipids induce antibody responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes 2 million new infections yearly and is a major cause of death worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-WHO1">[1]</xref>. Drug toxicity and the development of resistance have made leishmaniasis an ever-challenging set of diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Bryceson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Sundar1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Soto1">[4]</xref>. While a vaccine is likely the best way to deal with leishmaniasis, development has been hampered by our lack of understanding of factors needed to induce long-lasting cell-mediated immunity. Infections in which antibodies are protective, caused by bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and many viral infections such as hepatitis B, have yielded successful vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Austrian1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Szmuness1">[6]</xref>. However, <italic>Leishmania</italic> are able to hide from antibodies in an intracellular location. When <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigote stages, found in the mammalian host, are released from the cell to parasitize new host cells, the parasite is bound by antibodies and utilizes mechanisms to prevent lysis by complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Hoover1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Mosser1">[8]</xref>. In fact, not only are antibodies not helpful, they can be pathogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Kima1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Miles1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Chu1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The immune response to the better-studied <italic>L. major</italic> infection is well explained by the Th1/Th2 paradigm, with IFN-γ-associated Th1 responses being protective and IL-4-associated Th2 responses leading to susceptibility. Non-healing infections such as those caused by <italic>L. mexicana</italic> complex parasites do not fit well into this explanation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Soong1">[12]</xref>. Mice that lack IL-4 (a key cytokine of Th2 responses) have chronic infection with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Jones1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Buxbaum1">[14]</xref>, and mice that lack IL-12 (the master cytokine driving Th1 responses) are just as susceptible as wild-type B6 mice to <italic>L. mexicana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Buxbaum2">[15]</xref>. We therefore looked for other explanations and found that that IL-10 is required for chronic disease with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Buxbaum1">[14]</xref>. C57BL/6 (B6) mice lacking IL-10 resolve infection with a protective IFN-γ response. IL-10 exerts multiple immunosuppressive functions such as decreasing antigen presentation to T cells, decreasing IL-12 production and inhibition of iNOS (with nitric oxide being a required factor for killing of the parasite) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Thomas1">[16]</xref>. In addition, cell surface receptors for IgG, termed FcγRs, are required for chronic disease caused by <italic>L. mexicana</italic> complex parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Kima1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Buxbaum1">[14]</xref>. In particular we have shown a requirement for FcγRIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Thomas1">[16]</xref> and IgG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Chu1">[11]</xref>. The parasite is thus able to suppress the protective Th1 IFN-γ immune response through an IgG-FcγR pathway, utilizing the host's IgG response.</p>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> have a wide array of glycolipids called glycosyl phosphatidylinositols (GPIs) as membrane components. Many proteins such as the promastigote surface protease, gp63, are inserted into the plasma membrane by GPI anchors rather than through trans-membrane protein domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The surface of the insect vector stage of the parasite (the promastigote) is covered with lipophosphoglycan (LPG), which consists of a GPI core with a very large phosphoglycan repeat structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Small non-protein bound GPI molecules called glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs) are the most abundant glycolipids on the surface of the amastigote (the mammalian host stage), and are potential antibody targets. EPiM3 is the most abundant GIPL in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and likely is the molecule recognized by the mouse serum IgG, or is closely related to it in structure. EPiM3 has three mannose residues in a branched configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref> and is an isomer of the well-described glycolipid A from African trypanosomes, which has three linear mannose residues and a different lipid composition. Glycolipid A is the free-GPI precursor to the anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG); VSG is responsible for antigenic variation. The structures of <italic>Leishmania</italic> GIPLs have been determined for <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and several other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-McConville1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-McConville2">[19]</xref>. This analysis has shown species-specificity with <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, but not <italic>L. major</italic>, having ethanolamine-containing GIPLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-McConville2">[19]</xref>; and by contrast, <italic>L. major</italic>, but not <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, having terminal galactose residues on GIPLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-McConville3">[20]</xref>. It has been shown that humans with cutaneous leishmaniasis have antibody responses to promastigote GIPLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Avila1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Rosen1">[22]</xref>, although analysis of antibody recognition of amastigote GIPLs has not previously been performed.</p>

<p>It is clear that IgG in the serum of infected mice binds the surface of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes and that this IgG can induce IL-10 from macrophages in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Thomas1">[16]</xref> and suppress IL-12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Sutterwala1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Yang1">[24]</xref>. Many groups, using sensitive metabolic labeling methods, failed to find surface proteins on <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes that are recognized by antibodies, despite prominent IgG responses to the parasite surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Sadick1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-MedinaAcosta1">[26]</xref>. Abundant surface proteins such as gp63, PSA2, and mPPG found on the infective insect stage of the parasite (metacyclic promastigote) are downregulated in the mammalian host stage (amastigote), as is LPG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-McConville4">[27]</xref>. As promastigotes disappear within a few days of the sandfly bite, IgG responses to these promastigote molecules are not relevant to the chronic aspects of <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, which involves only the amastigote stage of the parasite. When rabbits were infected with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes, they produced antibodies that bind the surface of amastigotes. These surface-binding antibodies do not recognize proteins but instead bind to GIPLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>. In these studies, EPiM3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), the predominant amastigote GIPL (63% of GIPLs), was strongly recognized, and was the only parasite-derived glycolipid bound by rabbit IgG. EPiM3 is quite abundant, with roughly 2×10<sup>7</sup> molecules per amastigote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>. Unfortunately, the understanding of disease and the tools needed to study the immunology of leishmaniasis are not yet available for rabbit infection.</p>
<p>We therefore decided to use our well-characterized mouse model to investigate whether IgG specifically recognizes the GIPLs on <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes, and to confirm that these particular antibodies can bind to FcγR to induce IL-10. We also began the process of identifying aspects of the structure of the immunodominant GIPL needed for antibody recognition. In addition we extended this work by determining that humans infected with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> also harbor anti-GIPL antibodies that can induce IL-10 from monocytes.</p>

<p><italic>L. mexicana</italic> (MNYC/BZ/62/M379), <italic>L. major</italic> (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin), and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (LTB004) promastigotes were grown at 27°C in Grace's medium (pH 6.3) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. For infections, stationary-phase <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes (day 7) were washed three times in PBS and 5×10<sup>6</sup> parasites (in 50 µl DMEM) were injected into the hind footpad of mice. Stationary-phase promastigote cultures of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> or <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (day 7) were incubated at 33°C for 3 days to generate axenic amastigotes. Axenic amastigotes were passaged every 7–10 days at 1/100 into acidic Grace's medium (pH 5.5) supplemented as above. “Washed membranes” were prepared from axenic amastigotes by hypotonic lysis as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Thomas1">[16]</xref>. Briefly, axenic amastigotes were washed in PBS and then hypotonically lysed at 10<sup>9</sup>/ml in endotoxin-free water containing 0.1 mM N-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (TLCK; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1 µg/ml leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min on ice. Then an equal volume of 0.1 mM TLCK, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 20% glycerol was added and parasites were frozen at −80°C. Thawed lysate was washed in PBS (6100 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C) to remove soluble proteins and protease inhibitors, and resuspended at 10<sup>9</sup> cell equivalents/ml in PBS. This lysate was assayed for protein content by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and brought to 1 mg/ml protein, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. For some experiments, intracellular amastigotes devoid of mouse-derived surface antibodies were generated by infecting IC21 macrophages (ATCC, VA). IC21 cells were grown in 300 ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate in 1900 ml tissue culture flasks (T300; Becton Dickinson Labware, CA) and were infected with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> stationary-phase promastigotes (2×10<sup>8</sup> parasites: 4.5×10<sup>7</sup> cells; MOI 4.4) for 4 days at 33°C with parasite isolation by disruption of the cells ten times through a 23G needle. Parasites were then washed, counted, and frozen at −80°C. <italic>L. mexicana</italic> lesion amastigotes were isolated from footpads of infected C57BL/6 mice by soaking the feet in 70% ethanol, chlorhexadine, and 70% ethanol (5 min each) followed by removal of the skin and grinding the footpad with a tissue grinder in PBS with 200 U/ml penicillin, and 200 µg/ml streptomycin. Debris was removed with a low speed spin (5 min at 50 <italic>g</italic>) and parasites were washed three times at high speed (15 min at 1900 <italic>g</italic>).

Uninfected control serum values were subtracted from infected serum values. Biotinylated 26H3T-B4 (a mouse IgG1 mAb) was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase with PBS control optical density subtracted from all results. <italic>Leishmania</italic>-specific IgG1 and IgG2a/c were assayed by ELISA using axenic amastigote “washed membranes” for capture, with detection as above for GIPL ELISAs.

<title>B6 mice generate an IgG response to the surface of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes</title>
<p>We have shown by ELISA that at early times there is an IgG1 response and later an IgG2a/c response in B6 mice to parasite antigens (freeze-thawed Ag). Here we showed that this same kinetics occur with amastigote surface-binding IgG. Strong IgG1 and negligible IgG2a/c are seen at 9 wks post-infection, but both IgG1 and IgG2a/c to surface epitopes are present late in infection (27 wks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

Anti-GIPL IgG1 responses at 16 wks post-infection were correlated with parasite loads at 29 wks post-infection in the same mice. <bold><italic>D</italic></bold>.

<p>We found that the GIPL reactivity of serum from 28 wk-infected mice was highly positively correlated with their parasite loads (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This could either be due to anti-GIPL antibodies having a pathogenic effect and leading to poorer control of parasites, or conversely a consequence of higher parasite loads inducing higher IgG titers. To examine this further, we serially bled mice throughout an infection and looked for correlations between parasite loads at both 16 wks and 29 wks with various parameters such as lesion size, and IgG1 and IgG2a/c directed against GIPLs and washed membranes. Note that this infection had larger variation in parasite burdens than usual (for unknown reasons) and was used because greater variation allowed for comparisons not possible if parasite burdens were very similar in all mice. We found that the anti-GIPL IgG1 response at 16 wks correlated well with the parasite load in the same mouse at 29 wks of infection (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Anti-GIPL IgG1 at 16 wks did not closely correlate with lesion size at 16 wks (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.25, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating that anti-GIPL antibodies and inflammation in the lesion are not closely tied. Because of the temporal relationship, we concluded that anti-GIPL IgG1 responses earlier in infection could potentially cause increased parasite burdens later in infection due to IL-10 suppression of a Th1 response. New data indicate that <italic>L. mexicana</italic> parasite loads do not increase early in infection, but only increase later once the IgG1-induced IL-10 is present (Jude Uzonna, University of Manitoba, personal communication). Furthermore, there was no correlation between parasite burdens (at 29 wks) and IgG1 directed at <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigote “washed membranes” or between parasite burdens and IgG2a/c responses to GIPLs or “washed membranes” (at 16 or 29 wks, data not shown). This implies that IgG1 antibodies to GIPLs may be more important in determining parasite loads (through the FcγR-IL-10 pathway) than antibodies directed against other parasite components, such as proteins, and more important than IgG2a/c antibodies to GIPLs or other parasite molecules. This is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a strong IgG1 antibody response directed against GIPLs, but not against surface proteins, presumably because surface proteins are masked in some way. Because GIPLs are present on the amastigote surface, whereas protein targets of antibodies may reside within the parasite, antibodies to GIPLs, but not proteins, can efficiently induce IL-10 through the FcγR pathway.</p>
<p>When mice were bled throughout a course of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection, we found that IgG1 recognition of GIPLs increased rapidly between 10 and 20 wks of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), consistent with the time when chronic lesions plateau in size (B6 mice) rather than resolving in strains of mice that heal (IL-10 KO and FcγRIII KO mice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-McConville4">[27]</xref>.

Glycolipid A, unlike EPiM3, has a linear tri-mannose structure, so we decided to determine if a branched mannose is present in the recognized <italic>L. mexicana</italic> GIPL and is an important part of the recognized epitope. Digestion of the GIPLs with jack-bean α-mannosidase, which cleaves terminal α-linked mannose residues, resulted in a shift to a less hydrophilic (greater relative mobility) GIPL species, which is recognized by the anti-amastigote serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Therefore, the immunodominant GIPL has a branched mannose structure like EPiM3.

In addition, when biotinylated, this mAb bound GIPLs very well in an ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>), also demonstrating a dose-response relationship. We further demonstrated that the IgG1 mAb, when bound to amastigotes, induced IL-10 from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>).

<title>Humans with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection have anti-GIPL antibodies</title>
<p>Human infection with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> can cause localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), a disseminated skin disease called diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), and very infrequently visceral disease or mucocutaneous disease. Although high antibody titers are seen in visceral leishmaniasis, antibody titers in cutaneous leishmaniasis are not generally sensitive, with visualization of parasites from skin scrapings or biopsies being the main diagnostic tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Pearson1">[34]</xref>. In order to determine if human infection leads to anti-GIPL antibodies, we obtained human sera from Mexican patients with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection and LCL or DCL. We analyzed these sera using the GIPL ELISA and found that patients with LCL, and to a greater extent those with DCL, have antibodies to GIPL molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). Background values from uninfected sera may represent low levels of natural IgG antibodies or non-specific binding. We also bound the sera from DCL and LCL patients to <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes and found that IgG was detectible on the parasite surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g009">Fig. 9B and C</xref>), with all uninfected controls (both endemic controls and one random serum sample from Pennsylvania) having lower mean fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>). Geometric mean fluorescence was significantly greater in DCL and LCL patients than in controls, but these groups were not significantly different from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g009">Fig. 9E</xref>). Thus <italic>L. mexicana</italic>-infected people have antibodies that bind the parasite surface and that bind GIPLs in an ELISA format.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Antibodies are known to have a detrimental role in <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. IgG bound to parasites can induce IL-10 from macrophages, and likely other cell types, via FcγRIII. This IL-10, in turn, suppresses the immune response to the parasite by directly decreasing iNOS expression and thereby decreasing nitric oxide, which is needed for parasite clearance. In addition IL-10 down-regulates the Th1-associated IFN-γ response, which is required to activate infected cells to make nitric oxide and kill parasites. We have recently shown that IgG1, in particular, is pathogenic in vivo in B6 mice, whereas IgG2a/c is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Chu1">[11]</xref>. There have been some important gaps in our understanding of this mechanism. In particular it has been challenging to determine what the targets of these pathogenic antibodies are. Whereas much is known about surface proteins (such as gp63, PSA2, and mPPG) and a glycoconjugate, LPG, on the promastigote stage of the parasite, these are down-regulated when <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transforms into the intracellular amastigote stage. Because promastigotes rapidly disappear from the mammalian host, whereas antibodies do not appear for at least 4–6 wks of infection, antibodies to amastigote surface molecules are likely the most relevant in this protracted chronic infection. Several groups have failed to find surface proteins on the amastigote stage of the parasite that bind antibodies, and that could be responsible for initiating this pathway. Winter and colleagues identified a GIPL, EPiM3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g001">Fig. 1</xref> for structure), that is abundant on the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigote surface and that is recognized by rabbit antibodies that bind the amastigote surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Winter1">[17]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether GIPLs are important ligands of antibodies in our well characterized mouse model.</p>
<p>Using flow cytometry, TLC immunoblot, and an ELISA with unfractionated GIPLs, we have now shown that antibodies from <italic>L. mexicana</italic>-infected mice bind the surface of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes and specifically recognize <italic>L. mexicana</italic> GIPLs. Presumably these antibodies can access parasites when the latter are released from the macrophage. In fact amastigotes isolated from footpad lesions are coated with antibodies, probably from the lesion fluid (data not shown). There is species specificity, as antibodies from <italic>L. major</italic>-infected mice do not bind these same GIPLs, and sera from <italic>L. mexicana</italic>-infected mice do not recognize <italic>L. major</italic> GIPLs. The kinetics of appearance of these anti-GIPL antibodies is consistent with the generation of chronic disease in B6 mice, as compared with healing seen in IL-10 KO and FcγRIII KO mice. We used the variation in parasite loads we occasionally see in infections to demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between anti-GIPL IgG1 responses (but not IgG2a/c responses) and parasite burdens. In fact anti-GIPL IgG1 levels measured at earlier times predict higher parasite loads later in infection, suggesting that the anti-GIPL antibodies may induce higher parasite loads through IL-10, rather than merely being caused by the higher parasite burdens. Direct evidence of pathogenicity of these antibodies is currently being studied.</p>
<p>We have identified a number of properties of the immunodominant GIPL molecule(s). The main recognized glycolipid has a GPI structure as it is digested by GPI-PLC and GPI-PLD, enzymes that are specific for GPI structures. In addition, like EPiM3, but unlike trypanosome glycolipid A, the immunodominant GIPL has a terminal mannose present, likely part of a branched, rather than linear, tri-mannose structure. However, the molecule generated by jack bean α-mannosidase (which removes terminal mannose residues), is still recognized by some, if not all of the antibodies in the polyclonal serum, and thus this branched mannose is not needed for IgG recognition.</p>
<p>In addition, recognition was abolished by PLA<sub>2</sub> digestion, which removes the <italic>sn</italic>-2 fatty acid. Others have found that the binding of proteins to glycolipids can depend on the lipid portion of glycolipids and on the local lipid environment. <italic>E. coli</italic> verotoxins (VT1 and VT2c) bind to a glycosphingolipid, globotriaosylceramide b3 (Gb<sub>3</sub>), with different affinities based on the fatty acid length on the ceramide, with VT1 and VT2c having different optimal lengths of fatty acid chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Lingwood1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore the length of lipid chains and degree of unsaturation, as well as the surrounding phospholipid environment (sphingomyelin/cholesterol vs. dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes) can alter binding of polyclonal antibodies to glycolipids such as cerebroside sulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Crook1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Stewart1">[37]</xref>. It is believed that the “exposure” of the glycan and its conformation may be determined by an interaction between the lipid portion of the glycolipids and the lipid bilayer or liposome environment. Thus our findings that the PLA<sub>2</sub>-digested GIPL (a lyso-GIPL) no longer bound antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002224-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) extends this body of knowledge of the interaction between antibodies and glycolipids and demonstrates that the recognition process is more complex than just carbohydrate recognition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have generated mAbs to GIPLs. In particular an anti-GIPL-specific IgG1 (26H3T-B4) is able to bind isolated GIPLs and the surface of amastigotes. This mAb, when bound to amastigotes, induces IL-10 from mouse macrophages. This helps demonstrate the plausibility that anti-GIPL antibodies are important in the pathogenesis of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> disease in mice and will aid in future studies to directly show pathogenicity of anti-GIPL antibodies.</p>
<p>We have also found that humans develop antibodies that recognize the surface of amastigotes and GIPLs when infected with <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, whether they have DCL or LCL. Furthermore human monocytes secrete IL-10 in response to immune complexes consisting of these human antibodies and <italic>L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes. This shows the potential relevance of our mouse studies to human disease. This opens the door to further analysis of the human response to GIPLs, and generates several important questions: Does human IgG recognize the same GIPL structures as mice? Can we block this interaction and change the course of disease with a competing small molecule? In mice, IgG1 is pathogenic but IgG2a/c appears not to be, and may be protective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002224-Chu1">[11]</xref>. By generating a vaccine that induces competing antibody isotypes that are not pathogenic, can we protect against or treat <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection?</p>
