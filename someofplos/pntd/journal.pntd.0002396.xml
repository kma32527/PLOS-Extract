<p>We report in this work that <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains, virulent <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni, attenuated <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni and saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> serovar Patoc are capable of binding fibrinogen (Fg). The interaction of leptospires with Fg inhibits thrombin- induced fibrin clot formation that may affect the haemostatic equilibrium. Additionally, we show that plasminogen (PLG)/plasmin (PLA) generation on the surface of <italic>Leptospira</italic> causes degradation of human Fg. The data suggest that PLA-coated leptospires were capable to employ their proteolytic activity to decrease one substrate of the coagulation cascade. We also present six leptospiral adhesins and PLG- interacting proteins, rLIC12238, Lsa33, Lsa30, OmpL1, rLIC11360 and rLIC11975, as novel Fg-binding proteins. The recombinant proteins interact with Fg in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion when increasing protein concentration was set to react to a fix human Fg concentration. The calculated dissociation equilibrium constants (K<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>) of these reactions ranged from 733.3±276.8 to 128±89.9 nM for rLIC12238 and Lsa33, respectively. The interaction of recombinant proteins with human Fg resulted in inhibition of fibrin clot by thrombin-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that these versatile proteins could mediate Fg interaction in <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Our data reveal for the first time the inhibition of fibrin clot by <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. and presents adhesins that could mediate these interactions. Decreasing fibrin clot would cause an imbalance of the coagulation cascade that may facilitate bleeding and help bacteria dissemination</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is probably the most widespread zoonosis in the world. Caused by spirochaetes of the genus <italic>Leptospira</italic>, it has greater incidence in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease has become prevalent in cities with sanitation problems and a large population of urban rodent reservoirs, which contaminate the environment through their urine. Understanding the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of leptospirosis should contribute to new strategies that would help fight the disease. We show in this work that <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains, virulent, attenuated or saprophytic are capable of binding fibrinogen (Fg). The interaction of leptospires with Fg inhibits the formation of fibrin clot that may result of an imbalance in the haemostatic equilibrium. In addition, we show that plasminogen (PLG)/plasmin (PLA) generation on the surface of leptospires can lead to Fg degradation, showing evidence of possible route of fibrinolysis in leptospirosis. We also present six leptospiral proteins, as novel Fg-binding proteins, capable of inhibiting fibrin clot formation by thrombin-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that in <italic>Leptospira</italic> these multifunctional proteins could mediate Fg interaction. Our data suggest possible mechanisms that leptospires could employ to affect the coagulation cascade and fibrinolytic system that might lead to bacteria spreading.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spirochete <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> is a highly invasive pathogen and the causal agent of leptospirosis, one of the most widespread zoonosis of human and veterinary concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Faine1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Bharti1">[2]</xref>. The transmission occurs through contact with environmental water contaminated by leptospires shed in the urine of animal carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Faine1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Levett1">[3]</xref>. Humans are accidental and terminal hosts in the transmission process of leptospirosis. The leptospires enter the body via abrasions on skin or actively through mucosa, spreading to any tissue, and colonizing target organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Plank1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Levett1">[3]</xref>. <italic>Leptospira</italic> can cause damage of the endothelium of small blood vessels, leading to hemorrhage and localized ischemia in multiple organs. As a consequence, renal tubular necrosis, hepatocellular damage and development of leptospirosis-associated pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) may occur in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Faine1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-McBride1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Marotto1">[6]</xref>. The mechanisms responsible for bleeding in leptospirosis are poorly understood. Hemolysins could play an important role in this toxic response and several genes coding for predicted hemolysins were identified in the genome sequencing <italic>L. interrogans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. Yet, when evaluated, these proteins failed to show hemolytic activity in human erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Hauk1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Carvalho1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fg and PLG are key proteins in the coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis, respectively, and critical determinants of bacterial virulence and host defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Degen1">[10]</xref>. Fg is the major clotting protein present in blood plasma with an important role in blood coagulation and thrombosis. PLG under the action of its activators generates PLA, a serine-protease capable of degrading ECM components, fibrin, facilitating the pathogen penetration and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lahteenmaki1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that PLA-associated <italic>Leptospira</italic> renders the bacteria with proteolytic activity capable of degrading ECM components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Vieira1">[12]</xref> that in turn, may help bacterial penetration and dissemination. Furthermore, PLA-coated leptospires have also shown to degrade IgG and C3b that could facilitate the bacterial immune evasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Vieira2">[13]</xref>. The adhesion of physiological osmotically induced <italic>Leptospira</italic> with Fg was described but their effect on fibrin formation was not ascertained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy1">[14]</xref>. The leptospiral proteins LigB and OmpL37 were shown to interact with Fg and LigB was reported to reduce fibrin clot formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Pinne1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lin1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>We thus decided to evaluate if Fg-associated <italic>Leptospira</italic> was capable to inhibit the fibrin clot formation and the ability of seven recombinant proteins to act as leptospiral Fg-receptors. We report that <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains and the recombinant ECM- and PLG-interacting proteins, rLIC12238 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Vieira3">[18]</xref>, Lsa33, Lsa25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Domingos1">[19]</xref>, Lsa30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Souza1">[20]</xref>, OmpL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Fernandes1">[21]</xref>, rLIC11360 and rLIC11975 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Siqueira1">[22]</xref>, are capable to adhere to Fg. We also show that this interaction inhibits fibrin clot formation by thrombin-catalyzed reaction. Moreover, PLA-coated <italic>Leptospira</italic> was capable to degrade Fg. Altogether, the results suggest possible pathways that <italic>Leptospira</italic> may interfere with the coagulation/bleeding process.</p>

<p>The non-pathogenic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> serovar Patoc strain Patoc 1, the pathogenic attenuated <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni strain M-20 and the virulent strains of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Kennewicki strain Pomona Fromm (LPF) and serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 were cultured at 28°C under aerobic conditions in liquid EMJH medium (Difco) with 10% rabbit serum, enriched with L-asparagine (wt/vol: 0.015%), sodium pyruvate (wt/vol: 0.001%), calcium chloride (wt/vol: 0.001%), magnesium chloride (wt/vol: 0.001%), peptone (wt/vol:0.03%) and meat extract (wt/vol: 0.02%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Turner1">[23]</xref>. <italic>Leptospira</italic> cultures are maintained in Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed with leptospires resuspended in low salt – lsPBS (50 mM), instead of PBS that contains 137 mM NaCl, because it is an osmolarity condition closer to cultivation, which is approximately 35 mM.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunofluorescence assay</title>
<p>For the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), live <italic>L. interrogans</italic> sorovar Copenhageni strain M-20 suspensions (∼10<sup>8</sup>) were harvested at 5,000× g for 15 min, washed three times with lsPBS, resuspended in 200 µL lsPBS, and fixed with 200 µL with 4% paraformaldehyde for 40 min at 30°C. After the fixation, propidium iodide (Sigma) diluted 1∶50 in lsPBS was added to stain the nuclei, and the suspensions were incubated for 45 min at 30°C. After this time, the leptospires were gently washed three times with lsPBS and blocked with lsPBS containing 5% BSA for 90 min at 30°C, followed by incubation with 16 µg Fg in 200 µL lsPBS for 60 min at 37°C. The leptospires were washed three times with lsPBS plus 1% BSA and incubated with goat-produced antiserum against human Fg at a 1∶50 dilution for 45 min at 37°C. Leptospires were washed three times again and incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Sigma) at a dilution of 1∶400 for 45 min at 37°C. After this incubation, the leptospires were washed twice with lsPBS containing 1% BSA and once with distilled water. Finally they were resuspended in lsPBS-antifading solution (ProLong Gold; Molecular Probes). The immunofluorescence-labeled leptospires were examined by use of a confocal LSM 510 META immunofluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). As a control for unspecific binding, Fg was absent from the reaction mixtures.</p>

<title>Binding of soluble human Fg to <italic>Leptospira</italic></title>
<p>For accessing the leptospiral binding to soluble human Fg, ELISA plates were coated with 10<sup>8</sup> leptospires in lsPBS per well (<italic>L. interrogans</italic> sorovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130, <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni strain M-20, and <italic>L. biflexa</italic> serovar Patoc strain Patoc 1), allowed to set for 3 h at 37°C and then blocked with 200 µL of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) with 10% non-fat dry milk. After 2 h incubation, plates were washed with PBS-T and then 100 µL of a Fg solution (Fg- Sigma) (10 µg/mL in lsPBS) were added per well and incubation proceeded for 2 h. After extensive washing, 100 µL of solution containing goat anti-Fg (1∶25,000 in lsPBS) were added per well and incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37°C. After three washings, 100 µL of solution containing peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1∶50,000 in lsPBS) were added per well and the reaction continued for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were washed three times, and <italic>o</italic>-phenylenediamine (OPD) (1 mg/mL) in citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) plus 1 µL/mL H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added (100 µL per well). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min and interrupted by the addition of 50 µL of 8 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Readings were taken at 492 nm in a microplate reader (Multiskan EX; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Helsinki, Finland). The binding of Fg to each leptospiral strain was performed in triplicate and a negative control in which Fg was omitted was included in the experiment. In the no-cell control, BSA replaced leptospires. For statistical analyses, the binding of Fg to different strains and control BSA was performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-test for pairwise comparisons.</p>

ELISA plates were placed with 90 µL/well of leptospires plus Fg and 10 µL/well of thrombin (10 U/mL - Sigma). The fibrin clot formation was measured every 1 min for 10 min and then every 5 min for 35 min by an ELISA plate reader (Multiskan EX Thermo Fisher Scientific) at OD595<sub>nm</sub>. The positive control of the reaction employed Fg (1 mg/mL) plus thrombin (10 U/mL) while in the negative control thrombin was omitted. For statistical analyses, inhibition of fibrin clot formation was performed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-test for pairwise comparisons. Three independent experiments were performed.</p>

<title>Human Fg degradation by leptospires coated with PLA</title>
<p>Virulent <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Kennewicki strain Pomona Fromm (10<sup>8</sup> leptospires/sample) were treated in 200 µL lsPBS with the addition of: (a) 10 µg PLG (b) 3U urokinase (uPA) (c) 10 µg PLG and 3U uPA (generating PLA-coated leptospires) or (d) only lsPBS with no additions (untreated). The bacteria were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the PLG, and for one more hour after the addition of uPA. The cells were washed three times with lsPBS to remove the free PLG, uPA and PLA. Then, the bacteria were resuspended in 100 µL lsPBS containing goat anti-human Fg human purified Fg (Sigma, USA) as substrate, and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. Three additional controls were employed: (a) one sample received 1 µg of the protease inhibitor aprotinin (Sigma, USA) to the Fg-leptospires incubation, (b) one sample contained only Fg without leptospires, and (c) one sample received the PLG and uPA treatment without the addition of leptospires to rule out the free PLA Fg degradation. The leptospires were removed by centrifugation, 20 µL of the supernatants were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in semi-dry equipment. The membranes were blocked by incubating overnight at 4°C with 5% non-fat dry milk and 1% BSA. The Fg detection was performed by incubations with goat anti-human Fg antibodies and rabbit anti-goat secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, followed by ECL (GE Healthcare) development.</p>
<p>In another assay, after the incubation for Fg degradation, the pelleted leptospires and the remaining cell-free supernatants were also evaluated for the presence of Fg by ELISA. The cells were resuspended in 100 µL lsPBS and coated onto ELISA plates overnight at 4°C, as well as the cell-free supernatants previously diluted 20 times. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T and blocked with solution containing 5% BSA and 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h at 37°C, following incubations with anti-Fg polyclonal antibodies (1∶25,000) and secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase (1∶50,000). The reactions were developed by addition of 100 µL/well of solution containing 1 mg/mL OPD and 1 µL/mL H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and stopped by addition of 50 µL/well H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The samples in which the leptospires received no treatment (only PBS) were considered as having 100% of Fg for comparative purposes.</p>

<p>Five female BALB/c mice (4–6 weeks old) were immunized subcutaneously with 10 µg of each recombinant protein adsorbed in 10% (vol/vol) of Alhydrogel (2% Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, Brenntag Biosector, Denmark), used as adjuvant. Two subsequent booster injections were given at 2-week intervals with the same recombinant proteins preparation. Negative - control mice were injected with PBS plus Alhydrogel. Two weeks after each immunization, the mice were bled from the retro - orbital plexus and the pooled sera were analyzed by ELISA for determination of antibody titers.</p>

The blocking solution was discarded and 100 µL of 10 µg/mL recombinant proteins in PBS was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Wells were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with polyclonal mouse antiserum produced against each recombinant protein. The serum dilution used was determined by titration curve with the corresponding recombinant protein and the value of 1.0 at OD492<sub>nm</sub> was employed. These values are: 1∶1,000 for rLIC12238; 1∶750 for Lsa33; 1∶500 for rLIC11975 and rLIC11360; 1∶400 for Lsa30, 1∶800 for OmpL1, 1∶500 for Lsa25 and 1∶200 for PspA. After incubation, plates were washed again and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), diluted 1∶5,000 in PBS. After three washings, 100 µL/well of 1 mg/mL OPD plus 1 µL/mL H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) were added. The reactions were carried out for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 50 µL/well of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (8 M). Readings were taken at OD492 <sub>nm</sub>. In another assay, the assessment of bound proteins was performed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C with monoclonal anti-polyhistidine-HRP (Sigma) at appropriate dilutions: 1∶5,000 for rLIC12238; 1∶10,000 for rLIC11975 and rLIC11360; 1∶1,000 for Lsa30; 1∶500 for Lsa33, 1∶400 for OmpL1, 1∶200 for Lsa25 and 1∶200 for LigB7-12. The reaction was developed with 1 mg/mL OPD plus 1 µL/mL H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as described above. The rate of interaction of recombinant proteins to Fg was determined by measuring the reaction as a function of time. The OD492<sub>nm</sub> value after 2 h interaction was considered the maximal binding (100%) and was used for statistical analyses, using Student's two-tailed t test. For determination of dose-response curves of the binding of recombinant proteins to human Fg, protein concentrations varying from 0 to 4,000 nM in PBS were used. Binding was detected with polyclonal antibodies against each protein at the dilution described above, except for LigB7-12 where monoclonal anti-polyhistidine-HRP was used (1∶200). For statistical analyses, the binding of recombinant proteins to human Fg was compared to its binding to gelatin by Student's two-tailed t test.</p>

Control lacking leptospires (lane1) and addition of 1 µg aprotinin to the Fg-leptospires incubation (lane 6) were employed. The cells were incubated with 15 µg/mL human purified Fg for 16 h at 37°C, and the supernatants were fractioned by SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes. The Fg was detected by specific antibodies and the reaction was developed by ECL reagent. Indicated on the left are the molecular mass standards, and on the right, the masses of the intact Fg (340 kDa) and its degradation product (D domains, 90 kDa). (<bold>B</bold>) After treatments and incubation with Fg, the cell-free (supernatants) and cell-bound Fg were coated onto ELISA plates and detected by Fg polyclonal antibodies.

<p>The Fg degradation by PLA-coated leptospires was also evaluated by ELISA. When leptospires were treated with PLG+uPA, the detection of Fg remaining in cell-free solution is decreased when compared to untreated, only PLG or only uPA-treated or when aprotinin was added to the Fg incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002396-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). An additional control lacking leptospires was added in order to rule out the contribution of free PLA to the Fg degradation. As expected, the data showed that the remaining Fg level in this control was comparable with the non-proteolytic controls. Cell-bound Fg was also evaluated. PLA-coated leptospires retain Fg binding ability, though it seems to be diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002396-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), probably due to Fg degradation.</p>

LigB7-12, previously shown to inhibit thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lin1">[17]</xref>, was employed as positive control at 1,500 nM. Recombinant proteins Lsa25 and pneumococcal PspA that do not interact with Fg, were employed as negative controls, at 3000 nM. Each recombinant protein was pre-incubated with 1 mg/mL of Fg at 37°C for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were used to coat ELISA plates and 10 U/mL of thrombin was added per well. The fibrin clot formation was measured every 1 min for 10 min and then every 5 min for 35 min. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as a function of time, taking the complete reaction at the last time-point, in the absence of proteins, as a 100% fibrin formation (positive control). In the negative control, thrombin was omitted from the reaction. The measurements were performed in triplicate and representative curves of two independent experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002396-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. The proteins rLIC11360 and Lsa30 were not employed on these assays because they were kept at pH 12 for solubility and thrombin is not active above pH 10. The data show that the four proteins tested, Lsa33, rLIC12238, rLIC11975 and OmpL1, elicited an inhibition of 40–50% on the fibrin clot formation, similar to the one elicited by LigB7-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002396-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This effect on clot formation by the recombinant proteins was similar with all of them, although a lag time was observed within the rLIC12238 inhibition curve. The inhibition promoted by all proteins was statistically relevant when compared to the positive reaction control. The results are consistent with the K<italic><sub>D</sub></italic> of the proteins towards Fg that are in the same order of magnitude. In contrast, Lsa25 and PspA, proteins that do not react with Fg, were not capable to inhibit thrombin-catalyzed fibrin production, resulting in curves similar to the positive control of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002396-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Recombinant proteins were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS plus 1 mg/mL of Fg and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The employed concentration of recombinant protein was the one in which there was a binding saturation to Fg: Lsa33 (3,000 nM), OmpL1 (3,000 nM), rLIC12238 (3,500 nM) and rLIC11975 (2,000 nM). The positive control protein LigB7-12 was employed at 1,500 nM, while the negative control proteins, Lsa25 and PspA were used at 3,000 nM. ELISA plates were coated with 90 µL/well of recombinant proteins plus Fg and 10 µL/well of thrombin (10 U/mL). The positive control of the reaction employed Fg (1 mg/mL) plus thrombin (10 U/mL) while in the negative control thrombin was omitted. The fibrin clot formation was measured every 1 min for 10 min and then every 5 min for 35 min. Each point was performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean absorbance value at 595<sub>nm</sub>± SD for each point.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fg is the major clotting protein present in blood plasma with an important role in coagulation and thrombosis. Several studies have suggested roles of Fg and PLG in host bacterial interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lahteenmaki1">[11]</xref>. The fibrinolytic system that generates PLA from PLG and its activators, decomposes the fibrin clot by degrading fibrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Weisel1">[37]</xref>. This system is negatively regulated by PLG activator inhibitors. A balance between coagulation system and anticoagulation is necessary to avoid pathophysiological conditions, such as, bleeding and thrombosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Sun1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several Fg-binding proteins of important pathogens, such as, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Flick1">[39]</xref>, group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Dramsi1">[40]</xref>, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Collins1">[41]</xref> and the spirochetes <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Houston1">[42]</xref>, <italic>T. denticola</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Haapasalo1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Edwards1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Bamford1">[45]</xref> have been reported and characterized. These Fg-binding proteins are bacterial surface or secreted adhesins that although acting through different mechanisms will ultimately lead to enhance the bacterial survival in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Rivera1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>The adhesion of virulent <italic>L. interrogans</italic> strain Fiocruz L1-130 to Fg has been shown to be induced by physiological osmolarity, but the effect of this binding on fibrin clot formation was not evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy1">[14]</xref>. The leptospiral proteins, LigA and LigB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lin1">[17]</xref> and OmpL37 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Pinne1">[15]</xref> have been described as Fg-binding proteins. In addition, the interaction of LigB with Fg was shown to inhibit thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lin1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that <italic>L. interrogans serovar</italic> Copenhageni are capable of binding human Fg on their surface, as visualized by indirect IFA. Moreover, we have employed ELISA to assess the interaction of human Fg with virulent <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni Fiocruz L1-130, attenuated <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni M-20 and non-pathogenic saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> serovar Patoc Patoc 1, and the effect of this binding on the thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation. Moreover, we studied seven leptospiral adhesin- and PLG-binding proteins, rLIC12238 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Vieira3">[18]</xref>, Lsa33, Lsa25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Domingos1">[19]</xref>, Lsa30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Souza1">[20]</xref>, OmpL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Fernandes1">[21]</xref>, rLIC11360 and rLIC11975 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Siqueira1">[22]</xref> for their capacity to bind Fg and to inhibit fibrin clot formation. We show that all strains tested bind Fg, including the saprophytic one, and that this interaction inhibits fibrin clot formation. Though the virulent strain appears to be more efficient, the values obtained were not statistically significant. Attachment of recombinant proteins to Fg was specific, dose-dependent and saturable with all proteins but Lsa30. The interaction of the proteins with Fg, similar to the <italic>Leptospira</italic>, promoted an inhibition on thrombin-induced fibrin clot formation. Thus, <italic>Leptospira</italic>, similar to other pathogens, express multiple Fg-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Sun1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Rivera1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>As expected, recombinant proteins partially inhibited attachment of intact <italic>L. interrogans</italic> to immobilized Fg. The inhibitory effect exerted by the recombinant proteins was moderate, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 µM of protein concentration to reach significance, and could be explained by the existence of additional <italic>L. interrogans</italic> binding proteins contributing to the leptospiral adherence to Fg. A correlation between inhibition and affinity was detected with the recombinant protein Lsa33, while no correspondence was seen with the others.</p>
<p>The inhibitory effect on fibrin formation observed with leptospires and with the six recombinant proteins was partial, similar to the LigB, fragment 7–12, employed in this work as positive control, and previously reported by Choy et al., 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Choy2">[16]</xref>, using LigB fragment 9–11. Our data differ with the total clotting inhibition promoted by the Fg-binding proteins, SdrG of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Davis1">[47]</xref>, ClfA of <italic>S. aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Liu1">[48]</xref> and LigBCen2R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Lin1">[17]</xref>. The data suggest that in <italic>Leptospira</italic> other mechanisms might be involved in fibrin formation and/or the main function of these Fg- binding proteins is not associated with the clotting.</p>
<p>We have described the interaction of <italic>Leptospira</italic> with fibrinolytic system and shown that it occurs with virulent, attenuated and saprophyte strains of <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Moreover, we demonstrated that this association renders the bacteria with proteolytic activity capable of degrading ECM components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Vieira1">[12]</xref>. Several membrane proteins were identified as PLG-binding receptors capable of generating PLA in the presence of activator, suggesting that the interaction with the fibrinolytic system might be important during leptospirosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Verma1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Vieira3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Mendes1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Oliveira1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Domingos1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Fernandes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Souza1">[20]</xref>. Indeed, the increased plasma levels of Fg degradation products detected in leptospirosis has provided evidence for fibrinolysis activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Wagenaar1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Wagenaar2">[52]</xref>. We show now that <italic>Leptospira</italic> surface-associated PLA activity is capable to degrade Fg <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting one possible pathway to generate Fg metabolites during the disease.</p>
<p>Fg is considerably upregulated during inflammation or under exposure to stress such systemic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Rivera1">[46]</xref>. The activation of coagulation cascade with increased levels of plasma Fg during leptospirosis has been detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-DeFrancescoDaher1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Wagenaar1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Chierakul1">[54]</xref>. It has been suggested that these findings are possibly associated to severe tissue damage, vascular endothelial injury or a compensating production by the liver in response to the augmented Fg utilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Higgins1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-DeFrancescoDaher1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Wagenaar1">[51]</xref>. Our data show that <italic>Leptospira</italic> either through their Fg-binding proteins or coated with PLA activity would increase the consumption of Fg molecules by sequestering or degrading them. Under these circumstances, a reduction on fibrin clot formation is expected. In addition, leptospirosis patients with clinical bleeding were reported to have lower platelet counts when compared to other patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002396-Chierakul1">[54]</xref>, a condition that would help decrease thrombosis, facilitate bleeding and help bacterial dissemination.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have provided molecular evidence of the mechanisms that <italic>Leptospira</italic> could employ to interact with components of the coagulation cascade and the fibrinolytic system. In addition, we have shown that six adhesins could mediate the binding of <italic>Leptospira</italic> to Fg and impair thrombin- induced fibrin clot formation. We believe that our results should contribute to the understanding of the complex coagulopathy observed during leptospirosis.</p>
