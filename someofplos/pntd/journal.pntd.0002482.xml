<title>Background</title>
<p>It is believed that schistosomes evade complement-mediated killing by expressing regulatory proteins on their surface. Recently, six homologues of human CD59, an important inhibitor of the complement system membrane attack complex, were identified in the schistosome genome. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether these molecules could act as CD59-like complement inhibitors in schistosomes as part of an immune evasion strategy.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Herein, we describe the molecular characterization of seven putative SmCD59-like genes and attempt to address the putative biological function of two isoforms. Superimposition analysis of the 3D structure of hCD59 and schistosome sequences revealed that they contain the three-fingered protein domain (TFPD). However, the conserved amino acid residues involved in complement recognition in mammals could not be identified. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis determined that most of these genes are up-regulated in the transition from free-living cercaria to adult worm stage. Immunolocalization experiments and tegument preparations confirm that at least some of the SmCD59-like proteins are surface-localized; however, significant expression was also detected in internal tissues of adult worms. Finally, the involvement of two SmCD59 proteins in complement inhibition was evaluated by three different approaches: (i) a hemolytic assay using recombinant soluble forms expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>; (ii) complement-resistance of CHO cells expressing the respective membrane-anchored proteins; and (iii) the complement killing of schistosomula after gene suppression by RNAi. Our data indicated that these proteins are not involved in the regulation of complement activation.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our results suggest that this group of proteins belongs to the TFPD superfamily. Their expression is associated to intra-host stages, present in the tegument surface, and also in intra-parasite tissues. Three distinct approaches using SmCD59 proteins to inhibit complement strongly suggested that these proteins are not complement inhibitors and their function in schistosomes remains to be determined.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Schistosomes are parasites that reside for many years in the blood stream, demanding efficient mechanisms of evading immune response effectors such as complement deposition. A group of genes similar to human CD59, an important complement inhibitor in mammals, were identified in the schistosome genome. Computer predictions of protein structure indicated substantial similarity of the schistosome proteins and the mammalian CD59 family of proteins, which due to their three-finger-shaped spatial conformation are members of the Three-Finger Protein Domain fold superfamily (TFPD). Members of this family of schistosome proteins were also shown to be expressed predominantly during the mammalian stages when worms are exposed to complement and found to be present at the host-interactive surface of schistosomes. Three different methods were employed to test the possible involvement of these proteins in complement inhibition. Our results strongly suggest that these proteins are not involved in the inhibition of complement and that further studies are needed to establish their functional role(s) in schistosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis is an important parasitic disease, caused by trematode worms of the genus <italic>Schistosoma</italic>, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide, with a further 650 million individuals living at risk of infection, remaining a major public health problem in many developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-WHO1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Adult worms are able to survive for decades in the hostile blood environment of their vertebrate host, apparently unharmed by circulating leukocytes, antibodies and the complement system. Thus, the parasite must have developed strategies to evade the host's immune defenses. One of the most important modifications is the new tegument surface organization that develops immediately after penetration of cercariae into the skin and their transformation into schistosomula. The tegument is a thin syncytial layer that covers the whole parasite, limited by a basal membrane and a multilaminate surface membrane complex, which constitutes the major host–parasite interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Skelly1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Schistosomula are at first sensitive to complement killing, but rapidly become highly resistant to complement attack by both the Classical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-McLaren1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Tavares1">[4]</xref> and Alternative Pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Marikovsky1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Santoro1">[6]</xref>. The later developmental stages of the parasite, i.e., the lung schistosomula and adult worms, have also been shown to be refractory to both pathways of complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-McLaren1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Santoro1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Bickle1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Payares1">[8]</xref>. Intravascular parasites must also be resistant to a third complement activation pathway - the Lectin Pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Klabunde1">[9]</xref>. However, the precise mechanisms of complement resistance have not been fully characterized.</p>
<p>The strategies used by the parasite to subvert complement attack are most likely related to the function and composition of the tegument (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Skelly2">[10]</xref>). The apical membrane is considered poorly immunogenic due to the limited number of exposed proteins and the acquisition of a variety of host molecules, which may mask important surface proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Braschi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Braschi2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-CastroBorges1">[13]</xref>. Shedding of the outer coat has been considered as a mechanism to eliminate surface-bound complement and immune-complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Abath1">[14]</xref>. There are also reports of serine proteases in the surface of freshly transformed schistosomula, lung stage and adult worms, that may play a role in complement resistance by cleaving immuno-complexes and complement proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Ghendler1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Marikovsky2">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing strategies that has been proposed as a mechanism by which schistosomes escape complement attack involves the presence in the tegument of several complement regulatory proteins, including two of host origin (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Schroeder1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Skelly3">[18]</xref>). The binding activity to the complement components C1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Laclette1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-vanDam1">[20]</xref>, C3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Silva1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Horta1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Pearce1">[23]</xref> and C8/C9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Parizade1">[24]</xref>, have been reported to be present at the surface of schistosome parasites. It is important to note that while some of these parasite proteins (e.g. paramyosin) have been isolated and shown to interact with complement components <italic>in vitro</italic>, the definitive protective role of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> has not yet been demonstrated.</p>
<p>In the last seven years, several proteomics studies attempted to define the tegument protein composition, as well as its surface exposed molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Wilson1">[25]</xref>. From these studies, one surprising finding was the detection of the host complement components C3 and C4, but not those required for formation of the <underline>M</underline>embrane <underline>A</underline>ttack <underline>C</underline>omplex (MAC), i.e. C5b to C9 molecules, as revealed by biotinylation studies of the tegument surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Braschi2">[12]</xref>. A reasonable explanation is that the complement fixation is initiated, but then inhibited to prevent MAC formation. A mouse C3 complement regulatory (Crry)-like molecule has also been detected on the tegument surface by proteomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Braschi2">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Host cells are protected from MAC-mediated lysis mainly by CD59, a 18–21 kDa glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-linked membrane glycoprotein that inhibits polymerization of C9 by binding to C8α and C9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Ninomiya1">[26]</xref>, thus preventing the formation of the cytolytic MAC. Earlier studies indicated that the exposed form of the schistosome muscle protein paramyosin, was able to inhibit the assembly of C5b-9 by binding to C8 and C9; additionally, this protein was reportedly recognized by rabbit anti-human CD59 antiserum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Deng1">[27]</xref>. However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of paramyosin-complement interactions still awaits further clarification.</p>
<p>Recently, Wilson and Coulson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Wilson2">[28]</xref> identified in the schistosome genome six homologues of human CD59, containing 20–30% amino acid identity which rise to &gt;40% if conservative amino acid substitutions are included. One of these molecules (CD59b, formerly Dif 5) was described by our group as a vaccine candidate, due to its up-regulated expression in the schistosomulum stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Farias1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, in another approach to select vaccine candidates, two members of this family (CD59a and CD59b) were identified within a group of molecules exposed on the parasite's tegument by proteomics and molecular shaving with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PiPL-C) treatment of live adult worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-CastroBorges1">[13]</xref>. More recently, two other isoforms similar to CD59 (Smp_166340 and Smp_081920, GeneDB, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Smansoni" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Smansoni</ext-link>) were reported as membrane-associated tegumental proteins by proteomic analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Wilson1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate whether these six homologues could act as CD59-like complement inhibitors in schistosomes as part of an immune evasion strategy, especially because two of them were found on the tegument surface.</p>
<p>The CD59 family possesses the Three-Finger Protein Domain fold (TFPD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat1">[30]</xref>, that is also a feature of proteins with several distinct sequence and structural attributes, such as the receptors of activins, bone morphogenetic proteins, Mullerian inhibiting substance, transforming growth factor-β receptor II, C4.4a (a structural homologue of the urokinase receptor), <underline>u</underline>rokinase/<underline>p</underline>lasminogen <underline>a</underline>ctivatory <underline>r</underline>eceptor (uPAR) and several members of Ly6 family. The Ly6 molecules (lymphocyte differentiation antigens) were among the first cell surface molecules identified in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-McKenzie1">[31]</xref> and there is emerging evidence showing their role in cell signaling, cell adhesion and cellular activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Gumley1">[32]</xref>. The TFPD superfamily is characterized by the structural conservation of at least six half-cystines forming three disulfide bridges (B1, B2 and B4), five β-strands and one asparagine adjacent to the N-terminal of the last half-cystine from the last disulfide bridge B4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat2">[33]</xref>. A very striking characteristic of this domain is the finger-shaped spatial conformation that the amino acid backbone acquires between the two half-cystines of the same disulfide bridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the current work, we describe the molecular characterization of seven putative SmCD59-like genes from genome assembly version 5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Smansoni" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Smansoni</ext-link>) and attempt to address their putative biological function. Our data confirms up-regulation in the transition to intra-host stages. However, the functional studies performed with the two CD59-like members (CD59a and CD59b, named in this study as SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2), previously identified at the host-parasite interface, did not show any complement inhibition activity. Therefore, the function of these seven proteins in schistosomes remains to be established.</p>

Putative multi-copy recombinants were selected following the instructions of the manufacturer. To verify production of the relevant proteins, initial studies were done in small-scale expression conditions, followed by Western blot with anti-His-tag antibody (GE). Fermentation conditions for selected clones were carried out in BMGY media (15 mL) at 28–30°C in a shaking incubator until cultures reached an OD<sub>600</sub> = 2.0 (approximately 16–18 h), as per manufacturer's recommendations. Induction was performed by addition of methanol to a final concentration of 0.5% every 24 h; expression was monitored at 48 and 96 h time points. The supernatants and cell pellets for 10 colonies of each SmCD59 were analyzed for protein expression by Western blot. The colonies that presented the highest expression level were selected for scale-up fermentation.</p>
<p>For protein expression and purification, selected clones were scaled-up for growth in 300 mL in 2.0 L baffled flasks under the same conditions. Cells were harvested after 96 h by centrifugation. The culture medium containing the secreted proteins were filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane, and diluted with 3 volumes of equilibration buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.4 (for rSmCD59.1) and pH 8.0 (for rSmCD59.2).

<p>Analyses of the primary sequences revealed the presence of ten conserved cysteine residues following the same pattern of distribution in Platyhelminthes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A very intrinsic characteristic of the TFPD fold is the presence of at least four conserved cystines among all the different classes of proteins having this domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat1">[30]</xref>. Nonetheless, this pattern differs from the CD59s of mammals in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> cysteines, which are separated by a larger stretch of amino acids in the Platyhelminthes sequences and are located at a distance of exactly two amino acids from their closest cysteines (2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Cys). These distances (from the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 5<sup>th</sup> Cys) in mammals are more variable. However, the most important difference of these molecules when compared to human CD59, is that they do not have the conserved amino acid residues (D24, W40, R53 and E56 in hCD59) involved in complement recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Bodian1">[55]</xref>, as well as the “hydrophobic groove” (C39, W40 and L54 in hCD59), highly conserved in all CD59s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Bodian1">[55]</xref>. The sequence belonging to Herpesvirus Saimiri Protein (Sah-CD59) was included as a homolog from human CD59. Similarly, a glycine adjacent to the sixth cysteine (characteristic of toxins) is not present in the sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat2">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Homology modeling</title>
<p>In order to explicitly visualize the putative domain features and also provide insight into its folding, 3D-modeling of SmCD59.2 (Smp_105220) was performed using human CD59 as a template (2UWR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Despite the low similarity between the two sequences (∼37%), it was possible to align them in order to perform the modeling. Out of the 124 residues, 73 of them were modeled (beginning at V25, which becomes V1 in the mature protein, and ending at A97, becoming A73). The last 27 residues at the C-terminal remained out of the model, since they did not show any similarity to 2UWR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g001">Figure 1</xref>). RMSD was of 1.24 Å between template and models in the common core (36 alpha-carbon atoms).</p>

<p>In this model, the finger-shaped backbone is present within the structure, emerging from a hydrophobic palm, clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. Additionally, the four conserved cystines can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and would be formed by the following pairs: Cys3-Cys27, Cys24-Cys45, Cys49-Cys65 and Cys66-Cys71. There are another two conserved cysteines in the <italic>Schistosoma</italic> spp. (Cys6 and Cys9 in SmCD59.2) that may not form a disulfide bridge. However, the possibility of a fifth cystine formed by these two cysteines cannot be ruled out, since the model generated is not necessarily a real portrait of the native molecule's fold. All these spatial conformations are possible since the TFPD signature is present in the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The geometry of the final refined model was evaluated with a Ramachandran plot, which showed that 97% of the amino acid residues were positioned in the “allowed” regions (data not shown).</p>

<title>Most of the SmCD59 genes are differentially expressed in the transition from cercaria to schistosomulum and adult worms</title>
<p>In order to establish the level of expression in different parasite stages, including cercariae, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured 7-day old schistosomula, adult worms, eggs and miracidia, qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Life Technologies). Gene expression fold changes of each SmCD59 were calculated relative to the less expressed stage after normalization to the alpha-tubulin housekeeping gene.

<p>Samples prepared from cercariae, schistosomula, adult male and female worms, eggs and miracidia stages from <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, and tegument isolated by the freeze/thaw method, were all separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using mouse anti-rSmCD59.1 and anti-rSmCD59.2 antisera.

A lower intensity band of higher molecular mass may be attributed to some cross reactivity with other SmCD59 members (possibly glycosylated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), as suggested by the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted N-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

We cannot rule out the presence of this protein in the tegument fraction; however, this data suggested that the protein is much more abundant in denuded worms than in the tegument.

Expression of SmCD59.2 in the cell membranes was detected by Western blot of a membrane preparation of transfected cells (anti-rSmCD59.2 rat serum did not react with endogenous CD59 protein in live CHO cells – data not shown). To confirm that SmCD59.1 is GPI-anchored, transfected CHO cells were treated with PiPL-C, labeled with anti- rSmCD59.1 antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002482.s004">Figure S4C</xref> (top panels), there was a pronounced reduction in antibody labeling anti-rSmCD59.1 after treatment with PiPL-C (6.8%) as compared to untreated cells (25.8%). Results were similar for CHO-hCD59 cells included as positive control (bottom panels).</p>
<p>CHO-SmCD59.1 and CHO-SmCD59.2 were tested for complement resistance when exposed to antibodies reactive to CHO membrane proteins and to complement from NHS. Background cell mortality was monitored by including samples treated with heat-inactivated complement (iNHS). Complement-treated cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify the live cell population, i.e. cells of reduced fluorescence that are not stained by propidium iodide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The number of viable cells in the CHO-hCD59 sample was considerably higher than the number of live cells in the CHO-pcDNA sample after addition of NHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, first peak in left panel). <italic>T</italic>-test analysis of three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g007">Figure 7D</xref>) showed that CHO-hCD59 cells were significantly more resistant to complement (73.4%±9.1) than CHO-pcDNA cells (37.8%±9%) (p&lt;0.05). When cells were treated with iNHS, the number of live cells in both samples was nearly identical and close to 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, first peak in right panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), confirming the complement inhibitory activity of hCD59 in the transfected cells. The same cell survival analysis was performed on CHO-SmCD59.1 and CHO-SmCD59.2 samples, but there was no difference in cell viability in both samples compared to CHO-pcDNA sample after exposure to NHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref> respectively). These results strongly indicate that SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 are not complement inhibitory proteins.</p>

<title>Effect of SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 gene suppression on complement killing of schistosomula</title>
<p>To further assess whether SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 protect schistosomes from the complement attack, freshly transformed schistosomula were treated with a mixture of SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 specific siRNAs and tested for complement susceptibility 5 days later. Transcript levels measured by qRT-PCR were about 60% lower in SmCD59-suppressed parasites than in control parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Schistosomula were suppressed immediately after cercarial transformation because SmCD59 mRNA levels are undetectable by qRT-PCR at that early time point after which expression increases significantly (data not shown). This approach was expected to ensure that SmCD59 gene knockdown would substantially inhibit protein production in siRNA-treated parasites, while control parasites would have abundant protein levels. Indeed, Western blot analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g008">Figure 8B</xref> confirmed dramatic reduction of SmCD59.1 (top panel) and SmCD59.2 (middle panel) proteins in siRNA-suppressed parasites compared to lysates of control parasites. In the bottom panel, the SmAQP control protein was detected in all lysates, demonstrating that comparable levels of protein were present in each lane. The significant decrease of protein levels in siRNA-suppressed schistosomula did not enhance in vitro parasite killing by human complement beyond 20%, even in the presence of immune serum when compared to the control groups in three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Finally, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002482-g008">figure 8D</xref> was obtained to validate the complement assay and to confirm previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-McLaren1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Tavares1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Bickle1">[7]</xref> in which, contrary to older schistosomula, 3 h-cultured parasites are more susceptible to complement killing, particularly when the killing is antibody mediated. Thus, our results indicate that SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 are not complement regulatory proteins in schistosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Early analysis of the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sequences, SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2, revealed similarity to human CD59 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-CastroBorges1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Wilson2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Farias1">[29]</xref>. In the present report, we have described members of the TFPD family in Platyhelminthes and compared their structure and folding to the human CD59 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-MarchlerBauer1">[58]</xref>. This group of proteins contains the TFPD fold, since the characteristic cysteines of this family are present in their sequences. Despite the fact that the cysteines are conserved, there are two important differences that are evident in the alignment: i) the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> cysteines are in different positions when aligned with their mammalian counterparts; nevertheless, all the Platyhelminthes sequences maintain the two-amino acid distance pattern between the 2<sup>nd</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>/5<sup>th</sup> cysteines; ii) the Platyhelminthes sequences lack the essential amino acids in the active site required to block the formation of the MAC. However, it is reasonable to expect that not all these features would be totally conserved in trematodes and mammals, since these proteins may have hypothetically evolved as complement inhibitors through convergent evolution. For example, there is a fish homologue of CD59, which was shown to have fish complement inhibitory activity, but does not have many of the so-called ‘critical’ residues conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Liu1">[59]</xref>. Furthermore, the presence of at least one CD59 member in the non-parasitic flatworm, <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, suggests that these proteins are also participating in aspects of non-parasitic Platyhelminth biology. Moreover, it is at least intriguing how this pattern remained conserved in inferior taxa, while in mammals it seems to be more variable.</p>
<p>The transcription of most SmCD59 genes is up-regulated following the transition from free-living cercaria to the parasitic schistosomula stage; some of these genes continue to show increasing transcription into the adult worm stage. These data confirm previous microarray results showing up-regulation of SmCD59.1-5 expression in 3-day old schistosomula in comparison to germ-balls and cercariae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-ParkerManuel1">[60]</xref>. Since SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 are the only representatives of this family confirmed to localize at the host-parasite interface by PiPL-C treatment, they were chosen for additional characterization, including functional studies. Western blot analysis of SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 at different life cycle stages confirms that protein expression of these genes also increases during the transition to the mammalian stage. This coincides with the transition of the parasite from a complement-sensitive state to one of resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Marikovsky1">[5]</xref>. Confocal microscopy immunolocalization studies using anti-rSmCD59.1 and anti-rSmCD59.2 antibodies confirmed previous data obtained by PiPL-C shaving showing that the proteins were surface-exposed on the tegument. On the other hand, it was clear that the proteins were also present in considerable amounts inside the parasite, which is in accord with the Western blot experiments on tegument extracts and stripped worms. On the whole, these results further support the concept that these proteins are probably involved in aspects of non-parasitic schistosome biology.</p>
<p>Due to the sequence similarity, we also investigated whether polyclonal antibodies directed to human CD59 (Abnova) could recognize SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 and whether rat anti-rSmC59.1 and anti-rSmCD59.2 polyclonal antibodies recognize human CD59 (Abnova). However, no cross reactivity could be observed in any of these studies (data not shown).</p>
<p>To demonstrate whether SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 are functional homologues of human CD59, soluble rSmCD59 proteins produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were used to examine their complement-inhibitory activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> hemolytic assay designed to favor the activation of the Alternative (rabbit erythrocytes) or the Classical (antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes) Pathways, respectively. Soluble forms of CD59 lacking the GPI-anchor domain have been expressed in mammalian cells, insect cells and yeast and shown to have MAC-inhibitory activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Sugita1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Meri1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Quigg1">[62]</xref>, indicating that glycosylation by <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> does not inhibit the protein function. However, in our study no inhibition of erythrocyte lysis was observed when NHS was pre-incubated with rSmCD59 proteins.</p>
<p>Membrane-targeted forms of CD59 have been shown to be more potent in inhibiting complement than the soluble forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Jones1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Liu1">[59]</xref>. Thus, as an alternative approach, SmCD59.1 and 2 were expressed as membrane proteins (complete coding region) in CHO cells followed by treatment of transfected cells with human complement. Membrane protein expression in CHO cells may also contribute to produce rSmCD59 proteins as close to the native state as possible, which is essential for functional studies. In addition, eukaryotic cells transfected with complement regulatory proteins represent a more physiologically relevant target for <italic>in vitro</italic> complement experiments as compared to erythrocytes pre-treated with these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Huang2">[63]</xref>. Despite our results showing proper localization of rSmCD59.1 and rSmCD59.2 at the plasma membrane and proper GPI-anchorage of rSmCD59.1, transfected CHO cells were not resistant to killing by human complement. Taken together, these functional analyses suggest that SmCD59.1 and SmCD59.2 do not possess inherent complement inhibitory activities.</p>
<p>In a third attempt to investigate the potential of SmCD59.1 and 2 to protect schistosomes from complement attack, the parasites were treated with target-specific siRNAs to induce gene expression knockdown for both targets simultaneously. Despite successful suppression of SmCD59.1 and 2 transcription and translation in schistosomula, these parasites did not become more susceptible to complement killing, by either the Alternative or the Classical Pathways as compared to control parasites. We believe that these results, together with the other complement assays and the sequence and structural comparison, strongly support the conclusion that SmCD59.1 and 2 do not have a complement regulatory function.</p>
<p>These schistosome CD59-like proteins probably have another function in the parasite that is unrelated to complement evasion, although it is quite likely that they are involved in some kind of molecular interaction. This hypothesis is acceptable since TFPDs commonly bind molecules, either as ligands (e.g. toxins) or membrane-attached receptors, like CD59 or urokinase/plasminogen activator receptor, uPAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002482-Galat2">[33]</xref>. Gathering all the evidence, we conclude that these CD59-like proteins do not have a complement regulatory role in schistosomes. Thus, it would be more appropriate to rename this class of proteins. However, since several papers have been published on this gene family as SmCD59 and the protein function is still unknown, it is reasonable to change the family name only when their function is elucidated. Further studies should focus on resolving the 3-D structure of the proteins and deriving their function within the biological context of the host/parasite relationship.</p>
