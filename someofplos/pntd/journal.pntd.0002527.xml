<title>Background</title>
<p>Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) unresponsiveness of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (Ld) had effectively compromised the chemotherapeutic potential of SAG. 60s ribosomal L23a (60sRL23a), identified as one of the over-expressed protein in different resistant strains of <italic>L.donovani</italic> as observed with differential proteomics studies indicates towards its possible involvement in SAG resistance in <italic>L.donovani</italic>. In the present study 60sRL23a has been characterized for its probable association with SAG resistance mechanism.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology and principal findings</title>
<p>The expression profile of 60s ribosomal L23a (60sRL23a) was checked in different SAG resistant as well as sensitive strains of <italic>L.donovani</italic> clinical isolates by real-time PCR and western blotting and was found to be up-regulated in resistant strains. Ld60sRL23a was cloned, expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> system and purified for raising antibody in swiss mice and was observed to have cytosolic localization in <italic>L.donovani</italic>. 60sRL23a was further over-expressed in sensitive strain of <italic>L.donovani</italic> to check its sensitivity profile against SAG (Sb V and III) and was found to be altered towards the resistant mode.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion/Significance</title>
<p>This study reports for the first time that the over expression of 60sRL23a in SAG sensitive parasite decreases the sensitivity of the parasite towards SAG, miltefosine and paramomycin. Growth curve of the tranfectants further indicated the proliferative potential of 60sRL23a assisting the parasite survival and reaffirming the extra ribosomal role of 60sRL23a. The study thus indicates towards the role of the protein in lowering and redistributing the drug pressure by increased proliferation of parasites and warrants further longitudinal study to understand the underlying mechanism.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most fatal form in Indian subcontinent. Till last few years, the treatment of the disease was done with Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG), the first line drug against VL. This, however, was severely eroded by the resistance developed by the parasite against it. In order to understand the underlying mechanism, earlier a proteomic analysis of SAG sensitive as well as SAG resistant isolates of <italic>L.donovani</italic> (Ld) was done in which 60s ribosomal L23a (Ld60sRL23a) protein, one of the essential member of translational machinery, was found to be over-expressed. To examine its role in SAG resistance mechanism, which is hitherto not known, 60sRL23a was characterized and over-expressed in the sensitive isolate of <italic>L.donovani</italic>. The sensitivity of these transfectants, was found to be decreased towards SAG. The growth curve of transfectants clearly showed its proliferation potential in both promastigote and amastigote forms. Cell cycle analysis of the transfectants further assured its rapid progression towards the G2/M phase. The above studies, thus, indicate that 60s RL23a regulates proliferation of <italic>L.donovani</italic> parasites and represents a unique strategy to resist SAG. 60sRL23a could be further explored as a potential drug target to strengthen the chemotherapy strategy against <italic>L.donovani</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, affecting almost, more than 10 million people around the world and ranks itself second to malaria in terms of mortality and morbidity. It is caused by an obligatory intracellular protozoan parasite of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic> and has varied clinical spectrum from self healing skin ulcers to fatal visceral infection if left untreated. As vaccine against visceral form is still a distant proposition, treatment against Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) solely relies on chemotherapy. Unfortunately, during the last decade Sodium Antimony Gluconate (SAG) which had a traditional background of sixty years of chemotherapy has been worn out due to the resistance developed against this drug. This has become a major obstacle to the treatment, especially in India, where more than 60% of VL patients are unresponsive to SAG treatment. Although, new drugs have become available in recent years for treatment of VL, they are also far from satisfactory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Croft1">[1]</xref>. This is due to increased relapse cases, lack of cost effectiveness and emerging resistance against them, as reported earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Sundar1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, understanding the resistance mechanism could only strengthen the search for safe and wise chemotherapeutic strategies against VL.</p>
<p>SAG having Sb (V) is a pro-drug and requires biological reduction to active form i.e. Sb (III) in macrophage and/or amastigotes. Sb (III) has been reported to interact with several targets. Resistance in general has been understood as interplay among uptake, efflux and/or sequestration of active molecule and modulating gene expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Croft2">[3]</xref>. Most of the drug resistance studies were done on the laboratory mutants as compared to the clinical isolates. Although some studies emphasized on field isolates but these were based on biochemical, biophysical and immunological analysis of resistant isolates but several questions remains unrequited regarding the parasite's modulation for SAG at molecular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Mukhopadhyay1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Mukherjee1">[5]</xref>. Actual scenario could be more lucid by exploring clinical isolates and characterizing the up regulated as well as down regulated proteins in the resistant strains. Several differential studies revealed many proteins under several metabolic pathways, proteins involved in maintaining redox balance, transporters and signaling pathways along with a large number of translational/ribosomal proteins indicating its possible role in resistance mechanism in the resistant clinical isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Biyani1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Decuypere1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Chawla1">[8]</xref>. Some of them are well characterized for their possible role in SAG resistance mechanism e.g. Trypanothione reductase, γ glutamyl cysteine synthtase, ornithine decarboxylase and ABC transporters but ribosomal proteins are yet to be explored for its involvement in drug resistance against VL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Asutosh1">[9]</xref>. 60s ribosomal L23a (60sRL23a) is one such over-expressed protein in SAG resistant strain of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (Ld) identified through differential proteomics indicating its possible involvement in SAG resistance in <italic>L.donovani</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Kumar1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>60sRL23a encoded protein is a component of 60s subunit of large subunit of ribosome. In eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis is a coordinated assembly involving four ribosomal rRNA molecules and more than seventy ribosomal proteins. It was believed that ribosome were previously consists of RNA only and ribosomal protein appeared later in the evolution to facilitate the protein synthesis. However, ribosomal proteins have also been reported to regulate cell growth and apoptosis apart from their regular translational apparatus activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Naora1">[11]</xref>. There are some circumstantial evidences available regarding ribosomal proteins acting as modulators and effectors of changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Wool1">[12]</xref>. Ribosomal proteins may be meant for ribosome, but could be recruited for extra ribosomal functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Bavsar1">[13]</xref>. In the present study for the first time involvement of over-expressed 60sRL23a in <italic>in vitro</italic> SAG resistance has been explored in clinical isolates of <italic>L.donovani</italic>.</p>

<title>Parasites</title>
<p>Clinical isolates used in this study were isolated from patients at the Kala –Azar Medical Research centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, and at its affiliated hospital at Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India. Clinical isolates were obtained prior to drug treatment from VL patients who had responded to chemotherapy by SAG and were designated as SAG-S (SAG-sensitive), whereas VL patients who did not respond to SAG were designated as SAG-R (SAG-resistant). Promastigotes of corresponding strains were harvested by transformation of amastigotes from the splenic aspirates of kala-azar patients. SAG-S isolates used in this study include 2001 (S1) whereas the three SAG-R isolates were 2039 (R1), 1216 (R2), 761 (R3). The isolates used in this study were anonymized. The Dd8 (S2) strain (MHOM/IN/80/DD8) was used as a reference strain in this study. The isolates were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%FCS at 26°C (Sigma, USA) in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flask (Nunc). The virulence have been retained in parasites through regular passage through hamster, so as to maintain their chemosensitivity profiles that was measured periodically by amastigote macrophage J774A.1 infectivity assay as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Lakshmi1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<p>Mouse macrophage cell line, J774A.1, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)(Sigma, USA) in 16 well chamber slides (Nunc, USA) to a cell density of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and infected with late log phase promastigotes (S1, S2, R1, R2, R3) at a multiplicity of infection of 10∶1 (parasite/macrophage) and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 8–12 h after which chamber slides were washed with PBS and finally the wells were supplemented with fresh medium. Different concentrations of SAG [Sb (V) (Albert David)] were added to the wells in triplicate and incubated for 48–96 h. Chamber slides were fixed in absolute methanol, stained with Geimsa and examined under oil immersion objective of light microscope. At least 100 macrophages were counted per well for calculating % infected macrophages. Percentage inhibition (PI) of parasite multiplication was calculated in comparison to untreated/control using the formula: PI = no. of parasite count from infected control – no. of parasites from the treated group/no of parasite count from infected control per 100 macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Samant1">[15]</xref>.

Amplified PCR product was electrophoresed in agarose gel and eluted from the gel by Gen Elute columns (Qiagen). Eluted product was cloned in pTZ57R/T (T/A) cloning vector (Fermentas) and transformed into competent DH5α cells. The transformants were screened for the presence of recombinant plasmids with 60sRL23a insert by gene specific PCR under similar conditions as previously mentioned.

The blot was developed using an ECL kit (GE Biosciences). For purification of 60sRL23a 200 ml of LB medium containing 35 µg/mL of chloramphenicol and 35 µg/mL ampicillin were inoculated with <italic>E.coli</italic> Rosetta strain transformed with pTriEx4-Ld60sRL23a and grown to an O.D.<sub>600</sub> of, 0.6 and then induced by addition of 1 mM (IPTG, Sigma) then further incubated for an additional 4–5 h at 37°C. The rLd60sRL23a was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelating resin to bind the His6- Tag fusion peptide derived from the pTriEx4 vector. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl,) containing 1∶200 dilution of protease cocktail inhibitor (Sigma) and incubated for 30 mins on ice and the suspension was sonicated for 10×20 s (with 30 s interval between each pulse) on ice. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated at 4°C for 1 h with the 2 ml of Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing with buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM Nacl) containing different concentrations of imidazole i.e. 10, 20, 30 and 50 mM, the purified rLd60sRL23a was eluted with elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). The eluted fractions were analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE and the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, USA).

<p>10 million log phase parasites each of S1, S2, R1, R2, R3 were taken for RNA extraction. The freshly harvested promastigotes were immediately resuspended in Tri reagent (Sigma, Aldrich). RNA was isolated according to the manufacture protocol. Isolated RNA were treated with DNase and quantified in Gene-quant (Biorad). Total RNA (1 µg/reaction) was reverse transcribed using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) and then cDNA was treated with RNase. For qRT-PCR primers were designed using Beacon Designer software (Biorad). qRT-PCR was carried out with 12.5 ml of SYBER green PCR master mix (TAKARA), 1 µg of cDNA, and primers at a final concentration of 200 nM in a final volume of 25 µl. PCR was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 52°C for 1 min and extension at 70°C for 1 min followed by 80°C for 10 sec. 87 cycles of melt curve was set at 52°C for 10 sec. All quantification was normalized to the Ld-actin gene. A no-template control cDNA was included to eliminate contaminations or nonspecific reactions. The cycle threshold (CT) value was defined as the number of PCR cycles required for the fluorescence signal to exceed the detection threshold value (background noise). Difference in gene expression was calculated by comparative CT method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Rama1">[24]</xref>. This method compares test samples to the comparator sample and uses results obtained with a uniformly expressed control gene (Ld-actin) to correct for differences in the amounts of RNA present in the two samples being compared to generate a ΔCT value. Results are expressed as the degrees of difference between ΔCT values of test and comparator sample (S1) to get ΔΔCT i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Livak1">[25]</xref>.

Whereas S1(pXG-'GFP+) has 6, 10, 11, 13% of parasites in ‘G2/M’ phase and 14, 17, 23, 23% parasites in ‘S’ phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002527-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). The proportion of S1(pXG-'GFP+) in G0/G1 phase was 1.14, 0.5, 0.31 and 0.02% whereas 1.19, 1.62, 1.42 and 1.10% of S1(60s+pXG-'GFP) in G0/G1 phase at different time interval.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The emergence of SAG resistance and the limited knowledge of the mechanism by which parasite acquire resistance are the major obstacle for the control of VL. Several SAG resistance studies were done on the basis of differential proteomics or/and transcriptomics and microarray to understand the parasite strategy to escape the drug pressure. These studies led to the identification of several proteins, playing crucial role in liberating the drug pressure, including ribosomal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Biyani1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Chawla1">[8]</xref>. . The enhanced expression of ribosomal proteins has been reported in tumors such as breast cancers, prostate cancers and hepatocellular cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Kim1">[32]</xref>. These ribosomal proteins have not been studied in detail in relation to SAG resistance in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. In this study, therefore, we have evaluated the involvement of 60sRL23a in SAG resistance using five clinical isolates which were isolated from kala-azar patients (Muzaffarpur) and their SAG sensitivity was further verified <italic>in vitro</italic> (macrophage and amastigote model) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (hamster model). SAG sensitivity profile of sensitive and resistant isolates <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> was comparable. S2 (Dd8), a WHO reference laboratory strain of <italic>L.donovani</italic> was used in this study to assess the resistance index of isolates. Resistance index of different resistant clinical isolates (R1, R2, R3) revealed that their response to Sb (V) and Sb (III) were similar. <italic>In vivo</italic> response of the resistant isolates to SAG in hamster model exhibited no inhibition even at higher concentration of SAG where as the S1, S2 exhibited 94.97±2.0% and 96.915±0.84% inhibition. The sensitive isolates responded even at the lower doses of SAG (20 and 40 mg/kg×5i.p.). <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> SAG sensitivity profile of all the isolates replicated the patients' response and confirmed the persistence of SAG response of clinical isolates even after several passages in hamster. In order to assess the association of 60sRL23a in SAG resistance we cloned, expressed and purified the protein which exhibited very close homology with <italic>L.major</italic> 60sRL23a to the tune of 95% and 45% identity with humans indicating towards the difference among the humans and parasite's entity. The protein's mismatched homology with humans can present the protein as a potential drug target. Immunoblot study of <italic>L.donovani</italic> promastigote lysate with the polyclonal anti-rLd60sRL23a antibody has revealed one dominant protein of 16 kDa mol wt. This protein was identified earlier at lower molecular weight range in proteomic studies which is approximately identical to its observed molecular mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Kumar1">[10]</xref>. The protein has been observed to have a cytosolic localization in the parasite, though earlier in the proteomic study it was identified in the membrane fraction. The protein is a well known member of large subunit of ribosomes so it is obvious for its attachment to endoplasmic reticulum thus it would have eventually been identified in the membrane fraction in the proteomic study. To study the expression level of 60sRL23a in different clinical isolates real time and immunoblot analysis was done and it revealed the 2 fold expression of the transcript and protein in the resistant strain as compared to the sensitive one, verifying the differential proteomics finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Kumar1">[10]</xref>. Differential regulation of ribosomal proteins has been utilized by cells to cater their needs such as replication, transcription, delaying apoptosis and proliferation, thus helping the cell to escape the stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Jiang1">[33]</xref>. In this study whether 60sRL23a could modulate the SAG sensitivity profile of parasite, protein has been over expressed in S1 in pXG-'GFP+ vector having GFP tag in C-terminus end of the protein. Immunoblot analysis with 60sRL23a polyclonal antibody revealed the ∼43 kDa protein in the lysate of S1 transfected with 60sRL23a gene containing vector, verifying over expression of GFP tagged 60sRL23a. The immunoblot analysis with the GFP antibody identified two protein bands at ∼43 kDa and ∼27 kDa, indicating the detachment of GFP protein from combined entity of 60sRL23a+pXG-'GFP+ after expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002527-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This ensures the expression of protein returns in its original length after fusion protein expression. Transfectants expression profile in increasing G418 concentration indicated the increased protein expression pattern with increasing amount of G418 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002527-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) i.e. ∼ two fold expression of GFP tagged 60sRL23a in parasites growing in 50 µg/mL G418 as compared to parasites residing with 20 µg/mL G418, whereas no expression of GFP tagged 60sRL23a has been seen in 0 µg/mL of G418. Transfectants growth profile was analyzed by counting parasites per day for each transfectants and a clear proliferation has been observed in 60sRL23a over expressing parasites. The transfectants S1(60sRL23a+pXG-'GFP+) growing at 50 µg/mL of G418 has more proliferative potential as compared to transfectants growing at 0 µg/mL and 20 µg/mL of G418, indicating the increasing expression of protein leading the parasite proliferation. As the growth curve results exhibited greater number of parasites in transfectants over expressing 60sRL23a, thus the cell cycle progression of a synchronized transfected and control parasite population was analyzed to identify its relation with 60sRL23a expression. Parasites exhibited the tendency towards ‘G2/M’ phase as increasing number of parasites are seen in this phase wherein parasite progresses at different time intervals in compared to the control S1(pXG-'GFP+) one. The different proportion of both parasites [S1(pXG-'GFP+) and S1(60s+pXG-'GFP+)] in S phase were approximately same at different time interval. In G0/G1 phase number of parasites were decreased in S1 (60s+pXG-'GFP+) as compared to S1(pXG-'GFP+) revealing no arrest and a smooth progression to G2M phase. Whereas in G2M phase at 8 hrs and 12 hrs the S1(60s+pXG-'GFP+) progressively increased in comparison to S1(pXG-'GFP+) leading to rapid proliferation of parasites. Cell cycle progression pattern of transfectants reconfirmed the proliferation of S1(60sRL23a+pXG-'GFP+). Cellular proliferation as one of the extra ribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins have been reported to alter the cell cycle by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) and regulatory molecules of cell cycle check points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Moorthamer1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Takagi1">[35]</xref>. Although Cdk are absent in <italic>Leishmania</italic> still apoptosis like cell death has been evidenced in <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Bruchhaus1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Debrabant1">[38]</xref>. Transfectants were checked for their SAG sensitivity <italic>in vitro</italic> in macrophage-amastigote model Sb (V) as well as in the promastigotes for Sb (III) directly. Results revealed the <italic>in vitro</italic> SAG sensitivity of transfectants maintained at 0, 20, 50 µg of G418 were assessed with both SbV in macrophage amastigote model and with Sb (III) in promastigotes. The sensitivity profile of the transfectants to Sb (V) and Sb (III) is depicted in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002527-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>). S1 containing episomally over-expressed 60sRL23a growing at 50 µg/mL showed 1.7 fold higher IC<sub>50</sub> (158.066±4.28) for Sb (V) than IC<sub>50</sub> (92.506±5.7) of S1 expressing vector alone. S1(pXG-'GFP+60sRL23a) growing at 20 µg/mL of G418 also exhibited higher IC<sub>50</sub> (123.2±5.117) which is 1.5 fold as compared to S1(78.55±6.5). Whereas S1 (pXG-'GFP+60sRL23a) growing at 0 µg/mL of G418 demonstrated the IC<sub>50</sub> comparable to S1 (pXG-'GFP+) and S1. The sensitivity of transfectants to Sb (III) and Sb (V) patterns were similar to each other. The Sb (III) IC<sub>50</sub> (61.58±7.23) of S1 (pXG-'GFP+60sRL23a) was 3.5 fold higher than S1 (pXG-'GFP+) (17.67±1.71) at 50 µg/mL of G418, whereas at 20 µg/mL of G418 it was 2.7 fold higher. In absence of G418 the IC<sub>50</sub> of transfectants were comparable. The IC<sub>50</sub> of S1(pXG-'GFP+60sRL23a) growing at 50 µg/mL was 1.2 fold higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> of transfectants growing at 20 µg/mL. This sensitivity profile of transfectants to Sb (V)/Sb (III)and increasing expression pattern of 60sRL23a in response to varying G418 concentration revealed the SAG sensitivity profile and 60sRL23a expression pattern is inversely correlated. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of transfectants, were ∼1.3 to 1.8 fold higher for Sb (V) and ∼1.2 to 1.4 fold higher for Sb (III) to all the three resistant isolates, depicting the comparable resistance acquired by the transfectants to that of resistant isolates. Since SAG helps in sustaining innate as well as adaptive immunity against <italic>Leishmania</italic> by generating
ROS and NO, higher proliferating capacity would increase the chances of the parasite to survive the intracellular host killing mechanism and combating the drug pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Haldar1">[39]</xref>. Cellular proliferative potential of 60sRL23a and decreased SAG sensitivity of transfectants further emphasized the need to check its sensitivity profile for other antileishmanial drugs such as miltefosine, paramomycin and amphotericin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002527-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Results revealed the decreased sensitivity of transfectants towards miltefosine and paramomycin. Whereas transfectants retained unaltered sensitivity towards amphotericin B. Paramomycin in general is known to inhibit protein synthesis by targeting ribosomal proteins and resistant strains of paramomycin revealed upregulated translational/ribosomal proteins to combat the drug pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Chawla1">[8]</xref>. On the other hand the resistance mechanism of miltefosine involves several defect in inward translocation and increased efflux of drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-PrezVictoria1">[40]</xref>. Since paramomycin is known to inhibit protein synthesis and the exact working mechanism of miltefosine and SAG is still unknown, the pathways of these drugs may do the cross talk somewhere or the toxicity of these drugs could have been overtaken by the parasite through increased cellular proliferation. In the light of above observation increased proliferative potential may strengthen the parasite to redistribute or lower the drug pressure hence providing a prospect to escape the drug pressure. Amphotericin B being the most successful drug among these and no resistance cases reported till date, further revealed its unique mechanism unbeatable by the parasite. Despite of its peerless therapeutic results, its toxicity and cost factors further compelled us to rejuvenate the safe traditional drugs. Down regulation of 60sRL23a could validate the finding of the present study but as RNAi machinery is absent in <italic>L.donovani</italic> and only knockout remains the only way to study the down regulation effect of the gene, but knockout 60sRL23a would be futile due to multicopy of the gene present in the genome of <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Presence of multicopy of 60sRL23a again indicates the protein to be an essential component of parasite that could be used by the parasite in different ways as and when so ever needed. Hence this study could only confirm the after effects of up regulation of 60sRL23a. Study further revealed that parasite could use its usual protein to perform an unusual function such as cellular proliferation to combat pressure of different drugs carrying out different anti-parasitic pathway. Indian subcontinent is now relying on several other drug combinations other than SAG, but parasites had developed resistance against these drug combinations under laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Hernndez1">[41]</xref>. To win the battle against Leishmaniasis searching new drugs or combinations against <italic>Leishmania</italic> is not sufficient but our understanding for the resistance mechanism has to be explored enough to strengthen the new chemotherapeutic strategy. SAG has not been in use for some time on the Indian subcontinent, and although the removal of drug pressure is expected to allow the return of the sensitive parasites by natural selection, although this is not universally accepted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Lipstith1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Lipstith2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Mukhopadhyay1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002527-Mukherjee1">[5]</xref>. Our understanding regarding resistance mechanism is in its infancy, this study will help to focus on the substantial role played by the ribosomal proteins in disease progression by assisting the parasite to escape the drug pressure.</p>
