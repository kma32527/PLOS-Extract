<abstract>
<p>Chagas disease is caused by the parasitic protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. It has high mortality as well as morbidity rates and usually affects the poorer sections of the population. The development of new, less harmful and more effective drugs is a promising research target, since current standard treatments are highly toxic and administered for long periods. Fractioning of methanol (MeOH) extract of the stem bark of <italic>Calophyllum brasiliense</italic> (Clusiaceae) resulted in the isolation of the coumarin soulamarin, which was characterized by one- and two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy as well as ESI mass spectrometry. All data obtained were consistent with a structure of 6-hydroxy-4-propyl-5-(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-6″,6″-dimethylpyrane-[2″,3″:8,7]-benzopyran-2-one for soulamarin. Colorimetric MTT assays showed that soulamarin induces trypanocidal effects, and is also active against trypomastigotes. Hemolytic activity tests showed that soulamarin is unable to induce any observable damage to erythrocytes (c<sub>max.</sub> = 1,300 µM). The lethal action of soulamarin against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was investigated by using amino(4-(6-(amino(iminio)methyl)-1H-indol-2-yl)phenyl)methaniminium chloride (SYTOX Green and 1H,5H,11H,15H-Xantheno[2,3,4-ij:5,6,7-i′j′]diquinolizin-18-ium, 9-[4-(chloromethyl)phenyl]-2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17-octahydro-chloride (MitoTracker Red) as fluorimetric probes. With the former, soulamarin showed dose-dependent permeability of the plasma membrane, relative to fully permeable Triton X-100-treated parasites. Spectrofluorimetric and fluorescence microscopy with the latter revealed that soulamarin also induced a strong depolarization (ca. 97%) of the mitochondrial membrane potential. These data demonstrate that the lethal action of soulamarin towards <italic>T. cruzi</italic> involves damages to the plasma membrane of the parasite and mitochondrial dysfunction without the additional generation of reactive oxygen species, which may have also contributed to the death of the parasites. Considering the unique mitochondrion of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, secondary metabolites of plants affecting the bioenergetic system as soulamarin may contribute as scaffolds for the design of novel and selective drug candidates for neglected diseases, mainly Chagas disease.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chagas disease is a parasitic protozoan that affects the poorest population in the world, causing a high mortality and morbidity. As a result of highly toxic and long-term treatments, the discovery of novel, safe and more efficacious drugs is essential. Natural products isolated from plants are commonly used as drug prototypes or precursors to treat parasitic diseases. As part of our investigation of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora, the present study was undertaken in order to determine the antitrypanosomal effects of the soulamarin, a coumarin isolated from the stem bark of <italic>Callophyllum brasiliense</italic> (Clusiaceae), against <italic>Trypanossoma cruzi</italic>. This study moreover investigated the lethal action of soulamarin towards the parasite. Considering the obtained results, secondary metabolites of plants affecting the bioenergetic system as soulamarin may contribute as scaffolds for the design of novel and selective drug candidates for neglected diseases, mainly Chagas disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The tree <italic>Calophyllum brasiliense</italic> is known in Brazil as “Guanandi” or “Jacareúba”. It can reach up to 40 meters in high, 1–3 meters in diameter and is usually found in Brazil in the rain forest regions of the Amazon. Its stem bark is used in folk medicine to treat rheumatism, varicose veins, haemorrhoids and ulcers, whereas the leaves have anti-inflammatory properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-CechinelFilho1">[1]</xref>. Previous chemical studies on <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> resulted in the isolation of several interesting natural products, e.g. xantones, flavonoids, triterpenoids, and coumarins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Noldin1">[2]</xref>. Some coumarins isolated from <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> displayed trypanocidal activity, but unfortunately, no information about the underlying mechanism was available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-ReyesChilpa1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>The parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> causes American trypanosomiasis or “Chagas disease”, which has high mortality and morbidity rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Rassi1">[4]</xref>. Chagas disease is common to the Americas, including Mexico and the South of the USA and has become a global public health problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-WHO1">[5]</xref>. Due to high levels of migration, the disease has already reached non-endemic countries. An estimated 10 million people are currently infected and 14,000 deaths per year are documented. In Brazil alone, over 6 million people are infected and approximately 6,000 deaths per year are registered. The migration of millions of Latin Americans to more developed countries such as e.g. the USA, accounts for approximately 300,000 chronically infected patients there <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Bern1">[6]</xref>. More than a dozen infections acquired from blood transfusions or transplantations have been reported in several European countries, the USA, and Canada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Tempone1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Nifurtimox (7–10 mg/kg/day) and benznidazole (5–7 mg/kg/day) are the two prevalent drugs, currently used in the treatment of Chagas disease. Unfortunately they suffer drawbacks from high levels of toxicity and long treatment periods (ca. 60 days) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Bernardes1">[8]</xref>. Nifurtimox, a nitrofuran, inhibits the ability of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> to deplete free radicals through the generation of a nitro-anion in the presence of oxygen. Benznidazole, a nitroimidazole, binds to the DNA, lipids and proteins of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-DiasdeToranzo1">[9]</xref>. The average rate for successful cures among acute and recent cases is 80%, while it is less than 20% for chronic cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Coura1">[10]</xref>. Several studies have identified numerous potential candidates for more effective and less toxic drugs. Amidines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Soeiro1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Daliry1">[12]</xref>, azoles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Buckner1">[13]</xref>, amiodarones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-VeigaSantos1">[14]</xref>, natural naphthoquinone derivatives and megazols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-SoeiroMde1">[15]</xref> as well as calcium channel blockers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Reimo1">[16]</xref> have been proposed, but clinically effective compounds still remain elusive. Therapeutic drug combinations have also been proposed as treatment strategies, e.g. benznidazole/nifurtimox, orbenznidazole/nifurtimoxin combination with antifungals which inhibit ergosterol in double or triple associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Coura2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Natural products isolated from plants are commonly used as drug prototypes or precursors to treat parasitic diseases. Natural coumarins are an important class of plant products with antitrypanosomal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-ReyesChilpa1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-PrezCruz1">[18]</xref>. The coumarins mammea A/BA, A/BB, A/AA, A/BD and B/BA, isolated from <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> and <italic>Mamea americana</italic>, showed activity towards epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> for concentrations between 15 and 90 µg/mL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-ReyesChilpa1">[3]</xref>. Other coumarins isolated from the stem bark of <italic>Kielmeyera albopunctata</italic> showed <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against the trypomastigotes of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, killing 80% of the parasites after 24 hours at 125 µg/mL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Scio1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Continuing the investigation of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora, the present study was undertaken in order to determine the antitrypanosomal effects of soulamarin, which is the main compound isolated from the stem bark of <italic>C. brasiliense</italic>, against <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. This study moreover investigated the lethal action of soulamarin towards the parasite.</p>

<p>Dried and powdered stem bark samples of <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> (72 g) were washed exhaustively with hexane (10×500 mL) at room temperature in order to remove any residual fats. Subsequently, the plant material was extracted with MeOH (10×1 L) at room temperature. The combined organic fractions afforded, after removal of all solvents under reduced pressure, 4.7 g of crude residue. This crude extract was dissolved in MeOH:H<sub>2</sub>O (1∶2) and extracted with EtOAc. The removal of the solvent under reduced pressure resulted in the deposition of a residue (3.0 g), which was subsequently subjected to column chromatography (Sephadex LH-20) with MeOH as the eluent. Nine fractions (I–IX) were separated like this. Fraction III (1.31 g) was further purified by column chromatography over silica gel with a crude solvent gradient of hexane/EtOAc (starting with pure hexane and finishing with pure EtOAc).

<title>Antitrypanosomal activity</title>
<p>Trypomastigotes were counted in a hemocytometer (Neubauer) and deposited on a microplate (96 wells; 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well). Subsequently, soulamarin was added to the cells in concentrations up to 386 µM and the cells were allowed to incubate for 24 hours at 37°C (5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere). Benznidazole was used as standard. Trypomastigote activity was based on the conversion of the soluble tetrazolium salt 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) into the insoluble formazan by mitochondrial enzymes.

Peritoneal macrophages were collected from the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice and deposited on a 16-well chamber slide (1×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) before being incubated for 24 hours at 37°C (5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere). Trypomastigotes from LLC-MK2-infected cultures were washed twice in RPMI-1640 medium, counted in a hemocytometer and added to the macrophages (parasite:macrophage ratio = 10∶1). After an incubation period of 18 hours at 37°C (5% CO<sub>2</sub>), residual free parasites were removed with two washings with medium. Soulamarin was subsequently incubated with infected macrophages (60 h, 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in a non-toxic concentration range between 3.01 and 386 µM. Benznidazole was used as a standard. At the end of the assay, slides were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa prior to counting under a light microscope.

<title>Chemical characterization of soulamarin</title>
<p>The structure of soulamarin is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002556-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The assigned structure is consistent with the results obtained from NMR data and LR-ESI mass spectrum. The individual assignment of proton and carbon atoms was accomplished by 1D (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C) and 2D (HMQC, HMBC and NOESY) NMR measurements. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of soulamarin in CDCl<sub>3</sub>/CD<sub>3</sub>OD displayed two doublets at δ 6.35 and 5.26, with coupling constants of 10.0 Hz, which were assigned to H-9 and H-10. Together with the presence of a singlet at δ 1.20 (H-12 and H-13), these peaks suggested the presence of a chromene moiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Kitamura1">[29]</xref>. The presence of a dihydrocoumarin segment was based on the multiplets at δ 2.4–2.5 (2H) and δ 3.48 (1H), which were assigned to H-3a/H-3b and H-4, respectively. The multiplets at δ 1.30 (H-14), 1.32 (H-15) and the triplet at δ0.64 (<italic>J</italic> = 7.5 Hz, H-16) were assigned to an <italic>n</italic>-propyl chain linked to C-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Brenzan1">[30]</xref>. The doublets at δ 0.97 and 1.28 (<italic>J</italic> = 6.4 Hz) were attributed to the methyl groups H-5′ and H-4′, while the multiplets at δ 2.30 and 3.93 were assigned to H-2′ and H-3′ of the isoprene moiety at C-5. The<sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra showed carbonyl carbons at δ 199.1 (C-1′) and 174.8 (C-2), as well as the sp<sup>2</sup> carbon atoms of the chromene unit at δ 125.5 (C-10) and 115.2 (C-9). Resonances for aromatic carbon atoms were observed between δ 160 and 101, while the carbinol carbon atoms C-3′ and C-11 were observed at δ 78.4 and 77.4, respectively. Additional peaks, corresponding to an <italic>n</italic>-propyl group were observed at δ 35.1 (C-15), 20.4 (C-14) and 13.7 (C-16). Resonances corresponding to the isoprene unit were observed at δ 45.3 (C-2′), 19.2 (C-4′) and 10.0 (C-5′). The relative configurations of C-2′ and C-3′ were assigned by comparison of the NMR data with those reported for (2R*,3R*)- and (2R*,3S*)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Brown1">[31]</xref>. The configuration of C-4 was assigned as S*, due to the cross peaks between H-4<sub>ax</sub> and H-3<sub>eq</sub> as well as between H-4<sub>ax</sub> and H-14, observed in the NOESY spectrum. All these results are consistent with a structure of 6-hydroxy-4-propyl-5-(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-6″,6″-dimethylpyrane-[2″,3″:8,7]-benzopyran-2-one (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002556-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Antitrypanosomal drugs targeting the bioenergetic metabolism as well as the plasma membrane have been considered as potentially chemotherapeutics for Chagas disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Kessler1">[33]</xref>. As part of an ongoing search aiming at the isolation of antiparasitic compounds from Brazilian plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Grecco1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Morais1">[36]</xref>, the coumarin 6-hydroxy-4-propyl-5-(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-6″,6″-dimethylpyrane-[2″,3″:8,7]-benzopyran-2-one (soulamarin) was isolated for the first time from the stem bark of <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> and characterized by <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis as well as by mass spectrometry. Ee and co-workers have recently isolated soulamarin from <italic>C. soulattri</italic>, but no biological activity was described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Ee1">[32]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an antiparasitic activity against <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is reported for soulamarin. The comparable IC<sub>50</sub> values of soulamarin and benznidazole, which is the currently drug in clinical use, suggests a similar effectiveness against trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. In our assays, benznidazole showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 440 µM against trypomastigotes. Different protocols have been described in literature for the evaluation of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> survival, resulting in different IC<sub>50</sub> values. Such variations include: i) evaluation of cell lysis by light microscopy counting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Ferreira1">[37]</xref>; ii) spectrophotometric evaluation of MTT oxidation by mitochondrial dehydrogenases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Gehrke1">[38]</xref>; iii) culture-derived trypomatigotes and bloodstream trypomastigotes; iv) parasite strain; v) number parasites per well; vi) time of incubation with beznidazole, and vii) the source of the drug, which has been produced by different laboratories. Then, comparisons to other IC<sub>50</sub> values of benznidazole should be carefully analyzed. Natural products and synthetic compounds affecting the biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Kessler1">[33]</xref> or the permeability of the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Fernandes1">[39]</xref> of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> have been identified as interesting targets for drug discovery studies. By way of using different fluorimetric probes (SYTOX Green, MitoTracker Red), we targeted in this study the mechanistic aspects on how soulamarin kills <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes. Our data demonstrated that soulamarin rapidly altered the permeability of the plasma membrane, resulting in a dose- and time-dependent influx of the vital dye SYTOX Green into the cell. Fluorescence levels were constant during the observation period (60 min) for all tested concentrations of soulamarin. At 386 µM (IC<sub>100</sub>), soulamarin induced the highest fluorescence intensity, which was close to the positive control Triton X-100, suggesting long-term effects on the membrane of the parasite. A similar effect was also observed at the lowest tested concentration (IC<sub>25</sub> = 103 µM). Edelfosine, a synthetic lysophosphlipid drug has also been shown to induce alterations in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, suggesting that these organelles could be potential targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-SantaRita1">[40]</xref>. However, it has also been proposed that a drug-induced change of the permeability of the plasma membrane is not necessarily accompanied by changes of the mitochondrial function. Digitonin for example, a natural glycoside obtained from <italic>Digitalis</italic> sp., has been shown to increase plasma membrane permeability in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, without affecting the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Vercesi1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>The respiratory apparatus of protozoans typically displays a greater diversity in electron pathways compared to their host cells. The mitochondrion of the protozoan can be considered as a valuable drug target, because of its unique structure and function compared to mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Sen1">[42]</xref>. The predominant physiological function of the mitochondrion is the generation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Additional functions include the generation and detoxification of ROS, the involvement in some forms of apoptosis and the regulation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Brand1">[43]</xref>. Furthermore, a proper mitochondrial membrane potential is essential for the survival of cells and changes can result in a variety of consequence, such as the inhibition of the electron transport chain, the inhibition of ATP synthase, the stimulation of uncoupling proteins or the permeability of the inner membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Fidalgo1">[44]</xref>. In our assays, soulamarin rapidly induced a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential in trypomastigotes, resulting in a reduction of the fluorescence intensity by 97%, relative to the untreated group. This effect may have contributed to deleterious cellular damages associated with bioenergetic system. A similar, potent dose-dependent collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the killing of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites, has been reported for synthetic naphthofuranquinones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-MennaBarreto1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Under physiological conditions, the oxidative phosphorylation involving an electron transport to pump hydrogen ions across the inner membrane, releases ROS, amounting to 3–5% of the total amount of oxygen consumed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Boonstra1">[46]</xref>. Under pathologic conditions, several pathways result in excessive ROS production, which causes - if not efficiently scavenged by the antioxidant system - oxidative stress. Proteins, lipids, and DNA are readily oxidized by ROS, resulting in dysfunction of vital physiological processes, oxidative damage, and cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Gupta1">[47]</xref>. In our assays, despite the substantial depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, soulamarin induced no up-regulation of ROS compared to untreated trypomastigotes. Within the mitochondria, the primary site of ROS production is the electron transport chain, which involves four protein-associated complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Zhang1">[48]</xref>. Several cellular enzyme systems are potential sources of ROS:NAD(P)H oxidase, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), arachidonic acid metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 enzymes, lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, as well as the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Considering that a large number of drugs, which affect mitochondria also contribute to an up-regulation of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Carvalho1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002556-Roy1">[50]</xref>, we propose that soulamarin could target <italic>T. cruzi</italic> mitochondria without affecting the enzymes mentioned above.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Soulamarin was isolated for the first time from the stem bark of <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> and showed desirable anti-trypanosomal activity. Our results furthermore indicated that soulamarin-induced death in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and a modified permeability of the plasma membrane. Therefore, the natural product soulamarin could serve as a scaffold for the development of selective new drugs against neglected diseases, in particular Chagas disease.</p>
