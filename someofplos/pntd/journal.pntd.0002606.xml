<title>Background</title>
<p>Clonorchiasis, caused by the infection of <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> (<italic>C. sinensis</italic>), is a kind of neglected tropical disease, but it is highly related to cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been well known that the excretory/secretory products of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> (<italic>Cs</italic>ESPs) play key roles in clonorchiasis associated carcinoma. From genome and transcriptome of <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, we identified one component of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs, severin (<italic>Cs</italic>severin), which had three putative gelsolin domains. Its homologues are supposed to play a vital role in apoptosis resistance of tumour cell.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>There was significant similarity in tertiary structures between human gelsolin and <italic>Cs</italic>severin by bioinformatics analysis. We identified that <italic>Cs</italic>severin expressed at life stage of adult worm, metacercaria and egg by the method of quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. <italic>Cs</italic>severin distributed in vitellarium and intrauterine eggs of adult worm and tegument of metacercaria by immunofluorence assay. We obtained recombinant <italic>Cs</italic>severin (r<italic>Cs</italic>severin) and confirmed that r<italic>Cs</italic>severin could bind with calciumion in circular dichroism spectrum analysis. It was demonstrated that r<italic>Cs</italic>severin was of the capability of actin binding by gel overlay assay and immunocytochemistry. Both Annexin V/PI assay and mitochondrial membrane potential assay of human hepatocarcinoma cell line PLC showed apoptosis resistance after incubation with different concentrations of r<italic>Cs</italic>severin. Morphological analysis, apoptosis-associated changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay showed that co-incubation of PLC cells with r<italic>Cs</italic>severin <italic>in vitro</italic> led to an inhibition of apoptosis induced by serum-starved for 24 h.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Collectively, the molecular properties of <italic>Cs</italic>severin, a molecule of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs, were characterized in our study. r<italic>Cs</italic>severin could cause obvious apoptotic inhibition in human HCC cell line. <italic>Cs</italic>severin might exacerbate the process of HCC patients combined with <italic>C. sinensis</italic> infection.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> (<italic>C. sinensis</italic>) has afflicted more than 35 million people in world and approximately 15 million in China, creating a socio-economic burden in epidemic regions. The infection of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> is highly related to cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been documented that excretory/secretory products of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> (<italic>Cs</italic>ESPs) involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. <italic>Cs</italic>severin, expressed at life stage of egg, metacercaria and adult worm, was a component of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs. In the current study, we characterized the properties of <italic>Cs</italic>severin such as sequence signature, actin and calciumion binding activity. In addition, we demonstrated that <italic>Cs</italic>severin could cause apoptotic inhibition in spontaneously apoptotic human HCC cell line PLC cells by using morphological analysis, detection of the apoptosis-associated change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well as Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay. Our study provided an exploratory sight view of mechanism involved in progress of carcinoma associated with the infection of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> and <italic>Cs</italic>severin might exacerbate the process of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> infected HCC patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> (<italic>C. sinensis</italic>) has been proven to be the causative agent of clonorchiasis, which is endemic in China, Korea and Vietnam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Lun1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Yoo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Young1">[3]</xref>. As an important food-borne parasite, <italic>C. sinensis</italic> has afflicted more than 35 million people in world and approximately 15 million in China, creating a socio-economic burden in epidemic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Young2">[4]</xref>. Most clonorchiasis cases are due to the consumption of raw freshwater fish containing infective <italic>C. sinensis</italic> metacercariae, which excyst in the duodenum until they grow into juvenile <italic>C. sinensis</italic> and then migrate into the bile ducts of their host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Kim1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Hong1">[6]</xref>. Both experimental and epidemiological evidence have implied that long-term infections with liver flukes lead to chronic pathological changes, including hepatomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, adenomatous hyperplasia, and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Fried1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Sripa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Choi1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>C. sinensis</italic> was recently classified along as a Group I biological carcinogen by the World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Shin1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Lim1">[11]</xref>. In endemic area of China, 16.44% of HCC patients were infected with <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, while 2.40% were infected in non-tumor patients. The OR value and 95% CI in HCC group were 8.00 and 4.34–14.92 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Tan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-HOU1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Huang1">[14]</xref>, so that we should pay high attention to the relationship between primary hepatocellular carcinoma and the infection of <italic>C. sinensis</italic>. It has been well known that the excretory/secretory products of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> (<italic>Cs</italic>ESPs) can cause histopathological changes such as bile duct dilatation, inflammation and fibrosis, and adenomatous proliferation of the biliary epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Chung1">[15]</xref>. In the present studies, from the published genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Wang1">[16]</xref> and transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Young3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Huang2">[18]</xref> of <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, we identified one component of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs, <italic>Cs</italic>severin, which has three putative gelsolin domains.</p>
<p>The gelsolin superfamily is conserved in mammalian as well as in non-mammalian organisms and takes the leading role in controlling actin organization or actin filament remodeling. The family has some specific and apparently non-overlapping particular roles in several cellular processes, including cell motility, control of apoptosis and regulation of phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Silacci1">[19]</xref>. Initial evidence of anti-apoptotic effect of gelsolin was provided by the observation that a point mutation in mouse gelsolin confers on this protein tumor-suppressor activity against H-ras oncogene transformed NIH-3t3 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Mullauer1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Fujita1">[21]</xref>. Direct evidence of the inhibitory role of gelsolin was provided by Ohtsu et al., who generated Jurkat transfectants expressing up to threefold gelsolin than wild-type cells. These transfectants exhibited a phenotype more resistant to apoptosis induced by several stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Ohtsu1">[22]</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that human cytoplasmic gelsolin can prevent apoptotic mitochondrial changes such as mitochondrial membrane potential loss by binding to mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Granville1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Large-scale gene sequencing efforts have revealed gelsolin homologues in the majority of parasitic phyla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Zhou1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Berriman1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Wang2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-CortezHerrera1">[28]</xref>. In the current study, we presented for the first time the molecular characteristics of <italic>Cs</italic>severin. We described the detection of recombinant <italic>Cs</italic>severin (r<italic>Cs</italic>severin) binding to cytoskeletal actin filaments of human hepatocarcinoma PLC cells and investigated its potential anti-apoptotic role on PLC cells as an ingredient of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs <italic>in vitro</italic>. The present study is a cornerstone for researches on biological characterization of <italic>Cs</italic>severin in the future. In addition, our work will provide an exploratory sight view of mechanism involved in progress of carcinoma associated with the infection of <italic>C. sinensis</italic>.</p>

The PCR was carried out for 32 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 51°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 45 s, and extension for 10 min at 72°C after the last cycle in a DNA-Thermal Cycler (Biometra, Germany). PCR products were purified and digested with <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic> III, and then subcloned into prokaryotic expression vector 6×His tag pET28a(+) (Novagen, Germany). After digestion with <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic> III, the recombinant plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing and then transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>, BL21 (Promega, USA). The expression of r<italic>Cs</italic>severin was induced by 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 5 h at 37°C. After induction, the bacteria were harvested by centrifuging at 4°C for 15 min at 8,000×g and suspended in lysis buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 15 min at 4°C. The fusion protein was batch-purified using His Bind Purification kit (Novagen, USA) and the eluted fractions containing r<italic>Cs</italic>severin were pooled and dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM phosphate buffer, 27 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Protein samples were subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, the concentration was measured by a Bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Novagen, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Then, 100/50 µg of r<italic>Cs</italic>severin were mixed with an equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously to six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (purchased for experiments under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals). Boost injections were given at 2 and 5 weeks after first injection. Anti-serum was collected at 1 week after the second booster, then aliquoted and stored in −80°C.

<title>Recovery of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in r<italic>Cs</italic>severin treated PLC cells</title>
<p>To further investigate the molecule events triggered by r<italic>Cs</italic>severin inhibition, we measured MMP in the PLC cells by using flow cytometry and JC-1 staining <italic>in situ</italic>. The decline of MMP is considered as a symbolic event of early cellular apoptosis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we identified that <italic>Cs</italic>severin, which expressed at life stage of egg, metacercaria and adult worm was a component of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs. We also demonstrated its ability of binding with calciumion and actin filaments. Furthermore, co-incubation of PLC cells with r<italic>Cs</italic>severin <italic>in vitro</italic> led to an inhibition of apoptosis induced by serum-starved for 24 h, by using morphological analysis of PLC, detection of the apoptosis-associated change of mitochondrial membrane potential as well as Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay. We inferred that r<italic>Cs</italic>severin may play an intracellular protective role via preventing apoptotic mitochondrial changes (the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential), just like endogenous human gelsolin did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Kusano1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Gelsolin family is found in a diverse range of organisms including bacteria, invertebrates, plants, primates, rodents and vertebrates. The superfamily in mammals consists of seven different proteins: gelsolin, adseverin, villin, capG, advillin, supervillin and flightless I. All of them contain three or six homologous repeats of a domain named gelsolin-like (G) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Silacci2">[41]</xref>. Bioinformatics analysis showed that <italic>Cs</italic>severin comprised three gelsolin homology domains, calciumion and actin binding motifs. The amino acid sequence of <italic>Cs</italic>severin shared 36% identity with that of human gelsolin, but there was significant similarity between their tertiary structures. Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that a majority of gelsolin proteins do not form clades based on taxonomic groupings but rather group according to protein functions. The individual gelsolin domains from human gelsolin form distinct clades with homologues from other species, supporting the notion that these proteins have evolved to perform distinct functions in different organisms.</p>
<p>Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is the major determinant of cell injury following excitotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-MacDermott1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Koh1">[43]</xref>. The activity of these channels is modulated by dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Hines1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Rosenmund1">[45]</xref>, which may occur, in part, through the actions of gelsolin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Furukawa1">[46]</xref>. We obtained soluble and stable r<italic>Cs</italic>severin. CD measurements actually showed that r<italic>Cs</italic>severin could bind to calciumion. It has been documented that gelsolin family is of actin-regulatory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Khaitlina1">[47]</xref>. Cytoskeletal actin filaments are dynamic structures that form membranous networks interacting with cell surface receptors and intracellular effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Allison1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Furukawa2">[49]</xref>. Gel overlay and immunocytochemistry assay indicated the binding activity of r<italic>Cs</italic>severin.</p>
<p>Gelsolin expression in certain tumors correlates with poor prognosis and therapy-resistance. <italic>In vitro</italic>, human gelsolin has anti-apoptotic and pro-migratory functions and is critical for invasion of some types of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-An1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Zhuo1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Renz1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Tanaka1">[53]</xref>. We found that gelsolin was highly expressed at tumor borders infiltrating into adjacent liver tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Zhuo2">[54]</xref>. In Jurkat lymphoblastoid T-cell line, gelsolin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, and the overexpression of gelsolin inhibits the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release from mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Koya1">[55]</xref>. Additionally, in several models of neuronal cell death, endogenous gelsolin has been demonstrated that has an anti-apoptotic property which correlates to its dynamic actions on the cytoskeleton mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Harms1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we also showed that r<italic>Cs</italic>severin could cause obvious apoptotic inhibition in the human HCC cell line. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate r<italic>Cs</italic>severin-inhibited apoptosis after dual staining of cells with AnnexinV and PI. Due to that Annexin V binding is based on the transposition of phosphatidyl serine from the inner to the outer face of the cell membrane during the early stages of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Ma1">[57]</xref>. This method has been widely used to discriminate between normal cells (AnnexinV−/PI−), early apoptotic cells AnnexinV+/PI−), late apoptotic cells (AnnexinV+/PI+), and necrotic cells (AnnexinV−/PI+). Compared with PBS-treated group (negative control), there were less typical apoptotic changes in r<italic>Cs</italic>severin-treated PLC cells after induced spontaneous apoptosis by serum-starved for 24 h in morphology analysis. We also measured the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using a JC-1 probe that gives a red fluorescence when MMP is high and green fluorescence when MMP is low that occurs in early apoptosis cells. We found that interact directly with r<italic>Cs</italic>severin led to the recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential in PLC cells.</p>
<p>Moreover, r<italic>Cs</italic>severin could be probed by sera from rat infected with <italic>C. sinensis</italic> besides anti-<italic>Cs</italic>ESPs serum that confirmed <italic>Cs</italic>severin was a molecular of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs. Although it is still unclear about the mechanism of uptake or internalization of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs by host cells, internalized <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs could play roles in the interaction between the host and parasite. These data demonstrated that <italic>Cs</italic>severin, as an anti-apoptotic molecule to carcinoma cell, might be a pathogenic factor in <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs, contributing to the development of a pro-tumorigenic environment that was conductive to HCC.</p>
<p>Tissue-specific distribution of <italic>Cs</italic>severin in muscular locations such as teguments of adult worm and metacercaria, as well as its actin binding activity, we inferred that <italic>Cs</italic>severin might involve in regulating the contraction of smooth muscle and movement of worm body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Granzier1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Janson1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Gailly1">[60]</xref>. What was more, relative high transcript/protein level of <italic>Cs</italic>severin at egg stage was consist with its intensive immunolocalization in the intrauterine eggs of adult worm. As a food-borne parasite, <italic>C. Sinensis</italic> adult lives in the bile ducts of the host and the worm releases a mass of eggs and ESPs, so that <italic>Cs</italic>severin exists in parasitism circumstance sustainedly and takes a part in the interaction between the host and parasite.</p>
<p>Overall, we presented the molecular characteristics of <italic>Cs</italic>severin, a molecule of <italic>Cs</italic>ESPs. Recombinant <italic>Cs</italic>severin (r<italic>Cs</italic>severin) could bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cytoskeletal actin filaments and cause obvious apoptotic inhibition in human HCC cell line. By promoting apoptosis inhibition, <italic>Cs</italic>severin might exacerbate the process of HCC patients combined with <italic>C. sinensis</italic> infection. More experiments should be further conducted. The current study may provide a novel insight in understanding the pathogenesis of carcinoma associated with the infection of <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, which was an inducing factor that cannot be ignored in the process of the development of primary hepatic carcinoma. Since gelsolin has actin-regulatory functions, modulation of the actin network might be responsible for the inhibition of apoptosis, the actin cytoskeleton may be a target to protect from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002606-Ohtsu2">[61]</xref>. The anti-apoptotic mechanism of <italic>Cs</italic>severin are worthy of studying in the future.</p>
