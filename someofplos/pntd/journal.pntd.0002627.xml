<abstract>
<p>During a blood meal, <italic>Lutzomyia intermedia</italic> sand flies transmit <italic>Leishmania braziliensis</italic>, a parasite causing tegumentary leishmaniasis. In experimental leishmaniasis, pre-exposure to saliva of most blood-feeding sand flies results in parasite establishment in absence of any skin damages in mice challenged with dermotropic <italic>Leishmania</italic> species together with saliva. In contrast, pre-immunization with <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> salivary gland sonicate (SGS) results in enhanced skin inflammatory exacerbation upon co-inoculation of <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS and <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>. These data highlight potential unique features of both <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> and <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic>. In this study, we investigated the genes modulated by <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS immunization to understand their potential impact on the subsequent cutaneous immune response following inoculation of both SGS and <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>. The cellular recruitment and global gene expression profile was analyzed in mice repeatedly inoculated or not with <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic>. Microarray gene analysis revealed the upregulation of a distinct set of IFN-inducible genes, an immune signature not seen to the same extent in control animals. Of note this INF-inducible gene set was not induced in SGS pre-immunized mice subsequently co-inoculated with SGS and <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>. These data suggest the parasite prevented the upregulation of this <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> saliva-related immune signature. The presence of these IFN-inducible genes was further analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) sampled from uninfected human individuals living in a <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>-endemic region of Brazil thus regularly exposed to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> bites. PBMCs were cultured in presence or absence of <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS. Using qRT-PCR we established that the IFN-inducible genes induced in the skin of SGS pre-immunized mice, were also upregulated by SGS in PBMCs from human individuals regularly exposed to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> bites, but not in PBMCs of control subjects. These data demonstrate that repeated exposure to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS induces the expression of potentially host-protective IFN-inducible genes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease of serious public health importance. No efficient vaccine is currently available. Parasites are transmitted to mammalian hosts during sand fly bites. During this process, both parasites and sand fly salivary products are delivered into the skin. Immunization with salivary proteins from most sand fly species can protect mice against cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, immunization with sand fly saliva of <italic>Lutzomyia intermedia</italic> leads to aggravation of leishmaniasis. We investigated the impact of <italic>Lutzomyia intermedia</italic> saliva exposure on the development of immune response to <italic>Leishmania braziliensis</italic>, the major causative agent of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Brazil. To this end, we analyzed in mice the gene expression pattern induced by immunization with salivary gland extracts. Among the genes highly induced were the interferon-inducible genes known to contribute to resistance against parasite infections. These genes were also induced in blood cells of human individuals that were naturally pre-exposed to bites of <italic>Lutzomyia intermedia</italic> sand flies. Interestingly, subsequent infection with <italic>Leishmania braziliensis</italic> blocked the induction of these genes in mice. These data show that the induction of potentially protective genes by insect saliva can be altered by the infecting parasite. This should be considered when including salivary components in a vaccine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> protozoan parasites induce a broad spectrum of disease including cutaneous lesions and visceral leishmaniasis the latter being fatal if not treated. <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> parasites can be transmitted by <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> sand flies in Central and South America where they are the leading cause of American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. During a blood meal, the host is exposed to a variety of sand fly factors. Sand fly saliva contains many pharmacological agents aimed at obtaining the optimal amount of blood for nutrition, egg development and survival. In addition, the proteophosphoglycan gel which is synthesized by the parasites inside the fly midgut can exacerbate cutaneous leishmaniasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Andrade1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Rogers1">[2]</xref>. Individuals living in an endemic region are bitten by both uninfected and infected sand flies, and thus are repeatedly being exposed to sand fly saliva, leading progressively to the induction of an immune response to saliva. In Brazil, <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> is the predominant sand fly species harboring <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Rangel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Rangel2">[4]</xref> and in Corte de Pedra, Bahia, the endemic area studied in this report, both <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> and <italic>Lu. whitmani</italic> sand fly species exist sympatrically with fluctuations reported for these populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Miranda1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The role of sand fly salivary factors is also important in the establishment of infection and thus the outcome of disease. Salivary factors include mediators that circumvent the host's hemostatic responses by preventing blood clotting, vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation for optimal feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Andrade2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Bates1">[7]</xref>. Sand fly saliva is immunogenic and the immune response to salivary antigens modulates the microenvironment at the site of the bite with an impact on the development of disease. Co-inoculation of <italic>L. major</italic> parasites and sand fly salivary gland sonicate (SGS) from either <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> or <italic>Lutzomyia longipalpis</italic> leads to increased lesion sizes and parasite numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Belkaid1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Titus1">[9]</xref>. In contrast, several studies demonstrated that pre-immunization with <italic>P. papatasi</italic> SGS, individual components of SGS, or even uninfected sand fly bites followed by infection with <italic>L. major</italic> resulted in protection characterized by decreased lesion sizes and parasite numbers compared to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Belkaid1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Kamhawi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Valenzuela1">[11]</xref>. These studies suggest that the immune response associated with sand fly SGS may be detrimental to the establishment of <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection and salivary molecules may be included in the design of a vaccine against leishmaniasis.</p>
<p>In contrast, pre-exposure to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS surprisingly leads to enhanced disease development after infection with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>. The exacerbated disease in these mice was associated with increased parasite burdens and low IFNγ/IL-4 ratios <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>. Pre-sensitization to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS induced cell recruitment, an anti-SGS antibody response and a cell-mediated immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura2">[13]</xref>. To understand the parameters involved in the increased lesion development at the site of <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> inoculation in mice pre-exposed to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS, we examined gene expression in the skin after repeated SGS inoculations. We wanted to understand the mechanisms by which <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS modulates the microenvironment and how it may enhance susceptibility to <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> infection. The genes that were most induced in mice were further analyzed in SGS-stimulated PBMCs of healthy individuals naturally pre-exposed to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> sand fly bites.</p>

For microarray analysis RNA was harvested from ears 2 weeks post inoculation and for each sample condition, three independent sets of 200 ng of total RNA were isolated and used as a template for probe generation using an Ambion WT expression kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the cDNA was fragmented and labeled with WT DNA terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Biotinylated sense strand fragments were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST GeneChips using the Hybridization Control and Hybridization Wash and Stain kits at 45°C for 18 h. The stained array was scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G to generate the CEL files. The chip data were imported with Partek Genomics Suite 6.5 (Partek, Inc., St. Louis, MO), normalized and summarized using the RMA (Robust Multiarray Average) algorithm. The relative log expression was examined to ensure that the data were properly corrected by normalization and that there were no outliers. Scatter plots were generated using Matlab 2012a (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and DataGraph 3.0 (Visual Data Tools Inc., Chapel Hill, NC).

<p>Repeated pre-exposure of BALB/c mice to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS enhances susceptibility to <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> infection with a lesion beginning at 3 weeks post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>) in line with previously published results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>. Thus, we wanted to determine if differences in cellular recruitment due to pre-immunization with <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS prior to infection could explain the differences in disease status. Therefore, mice were repeatedly pre-immunized with SGS or inoculated with PBS and both groups were challenged with SGS in the contralateral ear. We examined the cellular infiltrate of the ear two weeks after SGS challenge, when the adaptive immune response is ongoing and the parasite has typically already established infection, despite a lack of detectable differences in lesion size. At this point, no significant differences were observed in the total number of cells, or the numbers of neutrophils, macrophages or DCs in the ears of mice pre-immunized with SGS compared to those inoculated with PBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002627.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<p>As a result, we hypothesized that alterations in gene expression in response to repeated exposures to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS may be modulating the local skin microenvironment, impacting the innate and adaptive immune responses and thus the outcome of disease. To examine the effect of SGS pre-immunization at the inoculation site, we carried out a microarray analysis in mice that were pre-immunized with SGS or inoculated with PBS and later challenged with SGS in the opposing ear dermis. The ear pinna was processed and analyzed two weeks after the last SGS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, there were few differences in the global gene expression patterns between mice that were repeatedly pre-exposed to SGS and challenged with SGS compared to those inoculated with PBS and challenged with SGS. However, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that 95 genes were increased and 60 genes were decreased in response to SGS pre-immunization compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g001">Fig. 1D and 1E</xref>). Of the 155 transcripts modulated by SGS pre-immunization, only 49 transcripts have been annotated, or ascribed to a specific gene, and the rest are classified as hypothetical or unknown. Despite the majority of these genes being classified as hypothetical or unknown, many of the transcripts that were differentially expressed in response to SGS pre-sensitization are known to play a role in immune processes like antigen presentation and signaling as well as transcripts encoding for cytokines, chemokines and their receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 49 annotated genes differentially regulated with SGS pre-immunization, the microarray analysis revealed all but one of these annotated genes was increased upon SGS challenge in mice pre-immunized with SGS compared to those inoculated with PBS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002627-t001">Table 1</xref>). Of the 49 annotated genes, 4 transcripts had greater than 2-fold expression in SGS pre-exposed mice compared to controls; the gene most highly expressed in SGS pre-immunized mice compared to PBS-inoculated animals was CXCL9. Mpeg1, a transcript indicative of macrophage presence, as well as IL-1rl1 and TLR13 which are members of the toll-like superfamily of receptors, were also significantly elevated in response to SGS challenge in SGS pre-exposed mice compared to controls. The microarray results revealed an especially high frequency (14.3% of the annotated genes) of genes induced in response to SGS pre-immunization to be IFN-inducible genes including immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Santiago1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Howard1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<p>Given the surprisingly large proportion of the modulation of IFN-inducible genes in mice pre-immunized with SGS compared to control mice, we carried out real-time qPCR for IFN-inducible genes as well as genes associated with IFN-induced responses on a biological replicate experiment to confirm the findings of the microarray analysis. Cells from mice pre-sensitized with SGS and challenged with SGS had a higher expression of Ifit1, Irgm1 and Irgm2 compared to mice inoculated with PBS and challenged with SGS. Of note, despite these differences, challenge with SGS in mice pre-immunized or not with SGS had a higher expression of these genes compared to naïve mice, suggesting SGS inoculation alone can already induce this gene family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, pre-immunization with SGS also led to an increased expression of Stat1, a signaling molecule responsible for the subsequent expression of IFN-inducible genes. CXCL9, a chemokine involved in T cell migration induced by IFNγ, was also expressed at higher levels in SGS pre-exposed mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

Following PBMC isolation, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS followed by mRNA isolation.

Similarly, supernatants from PBMCs of individuals living in an endemic area stimulated with SGS also produced significantly more CXCL9 protein as measured by ELISA compared to controls (data not shown).

<p>Here, we show that SGS pre-immunization induces the expression of IFN-inducible genes, which are typically associated with a protective response as Irgm1<sup>−/−</sup> animals are highly susceptible to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection (mentioned as data not shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Taylor1">[21]</xref>).

To evaluate the effect of the parasite on the local immune response induced by pre-immunization with SGS, mice were repeatedly pre-exposed to SGS or PBS and challenged with SGS in the presence or absence of <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> parasites. Gene expression profiling studies were carried out 2 weeks later. Mice that were pre-sensitized with SGS and challenged with SGS alone significantly upregulated the expression of Ifit1, Irgm1, Irgm2, Stat1 and CXCL9 compared to PBS pre-inoculated mice in line with our microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many studies have suggested the anti-saliva response against sand fly species such as <italic>P. papatasi</italic> or <italic>L. longipalpis</italic> is detrimental for the establishment of <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. In contrast, the <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> anti-saliva response does not prevent the development of disease, but rather may modulate the outcome of infection. Studies in a mouse experimental model have demonstrated that <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> infection alone induces a strong Th1 cell immune response with high levels of IFNγ and elevated numbers of IFNγ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the dLN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deSouzaNeto1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Rocha1">[34]</xref>. The strong protective immune response characterized by the presence of IFNγ was thought to correlate with the strong resistance to <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Rocha1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Samuelson1">[39]</xref>. Here, we show that repeated pre-immunizations with <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS alters the skin microenvironment and induces the expression of a variety of genes involved in the immune response, especially from the family of IFN-inducible genes. Genomic analysis of the skin of mice pre-immunized with SGS reveals an inflammatory setting with an increase in genes involved in immune responses including antigen presentation and cell signaling. Genes associated with Th1 cell immune responses such a CXCL9, a chemokine typically linked with the recruitment of Th1 cells, exhibited the greatest fold induction at &gt;5 times over control mice. The IL-7R, also known to influence the Th1 cell immune response, was also elevated following SGS pre-exposure (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Colpitts1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Groom1">[42]</xref>). Of note, cytokines typically associated with a Th2 cell immune response such as Chi3l1 (Ym1), or regulatory cytokines such as IL-10Rα were also detected at higher levels in SGS pre-immunized mice.</p>
<p>In the periphery IFNγ binds to its receptor and initiates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus which induces the transcription of more than 2000 genes including effector molecules that suppress the growth and survival of intracellular pathogens (Phox, iNOS, IDO, NRAMP1, GTPases, Ifits and chemokines) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Taylor1">[21]</xref>. Remarkably, several IFN-inducible genes as well as the IFN signaling molecule, STAT1, were upregulated at the site <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> challenge in mice that were pre-exposed through immunization. For example, p47 GTPases such as Irgm1 (formerly Lrg47) and Irgm2 (Gtpi) and p65 GTPases such as GBP6 and GBP8 were expressed at high levels in pre-immunized mice.</p>
<p>Interestingly, IFN-inducible genes were similarly induced in SGS-stimulated PBMCs isolated from humans living in an area endemic for <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> with active <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> sand fly transmission. It was not possible to perform skin biopsy in the human population studied due to ethical considerations; however, the expression of IFN-inducible genes in SGS-stimulated blood cells of individuals naturally exposed to sand fly bites was similar to that observed at the site of SGS challenge in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the induction of IFN-inducible genes by SGS is also occurring in humans.</p>
<p>To our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating an induction in the expression of IFN-inducible GTPases in response to vector saliva. These products have been well characterized for their role in host defense against viruses but they also contribute to resistance against protozoans. Mice deficient for either Irgm1 or many of the other GTPases are highly susceptible to infection with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, and many mimic the dramatic susceptibility phenotypes seen in IFNγR-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Taylor1">[21]</xref>. It should be noted that IFN-inducible genes are turned on in response to IFNγ but type I IFNs may also contribute, although to a lesser degree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Taylor1">[21]</xref>. In our analysis neither IFNγ or type I IFNs were elevated in cells from mice pre-sensitized with SGS but this may be a reflection of the time point analyzed (14 days post inoculation).</p>
<p>In this study mice were immunized with SGS to mimic one of the features of natural transmission of <italic>Leishmania</italic> where individuals are pre-exposed to several sand fly bites prior to deposition of parasites by the sand fly. A high dose of <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> promastigotes was co-inoculated in mice with SGS in an attempt to reproduce the cell recruitment rapidly observed at the site of infection after a sand fly bite. However, it is important to note that upon a blood meal, the sand fly is inoculating fewer parasites and also regurgitating many other factors including metacyclic promastigotes embedded in a proteophosphoglycan gel in a blood pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Rogers1">[2]</xref>. These factors are not all present during needle inoculation of the parasites and SGS. It is clear that further studies using natural sand fly infection will be required for a better understanding of the transmission dynamics during <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Repeated exposures to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS followed by challenge with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> parasites in the presence of SGS leads to an enhanced disease compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002627-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>). Interestingly, in this prior study the SGS pre-immunized mice challenged with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> plus SGS, and analyzed two weeks later had a lower parasite load compared to mice not immunized with SGS, suggesting a transient protection conferred by SGS pre-immunization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>. However, the trend was inversed from 3 weeks on and the SGS-immunized group showed increased lesion size and parasite load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>. Additionally, the mice pre-immunized with SGS and subsequently infected with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> plus SGS had lower levels of IFNγ to IL-4 ratios compared to mice inoculated with PBS and infected with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> plus SGS at 2 weeks post infection. Thus, in that study, the highest levels of IFNγ were not associated with the decreased parasite numbers <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting IFNγ is not the major factor contributing to parasite killing by macrophages at this time point. In our study, increased expression of IFN-inducible genes and of IFNγ was also not detected in the microarray performed in SGS pre-immunized mice 2 weeks post co-inoculation of <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> and SGS compared to PBS controls challenged with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> plus SGS. In this and the previous study, the levels of IFNγ upon challenge with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> and SGS were not elevated following SGS pre-immunization. Thus other factors may be involved in the transient control of parasite load observed by de Moura and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, higher concentrations of IFNγ are required for optimal parasite killing of <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> compared to <italic>L. major</italic> suggesting differences in the susceptibilities to IFNγ-mediated killing between different parasite strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Weinkopff1">[15]</xref>. Nevertheless, following <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> and SGS co-inoculation, both studies showed increased inflammatory lesions in the group pre-immunized with SGS compared to that injected with PBS.</p>
<p>This increase in disease severity to <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> infection in SGS pre-immunized mice, corresponds to a silencing of many of the genes turned on by SGS pre-sensitization, including IFN-inducible genes. This suggests that the parasite is actively modulating the host's immune response to the SGS. Interestingly, this observation is consistent with previous findings showing a decreased ratio of IFNγ/IL-4 production in the dLNs of mice pre-exposed to SGS and challenged with parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura1">[12]</xref>. In the same line, the same group further reported that challenge with <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> plus SGS after SGS pre-immunization also silenced CXCL10, another IFN-inducible gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-deMoura2">[13]</xref>. Despite differences in the methodology used between these studies (air pouch model in the former studies and needle inoculation in the ear pinna in the current study), the outcomes are going in the same direction. In addition, the impact of SGS on the skin microbiome which was shown to influence skin immunity may also contribute to the phenotype observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Naik1">[43]</xref>. We show here that there is an obvious benefit for the parasite to down-modulate the IRG system expressed in response to SGS pre-exposure to allow for parasite establishment. However, modulation of IFN-inducible genes is most likely not the only mechanism for enhancing disease. It is unclear how the parasite is altering the host's response to the SGS in the present study and this will require further investigation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that in both humans and mice, an array of IFN-inducible genes were up-regulated in response to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS pre-exposure. Interestingly, these genes were silenced when the parasite was present during the challenge. Given the marked changes in the skin microenvironment resulting from repeated exposures to <italic>Lu. intermedia</italic> SGS, and the different outcomes to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, understanding the relationship between pathogens and their homologous vectors is essential. Since SGS proteins from different sand fly species can either exacerbate or protect from disease, subsequent studies will aim to understand how the parasite is modulating SGS impact on the microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002627-Oliveira1">[44]</xref>. This will help determine risk factors for disease development, markers of exposure and defining potential vaccine candidates.</p>
