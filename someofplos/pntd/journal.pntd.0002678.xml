<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has traditionally been used as a model for studying nematode biology, but its small size limits the ability for researchers to perform some experiments such as high-throughput tissue-specific gene expression studies. However, the dissection of individual tissues is possible in the parasitic nematode <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> due to its relatively large size. Here, we take advantage of the recent genome sequencing of <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> and the ability to physically dissect its separate tissues to produce a wide-scale tissue-specific nematode RNA-seq datasets, including data on three non-reproductive tissues (head, pharynx, and intestine) in both male and female worms, as well as four reproductive tissues (testis, seminal vesicle, ovary, and uterus). We obtained fundamental information about the biology of diverse cell types and potential interactions among tissues within this multicellular organism.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Overexpression and functional enrichment analyses identified many putative biological functions enriched in each tissue studied, including functions which have not been previously studied in detail in nematodes. Putative tissue-specific transcriptional factors and corresponding binding motifs that regulate expression in each tissue were identified, including the intestine-enriched ELT-2 motif/transcription factor previously described in nematode intestines. Constitutively expressed and novel genes were also characterized, with the largest number of novel genes found to be overexpressed in the testis. Finally, a putative acetylcholine-mediated transcriptional network connecting biological activity in the head to the male reproductive system is described using co-expression networks, along with a similar ecdysone-mediated system in the female.</p>

<p>Tissue-specific gene expression provides fundamental information about the biology of diverse cell types within an organism and interactions among tissues within multicellular organisms.

Here, we build significantly on the previous tissue-specific gene expression research in <italic>A. suum</italic> by producing the first nematode RNA-seq dataset that spans multiple specific tissues, including three non-reproductive and two reproductive tissues in both male and female <italic>A. suum</italic> worms. This analysis provides significant details on the biological functions occurring within each of these tissues, which has not been previously explored. It also provides insight into specific gene regulation pathways active in each of the tissues, which have broad applicability across other nematodes, including both non-parasitic and parasitic species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene expression profiling is fundamental to understanding organismal biology, development and underlying functions at a specific time or under specific conditions. Tissue-specific gene expression provides fundamental information about the biology of diverse cell types within an organism and interactions among tissues within multicellular organisms. Molecular knowledge based on stage- and/or tissue-specific gene expression profiles in model organisms is explored to understand many aspects of complex diseases, and in parasitic helminths is explored to identify the properties/functions of tissues that may serve as targets for treatments and control measures. However, such studies (especially high-throughput tissue-specific gene expression studies) are experimentally challenging in smaller organisms, such as many nematodes species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Chikina1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>The phylum Nematoda is composed of the most abundant and diverse species of all animal phyla, with an estimated million species that are found in almost every environment including extremes such as hot springs and polar ice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Coghlan1">[2]</xref>. Members of this phylum are free-living or parasitic, and include one of the most well-studied model organisms, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Of the ∼28,000 described nematode species, ∼16,000 are parasitic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Hugot1">[3]</xref>. Infections by parasitic nematodes cause extensive suffering in humans, animals, and plants, as well as major losses in agricultural production due to disease and the cost of implementing control programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jasmer1">[4]</xref>. Calculations of the aggregate burden of human nematode diseases in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) indicate a tremendous global impact of these pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Hotez1">[5]</xref>. Research progress on anthelmintic discovery and immunological control of parasitic nematode infections has been impeded by the biological complexity of nematodes and their interactions with the host.</p>
<p>Extensive and high-quality genomic databases are available for <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Yook1">[6]</xref> and are also emerging for parasitic nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Martin1">[7]</xref>, providing a welcome infusion of information that opens valuable new avenues for progress in nematode research. This information has been used to produce stage-specific high-throughput gene expression experiments for nematode species using conventional expressed sequence tags (ESTs), next-generation sequencing (454/Roche, Illumina) or microarrays (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Allen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Mitreva1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Stoltzfus1">[11]</xref>), providing many novel insights into nematode biology. The elucidation of gene repertoires expressed by specific tissues of nematodes can further facilitate the development of broader and deeper insights into individual tissue functions, with applications to parasitic and non-parasitic nematodes alike. At the comparative level, information of this kind will aid in understanding of both conserved and divergent aspects of nematode biology, while also enhancing the value of model organisms, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in biomedical research. However, due to the small size of nematodes, it is not possible to accurately dissect enough tissue in most of these species to run high-throughput gene expression, proteomics or cellular biochemical experiments at the individual, isolated tissue level. Bioinformatic-based predictions of tissue-specific high-throughput gene expression have been inferred based on whole-organism, stage-specific <italic>C. elegans</italic> microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Chikina1">[1]</xref>, but these computational tissue-specific expression predictions still await experimental confirmation and are not useful in identifying genes relevant to host-parasite interactions, since <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a free-living species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Geary1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this context, <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> (the large roundworm of swine) is of particular interest as a model parasitic nematode. The <italic>A. suum</italic> genome has recently been sequenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jex1">[13]</xref>, and this parasite serves as a research model for its close relative, <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>, which is responsible for widespread disease infecting over one billion people worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Dold1">[14]</xref>. The large size of <italic>A. suum</italic> relative to other nematodes (adults can reach up to 40 cm in length) allows for accurate dissection of individual tissues and organs that is not possible in smaller nematodes. Previous studies have analyzed expression from a single tissue in <italic>A. suum</italic> using conventional ESTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Yin1">[15]</xref> and then multiple tissues using microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>. The multiple tissue study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>, while providing insight on many biological functions of tissues investigated, was based on ∼40,000 60-mer (40-k array) elements derived from genes predicted from low coverage of the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome, resulting in multiple elements representing a single gene or genes not being represented in the partial genome. Indeed, when the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome became available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jex1">[13]</xref> the 40-k array elements was shown to cover just 58% of the predicted <italic>A. suum</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>. This limitation has made it challenging to identify exact genes contributing to the expression patterns, and did not take advantage of the wide range of functional information that can be annotated using full-length gene sequences, or the high expression-level accuracy that can be provided with RNA-seq analysis. Here, we build significantly on the previous tissue-specific gene expression research in <italic>A. suum</italic>, by producing the first nematode RNA-seq dataset that spans multiple specific tissues, including three non-reproductive and two reproductive tissues in both male and female <italic>A. suum</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The analysis presented here provides additional annotation to the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome, through i) tissue-specific gene expression profiling, ii) detailed Gene Ontology-based functional enrichment for each tissue, iii) delineation of putative cis and trans regulatory elements involved in regulating expression in the specific tissues investigated and iv) co-expression networks, which identified putative genes that link molecular pathways across different tissues. The 10-tissue specific expression profiles (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002678.s004">Table S1</xref>; Also available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nematode.net" xlink:type="simple">www.nematode.net</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Martin1">[7]</xref>) and the analysis presented here provide valuable resources for studying basic functional relationships in nematodes, including both non-parasitic and parasitic species.</p>

<title>Parasite material and RNA preparation</title>
<p>Adult worms were collected from infected pigs at an abattoir when being processed as part of the normal work of the abattoir. The fresh worm tissues, including three non-reproductive (head, pharynx, and intestine) tissues in both male and female worms, as well as two reproductive tissues per sex (testis, seminal vesicle, ovary and uterus) were dissected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent storage at −80°C. Note that while the term “tissue” is used to describe all of these samples for simplicity, they may be more accurately described as “organs” or “regions of the body” rather than pure tissues. For the non-reproductive “tissues”, the “head” is defined as the terminal anterior region of the worm anterior to the beginning of the muscular pharynx, the “pharynx” is defined as the anterior body region that extends from the anterior-most to posterior-most margins of the muscular pharynx, and the “intestine” is defined as posterior to the posterior-most margin of the muscular pharynx to the posterior-most limit of the intestine near the anus (female) or cloaca (male). In the male reproductive samples, the “testis” sample contained the entire male reproductive system distal to the seminal vesicle. The “seminal vesicle” itself is likely to contain sperm, spermatids and vesicle wall. For the female reproductive system, some eggs were present in the “uterus” tissue, and while they are relatively resistant to Trizol, some contribution of mRNA from eggs in the uterine preparation cannot be excluded. The “ovary” samples contained the female reproductive system distal to the oviduct.</p>
<p>Tissue homogenization and RNA extraction were performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen; according to the manufacturer's instruction) and a rotor/stator probe (Tissue Tearor Model 985270-395, BioSpec Products Inc), which was used to mix the samples for 15 second intervals until the samples were completely homogenized. The integrity and yield of the RNA was verified by the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Cedar Creek, Texas). Total RNA was treated with Ambion Turbo DNase (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX), and 1 ug of the DNAse-treated total RNA went through polyA selection via the MicroPoly(A) Purist Kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX). 1 ng of the mRNA isolated was used as the template for cDNA library construction using the Ovation RNA-Seq (version 2) kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (NuGEN Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA). Whole-worm male and female samples were prepared using the same protocol.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>RNA-seq library construction and sequencing</title>
<p>Non-normalized cDNA was used to construct Multiplexed Illumina paired end small fragment libraries according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA), with the following exceptions: 1) 1 ug of cDNA was sheared using a Covaris S220 DNA Sonicator (Covaris, INC. Woburn, MA) to a size range between 200–400 bp. 2) Four rounds of PCR amplifications were performed to enrich for proper adapter ligated fragments and properly index the libraries. 3) The final size selection of the library was achieved by an AMPure paramagnetic bead cleanup (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter Genomics, Beverly, MA), targeting 300–500 bp. The concentration of the library was accurately determined through qPCR according to the manufacturer's protocol (Kapa Biosystems, Inc, Woburn, MA) to produce cluster counts appropriate for the Illumina GAIIx platform. Multiple libraries were pooled together and loaded into one lane of a HiSeq2000 version 3 flow cell. 2×101 bp read pairs (later clipped to 100 bp using Consensus Assessment of Sequence and Variation [CASAVA, version 1.8]) were generated for each sample, generating ∼2 Gb per sample. Whole-worm male and female samples were sequenced using the same protocol (SRA Accession numbers SRR851237, SRR851252, SRR851258 and SRR869505).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Analytical processing of the reads and differential expression</title>
<p>Analytical processing of the Illumina 100 bp reads was performed using in-house scripts. DUST was used to filter out regions of low compositional complexity and to convert them into Ns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Morgulis1">[17]</xref>. An in-house script was used to remove Ns, which discards reads without at least 60 bases on non-N sequence.

Gene expression values were normalized using the depth of coverage per million reads (DCPM) per sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Hillier1">[20]</xref>. Stage-specific over-expression and under-expression for each gene with at least 50% breadth of coverage across all of the tissues was tested using SAMSeq (v4.0, released 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Li2">[21]</xref>). Genes with less than 50% breadth of read coverage of the gene sequence across all samples were excluded from the analysis. This algorithm was chosen because (i) it has been designed for multi-class testing among RNA-seq datasets (i.e. allows for more than pair-wise comparisons simultaneously, and can identify over-expression in multiple tissues), (ii) it has been shown to have low bias and false discovery rates relative to other differential expression algorithms for other RNA-seq datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Guo1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Xu1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Soneson1">[24]</xref>, and (iii) it has demonstrated effectiveness in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Li2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Kozubek1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Rapicavoli1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Ding1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Xu2">[28]</xref>. This algorithm identified approximately 69% of the expressed genes as being over-expressed in at least one of the tissues (with p≤0.05 confidence and a false discovery rate of 0.8%). Tissue-overexpression profiles for every gene were generated based on these results (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002678.s004">Table S1</xref>; Also available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nematode.net" xlink:type="simple">www.nematode.net</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Martin1">[7]</xref>).

<title>Binding motif enrichment and annotation</title>
<p>The identification of genes that are overexpressed in individual <italic>A. suum</italic> tissues facilitated the analysis of potential cis and trans regulatory elements responsible for this differential expression. 2000 bp upstream untranslated regions (UTRs) were extracted for each gene based on the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jex1">[13]</xref>. The 5′ end of 725 gene sequences (4% of the gene set) was less than 2000 bp from the end of a contig; these genes were not included the in motif enrichment testing. Motif enrichment was performed using a discriminative motif analysis algorithm (DREME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Bailey1">[38]</xref>, using an 8-nucleotide sequence search), where the 5′ UTRs of the genes overexpressed in a tissue were compared to the 5′ UTRs of the expressed genes not overexpressed in that tissue, in order to determine over-represented enriched motifs. FIMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Grant1">[39]</xref> was used to calculate the coordinates of motifs similar to the enriched motifs among all genes, and potential transcription factors binding the discovered motifs were identified using Tomtom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Gupta1">[40]</xref> (where transcription factors from the JASPAR CORE nematoda and vertebrata motif databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Bryne1">[41]</xref>, as well as the UniProbe motif database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Newburger1">[42]</xref> were considered for annotation).

<title>Gene co-expression network construction</title>
<p>Male and female gene co-expression networks were constructed to further explore the tissue-specific gene expression data. For the male network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), all genes overexpressed in at least one male tissue were considered for the network. For these genes, the Pearson correlation (based on the expression values across both replicates in all 10 tissues) between all gene pairs was calculated, and every gene pair with a correlation ≥0.90 was connected with an edge using Cytoscape software (version 3.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Smoot1">[45]</xref>. It should be noted that a previous study showed that a Pearson correlation-based gene co-expression network of over 22,000 genes constructed with only 14 samples was sufficient to identify the same functional modules as a much larger dataset, so the 20 samples used here are thought to be sufficient to find biologically meaningful modules and subnetworks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Mao1">[46]</xref>. The male network contained 4,784 genes with 1,387,028 edges. The default “prefuse force-directed” layout was used with the “spring length” variable set to 100 in order to avoid overlapping of unconnected subnetworks. The positions of four nodes in the long vertical bridges of this network were manually repositioned in order to better display the connectivity without overlaps. Genes were colored according to the tissue in which they were overexpressed; if a gene was overexpressed in more than one tissue, the tissue with the highest expression level was chosen for the color coding. The same approach and settings were used to construct the female gene co-expression network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), and this network contained 7,741 genes with 1,188,989 edges.

<title>RNA-seq analysis of 10 tissues dissected from adult male and female <italic>A. suum</italic></title>
<p>RNA-seq analysis was performed in duplicate on three non-reproductive (head, pharynx, and intestine) tissues in both male and female worms, as well as two reproductive tissues per sex (testis, seminal vesicle, ovary and uterus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). Across the 20 RNA-seq samples (2 replicates from 10 different tissues), 348 million reads were generated, and 199 million reads mapped to the 18,542 genes of the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jex1">[13]</xref>. The number of reads mapped in individual tissues ranged from 6 million (in the second uterine replicate) to 16 million (in the second male intestinal replicate; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002678-t001">Table 1</xref>). The average Pearson correlation for expression values of all expressed genes between replicates was 0.90, while the average correlation between samples from different tissues was 0.24 (based on all pair-wise comparisons between tissues). The lowest correlation among replicates was between the replicates of the female pharynx (0.61), and may reflect the relative difficulty of the dissection procedure for this particular tissue (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). A total of 16,854 genes (91% of the complete <italic>A. suum</italic> geneset) had ≥50% breadth of coverage (ie, ≥50% of the gene sequence was covered with at least one read from any of the samples), and this final set of expressed genes was used in the subsequent differential expression analysis, which identified 11,690 genes (63% of all expressed genes) as being significantly overexpressed in at least one tissue. The male and female samples had relatively consistent gene expression profiles in the head, pharynx and intestinal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The tissue with the most distinct gene expression profiles was the testis, which had a low similarity (Spearman correlation of 0.26) compared to the other tissues. However, the similarity between the two testis replicates based on the same statistics was over 0.90 (data not shown), indicating that this large difference is not due to inter-replicate variability.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous microarray-based study of <italic>A. suum</italic> tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>, genes with high similarity to <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes were found to be more enriched among overexpressed genes in all tissues except for the testis and pharynx (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002678-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the previous study, similarity was measured by the identification of PANTHER domains among the genes, which may have biased the identification towards genes with known functions rather than genes with similarity to other species. Also, unlike the previous microarray-based study of <italic>A. suum</italic> tissue-specific expression which found substantial differences between genders in terms of expression profiles in non-reproductive tissues (particularly the intestine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>, we observed strong agreement between the gene expression profiles for the male and female intestine and pharynx (Spearman r = 0.93 and 0.94, respectively), but observed a higher disparity for the head (r = 0.79). While this difference may be biological in nature, it may be accounted for by the higher accuracy of the expression data here, provided both by RNA-seq (as opposed to microarray) and the higher-quality gene set provided by the recent genome publication (which was not available when the microarray study was performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>). The current study focuses primarily on tissue-specific differences among these tissues rather than on the gender differences.</p>
<p>Separate whole-worm male and female <italic>A. suum</italic> RNA-seq samples were also generated as a comparison to these tissue-specific samples. In the whole-worm male sample (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002678.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>), 15,604 genes were detected (<italic>see</italic> methods for criteria), and in the combined tissue-specific male samples, 15,941 genes were detected, including 863 which were not detected in the whole-worm samples. Among those 863, more than half (52%) had their highest expression in either the head or pharynx (compared to 34% in the entire tissue dataset). Likewise, in the female comparison (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002678.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), 45% of the 1,655 genes detected only in the tissue-specific dataset were most highly expressed in the head or pharynx, compared to 31% across all of the genes expressed in the tissue samples (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002678.s004">Table S1</xref>). Thus, the whole-worm samples more often failed to capture the expression of genes which are most actively expressed in the head and pharynx, which highlights the importance of the production of these tissue-specific datasets.</p>

<p>The most enriched term in the head of <italic>A. suum</italic> (including the circular three-lipped mouth, the outer cuticle layer, amphids, some muscle tissue, and internal structures consisting primarily of neurons) was “structural constituent of cuticle” (GO:0042302).

Additionally, many of the GO terms exclusive to the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) are linked to neuronal activity, including ten terms related to ion channel/transport activity (related to synaptic transmission and action potential depolarization in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Collingridge1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Li3">[48]</xref>), which were not previously identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>. “Arylesterase activity” (GO:0004064) was also enriched, which is of interest because arylesterase is negatively correlated with inflammation in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Senturk1">[49]</xref>, and was found to be significantly decreased in the serum of rats infected with the nematode <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Farid1">[50]</xref>.

The previous microarray-based study found no significant functional enrichment for the pharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>, but here we have identified twelve enriched terms. This difference is likely due to an improved dataset resulting in more comprehensive coverage of the genome, as well as the recent improvement of the genome itself. Five child terms of “catalytic activity” (GO:0003824) were found to be significantly enriched in the pharynx (including two which were also enriched in the intestine). Necepsins have nematode-specific characteristics and are able to hydrolyse host proteins including hemoglobin and serum proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Williamson1">[54]</xref>, and eight out of the nine genes annotated as necepsins (according to NCBI RefSeq database search results provided in the genome publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jex1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Pruitt1">[55]</xref>) were also annotated with “aspartic-type endopeptidase activity” (GO:0004190, enriched in the pharynx; p = 8×10<sup>−4</sup>).</p>
<p>Nearly half (46%) of the <italic>A. suum</italic> intestinal transcripts conserved with <italic>H. contortus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Yin2">[56]</xref> were identified in our <italic>A. suum</italic> intestinal genes, representing 395 unique intestinal genes (enriched for overexpression in the intestine, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>). Here, a total of 31 GO terms were significantly enriched in the intestinal tissue, including nine ‘Molecular Function’ child terms of “hydrolase activity” (GO:0016787) (including “cysteine-type endopeptidase activity”, a category previously identified in the <italic>A. suum</italic> intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>) and eleven terms related to transport of protons, lipids and amino acids.</p>

<title>Functional enrichment in reproductive tissues</title>
<p>The testis in <italic>A. suum</italic> is the best characterized of the four reproductive tissues analyzed in this study.

Although not found in the previous microarray-based study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>, the presence of high phosphatase activity in the testis is supported here by the enrichment of the MF GO term “protein tyrosine phosphatase activity” (GO:0004725), and the presence of high kinase activity is supported by the enrichment of six different terms describing kinase activity. Five <italic>A. suum</italic> major-sperm protein (MSP) domain-containing proteins were previously found to be active in the testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Tarr1">[57]</xref>; The <italic>A. suum</italic> genes with the highest sequence similarity to each of these MSP genes was found via a BLAST search <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Altschul1">[43]</xref>, and all five were over-expressed in the testis in this analysis (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002678.s008">Table S5</xref>). Also, previously, a serine protease inhibitor expressed in the <italic>A. suum</italic> testis (As_SRP-1) was found to be critical for cytoskeleton assembly and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Zhao1">[59]</xref>; The <italic>A. suum</italic> gene with the highest similarity to <italic>As_SRP-1</italic> (<italic>GS_04617</italic>) was very highly overexpressed in the testis (with the 6<sup>th</sup> highest average expression value of all the genes in the testis).</p>
<p>Unlike the testis, the broad molecular activity in the ovary, seminal vesicle and uterus of <italic>A. suum</italic> have not been previously studied outside of the previous microarray study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>. However, a number of studies have identified many genes responsible for different stages of embryo and oocyte development in the ovary of <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Piano1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Reinke1">[61]</xref>, including a study which estimated that more than 2,600 genes are responsible for these processes alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Fernandez1">[62]</xref>. Here, more genes were overexpressed in the <italic>A. suum</italic> ovary than in any other tissue (5,446; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The top five enriched GO terms (and fourteen total terms) were directly related to DNA binding and replication, including “mitosis” (GO:0007067; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), consistent with an RNA-seq dataset produced from the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Jex1">[13]</xref>, and demonstrating that our approach is identifying the expected biological functions in the ovary. Two BP GO terms related to phosphatidylinositol signalling were also enriched in the ovary, which supports previous literature suggesting that at least one of these signalling pathways (the <italic>ppk-1</italic> pathway) is necessary for ovulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Xu3">[63]</xref>. Also, two terms related to chitin binding were found to be enriched among ovary-overexpressed genes, consistent with findings in the previous microarray study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Like with the ovary, very little is known about the specific molecular functional activity of the seminal vesicle in <italic>A. suum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Wang1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Zhao2">[64]</xref>, and genes overexpressed in this tissue (and the uterus) were enriched for sharing high sequence similarity (based on reciprocal BLAST hits) to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (p = 1×10<sup>−5</sup>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, seminal fluid has been shown to modulate sperm function, promote sperm viability and initiate physiological changes in the female uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Shakes1">[65]</xref>. Actin and cytoskeleton activity have been shown to be critically important for nematode sperm motility and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Roberts1">[66]</xref>, consequently it is possible that the high enrichment of the MF GO terms “protein binding” (GO:0005515) and “actin binding” (GO:0003779) in the seminal vesicle is due to the overexpression of several genes responsible for binding spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, “fucosyltransferase activity” (GO:0008417) was found to be enriched in the seminal vesicle, a function which has also been found in the seminal fluid of mammals and implicated in fertility via the removal of fertility-inhibiting fucose-containing molecules on the sperm surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Alhadeff1">[67]</xref>, but this observation has not been previously reported in the literature for nematodes.</p>
<p>The <italic>A. suum</italic> uterus is the site of fertilization and egg development, and as with the ovary and seminal vesicle, <italic>A. suum</italic>-specific studies of the uterus have focused on morphology rather than detailed functional analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Li4">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Lysek1">[69]</xref>.

<p>Highly and significantly enriched (p≤10<sup>−5</sup>) Interpro domains among genes in each of the tissues studied are shown in Supporting Figures S2 and S3.

<title>Tissue-specific transcription factor binding site enrichment</title>
<p>The identification of genes that are preferentially or exclusively expressed in individual <italic>A. suum</italic> tissues facilitated the analysis of potential cis and trans regulatory elements responsible for this differential expression.

<p>The binding motif “<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ADTTCGC</named-content>” was the most significantly enriched out of three motifs enriched among genes overexpressed in the <italic>A. suum</italic> head, and matched MAB-3-like (“Male Abnormal 3”), which has been previously described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Gupta1">[40]</xref>.

<p>Only one binding motif (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CATACAYA</named-content>) was found to be significantly enriched among genes overexpressed in the <italic>A. suum</italic> pharynx.

<p>The most significant binding motif found among genes overexpressed in the <italic>A. suum</italic> intestine (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTTATCAR</named-content>) matches the reverse complement binding sequence of ELT-2 (TGATAA), the predominant transcription factor controlling differentiation and function of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-McGhee1">[74]</xref> as well as the GATA-like intestine-enriched motif previously reported in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCTTATC</named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Chikina1">[1]</xref>.

<p>A total of 12 predicted binding motifs were enriched among genes overexpressed in the <italic>A. suum</italic> ovary, which may be due to the expression of early-stage developmental genes which are not present in other tissues. This idea is supported by the annotation of the most highly enriched binding motif (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GGGGGDK</named-content>), which matches the ZFP281 (“zinc finger protein 281”) transcription factor binding site in <italic>M. musculus</italic>.

<p>Finally, the motif “<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CSCCACW</named-content>” (which matches the <italic>M. musculus</italic> SMAD3 binding motif) was one of two significantly enriched in the <italic>A. suum</italic> uterus.

<p>These results on binding motif enrichment suggests existence of tissue-specific co-expressed genes that are under similar transcriptional control, and identifies their putative transcription factors in <italic>A. suum</italic>, most of which have putative orthologues that have been previously described in the literature. Several examples provide very promising targets for further study to identify specific mechanisms governing tissue-specific gene expression in adult <italic>A. suum</italic>. The similarities to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a distant nematode relative to <italic>A. suum</italic>, indicate that findings reported here should have broad applicability to species across the phylum Nematoda.

<p>Like in the male network, the female co-expression network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) arranged in a pattern similar to its body plan layout, with the pharynx bridging the head and intestine and the reproductive tissues largely separated. However, in the female, the subnetwork connecting the head and ovary networks is very dense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002678-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), involving a large set of co-expressed genes. One of the head-overexpressed genes central to this head-ovary bridge network (<italic>GS_05636</italic>) was annotated as an “ecdysone receptor” (K14034). This was the only gene in the current <italic>A. suum</italic> genome annotated to this KEGG category, and is important because in the parasitic nematode <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>, ecdysteroid signalling has been found to play a role in molting and fertility, but the mechanism behind these relationships is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002678-Tzertzinis1">[94]</xref>. Similar to the story for the male subnetwork, this gene bridges a gap between reproductive and non-reproductive networks (as evidenced by the its first-neighbor co-expression pairs which include both head-overexpressed and ovary-overexpressed genes), and may be an interesting target for further study in order to elucidate signal transduction pathways and design drug targets for eliminating <italic>A. suum</italic> fertility. Although the co-expression networks were segregated by gender here, the pathways described are not necessarily restricted to only one gender.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The functional enrichment results across different <italic>A. suum</italic> tissues present many confirmations of existing knowledge in nematode tissues, as well as many suggestions of novel functions which are interesting subjects for further study. This analysis indicates that the <italic>A. suum</italic> pharynx may be actively involved in digestive processes and it provided functional descriptions of the <italic>A. suum</italic> seminal vesicle, ovary and uterus, which have not been previously studied in this detail. Constitutively expressed and novel genes were also characterized, and putative tissue-specific transcriptional factors and corresponding binding motifs were deduced stemming from results of the tissue expression analysis, which included the intestine-enriched ELT-2 motif/transcription factor previously described in nematode intestines. Also, the gene co-expression networks constructed here present several possible novel molecular signalling pathways between non-reproductive and reproductive tissues, and provide a resource for quickly identifying genes co-expressed between different tissues. As the <italic>A. suum</italic> genome is better annotated and specific pathways are more carefully identified, additional subnetworks of interest could be identified in these networks.</p>
<p>The analyses in this paper present several approaches for mining data from this rich RNA-seq analysis of 10 different <italic>A. suum</italic> tissues. Hence, the dataset, co-expression relationship and transcriptional regulation that were derived from it provide a valuable resource for studying tissue-specific biological activity in nematodes. In addition, the annotation data, gene expression data and overexpressed gene lists in each tissue (Supp. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002678-t001">Table 1</xref>; also deposited into <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nematode.net" xlink:type="simple">www.nematode.net</ext-link>, enabling readers to perform advanced searches) provide valuable resources for building future tissue-specific analyses for helping with drug and vaccine design directed against parasitic nematodes.</p>
