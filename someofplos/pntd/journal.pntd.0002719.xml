<abstract>
<p>Mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus from the genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, family Togaviridae, which causes fever, rash and severe persistent polyarthralgia in humans. Since there are currently no FDA licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for CHIKV, the development of vaccine candidates is of critical importance. Historically, live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) for protection against arthropod-borne viruses have been created by blind cell culture passage leading to attenuation of disease, while maintaining immunogenicity. Attenuation may occur <italic>via</italic> multiple mechanisms. However, all examined arbovirus LAVs have in common the acquisition of positively charged amino acid substitutions in cell-surface attachment proteins that render virus infection partially dependent upon heparan sulfate (HS), a ubiquitously expressed sulfated polysaccharide, and appear to attenuate by retarding dissemination of virus particles <italic>in vivo</italic>. We previously reported that, like other wild-type Old World alphaviruses, CHIKV strain, La RÃ©union, (CHIKV-LR), does not depend upon HS for infectivity. To deliberately identify CHIKV attachment protein mutations that could be combined with other attenuating processes in a LAV candidate, we passaged CHIKV-LR on evolutionarily divergent cell-types. A panel of single amino acid substitutions was identified in the E2 glycoprotein of passaged virus populations that were predicted to increase electrostatic potential. Each of these substitutions was made in the CHIKV-LR cDNA clone and comparisons of the mutant viruses revealed surface exposure of the mutated residue on the spike and sensitivity to competition with the HS analog, heparin, to be primary correlates of attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we have identified a mutation at E2 position 79 as a promising candidate for inclusion in a CHIKV LAV.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>With the adaptation of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to transmission by the <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito, a pandemic has occurred resulting in four to six million human infections, and the virus continues to become endemic in new regions, most recently in the Caribbean. CHIKV can cause debilitating polyarthralgia, lasting for weeks to years, and there are currently no licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies available. While an investigational live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) exists, problems with reactogenicity have precluded its licensure. The purpose of the current study was to: i) devise an <italic>in vitro</italic> passage procedure that reliably generates a panel of CHIKV envelope glycoprotein mutations for screening as vaccine candidates; ii) determine the position of the mutations in the three-dimensional structure of the alphavirus spike complex and their effect on electrostatic potential; iii) determine the attenuation characteristics of each mutation in a murine model of CHIKV musculoskeletal disease; and iv) to identify <italic>in vitro</italic> assays examining the dependency of infection upon HS that correlate with attenuation and localization in the glycoprotein spike. This approach provides a paradigm for the rational design of future LAVs for CHIKV and other mosquito-borne viruses, by deliberately selecting and combining attenuating processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last few years, considerable attention has been focused upon mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV); once a relatively obscure member of the <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus in the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Higgs1">[1]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Thiberville1">[3]</xref>. In 2005, an East African clade CHIKV strain emerged on the Indian Ocean island of La RÃ©union that was maintained in a human-mosquito-human transmission cycle and caused a massive outbreak of CHIK fever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Powers1">[4]</xref>. Spread and/or re-emergence of CHIKV in Indian Ocean areas, Asia, southern Europe, and most recently in the Caribbean, in the following years has resulted in an estimated four to six million cases of CHIK fever with painful, often chronic, arthritides and an ongoing worldwide public health problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Thiberville1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Burt1">[5]</xref>. The future occurrence of autochthonous cases in the mainland Americas seems inevitable with frequent travel-associated virus introduction, and the likelihood of a resulting outbreak is predicted to be high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Mirzaian1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-RuizMoreno1">[7]</xref>. Thus, the need to develop therapeutics and vaccine candidates for protection against this virus is ever more urgent. A cell culture-adapted LAV (181/25) is available as an investigational drug to at-risk researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Hoke1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Edelman1">[9]</xref>. However, insufficient attenuation and consequent reactogenicity problems have precluded its licensure for general use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Hoke1">[8]</xref>. New strategies are required to develop CHIKV LAVs combining a more refined balance between attenuation and immunogenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Weaver1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Like all members of the genus, CHIKV has an infectious, single-stranded RNA genome of â¼11 kb with a m<sup>7</sup>G 5â² cap structure and a 3â² polyadenylated tail (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Jose1">[11]</xref>). Within this genome are encoded four non-structural (nsP1-4) and three structural (C, 6K/E1 and pE2) proteins from two open reading frames in the genomic and subgenomic RNAs, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Khan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Vanlandingham1">[13]</xref>. CHIKV virions have icosahedral symmetry, with a glycoprotein shell enclosing the viral membrane and nucleocapsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Voss1">[14]</xref>. pE2 and E1 glycoproteins insert into the cell's endoplasmic reticulum as they are synthesized, forming heterodimers that trimerize into the viral âspikesâ and envelop nucleocapsids, budding as virus particles from the cell's plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Jose1">[11]</xref>. pE2 is cleaved by host furin into E2 and a released E3 fragment during egress to produce the mature, fusion-competent virions in preparation for the next round of infection.</p>
<p>CHIKV isolates bind to cell surface receptors <italic>via</italic> E2 and fuse with cell membranes by clathrin-independent, Eps15-dependent, endocytosis <italic>via</italic> E1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Bernard1">[15]</xref>. The relationship between alphaviruses and their receptors is a complex one with many questions still unanswered and the identity of the receptor(s) utilized by wild-type isolates is still elusive with the exception of C-type lections, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra1">[16]</xref>. For many years, receptor identification was clouded by the use of strains that had adapted to growth in cultured cells. Fifteen years ago, we demonstrated that <italic>in vitro</italic> passage of the prototypic Old World alphavirus, Sindbis (SINV), in different laboratories had resulted in the accumulation of positively charged mutations in the E2 glycoprotein, which dramatically improved the virus-cell surface receptor interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra3">[18]</xref>. In the converse experiment, Griffin and coworkers showed that <italic>in vivo</italic> passage in immune-deficient mice of a laboratory SINV strain could select for acquisition of negative charge and reduced heparan sulfate (HS)-dependence <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes2">[20]</xref>. Amino acid substitutions that increased net positive charge in certain E2 regions could dramatically increase per particle infectivity in cultured cells, dependent upon ionic interaction with negatively charged, cell-surface HS chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ryman1">[21]</xref>. The following observations are of profound importance to the current study and to the biology of Old World alphaviruses in general: i) the substitution for positively charged residues in E2 that confer enhanced, HS-dependent infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> is a common phenomenon amongst cell culture-passaged strains of SINV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ryman1">[21]</xref>, Ross River (RRV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Heil1">[22]</xref>) and Semliki Forest (SFV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Smit1">[23]</xref>) viruses; ii) these mutations can be selected within only a few serial passages <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>; and iii) viruses whose <italic>in vitro</italic> infectivity is enhanced by artificial HS attachment/entry are typically attenuated/avirulent <italic>in vivo</italic> from the natural infection route, at least in part due to reduced level and/or duration of viremia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra4">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>We demonstrated recently that a wild-type CHIKV strain (LR2006 OPY1), isolated during the La RÃ©union outbreak and sequence-stabilized in cDNA clone form (CHIKV-LR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Tsetsarkin1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Parola1">[26]</xref>), exhibited no significant dependence upon HSPGs or other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) for infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>. In contrast, the 181/25 CHIKV LAV candidate, derived by 18 serial passages of wild-type CHIKV (strain 15561) in MRC-5 fibroblasts to achieve attenuation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Edelman1">[9]</xref>, was highly dependent upon ionic interaction with HS for infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>. We predicted that this was due to an amino acid substitution at E2 position 82 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>, which was subsequently shown by Weaver and coworkers to attenuate both CHIKV-15561 and CHIKV-LR <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gorchakov1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we have exploited existing knowledge to deliberately select for and identify a set of E2 mutations that confer HS-dependence for infectivity by serial passage of wild-type CHIKV-LR on different cell-types <italic>in vitro</italic>. Single amino acid mutations that became predominant in the virus population within only five to ten passages through mammalian or mosquito cells were predicted by computational modeling to alter the electrostatic profile of the E2 glycoprotein and increase net positive charge in two exposed regions. By individual introduction of these mutations into CHIKV-LR, we have identified a panel of E2 mutations that confer reduced virulence in a murine model of musculoskeletal disease (MSD) and associated these with particular aspects of dependence upon HS for attachment/infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic>. In particular, we identified a novel mutation at E2 position 79 that increased attenuation over the E2-82R mutation present in the 181/25 LAV but did not diminish immunogenicity or protective efficacy. The positions of the attenuating mutations are clustered within two regions in the three-dimensional structure of the alphavirus trimer-heterodimer with the most attenuating mutated residues prominently exposed to the exterior of the spike. Furthermore, mutations conferring the greatest attenuation were associated with very small plaque size and sensitivity to competition with the HS analog, heparin. We propose this approach as an informed means to create mutant viruses and utilize <italic>in vitro</italic> HS interaction phenotypes and structural modeling to identify promising candidates for inclusion in CHIKV and other arboviral LAVs.</p>

Mice inoculated with equal genome equivalents (GE) were inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup> genomes (equivalent to â¼10<sup>3</sup> PFU of CHIKV-LR). Mice were weighed and monitored daily for clinical signs of disease and mice showing severe signs of disease were monitored twice a day. The width and height of the metatarsal region of the rear footpad of CD-1 and STAT129 mice were measured daily with a caliper. Changes in footpad swelling were expressed as fold change in area (widthÃheight) compared to pre-inoculation area. AST and percent mortality were calculated. Surviving mice were bled and challenged with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of CHIKV-LR 21 d post primary infection.</p>
<p>At 48 h post-infection (p.i.), groups of three mice were euthanized with isofluorane and then exsanguinated by cardiac puncture to collect blood.

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> passage of wild-type CHIKV-LR rapidly selects for positively charged mutations in the E2 glycoprotein</title>
<p>As a proof of concept, we began these studies by passaging CHIKV on cells from two evolutionarily divergent organisms, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 fibroblasts and C6/36 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito cells. A population of wild-type strain CHIKV-LR particles with maximal genome sequence homogeneity was generated by transfection of <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed, full-length, infectious viral RNA genomes into BHK-21 fibroblasts. This virus population was then subjected to a positive selection pressure for rapid growth on CHOK1 or C6/36 cells by performing ten sequential passages in triplicate parallel series. Infectious virion yields in supernatants, harvested after each amplification, declined slightly on both cell-types in the first two passages (data not shown) but then gradually increased to surpass passage 1 (P1) yields by â¼10 or 1,000-fold on mammalian or mosquito cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These data gave an initial indication of adaptation to cell culture within five to 10 passages. Importantly, infectious virion yields were not significantly enhanced by passage on CHOK1-derivative pgsA745 cells, deficient in the synthesis of GAG chains, suggestive that GAG-dependent changes underlay cell culture adaptation.</p>

<title>Cell culture passage of CHIKV-LR.</title>
<p>CHIKV-LR virus stock was serially passaged 10 times in triplicate parallel series on: A) CHOK1; B) C6/36; or C) pgsA745 cells. After each amplification, the quantity of infectious virions was titered on BHK-21 fibroblasts by standard plaque assay. The fold-increase in titer at passage (P) 5 and P10 were normalized to the titer at P1. Each bar represents one individual passage series.</p>

<p>The sequence encoding the entire pE2 protein (E3 and E2) was analyzed from virus populations at P5 and P10 to identify mutations that might have accumulated during cell culture passage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002719-t001">Table 1</xref>). Each population of RT-PCR products was sequenced to reveal mutations present in the majority of packaged genomes. In addition, several individually cloned RT-PCR products from each P10 population were sequenced to determine whether amino acid substitutions were occurring alone or together, and to identify mutations occurring at lower frequency in the population. Passage on C6/36 mosquito cells selected strongly for an E to K substitution at E2 position 79, as this variant was the majority (or consensus) sequence for progeny virus genomes by P5 in three parallel passage series, and was retained through P10. In two of five individually cloned pE2 sequences from one passage series, we also identified a deletion of the codon for negatively charged E2-166E in mosquito cell-passaged virus populations. This mutation arose independently of E2-79K, which was found in the other three sequenced clones for this passage series, and in all sequenced clones for the two other passage series. Surprisingly, no other nucleotide mutations were detectable at this depth. Passage on CHOK1 fibroblasts selected strongly for an S to R substitution at E2-159 in the majority sequence in each of the three parallel passage series within five passages, and was retained as the dominant mutation in two passage series through P10. Interestingly, however, by P10 in the third passage series the dominant mutation in the population, and in four of six individual clones, was the E2-79 E to K substitution also selected on C6/36 cells. Three additional pE2 mutations were revealed in individual virion sequences. An E2-55 G to R substitution occurred at two out of five frequency in the second passage series on CHOK1 cells, while the combination of E2-99 H to Y/E2-168 E to K was present in two out of six of the population of the third passage series. After serial passage on GAG-deficient CHO cells, a dominant E2-264 V to A substitution was detected in one of three passage series at P5 and two of three at P10.</p>

<p>The E2-159R, E2-Î166E and E2-168K mutations mapped to the acid-sensitive region in arch 1 of the Î² ribbon connector between Domains A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Interestingly, an E to K substitution at E2-166 was previously selected during passage of CHIKV-06.049 on human epithelial carcinoma HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-HenrikGad1">[36]</xref>. The E2-159, E2-166 and E2-168 residues lie within the Î² ribbon connector facing outward from the heterotrimeric spike interior essentially on the opposite side of the E1/E2 heterodimer from E2-79 and E2-82 residues. E2-166 and E2-168 residues are close to areas of contact between the Î² connector and E1, although residue E2-166 is located more towards the heterotrimer exterior than E2-168 which is deeper within an invagination of the spike between the Î² connector and E1. The E2-159 residue lies higher and more towards the cleft in Domain A, where E2-55 is located.</p>
<p>For ease of viewing, regions affected by the changes in electrostatic potential created by each mutation are shown magnified on only one of the E2 molecules in the heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g002">Fig. 2E &amp; F</xref>). Those amino acid mutations that were predicted to increase net positive charge also produced localized increases in the computer-predicted positive electrostatic potential on the surface of the E2 protein. In contrast, the E2-Î166E deletion mutation appeared to affect a broader area and, at the resolution of the model, alter contact regions between the Î² connector and E1. The prominent exposure of the positive-charge shift conferred by the highly attenuating E2-79K mutation in comparison with the similarly located E2-55R and E2-82R is particularly apparent in the top view of the spike three-fold axis of symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g002">Figs. 2HâJ</xref>).</p>

<title>Positively charged amino acid substitutions in E2 result in a range of HS dependencies</title>
<p>Each amino acid substitution or deletion discussed above, including E2-82R and E2-166K, was introduced separately into the CHIKV-LR cDNA clone. Stocks of CHIKV-LR and the E2 mutant viruses were generated by transfection of <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed, capped genomes, and not passaged further. Reasoning that the positive electrostatic potential increases in E2 would result in a dependency upon cell surface HS for infectivity, we compared particle infectivity on CHOK1 cells <italic>versus</italic> derivatives that lack the ability to synthesize either all GAG chains (pgsA745) or just HS (pgsD677; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Esko1">[37]</xref>). Like other Old World alphaviruses, the infectivity of wild-type CHIKV-LR did not depend upon the presence of these sulfated glycans (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002719.s001">Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner3">[38]</xref>). In contrast, the infectivities of LR-55R, LR-79K, LR-82R, LR-159R, LR-166K, LR-Î166E and LR-168K for CHO cells all exhibited significant dependence upon GAGs, and this phenotype was almost completely conferred by the absence of HS alone. Neither E2-99Y, nor E2-264A mutation, exhibited significant dependence upon GAGs for infectivity (data not shown). In our experience the usefulness of the pgsD677 and pgsA745 CHO cells is limited to determining whether or not viral infectivity is affected by the absence of HS or GAGs but does not accurately determine relative degrees of dependency. However, these data indicate that predicted increase in exposed positive charge on E2 in the trimer-heterodimeric spike correlates with a significant dependence upon HS for infection of CHO cells. Most of the mutations increased per-particle infectivity, with the notable exceptions of E2-Î166E and E2-159R (data not shown), which reduced infectivity unless HS was present, indicating that the latter mutations may compromise attachment/entry <italic>via</italic> another receptor(s) pathway used by CHIKV-LR.</p>

In the second category (blue), partial attenuation was observed for several virus mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g003">Fig. 3CâE</xref>). LR-168K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) was â¼24 h delayed and attenuated at 1â2 d p.i. but produced wild-type levels of swelling in some cases in the second phase. Interestingly, some animals infected with LR-168K also exhibited a more prolonged swelling than we observed for the wild-type virus infection. LR-55R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) and LR-159R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>) were not delayed but demonstrated significantly reduced swelling compared with CHIKV-LR in both waves.

<p>In an effort to identify particular <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes that could be used to identify promising mutations for a LAV, we compared multiple characteristics of the dependence of infectivity of each mutant upon HS. By calculating plaques per GE (specific infectivity), we estimated that under plaque assay conditions, â¼1% of wild-type CHIKV-LR virus particles initiated infection on BHK-21 fibroblasts, 0.1% on Vero cells, 0.05% on CHOK1 cells and 0.01% on MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). These susceptibility differences may be due to reduced attachment, entry and/or to subsequent steps in propagation. The LR-Î166E mutant exhibited minimal changes in specific infectivity on the four cell-types compared to wild-type CHIKV-LR. Otherwise, with a few exceptions (E2-55R on Vero and MC3T3-E1, and E2-159R on CHOK1 and MC3T3-E1), the cell culture passage-derived E2 mutations tended to increase the infectivity of CHIKV particles by up to 70-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) and thus provided an advantage to virions in culture conditions. However, these data also indicated that the virus-host receptor interactions differ between cell-types, as the hierarchies of cell susceptibility and virion infectivity were not consistently maintained.</p>

Virus inocula were prepared in media with a range of salt concentrations to disrupt potential ionic interactions between the virus particles and cell-surfaces during the infection period. As expected from our prior studies, the infectivities of wild-type SINV (SINV-TR339) and CHIKV-LR particles exhibited no significant dependence upon ionic interaction, whereas an E2-70K mutation in SINV-TR339 (SINV-K70) makes this virus highly sensitive to ionic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ryman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, although the electrostatic model of the E2 protein predicted that the deletion of residue E2-166E would increase net-positive charge, the infectivity of LR-Î166E virus for MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts was insensitive to even the highest salt concentration (350 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), and indistinguishable from wild-type CHIKV-LR by this assay.

<title>Increased infectivity tends to be conferred by ionic interactions, sensitive to blocking by heparin</title>

However, heparin is a uniformly highly sulfated GAG, lacking the diversity of HS chain charge distributions and therefore does not necessarily block all HS-ligand interactions.

<p>While performing the above experiments, it was noted that plaque sizes on MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were highly variable between mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). When quantified and compared with CHIKV-LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), it was revealed that the plaques formed by LR-166K, LR-82R and LR-79K were extremely small, LR-168K plaques were of intermediate size, while the plaque sizes of LR-Î166E, LR-55R and LR-159R did not differ significantly from wild-type virus. The heparin blocking assay measures only the ability of the virus to initiate infection in the presence of varying amounts of heparin. As an extension to this assay, we determined whether or not the addition of heparin to the overlay impacted virus plaque size phenotypes as a more sensitive measurement of HS-dependence. As expected the plaque size of the wild-type virus was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). The three viruses exhibiting the smallest plaque size were also unaffected by added heparin, presumably because cell-surface or extracellular matrix HS already inhibits the spread of these highly sensitive mutants. However, heparin reduced the plaque sizes of LR-55R and LR-168K to a size comparable with LR-79K, LR-82R and LR-166K, and reduced the plaque size of LR-159R and LR-Î166E, significantly. The reduced plaque size of LR-Î166E under heparin overlay along with the reduced infectivity on HS-deficient CHO cells (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002719.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) suggested that this virus has a slight dependence on HS depending upon culture conditions, which fit with the prediction of an alteration of the positive electrostatic potential.</p>

<title>Increased infectivity conferred by positively charged E2 mutations tends to be disrupted by HS digestion from cell surfaces</title>
<p>We examined the infectivity of each virus for MC3T3-E1 cells digested with microbial heparinases, (Hep) I, II and III, which digest cell-surface HS chains (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Tripathi1">[49]</xref>). Hep II acts with little specificity, cleaving both HS chains and heparin regardless of sulfation. In contrast, Hep I cleaves primarily heparin and highly sulfated HS regions, while Hep III primarily cleaves less-sulfated regions of HS chains. Thus, the HS structures remaining on the cell surface after digestion differ between heparinases. Successful digestion of HS was confirmed by the greatly reduced infectivity of SINV-K70. As expected, viruses with little infectivity dependence upon HS (SINV-TR339, CHIKV-LR and LR-Î166E) were unaffected by the digestion of HS chains with Hep I, II or III, even when high concentrations of enzyme were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g007">Fig. 7AâC</xref>). With the exception of LR-55R, heparin blocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) correlated with &gt;90% reduction in infectivity on MC3T3-E1 cells digested with Hep II. However, the infectivities of these viruses were only reduced â¼50% by digestion with Hep I or III suggesting that they were able to utilize residual chains for infection regardless of their sulfation level, unlike SINV-K70. The infectivity of LR-55R was reproducibly reduced by only â¼50% following digestion with Hep I, II or III. Overall, LR-79K infectivity appeared to be the most sensitive to the digestion of HS, followed by LR-166K.</p>

Viral loads for the attenuated E2 mutants were generally lower in MSTs than wild-type CHIKV-LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g008">Fig. 8B &amp; C</xref>), whereas the LR-Î166E mutant titers were comparable to wild-type, and LR-159R infection produced similar viral load in the knee joint as CHIKV-LR in keeping with the observed hind limb swelling. However, it was surprising to discover that LR-82R replicated to similar titer in the quadriceps muscle as the wild-type virus since this mutant caused no detectable MSD.</p>

<title>DLN, serum viremia and spleen</title>
<p>All of the attenuated viruses (groups 2 and 3) exhibited a highly significant inability to amplify within the DLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>), suggesting a reduced or delayed spread either within the lymphatic vessels to the DLN or within the organ itself. With the exception of LR-168K, the viremic titers were also significantly reduced or undetectable in the cases of LR-166K, LR-82R and LR-79K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>). Notably, there was no detectable presence of the three most attenuated viruses, LR-79K, LR-82R, and LR-166K, in the spleen either likely due to the absence of viremic spread by this time p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>). These data suggest that the attenuated E2 mutants are impaired to differing degrees in their ability to spread from the site of inoculation with a high degree of association with MSD severity. It is interesting, however, that viral loads in lymphoid tissues and serum viremia appear to correlate better with MSD and cytokine/chemokine levels than MST titers.</p>

<title>Attenuation of E2 mutants in an immunocompromised mouse models</title>
<p>Based upon the studies above, we proposed that two of the mutant viruses were sufficiently attenuated for inclusion in LAV vaccine formulations: LR-82R and LR-79K. To stringently determine the degree and stability of their attenuated phenotypes, we infected more susceptible animals. We have previously shown that mice deficient in STAT1-dependent type I IFN signaling pathways had exacerbated MSD, whereas CHIKV-181/25 remained partially attenuated in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>. STAT1-deficient mice infected with LR-82R exhibited exacerbated hind limb swelling compared to 129/Sv control animals, similar to that caused by wild-type CHIKV-LR (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002719.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). However, LR-79K infection of the STAT1-deficient mice caused only mild MSD compared to CHIKV-LR and LR-82R, from which we infer that LR-79K is substantially more attenuated for ability to cause MSD than LR-82R or even the 181/25 LAV. Both LR-82R and LR-79K infections were lethal to the STAT1-deficient mice, however, supporting our prior contention that MSD and fatality are not closely linked.</p>

<title>LR-79K and LR-82R elicit protective immunity and neutralizing antibodies</title>
<p>Finally, we immunized CD-1 mice with LR-82R or LR-79K, and challenged with CHIKV-LR three weeks p.i., to determine whether or not these attenuated E2 mutants could efficiently elicit a protective adaptive immune response. All of the immunized mice were completely protected from development of MSD upon CHIKV-LR challenge, whereas mock-immunized mice developed mild MSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). Only the second wave of swelling was observed in these control animals most likely due to the ongoing age-dependent attenuation of CHIK-LR-induced MSD in this model. Protection from disease was coincident with the presence of neutralizing antibodies prior to challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>) and, although we have not shown directly that this confers the immunity, antibody responses have been shown to protect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Chu1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Lum1">[51]</xref>.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002719-g009">Fig. 9B</xref> and data not shown), despite there being highly significant differences in dissemination, replication and disease.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The gold standards for a successful LAV against mosquito-borne virus infection are the 17D strains of yellow fever virus (YFV), currently used for routine immunization where YFV is endemic and in regional mass vaccination campaigns at the first sign of an outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner5">[52]</xref>. The 17D vaccines immunize 99% of vaccinees with only one inoculum dose, provide immune memory for decades, and very rarely cause vaccine-associated adverse events. The original 17D virus was fortuitously selected by extensive blind cell culture-passage in the 1930's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Roukens1">[53]</xref>. Although, the molecular mechanisms underlying the consistent immunogenicity and stable attenuation of 17D are largely unknown and cannot yet be intentionally duplicated for viruses or even for YFV, increased HS interaction has been identified as significantly contributing to the attenuation of 17D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Lee1">[54]</xref>. Alphavirus LAV candidates have been generated for VEEV (TC83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-McKinney1">[55]</xref>) and CHIKV (181/25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Edelman1">[9]</xref>) by serial passage in cell culture but both have encountered problems during clinical trial for reasons of inadequate immunogenicity in some vaccinees and residual virulence in others. Yet, both of these vaccines are attenuated, at least in part due to more efficient interaction with HS than their wild-type counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Bernard2">[48]</xref>. Attaining the ideal balance between attenuation of disease and immunogenicity is extremely challenging, and to do so by design will require knowledge of virus biology and the optimization of rational attenuation strategies that can be combined to produce a safe and effective vaccine. Thus, one characteristic of most, if not all, arbovirus LAV is increased HS interaction over the wild-type virus, yet these mutations have previously been selected at random as a component of extensive blind passages without knowledge of their contribution to attenuation of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Our current studies represent the first attempt to evaluate systematically selected mutations that confer interaction with HS and attenuate CHIKV <italic>in vivo</italic>. We began by assuming that a rational method for identification of a panel of E2 glycoprotein mutants highly enriched in HS binding mutations would be serial passage of CHIKV virus on two evolutionarily divergent cell types. Within an organism, HS biosynthesis is primarily regulated by domain distribution and degree of sulfation (i.e., the distribution of <italic>N</italic>-substituents and the levels of 2-<italic>O</italic>- and 6-<italic>O</italic>-sulfation) resulting in different composition of HS species from different cellular or tissue sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Maccarana1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ledin1">[57]</xref>. Furthermore, invertebrate HS has a number of unique properties, including unusually low <italic>O-</italic>sulfation, yielding different domain structures from vertebrate HS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-KuscheGullberg1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Pejler1">[59]</xref>. This diversity most likely results in the duality of both non-specific ionic interactions occurring between HS and positively charged ligands <italic>versus</italic> highly specific interactions of particular ligands with certain HS species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Bernfield1">[60]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Esko2">[63]</xref>. Specificity for particular HS structures has been documented for several virus-HS interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner3">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Spear1">[64]</xref>. Therefore, it was possible that mutations affecting the charge balance of E2 selected on different cell types might exhibit different types of HS interaction. While the particular contribution of HS binding to alphavirus infection is not fully characterized beyond increases in virus association with cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ryman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra4">[24]</xref>, it is possible that structural differences in HS chains, their attachment to core proteins or their associations with other cell surface factors may be involved in the selective advantage provided by a particular virus mutation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Comparing CHO and C6/36 cell passage series, we obtained one common mutation altering charge (E2-79 E-K), three CHO-only mutations (E255 G-R, E2-159 S-R and E2-168 E-K) and one C6/36-only mutation (deletion of E2-166E). Neither the V to A substitution at E2-264, nor the H to Y substitution at E2-99, would be anticipated to have considerable impact upon electrostatic potential; therefore, these were not considered. Interestingly, the E2-159R selected in these studies was previously selected during passage of CHIKV on Vero primate kidney fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Wang2">[65]</xref>, the E2-166K was selected on HeLa human adenocarcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-HenrikGad1">[36]</xref>, and the E2-82R in the vaccine strain was selected on MRC-5 human fetal fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Edelman1">[9]</xref>, although none of these studies deliberately selected for increased infectivity or HS interaction. Therefore, common mutations can be selected between evolutionarily divergent hosts (E2-79 E-K in hamster and mosquito, and E2-159 S-R in monkey and mouse) while it is possible that others are unique to particular cells or species. While not considered in our studies, it is possible that the number of different mutations selected would be increased by using cells from different tissue types reflecting the diversity of tissue specific HS structure described above.</p>
<p>To determine whether or not the mutations identified were unique to cell culture-adapted virus populations, we examined these positions in an alignment of 200 pE2 sequences available in GenBank and believed to be from isolates minimally or unpassaged before sequencing (Gardner <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished observations). Only two of the mutations selected in our study were present in any of these isolates: four isolates had E2-55R (ADV31296, AEE60792, AEE60797 and BAH97931) and 10 isolates had the E2-264A (AEX25348, AEX25344, AEX25346, AEE60795, AEE60793, AEE60796, AEE60794, AEE60792, CCA61129 and CCA61128). Whether or not these residues are present in naturally circulating viruses or represent cell culture adaptive mutations in the minimally passaged strains remains to be determined.</p>
<p>With the exception of LR-Î166E, all of the E2 mutants were attenuated for the ability to cause MSD in mice. Although all of the viruses were clearly able to replicate at the site of inoculation in the footpad, in general their replication in MST was reduced. The virus mutants fell into three groups of disease severity with LR-Î166E disease indistinguishable from CHIKV-LR; LR-168K, LR-55R and LR-159R eliciting a biphasic MSD similar to CHIKV-LR but with reduced disease; and LR-166K, LR-82R and LR-79K eliciting either a minor monophasic MSD (LR-166K) or no detectable MSD (LR-82R and LR-79K). As suggested by studies with other alphaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Bernard2">[48]</xref>, the dependence upon HS for infectivity prevents efficient spread of CHIKV <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the current studies, this led to decreased levels of inflammatory chemokines such as MCP-1, MIG and IP-10 that are associated with CHIKV-induced disease. Further, the most attenuated viruses elicited the lowest levels of these factors. It was not surprising that the levels of IP-10 and MCP-1 correlated with attenuation, as these cytokines are chemoattractants for monocytes/macrophages which have been shown to be important for disease mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner4">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Rulli1">[41]</xref> and humans, especially during the acute phase of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Kelvin1">[42]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Chow1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ng1">[66]</xref>, and can be associated with higher CHIKV loads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Chow1">[44]</xref>. MIG and IL-12 are involved in T cell recruitment and differentiation respectively and have been shown in some human cohorts to be elevated during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Kelvin1">[42]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Hoarau1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ng1">[66]</xref>, and CD4+ T cells have been shown to contribute to hind limb swelling in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Teo1">[67]</xref>. IL-1Î±, IFN-Î³ and IL-2 were increased in the serum of mutant viruses similarly to wild-type CHIKV-LR and several of these cytokines were also shown to be upregulated during human infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Rulli1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Wauquier1">[43]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Hoarau1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ng1">[66]</xref>. It remains to be determined if elevation of these cytokines is associated with the attenuated phenotype and/or the induction of the protective immune response. Taken together, the cytokine profiles in mice correlated with virulence and for many of the cytokines are similar to profiles in humans following CHIKV-LR infection.</p>
<p>We attempted to associate <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of HS infection dependence with virulence, examining virus specific infectivity, infection efficiency in the absence of HS or all GAGs, plaque size, resistance of infectivity to competition with increasing salt concentrations, sensitivity to competition with heparin, and infection sensitivity to digestion of cell surfaces with heparinases. Each of these assays has previously been used to compare HS infectivity dependence of alphaviruses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Ryman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Heil1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Bernard2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Byrnes3">[68]</xref>). All viruses attenuated in comparison with CHIKV-LR did exhibit increased specific infectivity on at least one of the four cell types tested and this was associated with similar infectivity diminution in cells genetically deficient in GAG synthesis. LR-Î166E dependence on HS was significantly less than the other mutants but much greater than CHIKV-LR indicating that at least partial dependence upon HS for infectivity is not invariably associated with attenuation. Interestingly, in contrast with the SINV-K70 mutant whose infectivity appeared to depend solely upon HS among GAGs, all CHIKV mutants exhibited a minor dependence of infectivity upon GAGs other than HS evidenced by slightly increased infectivity on HS-deficient pgsD-677 cells <italic>versus</italic> GAG-deficient pgsA745 cells. This suggests the possibility of differences in attachment/entry mechanisms of SINV <italic>versus</italic> CHIKV.</p>
<p>Disruption of infection with salt did not distinguish between attenuated mutants with each exhibiting moderate decrease at 200 mM and â¼90% decrease in infectivity at 250 mM and above. Interestingly, LR-Î166E, although sensitive to genetic deficiency in HS and all GAGs, was insensitive to all salt concentrations used, similar to CHIKV-LR. Furthermore, digestion of HS chains with Hep I, II or III did not distinguish the three groups of attenuation phenotypes. Likely reflecting the different substrate specificities of the three enzymes, differential sensitivity to the three heparinases can distinguish between virulence phenotypes with other alphaviruses with genetic differences in HS binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Gardner2">[29]</xref>. In these studies, CHIKV-LR was insensitive to all three heparinases, while LR-166K, LR-168K, LR-55R, LR-159R and LR-82R were partially sensitive to Hep I, highly sensitive to Hep II and partially sensitive to Hep III. Notably, LR-79K was significantly more sensitive to Hep I and Hep III than the other E2 mutants. LR-Î166E, again, exhibited an intermediate dependence phenotype with all three heparinases. SINV-K70, in comparison, was highly sensitive to all three heparinases, again suggesting differences in GAG interactions between SINV and CHIKV mutants. In contrast with these assays, blocking of infectivity by reaction of virus particles with soluble heparin clearly distinguished LR-166K, LR-82R and LR-79K from the other viruses. Small plaque size and lack of change in size with addition of heparin to the overlay provided a similar distinction.</p>
<p>Comparison of location in an electrostatic map of the CHIKV heterotrimeric spike complex revealed that mutations that were more attenuating to disease in mice appeared to create additional positive charge that was more exposed to the exterior of the spike (e.g., E2-79K, E2-82R and E2-166K as opposed to E2-55R, E2-Î166E or E2-159R). The lack of any attenuating phenotype with E2- E2-Î166E was surprising, especially since the electrostatic model of this mutant suggested that the deletion should lead to increased electrostatic potential of E2 similar to that of the other E2 amino acid substitution mutants listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002719-t001">Table 1</xref> which demonstrated various degrees of attenuation. Clearly, the interpretation of the electrostatic potential maps of particular E2 mutant proteins will depend upon confirmation with <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of GAG dependency.</p>
<p>Our data for the E2-166K mutation, which we tested because of its identical location to the selected E2-Î166E mutation, indicate that it confers efficient attachment to HS. This mutation was selected by passage in a context where the authors concluded that the mutation increased virus resistance to the OAS3 antiviral protein, possibly by conferring a rapid entry phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-HenrikGad1">[36]</xref>. Many of the HS-binding E2 mutants for SINV and VEEV were originally selected and identified as rapid entry mutants and only later shown to confer efficient HS binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Klimstra4">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Davis1">[69]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-Olmsted1">[72]</xref>. The relationship of HS binding, rapid entry and antiviral resistance is unclear. However, if the LR-166K virus effectively antagonized the antiviral response as suggested by Henrik Gad <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-HenrikGad1">[36]</xref>, one would expect the virus to be more virulent <italic>in vivo</italic> instead of more attenuated compared to CHIKV-LR and thus this phenotype may be an <italic>in vitro</italic> artifact or a localized phenomenon.</p>
<p>Overall, our data suggest that positively charged amino acid substitutions in CHIKV E2 that result in small plaques and efficient competition with heparin will be highly attenuated in the adult mouse model of MSD. The LR-166K, LR-82R and LR-79K viruses were very similar in terms of the primary <italic>in vitro</italic> correlates of attenuation: plaque size and heparin sensitivity. In addition, LR-79K was dramatically more attenuated for MSD than LR-82R in the severely immunocompromised STAT1-deficient mice. Testing in this model will refine choices between mutants with similar <italic>in vitro</italic> characteristics and sensitivity to all three heparinases may indicate the highest degree of <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation within this group. Furthermore, combinations of such mutations can be tested to improve immunogenicity and/or stabilize attenuation. One question raised by these studies is whether or not this paradigm for deliberate mutation selection will be applicable to other alphaviruses and/or other arboviruses. We have detected differences between SINV and CHIKV mutants in dependency upon HS <italic>versus</italic> other GAGs for infectivity and it is unclear how this phenotype correlates with attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic> especially when evaluating the results of assays that are not specific to a particular GAG. It is likely that the specific combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays most correlated with attenuation must be determined for each virus type.</p>
<p>In summation, these studies demonstrate that very limited passage of CHIKV is sufficient to generate HS binding mutations that are highly attenuating but retain immunogenicity, and would make satisfactory candidates for testing in a LAV. Furthermore, using this approach, we have identified E2-79K as a single site mutation that is highly attenuating for MSD and stable even in a severely immunocompromised model of disease. It is possible that attenuating mutations present in other areas of vaccine genomes (e.g., nonstructural or non-translated region mutations in the YFV 17D vaccine or the VEEV TC83 vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002719-White1">[73]</xref>) would require further passage to accrue. Therefore, rational LAV creation may benefit from multiple selection strategies with an initial screen identifying mutants meeting the criteria we have outlined for HS binding-mediated attenuation followed by additional passage on the same cell type or others or introduction of mutations identified with other alphaviruses that could be reasonably transferred to CHIKV.</p>
