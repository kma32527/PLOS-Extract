<title>Background</title>
<p>The snake <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic> is responsible for the majority of envenomings in the northern region of South America. Severe local effects, including hemorrhage, which are mainly caused by snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), are not fully neutralized by conventional serum therapy. Little is known about the immunochemistry of the P-I SVMPs since few monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against these molecules have been obtained. In addition, producing toxin-neutralizing mAbs remains very challenging.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Here, we report on the set-up of a functional screening based on a synthetic peptide used as a biosensor to select neutralizing mAbs against SVMPs and the successful production of neutralizing mAbs against Atroxlysin-I (Atr-I), a P-I SVMP from <italic>B. atrox</italic>. Hybridomas producing supernatants with inhibitory effect against the proteolytic activity of Atr-I towards the FRET peptide Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp were selected. Six IgG1 Mabs were obtained (named mAbatr1 to mAbatr6) and also two IgM. mAbatrs1, 2, 3 and 6 were purified. All showed a high specific reactivity, recognizing only Atr-I and <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom in ELISA and a high affinity, showing equilibrium constants in the nM range for Atr-I. These mAbatrs were not able to bind to Atr-I overlapping peptides, suggesting that they recognize conformational epitopes.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>For the first time a functional screening based on a synthetic biosensor was successfully used for the selection of neutralizing mAbs against SVMPs.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In this work, we propose a new screening strategy to produce monoclonal antibodies against Atr-I, a P-I class SVMP from <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic>, which is the snake responsible for the majority of the accidents in South America. SVMPs are the main toxic factors in Bothrops venom causing systemic and local hemorrhage, which may evolve to inflammation and/or necrosis. Since the toxic effects of SVMPs are related to their proteolytic activity, we have produced a peptide which was used as a biosensor for Atr-I hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of this substrate was monitored and the clones possessing inhibitory activity against the proteolytic activity of Atr-I upon the peptide were selected. Using our new approach, we have obtained four monoclonal antibodies highly specific and with neutralizing capacity against the hemorrhagic activity of either Atr-I alone or <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic> whole venom. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time where a functional screening is used for the selection of neutralizing mAbs against SVMPs. It is also the first description of mAbs anti-Atr-I, with inhibitory potential against its toxic activities which may be useful for diagnosis and treatment in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Snakebites cause up to 1,800 000 envenomations per year, mainly in tropical areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Kasturiratne1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Harrison1">[4]</xref>. Snakebites might be considered as a daily occupational hazard since rural subsistent farming communities are the main population suffering from this condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Williams1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Harrison1">[4]</xref>, considered as a Neglected Tropical Condition by WHO (World Health Organization) since 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Kasturiratne1">[1]</xref>. In Brazil, nearly 30,000 snakebite envenomings occur per year and the incidence is about 14 cases/100,000 people/year, a number as high as those found in many other Latin American countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Kasturiratne1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Brasil1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Hansson2">[8]</xref>. Moreover, in the Brazilian Amazon region, 9,000 snakebites occur per year with an incidence fourfold higher than that found in the rest of Brazil. <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic> is found in tropical lowlands and rainforests in the north of South America and is responsible for the majority of envenomations in this area, causing approximately 80% of snake bites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Hansson2">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Bothrops1">[10]</xref>. <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming is characterized systemically by headache, severe coagulopathy, with consumption of coagulation blood factors, generalized hemorrhage and renal failure. Locally, severe tissue lesions may be observed, including swelling, blisters, inflammatory response, erythema, ecchymosis, local hemorrhage and necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-White1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Warrell1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy by antivenoms is the only efficacious treatment approved by WHO for snakebite accidents. Antivenoms are produced by hyper immunization of animals (generally horses, sheeps or goats) with a pool of venoms from the most important species of snakes found in each country/region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-EspinoSolis1">[13]</xref>. It is known that serum therapy is effective against several of the systemic noxious effects of snake envenomings, when administered early enough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Camey1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Otero1">[16]</xref>. However, the local effects are not fully neutralized, being clinically important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Moreira1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Zamuner1">[20]</xref> due to complications related to local hemorrhage and tissue necrosis that can permanently provoke a disability and morbidity among patients, causing a very important socio-economic impact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Queiroz1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>B. atrox</italic> venom is a rich mixture of bioactive components belonging to few protein families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-LopezLozano1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Calvete1">[24]</xref>. Proteomic characterization of toxin composition of <italic>B.</italic> atrox venom used in this study indicates that the main components of this venom are represented by SVMPs (Snake Venom Metalloproteinases) (58.2%), including P-III and P-I classes, SVSP (Snake Venom Serine Proteinases) (11.17%), PLA<sub>2</sub> (Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>) (11.0%) and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Kohlhoff1">[25]</xref>. Although these molecules act synergistically in a typical “pit viper envenoming” clinical picture, it is well established that SVMPs are responsible for the most severe local effects (i.e. hemorrhage and its variable consequences) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-White1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Gutierrez2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Eble1">[31]</xref>. SVMPs are zinc-dependent proteinases representing up to 70% of venom dry weight, and can be classified into three classes (P-I to P-III) and several subclasses, according to their domain organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-LopezLozano1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Calvete1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Stocker1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fox2">[35]</xref>. The P-I class are endopeptidases possessing the metalloproteinase catalytic domain only. The P-II class presents both metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains and the P-III class SVMPs contain disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains, in addition to the proteinase domain.</p>
<p>Although no P-III class SVMPs from <italic>B. atrox</italic> have yet been characterized at the protein level, evidence supporting the presence of this class of enzymes has been provided by proteomic and transcriptomic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Nunez1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Kohlhoff1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tavares1">[36]</xref>. In addition, three P-I class SVMPs from <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom have already been purified and characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Sanchez1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Cintra1">[39]</xref>. Atr-I (Atroxlysin-I), Batx-I and Batroxase are P-I enzymes isolated from <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom from the Amazonian regions of Peru, Colombia and Brazil, respectively. They are hemorrhagic and fibrinogenolytic and do not bear any pro-coagulant activity. These molecules are hemorrhagins that can act proteolytically upon extracellular matrix components, contributing to the local damages following bite. They can also play a systemic role, causing myotoxic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Patio1">[38]</xref> and inhibition of platelet aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Sanchez1">[37]</xref>, which can contribute to hemorrhagic, necrotic and blood-clotting disturbances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Sanchez1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Cintra1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Considering the important role played by P-I class SVMPs in the <italic>B. atrox</italic> poisoning, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against these molecules constitute highly useful tools to investigate the structural determinants of toxicity, for patient diagnosis and may have great potential for the preparation of more efficient antivenoms for passive immunotherapy or even for vaccination. Thus, in this study we used a functional screening based on a synthetic biosensor to produce neutralizing mAbs against Atr-I. Specificity assays of Atr-I using oxidized insulin B-chain as substrate showed that the enzyme cleaves the Ala<sub>14</sub>-Leu<sub>15</sub> peptide bond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Sanchez1">[37]</xref>. Inhibition of enzymatic-dependent cleavage of the Atr-I peptide substrate [Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp, containing a FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) system], determined by means of fluorescence emission, was used as a tool to select specific monoclonal antibodies. Four monoclonal antibodies that fully neutralize the proteolytic and hemorrhagic <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of Atr-I and crude <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom were obtained using this functional screening.</p>

<title>Hybridoma production</title>
<p>Atr-I was injected four times subcutaneously in BALB/c mice in order to obtain mice hybridomas. 10 µg of protein were used per dose in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) at the first injection, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) at subsequent inoculations with intervals of 2 weeks between each dose. A booster injection of Atr-I was made 4 weeks after the fourth immunization. Throughout the immunization schedule, mice were bled and the reactivity of immune sera was tested against Atr-I in ELISA assay. Three days after the last injection, spleen cells from hyper immunized mice were fused with Sp2/0 myeloma cells (ATCC).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d2">
<title>Functional clone selection and biosensor synthesis</title>
<p>The FRET peptide (Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp) was used as a functional biosensor. Supernatants from resulting hybridomas were functionally screened by inhibition of FRET peptide (Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp) hydrolysis by Atr-I. For the production of Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp, a first step consisting of Fmoc-Glu-EDDnp synthesis was manually done according to a slightly modified version of the method described by Csuhai and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Csuhai1">[40]</xref>. Next, Fmoc-Glu-EDDnp was immobilized to Rink Amide resin (Novabiochem) by its lateral chain. The subsequent steps of deprotection and coupling of the aminoacids (Abz-LVEALY) were automatically performed by Fmoc chemistry using Multipep robot (Intavis), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Gausepohl1">[41]</xref>. At the end of the synthesis, the rink amide resin liberates a NH<sub>2</sub> group, transforming the Glu into a Gln from the sequence Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp.</p>
<p>Fmoc amino acids were acquired from Novabiochem and Boc-2-Abz-OH from Sigma Aldrich. The release from the resin and side-chain deprotection was achieved by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp was purified and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Waters) on a C-18 column with an acetonitrile gradient (0–60%) (not shown).</p>
<p>To select hybridomas of interest, 40 µL of supernatants from cell cultures were pre-incubated with 11 ng of Atr-I for 30 min at 37°C. Then, 10 µL of Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp were added to reach a 47 mM final concentration (1∶540 molar ratio enzyme∶substrate). The kinetics of FRET peptide hydrolysis was monitored by fluorescence in a Sinergy2 (Biotek) equipment (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 320 nm and λ<sub>em</sub> = 420 nm) for 60 min at 37°C. Positive controls were made with Sp2/0 supernatants culture and the blank had no Atr-I added. Clones possessing inhibitory effects against the proteolytic activity of Atr-I upon FRET peptide were chosen for subcloning by single-cell limiting dilutions. A second selection round was done and subclones presenting the highest inhibitory effect upon Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp cleavage by Atr-I were selected for mAbs production. To determine isotypes of mAbs we used IsoStrip (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions and purified on a protein A-sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The purity of mAbs was analyzed by a 4%–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) in non-reducing conditions.</p>

After an overnight saturation step with 3% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin), the set of membrane bound peptides was probed by incubation with mAbs anti-Atr-I (1 µg/mL). Antibody binding was detected by using the alkaline–phosphatase conjugated-goat anti-mouse whole IgG (Sigma, diluted 1∶2000; 90 min, 37°C). After washing, a phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added. Anti-Atr-I IgG produced in rabbits were used as positive controls for the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Sanchez1">[37]</xref>. A blue precipitate was observed on peptides bound by antibodies. To allow the re-use of the membranes, they were sequentially treated with dimethylformamide, then 1% SDS, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol in 8 M urea, followed by ethanol/water/acetic acid (50∶40∶10 vol/vol/vol) wash and, finally, ethanol so as to remove the precipitated dye and molecules bound to the peptides.</p>

<p>After immunization of BALB/c mice with Atr-I, a panel of twenty-one anti-Atr-I secreting hybridomas was selected on the basis of their capacity to neutralize Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp hydrolysis by Atr-I. Only hybridomas that presented at least 50% of inhibition of the Atr-I proteolytic activity were selected. These clones were then subcloned and a new round of selection was performed. Eight clones presenting the highest inhibition of the proteolytic activity of Atr-I were finally chosen for production, of which six were IgG1 (named mAbatr1 to mAbatr6) and two were IgM. mAbatr1 to 6 were purified on a protein A-Sepharose column and appeared as homogeneous bands on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002826-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The bothropic envenoming induces severe local symptoms in human victims, including hemorrhage and tissue necrosis. Complications arise in up to 40% of the cases, in which permanent damage can necessitate the amputation of limbs. The local noxious effects of bothropic venoms (e.g. hemorrhage and necrosis) are mainly due to the action of SVMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-White1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Gutierrez2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Terra1">[30]</xref>, which seem to be not well neutralized by current therapeutic anti-bothropic antivenoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Moreira1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Zamuner1">[20]</xref>. In this present work, we describe a new rational and functional method to produce neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against P-I SVMPS, using as hybridoma selection criterion the capability of mAbs to block the proteolysis induced by SVMPs.</p>
<p>Atr-I, a 22.3 kDa P-I class SVMP isolated from the Peruvian <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom, is able to hydrolyze the peptide bond between ala<sub>14</sub> and leu<sub>15</sub> present in insulin B-chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Sanchez1">[37]</xref>, as well in the fluorogenic peptide (Abz- LVEALYQ-EDDnp). We decided to synthesize this peptide sequence coupled to a fluorescent donor and its respective quencher and to use the FRET technique to measure the inhibition of Atr-I-induced hydrolysis of this biosensor by mAbs. Hybridoma supernatants abolishing fluorescent emission were selected as potentially neutralizing mAbs. Based on this method, we have obtained six IgG1 and two IgM monoclonal antibodies against Atr-I.</p>
<p>mAbs previously produced against BaP1 or Mut-II were selected by ELISA and presented cross-reactivity against heterologous venoms and P-I class SVMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fernandes1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tanjoni1">[47]</xref>. Although our mAbatrs were not selected on an antigen-binding capacity basis, they showed a very high specificity to Atr-I and <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom. We demonstrated that they do not recognize either other P-I SVMPs from Latin American pit viper venoms that present high degrees of similarity to Atr-I (i.e. Mut-II and BaP1, 57% of identity and Leuc-a, 52% of identity), or any other South American whole venoms from species that share the Amazonia forest as habitat with <italic>B. atrox</italic>.</p>
<p>In the Amazonian forest, the snake <italic>Lachesis muta muta</italic> is responsible for approximately 10% of all snakebites, and the symptoms of this accident are very similar to <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming. Currently, there is no laboratory diagnostic able to differentiate <italic>B. atrox</italic> from <italic>L. muta muta</italic> envenoming. Therefore, we have developed a simple test for discriminating <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming from envenoming caused by other genera. To avoid unnecessary animal suffering, we have bled Swiss mice and prepared a mixture of their sera with different venoms, simulating experimental envenoming. ELISA plates were coated with polyspecific anti-bothropic antivenom (FUNED – Brasil) to capture antigens from different venoms. Using a pool of mAbatrs, only antigens from <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom were recognized, presenting an absorbance signal double that of pre-immune sera, suggesting that our mAbatrs could be useful in the development of a differential diagnostic for <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming.</p>
<p>Western blot assays using mAbatr and purified Atr-I or <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom were done under reducing (not shown) and non-reducing conditions.

Due to the likely evolution of toxins by gene duplication and diversification, some epitopes may be kept unchanged during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Calvete1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fry1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fry2">[52]</xref> and common epitopic motifs recognized by mAbatrs might be shared by some different classes of SVMPs in <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom, which could explain the cross-reacting bands around 30 and 55 kDa in Western Blot assay, as observed before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-EstevaoCosta1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tanjoni1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tanjoni2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Lomonte2">[54]</xref>. However, the recognition of the band at ∼15 kDa is probably not the result of an interaction between mAbatrs and PLA<sub>2</sub> since the overall shape of PLA<sub>2</sub> molecules differ from SVMPs structures. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the reacting band at 15 kDa might be either an artifact or result of SVMPs autolysis/degradation.</p>
<p>None of our mAbatrs recognized overlapping synthetic peptides from the Atr-I primary sequence, confirming that the conformation of Atr-I is very important in recognition by mAbatrs and suggesting that all mAbatrs bind to conformational epitopes. Few works have reported on the molecular interaction of monoclonal antibodies with their respective epitopes in SVMPs. Apparently, neutralizing mAbs against P-I SVMPs interact predominantly via conformational structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fernandes1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tanjoni1">[47]</xref>. Further studies are necessary to better characterize the functional epitopes recognized by mAbatrs and to clarify their role in the biological activity of Atr-I. However, recognition of loops adjacent to the methionine-turn near to the catalytic region, which is an important region for the catalytic activity and determines substrate specificity, might explain the neutralizating activities of mAbatrs. Moreover, this region presents the highest variability in SVMPs, which could account to the high mAbatrs' specificity for Atr-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Ramos1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Akao1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>mAbatr6 (K<sub>D</sub> = 8.52×10<sup>−9</sup> M), mAbatr1 (K<sub>D</sub> = 12.0×10<sup>−9</sup> M) and mAbatr2 (K<sub>D</sub> = 15.1×10<sup>−9</sup> M), showed the highest affinities for Atr-I. Despite the fact that the hybridoma selection method we designed was based on function and not on binding, mAbatrs presented nanomolar equilibrium constants for their binding to Atr-I. This affinity is in the same range as that found in mAbs against others SVMPs, which were selected through affinity-based ELISA assays. When selected conventionally by binding assays, mAbs against SVMPs do not present a correlation between affinity and inhibitory action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fernandes1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tanjoni1">[47]</xref>. However, it is interesting to note that there is a clear correlation between the measured affinity of mAbatrs to Atr-I and their neutralizing efficacy.</p>
<p>Three mAbs (mAbatr1, mAbatr2 and mAbatr6) efficiently neutralized proteolysis induced by both Atr-I and <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom upon Abz-LVEALYQ-EDDnp. As hemorrhagic activity of SVMPs is dependent on their enzymatic activities, we decided to test whether mAbatr1, 2 and 6 could prevent hemorrhage induced by either Atr-I or <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although mAbatr1, mAbatr2 and mAbatr6 presented a slightly weaker inhibitory activity on synthetic substrate compared to anti-BaP1 monoclonal antibodies MABaP1-3 and MABaP1-6; mAbtr1, 2 and 6 fully neutralized <italic>in vivo</italic> hemorrhage induced by Atr-I isolated or <italic>B. atrox</italic> whole venom when preincubations with mAbs were performed.</p>
<p>Brazilian and Peruvian <italic>B. atrox</italic> venoms are composed mainly by SVMPs, including P-I and P-III classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Queiroz1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Kohlhoff1">[25]</xref>, which are the main molecules responsible for the hemorrhagic activity in <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming. The possible cross-reactivity against some other SVMPs present in <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom, but not all of them, may play a key role in neutralization of <italic>B. atrox</italic> whole venom in hemorrhage and could explain the weaker neutralizing ability of mAbatrs against <italic>B. atrox</italic> whole venom tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. The neutralization of other bothropic South American venoms was not tested, since all mAbatrs were very specific and recognized only <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom.</p>
<p>Currently, the standard procedure used, even for monoclonal antibodies, to measure the neutralization capacity of an antivenom against the hemorrhagic activity of snake venoms consists in the preparation of a mixture of venom and antivenom, followed by injection of this preincubated mixture in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Fernandes1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-EstevaoCosta1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Tanjoni2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Morine1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002826-Frauches1">[58]</xref>. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that once mAbatrs bind to Atr-I and/or Atr-I-like molecules in preincubation step of our hemorrhagic assay these hemorrhagins are sterically hindered and not able to bind to their <italic>in vivo</italic> molecular targets, leading to the abolishment of hemorrhage. On the other hand, when mAbatrs are not preincubated with <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom, hemorrhage is still observed, suggesting that when hemorrhagins are first injected in animals, they bind to and degrade their <italic>in vivo</italic> molecular targets and become inaccessible to mAbatrs. Further studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of preincubation steps of mabs and SVMPs in studies of neutralization of hemorrhage induced by SVMPs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we developed an efficient method for functional antibody screening, based on a synthetic biosensor to produce mAbs specifically neutralizing P-I SVMPs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a functional screening has been used in order to select monoclonal antibodies able to block the toxic effects of SVMPs. It is also the first description of mAbs against Atr-I, isolated from <italic>B. atrox</italic> venom, with inhibitory potential against toxic activities of purified Atr-I and <italic>B. atrox</italic> crude venom. It is still unknown where neutralizing mAbatrs bind to Atr-I. Further, mAbatrs are highly specific to <italic>B. atrox</italic> antigens and may be useful as diagnostic tools for <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming. These very encouraging results open the way for a wider utilization of synthetic biosensors in functional screening aiming at the production of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies for further therapeutic approaches or diagnostic assays against <italic>B. atrox</italic> envenoming.</p>
