<abstract>
<p>In 2006, we reported a <italic>mariner</italic> (<italic>Mos1</italic>)-transformed <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> line, Carb77, which was highly resistant to dengue-2 virus (DENV2). Carb77 mosquitoes expressed a DENV2-specific inverted-repeat (IR) RNA in midgut epithelial cells after ingesting an infectious bloodmeal. The IR-RNA formed double-stranded DENV2-derived RNA, initiating an intracellular antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) response. However, Carb77 mosquitoes stopped expressing the IR-RNA after 17 generations in culture and lost their DENV2-refractory phenotype. In the current study, we generated new transgenic lines having the identical transgene as Carb77. One of these lines, Carb109M, has been genetically stable and refractory to DENV2 for &gt;33 generations. Southern blot analysis identified two transgene integration sites in Carb109M. Northern blot analysis detected abundant, transient expression of the IR-RNA 24 h after a bloodmeal. Carb109M mosquitoes were refractory to different DENV2 genotypes but not to other DENV serotypes. To further test fitness and stability, we introgressed the Carb109M transgene into a genetically diverse laboratory strain (GDLS) by backcrossing for five generations and selecting individuals expressing the transgene's EGFP marker in each generation. Comparison of transgene stability in replicate backcross 5 (BC<sub>5</sub>) lines versus BC<sub>1</sub> control lines demonstrated that backcrossing dramatically increased transgene stability. We subjected six BC<sub>5</sub> lines to five generations of selection based on EGFP marker expression to increase the frequency of the transgene prior to final family selection. Comparison of the observed transgene frequencies in the six replicate lines relative to expectations from Fisher's selection model demonstrated lingering fitness costs associated with either the transgene or linked deleterious genes. Although minimal fitness loss (relative to GDLS) was manifest in the final family selection stage, we were able to select homozygotes for the transgene in one family, Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ. This family has been genetically stable and DENV2 refractory for multiple generations. Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ represents an important line for testing proof-of-principle vector population replacement.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Expression of a DENV2 sequence-derived IR RNA in the mosquito midgut initiates an antiviral intracellular RNAi response that efficiently blocks DENV2 infection and profoundly impairs vector competence for that virus in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. DENV2-specific IR RNA expression in the Carb109M strain has maintained the RNAi-based, refractory phenotype for 33 generations in laboratory culture. The two transgene integration sites were stable after multiple generations and following introgression into a genetically-diverse (GDLS) <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population. Introgression of the transgene into the GDLS genetic background changed GDLS from a DENV2 susceptible phenotype to a DENV2 refractory phenotype. The DENV2 refractory homozygous line, Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ, exhibits (relative to GDLS) minimal fitness loss associated with the transgene. This line could be a potential candidate for proof-of-principle field studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV1-4; <italic>Flaviviridae; Flavivirus</italic>) are considered the most important mosquito-transmitted arboviruses infecting humans. Epidemiologists have estimated 100â€“390 million people per year acquire DENV infections in tropical and subtropical regions of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Guzman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Bhatt1">[2]</xref>. Dengue disease symptoms range from mild febrile illness, referred to as dengue fever (DF), to severe disease dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Gubler1">[3]</xref>. DENV prevalence is increasing rapidly throughout South-East Asia, and Central-and South-America due to rapid urbanization, increased trade and human traffic. DENV in these regions can be hyper-endemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Weaver1">[4]</xref>, further increasing the risk of DHF. Furthermore, virulent strains have been introduced in the last decades from South-East Asia into Central-America and the Caribbean replacing endogenous DENV2 genotypes and causing more cases of DHF and DSS among local populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Gubler2">[5]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-LoronoPino1">[7]</xref>. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutic drugs readily available to the more than two billion people at risk for DENV infection or the tens of millions manifesting some level of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Bhatt1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Hombach1">[8]</xref>. Thus, DENV prevention relies on vector control through indoor insecticide spraying, using insecticide treated door/window curtains and reducing the number of potential oviposition sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Strickman1">[9]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-GarciaRejon1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The principal vector of DENV is the peridomestic mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (L.), which is distributed widely in many regions of the world and is a major factor contributing to the global incidence of DEN disease. Novel alternative vector control strategies are now being tested that use genetically-modified <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> carrying a dominant-lethal gene (RIDL) to reduce mosquito populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Harris1">[12]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Facchinelli1">[14]</xref>. A second novel concept in DEN disease control is replacement of DENV-competent mosquito populations with DENV-refractory vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Curtis1">[15]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz2">[17]</xref>. The work presented here describes the generation of a new <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> transgenic strain, Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ, which expresses an anti-DENV2 gene construct and is highly refractory to the virus after being introgressed into a genetically diverse laboratory strain (GDLS).</p>
<p><italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females acquire a DENV-containing bloodmeal from a viremic human host. DENV initially infects midgut epithelial cells and 4â€“5 days later disseminates to hemocytes, fat body, nervous system tissues, and salivary glands. The mosquito can transmit virus to a new host 10 to 14 days post-infection (dpi) depending on ambient conditions, virus strain and mosquito competence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Salazar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Richardson1">[19]</xref>. DENV is confronted inside the mosquito cell by the innate antiviral, exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Ghildiyal1">[20]</xref>. The antiviral, siRNA arm of the RNAi pathway is a major defense used by mosquitoes early in infection with arboviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Blair1">[21]</xref>. The sequence-dependent RNAi pathway has been described in great detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-vanRij1">[22]</xref>. During a typical mosquito infection with DENV, 21 nt virus-derived siRNAs (or viRNAs) are readily detectable, indicating that the RNAi machinery degrades viral genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-SanchezVargas1">[23]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Scott1">[25]</xref>. We showed that DENV titers increase in vectors when the RNAi pathway is impaired leading to significantly higher midgut infections and dissemination rates and shorter extrinsic incubation periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-SanchezVargas1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Khoo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Khoo2">[27]</xref>. Thus, the RNAi pathway modulates DENV replication in the mosquito and may keep virus concentrations below a threshold that could become detrimental to insect fitness.</p>
<p>Even though <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has a highly functional antiviral RNAi pathway, the vector remains an efficient transmitter of DENV. DENVs may have evolved mechanisms to counter the mosquito antiviral RNAi response. Schnettler and colleagues reported that the 3â€²UTR of the DENV genome generates a subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) that modulates RNAi as part of a counter-defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Schnettler1">[28]</xref>. Our strategy has been to initiate a DENV2-specific RNAi response in midgut epithelial cells within the first few hours following acquisition of a viremic bloodmeal and thereby prevent the virus from establishing infection foci in these cells. This RNAi-mediated midgut infection barrier should prevent further accumulation of sfRNAs or other RNAi-modulating factors the virus uses to counteract the RNAi response. We hypothesize that perturbing homeostasis between vector RNAi defense and virus counter-response and establishing a specific antiviral RNAi response coincident with infection will reduce vector competence and lower disease transmission.</p>
<p>The successful use of genetically-modified mosquitoes for gene replacement in the field requires stable effector gene expression over many generations and across diverse genetic backgrounds to maintain the DENV refractory phenotype. Furthermore, effector genes need to be designed that target each of the four DENV serotypes and the many different DENV genotypes that arise among serotypes. Ideally, these transgenes should have minimal fitness costs relative to wild-type mosquitoes or the transgenic mosquito is unlikely to spread the effector gene through the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Beaty1">[29]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-James1">[31]</xref>. Earlier studies suggest evidence of a fitness load associated with transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Catteruccia1">[32]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Moreira1">[34]</xref>. However, these studies failed to assess this effect in different genetic backgrounds. Without this information the effect of the transgene cannot be distinguished from the generally low fitness imposed by deleterious recessive alleles as they become homozygous in inbred lines. Assessing transgene loads absolutely requires its analysis in diverse genetic backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Scott2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, we described the generation of a transgenic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> line, Carb77, which was engineered to be refractory to DENV2 by expressing an IR effector RNA in midgut tissue for a 24â€“48 h period after receiving a bloodmeal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz1">[16]</xref>. Carb77 mosquitoes exhibited a strong midgut infection barrier for DENV2. However, Carb77 mosquitoes eventually lost their refractory phenotype for DENV2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz2">[17]</xref>. The transgene sequence was fully intact in Carb77 G<sub>17</sub>, but the IR RNA was no longer detected by Northern blot analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz2">[17]</xref>. We speculated that the loss of IR-RNA expression could have been due to chromatin/heterochromatin rearrangements that enabled regulatory elements of neighboring or even distant genes to silence the transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Sabl1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we engineered new transgenic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> lines harboring the same transgene as line Carb77 to further evaluate genetic and phenotypic stability associated with the transgene. One of these lines, Carb109M, was highly refractory to DENV2 infection. To evaluate the effect of genetic background on transgene stability, we performed five generations of backcrossing into a genetically-diverse laboratory strain (GDLS) derived from field collections of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from southern Mexico <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-WisedeValdez1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Deus1">[36]</xref>. We selected for the EGFP eye marker associated with the transgene in each of the five backcross generations to produce six BC<sub>5</sub> lines. The BC<sub>5</sub> lines were subject to five generations of selection for the EGFP eye marker to increase the frequency of the transgene prior to final family selection. We were able to select one family, Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ,that has maintained the DENV2 refractory phenotype for multiple intercrossed generations. Our results illustrate clearly the importance of outcrossing transgenes into genetically diverse, preferably recently-colonized, strains before attempting to assess transgene-associated fitness loads and certainly before using genetically modified strains in population cage or field experiments.</p>

<p>All <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> colonies were maintained in a BSL2/Arthropod Containment Level 2 (ACL2) insectary as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz1">[16]</xref>. The temperature in the insectary was 28Â°C with 75â€“80% relative humidity and a 12 h light/12 h darkness cycle. Adults were generally maintained in 1ft<sup>3</sup> cages and fed on raisins. For routine rearing and maintenance, mated females (approximately 1-week post-eclosure) received artificial bloodmeals consisting of citrated sheep blood. Females were allowed to oviposit eggs on paper towel strips inserted into small water-filled oviposition cups. The eggs deposited on papers (or eggliners) were viable for up to 3â€“4 months before hatching. Eggs were hatched in pans containing sterile, de-aerated water to synchronize the hatch and larvae were fed ground TetraMin (Melle, Germany) aquarium food. Pupae were separated and placed into water-filled cups. Pupae identified as females based upon size were mixed with male pupae at a ratio of âˆ¼1âˆ¶20. Two cups with up to 500 female pupae were placed in a 1ft<sup>3</sup> cage prior to eclosion.</p>

Five larvae from each of the 10 strains were placed into 1 liter of tap water, poured into a 4 liter plastic box and fed as described above. The resulting adult females were mated to males from the same box and then bloodfed. The eggs arising from these matings were used in the initial HTL x GDLS intercrosses and in each of the subsequent five backcross generations. Virgin HTL females were placed in a cage with virgin GDLS males in each backcross, and reciprocally, virgin HTL males were placed in a separate cage with virgin GDLS females. Females were bloodfed and allowed to oviposit. Eggs were hatched, raised to third instar larvae and larvae lacking EGFP eye marker expression (wild-type homozygotes) were counted and culled. Two hundred larvae expressing EGFP were reared to adults and virgin adults then were mated to virgin GDLS. This backcross procedure was repeated four more times to yield HTL/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>. Theoretically, five generations of backcrossing should generate mosquitoes in which 31 of every 32 alleles (97%) are expected to have originated from the GDLS strain.

<title>Transgene frequencies in HTL (BC<sub>1</sub> and BC<sub>5</sub>)</title>
<p>Due to the number of backcrosses and the selection scheme in this study we limited our analysis of transgene frequency to two HTL lines generically termed here as HTL1 and HTL2. Selection of HTL1 and HTL2 was based on the two lines having the strongest, most consistent DENV2 refractory phenotype. After the first backcross, four groups of fifteen lines were initiated to assess whether backcrossing affected transgene stability. The first set of 15 lines was initiated by crossing a HTL1/GDLS.BC<sub>1</sub> heterozygote with a GDLS parent to generate offspring having an initial HTL1allele frequency of 0.25. The offspring were allowed to inter-mate randomly. The expected frequency of EGFP-positive offspring through five generations (F<sub>1</sub>â€“F<sub>5</sub>) was 0.4375, based on Hardy-Weinberg expectations (0.25<sup>2</sup> transgene homozygotes +2*0.25*(1â€“0.25) transgene heterozygotes). The second set of 15 lines was generated by intercrossing HTL1/GDLS.BC<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes so that the initial frequency of the HTL1 allele was 0.5. The expected frequency of EGFP-expressing larvae in F<sub>1</sub>â€“F<sub>5</sub> was 0.75 (0.5<sup>2</sup> transgene homozygotes +2*0.5*(1â€“0.5) transgene heterozygotes). The third and fourth sets of 15 lines were the same as for the first and second sets except that HTL2/GDLS.BC<sub>1</sub> were used. These 60 lines were maintained without selection of EGFP expressing larvae for five generations and the frequency of EGFP larvae was estimated in âˆ¼150 larvae from each of the 15 lines in each generation. This same process was repeated for the BC<sub>5</sub> offspring.</p>
<p>The relative fitness loads of the transgene in homozygotes, heterozygotes and fitness of wild-type homozygotes were estimated by identifying the fitness coefficients in Fisher's Selection Model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Fisher1">[45]</xref> that most closely fit the observed proportion of larvae expressing EGFP (pEGFP<sub>t</sub>) in each of the six generations.

Siblings from each of the thirty families were screened for EGFP expression and families with all siblings expressing EGFP were reared to adults and intercrossed. These offspring were reared to adults, intercrossed, bloodfed, eggs collected and hatched. These offspring were again screened for EGFP expression. Families, in which all siblings expressed EGFP were combined and maintained as homozygous (HZ) lines for further experiments.

DENV2 prevalence in Carb1M, Carb1F, Carb22M, and Carb96F at 7 and 14 dpi was not significantly different from that observed in the DENV2 competent control lines (HWE and Carb52) and as a consequence these lines were not further used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002833-t001">Table 1</xref>).

However, the hybridization signal was faint even after long exposure times of the northern blot and consistent with the weaker virus resistant phenotype especially in later generations.

<title>IR-RNA processing in Carb109M by the endogenous RNAi machinery</title>
<p>We performed NextGen sequencing with Carb109M to detect size and specificity of small RNAs generated from the IR-RNA of the effector gene. NextGen sequencing of size-fractionated, total RNA from Carb109M midguts at 20 h post-bloodmeal was performed to determine whether the expressed IR-RNA was processed as a double-stranded RNA by the vector's RNAi machinery. The DENV2-specific small RNA profile revealed that the IR RNA was processed into siRNAs within hours of Carb109M mosquitoes ingesting a bloodmeal containing no virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002833-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Alignment of the small RNA sequences to the whole genome of DENV2-Jamaica1409 revealed a cluster of small RNAs from nucleotide positions nt 450â€“1000 mapping to the prM-M coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002833-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Alignment of the small RNA sequences to the 568 nt region of DENV2-Jamaica1409 RNA targeted by the IR effector sequence had significant overlap with sequences at nucleotide positions corresponding to the prM-M coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002833-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Small regions of complementarity were concentrated at nucleotide positions 260â€“440, with representation reaching up to 220 read counts per small RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002833-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Size-distribution plotting of small RNAs showed that the predominant size was 21 nucleotides; the hallmark of the antiviral siRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002833-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, there was a bias towards siRNAs in antisense orientation even though it was expected that RNAi degradation of the IR effector would have produced equal proportions of sense- and antisense-oriented siRNAs.</p>

This supports the conclusion that either the transgene has a dominant fitness load or that a deleterious allele(s) was linked (in <italic>cis</italic>) to the transgene insertion site. In contrast, the proportions of EGFP-expressing larvae in Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub> and Carb109F/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub> when initiated at p<sub>0</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.5 were 0.4881 and 0.4782 in F<sub>5</sub>. However, the 95% HDI surrounding these frequencies did not contain the predicted 0.75 allele frequency. Again the predicted fitness coefficient for transgene homozygotes was W<sub>AA</sub> â€Š=â€Š0.01 in all four experiments while W<sub>Aa</sub> varied from 0.94â€“1.00, which actually exceeded W<sub>aa</sub> (0.65â€“0.93) in the four BC<sub>5</sub> experiments.

The fact that the predicted fitness coefficient for transgene homozygotes was very low (W<sub>AA</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.01), whereas fitness coefficients for transgene heterozygotes (W<sub>Aa</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.94â€“0.95) and those for wildtypes (W<sub>aa</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.81â€“0.93) were significantly higher supports the interpretation that the wild-type allele had a dominant positive effect on fitness. Thus, five generations of backcrossing did not change the fitness of transgene homozygotes but greatly improved the fitness of transgene heterozygotes.</p>

<title>Fitness of the Carb109F and Carb109M transgenes during selection</title>
<p>Selection was applied to three lines each of Carb109F/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub> and Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub> heterozygotes. In each generation wild-type larvae were culled and mosquitoes were allowed to inter-mate.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We showed in an earlier proof of principle study that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> can be genetically modified for DENV resistance by establishing an RNAi-based infection barrier in the midgut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz1">[16]</xref>. However, Carb77 eventually lost its refractory phenotype to DENV2 before we completed introgression of the transgene into a more genetically diverse vector population. Here, we have developed and characterized a panel of new transgenic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> lines and have identified additional lines refractory to DENV2 and suitable for introgression studies. In previous, unpublished experiments (Dr. Bill Black, CSU) a transgene was introgressed into GDLS and after 5 backcrosses, 4 generations of selection and construction of the final strain from only 34 families there was only a very small decrease in genetic diversity (a drop from 0.257 to 0.251). Allele frequencies did not change at four of 10 loci. Given the very large numbers of genomes involved in these experiments, we considered it unlikely that these shifts arose via genetic drift but rather reflect laboratory adaptations. Our conclusion was that the transgene introgression strategy into GDLS was effective in maintaining genetic diversity. We report the development of a mosquito line (Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ) expressing an antiviral effector RNA in the midgut, and displaying a refractory DENV2 phenotype. This line should be suitable for analyzing and modeling transgene spread between mosquito populations using strategies such as Reduce and Replace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Robert1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Okamoto1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>The development and characterization of one transgenic line, Carb109M, resulted in five key findings. First, the transgenic genotype and DENV2 refractory phenotype of Carb109M mosquitoes in a HWE genetic background has remained stable over 33 generations. Second, the DENV2 refractory phenotype remained stable after five consecutive backcrosses into a genetically diverse background followed by four generations of selection and two generations of family-based selection. Third, backcrossing the transgene dramatically improved the fitness of the transgene heterozygotes from W<sub>Aa</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.11â€“0.21 after one backcross to W<sub>Aa</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.94â€“1.00 after five generations of backcrossing. However, the fitness of transgene homozygotes remained at W<sub>AA</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.01 after five generations of backcrossing. Fourth, four generations of selection improved transgene homozygous fitness from W<sub>AA</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.01 to 0.32â€“0.51 in the F replicates and from W<sub>AA</sub>â€Š=â€Š0.01 to 0.72â€“0.77 in the M replicates. As discussed below, this is consistent with the presence of a deleterious recessive allele linked with the transgene but which gradually became unlinked with recombination. Fifth, family based selection involving 180 families yielded only one homozygous line (Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>).HZ line. This line was highly refractory to DENV2.</p>
<p>We observed a few Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ individuals infected with DENV2. This also was observed with Carb77 mosquitoes and may be a consequence of using artificial bloodmeals, which occasionally might lead to a leaky midgut phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Weaver2">[49]</xref>. A concern is the possibility that the antiviral IR-RNA and siRNAs from the transgene promote selection for viral escape mutants, capable of evading our RNAi-based strategy. However, our results show that nucleotide sequence diversity over the 568 nt target region of the DENV2-specific RNAi trigger can reach 14% without compromising the sequence-dependent RNAi degradation mechanism. This presumably occurs because a number of siRNAs derived from the 568 bp effector RNA have exact matches with the sequence of each of the DENV2 genotypes. At this point we consider it unlikely that the effector RNA of Carb109M could select for a viable DENV2 mutant that has &gt;14% sequence diversity in the prM-M encoding region of its viral RNA to escape the RNAi response in the transgenic mosquitoes. Nevertheless, the possible occurrence of RNAi escape mutants will be addressed in future experiments.</p>
<p>The transgene integration pattern in Carb109M may account for the strong DENV2 resistance phenotype. In contrast to Carb77, which had a single transgene integration event, Carb109M and Carb109F mosquitoes appear to have two independent insertions, which potentially result in an increased dose of the IR-RNA effector. If the quantity of IR-RNA produced in a cell is a rate-limiting factor determining the efficiency of the RNAi response, higher IR-RNA expression would degrade a proportionally higher number of target RNAs at any given time. The site of transgene integration cannot be targeted using a TE such as <italic>mariner Mos1</italic> as the insertion vector, and this may lead to position-effects impacting transgene expression. A reason for the loss of the resistance phenotype in Carb77 mosquitoes could have been chromatin re-arrangements that led to silencing of the IR effector gene expression while leaving the transgene intact at the DNA level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Irvin1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Sabl1">[35]</xref>. In contrast, Carb109M had an integration of the transgene in the 3â€²UTR of the polyadenylate binding protein gene (AAEL010318) and another in a highly repetitive DNA motif. At this point we cannot explain why the integration pattern of the transgene in Carb109M mosquitoes produced more stable effector RNA expression than that observed in Carb77 mosquitoes. Two strategies can be employed to avoid transgene position effects in arthropods. One strategy is the use of a site-specific recombination system such as Ï† C31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Franz3">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Nimmo1">[50]</xref>. Another strategy is the use of chromatin insulators such as those derived from the Drosophila <italic>gypsy</italic> retrotransposon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Gdula1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Sarkar1">[52]</xref>, which have not currently been used in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.</p>
<p>We propose that the initial rate and pattern of decline in the frequency of EGFP-expressing BC<sub>1</sub> and BC<sub>5</sub> larvae maintained without selection is consistent with the presence of deleterious or lethal recessive allele (or allele) originating from the HWE chromosome into which the transgene was originally inserted. This would explain why five generations of backcrossing increased the fitness of transgene heterozygotes but not homozygotes. Only a single wild-type allele would have been sufficient to cover the deleterious recessive allele linked to the transgene in heterozygotes. It is unlikely that the transgene itself was under negative selection due, for example, to overexpression of the EGFP reporter or the transgene disrupting expression of the polyadenylate-binding protein gene into which it is inserted. The insertion site is 679 bp 3â€² from the stop codon in the 3â€²UTR. Further, if the transgene itself were under strong negative selection we would not have succeeded in breeding a homozygous Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ line. Nor would backcrossing and selection have improved the fitness of transgene homozygotes and heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002833-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have documented deleterious and lethal recessives in inbred lines of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and several loci of this type have been mapped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Wallis1">[53]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-GomezMachorro1">[55]</xref>. These are maintained as heterozygotes through balancing selection. Through rare recombination during backcrossing and selection, the deleterious allele of HWE origin might have recombined once or a few times with wild type alleles from the GDLS and thus become disassociated with the transgene. An additional factor may be that the GDLS strain was generally more fit than the HWE strain, which was inbred initially to generate homozygous white-eye mosquitoes and then maintained for over 20 years in the laboratory. In this case, a beneficial gene originating from the GDLS background would have become linked to the Carb109 transgene.</p>
<p>If this is the case then we believe that crossover events between wild-type GDLS alleles and/or deleterious alleles from the HWE strain were rare (i.e. the transgene and deleterious alleles were closely linked). This would explain why eventually only one of the six selected lines responded to selection in the predicted manner. It also would explain the discrepancy between the final allele frequencies in the BC<sub>5</sub> F and M replicate strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002833-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). Residual linkage between the transgene and deleterious allele would also explain why family based selection on 180 families yielded only one homozygous Carb109M/GDLS.BC<sub>5</sub>.HZ line.</p>
<p>Regardless of the mechanism, the results of the backcross and selection experiments emphasize the importance of outcrossing transgenes into genetically-diverse, recently-colonized strains before attempting to assess fitness loads imposed by the transgene and certainly before driving transgenes into natural or laboratory-maintained populations. Two additional components will be necessary to successfully implement a population replacement-based DENV control strategy in the field. (1) Design of an effector gene that targets and destroys simultaneously the genomes of all four DENV serotypes. Earlier attempts to design a tetravalent IR effector gene targeting the NS5 region of all four DENVs failed due to technical problems, although we are confident this problem can be overcome. (2) The anti-DENV effector gene may require linkage to an <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-specific gene drive system to enable fixation of the transgene in the target population. The Reduce and Replace strategies and killer-rescue based gene drive systems such as Medea are currently under development in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Robert1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Okamoto1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Chen1">[56]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002833-Gould1">[58]</xref>.</p>
