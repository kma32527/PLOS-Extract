<title>Background</title>
<p>Field-applicable tests detecting asymptomatic <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (<italic>M. leprae</italic>) infection or predicting progression to leprosy, are urgently required. Since the outcome of <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection is determined by cellular- and humoral immunity, we aim to develop diagnostic tests detecting pro-/anti-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines as well as antibodies against <italic>M. leprae</italic>. Previously, we developed lateral flow assays (LFA) for detection of cytokines and anti-PGL-I antibodies. Here we evaluate progress of newly developed LFAs for applications in resource-poor settings.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The combined diagnostic value of IP-10, IL-10 and anti-PGL-I antibodies was tested using <italic>M. leprae</italic>-stimulated blood of leprosy patients and endemic controls (EC). For reduction of the overall test-to-result time the minimal whole blood assay time required to detect distinctive responses was investigated. To accommodate LFAs for field settings, dry-format LFAs for IP-10 and anti-PGL-I antibodies were developed allowing storage and shipment at ambient temperatures. Additionally, a multiplex LFA-format was applied for simultaneous detection of anti-PGL-I antibodies and IP-10. For improved sensitivity and quantitation upconverting phosphor (UCP) reporter technology was applied in all LFAs.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Single and multiplex UCP-LFAs correlated well with ELISAs. The performance of dry reagent assays and portable, lightweight UCP-LF strip readers indicated excellent field-robustness. Notably, detection of IP-10 levels in stimulated samples allowed a reduction of the whole blood assay time from 24 h to 6 h. Moreover, IP-10/IL-10 ratios in unstimulated plasma differed significantly between patients and EC, indicating the feasibility to identify <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection in endemic areas.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Dry-format UCP-LFAs are low-tech, robust assays allowing detection of relevant cytokines and antibodies in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> in the field. The high levels of IP-10 and the required shorter whole blood assay time, render this cytokine useful to discriminate between leprosy patients and EC.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Leprosy is one of the six diseases considered by WHO as a major threat in developing countries and often results in severe, life-long disabilities and deformities due to delayed diagnosis. Early detection of <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (<italic>M. leprae</italic>) infection, followed by effective interventions, is considered vital to interrupt transmission. Thus, field-friendly tests that detect asymptomatic <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection are urgently required. The clinical outcome after <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection is determined by the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic>. In this study, we developed lateral flow assays (LFA) for detection of pro-inflammatory (IP-10) vs. anti-inflammatory/regulatory (IL-10) cellular immunity as well as antibodies against <italic>M. leprae</italic> and evaluated these in a field setting in Ethiopia using lightweight, portable readers. We show that detection of IP-10 allowed a significant reduction of the overall test-to-result time from 24 h to 6 h. Moreover, IP-10/IL-10 ratios in unstimulated plasma differed significantly between patients and EC, which can provide means to identify <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection. Thus, the LFAs are low-tech, robust assays that can be applied in resource-poor settings measuring immunity to <italic>M. leprae</italic> and can be used as tools for early diagnosis of leprosy leading to timely treatment and reduced transmission.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leprosy, a curable infectious disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (<italic>M. leprae</italic>) that affects the skin and peripheral nerves, is one of the six diseases considered by the WHO as a major threat in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-1">[1]</xref>. Despite being treatable, leprosy often results in severe, life-long disabilities and deformities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Ridley1">[2]</xref> due to delayed- or misdiagnosis. Transmission of leprosy is clearly unabated as evidenced by the number of new cases, 10% of whom are children, that plateaued at nearly 250,000 each year since 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-1">[1]</xref>. Continued transmission in endemic areas likely occurs from the large reservoir of individuals who are infected subclinically. Thus, early detection of <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection, followed by effective interventions, is considered vital to interrupt transmission as highlighted by the WHO 2011–2015 global strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Burki1">[3]</xref>. Despite this pressing need, field-friendly tests that detect asymptomatic <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection are lacking, nor are there any biomarkers known that predict progression to disease in infected individuals.</p>
<p>Lateral flow assays (LFAs), are simple immunochromatographic assays detecting the presence of target analytes in samples without the need for specialized and costly equipment. Combinations of LFAs with up-converting phosphor (UCP) reporter technology are useful for detection of a variety of analytes, e.g., drugs of abuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Niedbala1">[4]</xref>, protein and polysaccharide antigens from pathogens like <italic>Schistosoma</italic> and <italic>Brucella</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Qu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-vanDam1">[6]</xref>, bacterial and viral nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Zuiderwijk1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Chen1">[8]</xref> and antibodies against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, HIV, hepatitis virus and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Hong1">[11]</xref>. The phosphorescent reporter utilized in UCP-LFAs is excited with infrared light to generate visible light, a process called up-conversion. UCP-based assays are highly sensitive since up-conversion does not occur in nature, avoiding interference by autofluorescence of other assay components. Importantly, UCP-LF test strips can be stored as permanent records allowing re-analysis in a reference laboratory.</p>
<p>In leprosy, the innate and adaptive immune response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> matches the clinical manifestations as substantiated by the characteristic spectrum ranging from strong Th1 immunity in tuberculoid leprosy to high antibody titers to <italic>M. leprae</italic> with Th2 cytokine responses in lepromatous leprosy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Scollard1">[12]</xref>. In view of this spectral character, field-applicable tests for leprosy should allow simultaneously detection of biomarkers for humoral- as well as cellular immunity.</p>
<p>Tests used in leprosy diagnostics include the broadly investigated serological assay detecting IgM against PGL-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Spencer1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Oskam1">[14]</xref>. Although this test is useful for detection of most multibacillary (MB) patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-BuhrerSekula1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Goulart1">[16]</xref>, as the antibody levels correlate well with the bacillary load, detection of anti-PGL-I Ab has limited value in identifying paucibacillary (PB) leprosy patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Spencer2">[17]</xref>. In areas hyperendemic for leprosy more than 50% of young schoolchildren surveyed had positive anti-PGL-I responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Barreto1">[18]</xref>. Still, the vast majority of individuals with a positive antibody titer will never develop leprosy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Spencer1">[13]</xref>. With respect to cellular responses in leprosy diagnosis, studies have focussed on <italic>M. leprae</italic>-unique antigens which can probe T-cell <italic>M. leprae</italic>-specific responses resulting in the identification of <italic>M. leprae</italic> (-unique) antigens that specifically induced IFN-γ production in <italic>M. leprae</italic> infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk2">[20]</xref>. Combined with serology, the use of these IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) provided significant added value since they identified the majority (71%) of PGL-I negative healthy household contacts in Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk3">[21]</xref> while control individuals not exposed to <italic>M. leprae</italic> were IGRA-negative. Similar IGRAs allowed detection of the extent of <italic>M. leprae</italic> exposure along a proximity gradient in EC in one city in Brazil and in Ethiopia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk4">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Martins1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although ELISA techniques, as used in IGRAs, are more widely applied than before, they still require laboratory facilities which are not available at all health centres in leprosy endemic areas. To accommodate ELISAs to field-applicable tests for leprosy diagnosis, we previously developed UCP-LFAs for detection of IFN-γ and IL-10 as well as antibodies against the <italic>M. leprae</italic>-specific phenolic glycolipid-I (PGL-I) for high-tech, laboratory-based microtiter-plate readers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens3">[26]</xref>. Since IFN-γ, the hallmark cytokine of Th1 cells, has generally been assessed as a biomarker to detect anti-mycobacterial immunity, we first developed a IFN-γ-UCP-LFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens2">[25]</xref>. Recently, IFN-γ induced protein 10 (IP-10) was found useful for detection of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Ruhwald1">[27]</xref> and can also be used to indicate levels of <italic>M. leprae</italic> exposure and thereby the risk of infection and subsequent transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk4">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Bobosha1">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, since IP-10 is produced in large quantities, facilitating the use of simplified test platforms such as LFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Aabye1">[28]</xref>, we investigated its potential as an alternative to IFN-γ for leprosy diagnosis. Accordingly, we developed quantitative, dry reagent UCP-LFAs for field-detection of IP-10 and anti-PGL-I antibodies and evaluated these in a leprosy endemic area in Ethiopia.</p>

<title>Study participants</title>
<p>HIV-negative, newly diagnosed untreated leprosy patients and healthy endemic controls (EC) were recruited at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, The Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) and the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC), The Netherlands from October 2011 until November 2012. Leprosy was diagnosed based on clinical, bacteriological and histological observations and classified by a skin biopsy evaluated according to the Ridley and Jopling classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Ridley1">[2]</xref> by qualified personnel. EC were assessed for the absence of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis and leprosy. Staff members working in the leprosy centers or TB clinics were excluded as EC. Mantoux-negative, healthy Dutch donors recruited at the Blood Bank Sanquin, Leiden, The Netherlands were used as nonendemic controls (NEC).

<p>UCP conjugates specific for cytokines IP-10, IL-10, IFN-γ were prepared following earlier described protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens3">[26]</xref>, by conjugating 5 µg anti-IP-10 (BC-50; Diaclone), 20 µg anti-IL-10 mAb (coating mAb in ELISA, mO-13-10-12; U-CyTech) or 25 µg anti-IFN-γ (BB-1; Diaclone) per 1 mg carboxylated UCP particles, respectively. Wet UCP conjugates were stored at a concentration of 1 mg/ml at 4°C. An UCP-IP-10 dry conjugate was made by drying 100 ng in a 5% sucrose matrix overnight at 37°C in 0.65 ml U-shape polypropylene tubes (Ratiolab tubes for 96-well micro test plate, VWR International, Amsterdam, The Netherlands); dried materials were stored in aluminum foil bags (Lamigrip pouches Overtoom International, Den Dolder, The Netherlands) with silica dry pellets at ambient temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-vanDam1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Downs1">[32]</xref>.

LF strips (4 mm width) for IP-10, IL-10 and IFN-γ were prepared with a test (T) line at 2.0 cm comprised of 50 ng anti-IP-10 BC-55 (Diaclone), 700 ng anti-IL-10 mAb mO-10-10-28 (U-CyTech Biosciences) or 200 ng anti-IFN-γ BG-1 (Diaclone) respectively. The antibody pairs were identical to those used for ELISA but not containing a biotin hapten. LF strips for cytokine detection were further provided with a goat anti-mouse pAb (M8642; Sigma-Aldrich) flow-control (FC) line of respectively 100 ng and 200 ng at 2.5 cm. LF strips for detection of antibodies against PGL-I were provided with 50 ng synthetic PGL-I (ND-O-HAS) on the test (T) line and 100 ng rabbit anti-goat IgG (G4018; Sigma-Aldrich) on the flow-control (FC) line. LF strips for IP-10 and PGL-I multiplex detection were prepared using the same compositions as the strips for the individual targets, but now were provided with two T- and two FC-capture lines. Capture lines were separated by 4 mm located at 1.5 (T1, IP-10), 1.9 (T2, PGL-I), 2.7 (FC1, goat anti-mouse), and 2.3 cm (FC2, rabbit anti-goat).</p>

<title>UCP-LFA for cytokine detection</title>
<p>The UCP-LFAs for cytokine detection (IFN-γ, IL-10, IP-10) comprise two phases, designated solution phase and immunochromatography phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens3">[26]</xref>. Solution phase: 10 µl of 100-fold diluted sample (translating to 0.1 µl undiluted sample) for IP-10 and 10 µl undiluted sample for IL-10 and IFN-γ is mixed with 90 µl High Salt Lateral Flow (HSLF) buffer (100 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 270 mM NaCl, 1% BSA (w/v), 0.5% Tween-20 (v/v)) containing 100 ng specific UCP reporter conjugate and incubated for 60 min on a thermoshaker at 37°C and 900 rpm. The immunochromatography phase: the above mixture is applied to cytokine specific LF strip and allowed to flow for at least 30 min. After immunochromatography, LF strips are scanned in a Packard FluoroCount microtiterplate reader adapted with an infrared laser. Upon IR excitation (980 nm), UCP reporter particles emit green light detectable using a 550 nm band pass filter. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> are displayed in histograms in relative fluorescence units (RFUs) measured at Test and Flow-Control lines, or as the ratio value between Test (T) and Flow-Control (FC) RFUs using Lateral Flow Studio software V 3.3.5 (QIAGEN Lake Constance GmbH).

<title>UCP-LFA for anti-PGL-I antibody detection</title>
<p>For detection of anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies two protocols were used: a rapid sequential flow protocol without incubation using the UCP<sup>protein-A</sup> or UCP<sup>αIgG/IgM/IgA/Kappa/Lambda</sup> conjugate, or a two phase protocol similar to the above described protocol for cytokine detection only using UCP<sup>αIgM</sup> instead of cytokine-specific UCP conjugates. The sequential flow protocol using the UCP<sup>protein-A</sup> conjugate is referred to as consecutive flow (CF) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Chen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens5">[35]</xref>. The CF protocol comprised three sequential flow steps: first 40 µl of a diluted clinical sample (2.5% (v/v) in HSLF assay buffer), after 2 min followed by a wash step with 20 µl HSLF and a final flow after 5 min with 70 µl UCP-conjugate (100 ng in HSLF). Multiple strips can be handled simultaneously by prefilling 96 well ELISA microtitre-plates (Nunc MaxiSorp) with the appropriate three solutions and transferring LF strips from one well to the other. Immunochromatography is allowed to continue for at least 30 min before LF strips are analyzed (see above).

<title>UCP-LFA for simultaneous (multiplex) cytokine and antibody</title>
<p>Simultaneous detection of IP-10 and anti-PGL-I IgM was performed following the two phase protocol described above for cytokine detection.

The immunochromatography phase was identical to that described for the cytokine-only testing protocol and allowed to continue for at least 30 min before analysis of LF strips (see above).

<p>To evaluate the combined diagnostic value of IL-10, IP-10 and IFN-γ, we first determined their concentrations by ELISAs in 24 h WBA of 11 Ethiopian leprosy patients (9 BL, 2 BT) and 12 EC. In addition, anti-PGL-I antibodies were determined for each individual as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002845-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The IP-10 production measured in WBA displayed a pattern similar to that of IFN-γ, although the overall IP-10 concentrations were much higher: median levels of both cytokines in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> and ML2478 in patients' WBA were not significantly different from those for EC in this leprosy endemic area. These data are consistent with our previous findings, leading to the use of IFN-γ/IP-10 production in response to ML2478 to determine the level of exposure to <italic>M. leprae</italic> irrespective of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk4">[22]</xref>.</p>

<p>In contrast, IL-10 concentrations in response to ML2478, were significantly lower for EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002845-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> regulates the clinical outcome after infection, diagnostic tests for leprosy measuring both type of responses will be helpful in the decision on which individuals need (preventive) treatment. IP-10/IL-10 ratios for stimulated and unstimulated WBA samples demonstrated significantly different values between patients and EC, in particular for unstimulated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002845-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, detection of a biomarker for humoral immunity, anti-PGL-I antibody levels, demonstrated significantly higher titers for leprosy patients, further contributing to a discriminating profile between leprosy patients and EC in leprosy endemic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002845-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinetics of cytokine production in WBA</title>
<p>Since short overall test-to-result times are preferred for diagnostic assays, the supernatants of WBA of Ethiopian leprosy patients and EC were analyzed for the presence of IFN-γ, IL-10 and IP-10 after 1 h, 4 h, 6 h and 24 h stimulation. For IFN-γ and IL-10, levels that varied significantly from unstimulated samples were only detected after 24 h (data not shown). For IP-10, however, already after 6 h significant production was observed in antigen stimulated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002845-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Important to note is that after 6 h, IP-10 levels in ML2478-stimulated samples were significantly higher (p = 0.02) in patients compared to EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002845-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), whereas no distinctive responses were observed for IFN-γ at that time point. PHA-induced IP-10 levels were high for all individuals after 6 h and substantial IP-10 levels were only detectable in <italic>M. leprae</italic>-stimulated samples after 24 h. Thus, besides the higher levels of IP-10, also the shorter whole blood assay time required render IP-10 combined with ML2478 or as ratio with IL-10 directly in serum, a preferred pro-inflammatory biomarker to discriminate between leprosy patients and EC.</p>

<p>To further evaluate UCP-LF applications with this Ethiopian sample set, IL-10 levels of 84 samples (21 patients, 3 stimuli and medium) were also tested, using the available wet-format IL-10-UCP-LFA in parallel with ELISA. Since the IL-10-UCP-LFA was used with 100-fold larger sample input than the IP-10 assay, some of the discrepancies observed for IL-10 between ELISA and UCP-LF assay were probably due to particulate material present in WBA samples.

The main requisite for such diagnostic tests is the selection of suitable biomarkers. WBA using <italic>M. leprae</italic>(-specific) antigens induce a ‘fingerprint’ of (the ratio of) pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that, combined with detection of anti-PGL-I antibodies, can be used as a biomarker profile for <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the frequent use of IFN-γ, IP-10 represents an equally valid biomarker for pro-inflammatory responses to mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk4">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Bobosha1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Ruhwald1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Bobosha2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Aabye2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Tuuminen1">[41]</xref>. This chemokine is produced by various cell types, including monocytes/macrophages, and is involved in recruitment of lymphocytes and neutrophils to sites of inflammation. IP-10 can be used to differentiate between high and low <italic>M. leprae</italic> exposure levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk4">[22]</xref> and it also provides a biomarker associated with type 1 reactions (T1R) in leprosy patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk5">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Scollard2">[43]</xref>. Moreover, IP-10, is much less influenced by CD4 cell count and, in contrast to IFN-γ, can be used in HIV<sup>+</sup> individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Aabye1">[28]</xref>. Considering the similarities in IP-10 responses of <italic>M. leprae</italic>- and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected individuals, and the high concentrations in which it is produced, we developed a UCP-LFA for IP-10 and investigated its diagnostic potential for leprosy (this study) and TB in Africa (Corstjens <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation). Although most IGRAs require an antigen stimulation time of at least 24 h, we here demonstrate that IP-10, in contrast to IFN-γ, already showed a significant divergence between Ethiopian leprosy patients and EC after 6 h stimulation with the <italic>M. leprae</italic>-unique protein ML2478. This considerably reduces the overall assay time and could conveniently provide a sample-to-result on the same day.</p>
<p>Since host immunity and immuno-pathogenicity in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> comprises multifaceted interactions between a diversity of cells secreting different molecules, it is rather unlikely that only a single compound is linearly correlated to protection or to disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Ottenhoff1">[44]</xref>. Diagnostic tests that determine ratios of different types of cytokines will therefore be informative regarding disease development after <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk6">[45]</xref> as was previously illustrated by IFN-γ/IL-10 and IFN-γ/IL-17 ratios in <italic>Mtb</italic> infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Hussain1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Hur1">[47]</xref>, but also for the development of T1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Geluk5">[42]</xref>. Relatedly, another valuable observation made here was the significant difference in IP-10/IL-10 ratios in sera of leprosy patients and EC, even without antigen stimulation. These data illustrate that the proportion of pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokines is consistent with clinical outcome after infection. Consequently, over time changes in the IP-10/IL-10 ratio for one individual will provide relevant clinical information with respect to the outcome of infection.</p>
<p>Dry-format UCP-LFAs are ideally suited for performance in the field and can be shipped and stored conveniently at ambient temperature and have prolonged shelf life of more than two years in African settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-vanDam1">[6]</xref>. In this study we selected IP-10 and anti-PGL-I antibodies for field-evaluation of the dry-format UCP-LFA, and development of dry-format UCP-LFA for more analytes is in progress. This evaluation showed that both dry-format UCP-LFAs were equally sensitive as ELISAs and could be applied in the concentration range of 100 to &gt;100,000 pg/ml. Also, the availability of affordable and portable UCP-LF strip readers showed suitability of the assay in field settings where ELISA equipment is not available or is more challenging to use. The LF strips were read with an easy to operate, portable reader that allows full instrument-assisted assay analyses avoiding operator bias. Due to the chemical stability of the assay components, the strips can be kept in patients' files and read again after long periods of time.</p>
<p>Besides the speed and ease of performance, another advantage of the UCP-LFA is that multiple analytes can be detected on the same LF-strip. Feasibility of multiplexed analysis was demonstrated previously for IL-10 and anti-PGL-I antibodies in spiked sera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Corstjens3">[26]</xref>. In this study multiplexing was successfully shown for IP-10 and anti-PGL-I antibodies in whole blood samples. Although the current UCP-LFA conditions for IL-10 quantitation demand a 100-fold larger sample input than the IP-10 assay, a single strip allowing quantitative detection of IP-10, IL-10 as well as anti-PGL-I antibody detection is feasible. Revision of the position (distance from the sample pad) and antibody load of the test lines, would allow the use of 1 µL samples instead of the currently applied 0.1 and 10 µL for IP-10 and IL-10 respectively. Moreover, multiplexing can be achieved by running two or more LF strips from a single sample in parallel as was for instance described for a simple multiple channel device running ten UCP-LF strips from a single sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002845-Hong1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>This study describes the first steps towards development of a UCP-LFA as a field test measuring pro- and anti-inflammatory cellular- as well as humoral immunity to <italic>M. leprae</italic>, thereby including read-outs for multiple classifications of the leprosy spectrum. Such tests can be useful tools in leprosy control programs for classification of leprosy and allow early diagnosis of leprosy or leprosy reactions, leading to timely treatment and reduced transmission.</p>
