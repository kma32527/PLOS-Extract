<abstract>
<p>Human brucellosis is most commonly diagnosed by serology based on agglutination of fixed <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> as antigen. Nucleic acid amplification techniques have not proven capable of reproducibly and sensitively demonstrating the presence of <italic>Brucella</italic> DNA in clinical specimens. We sought to optimize a monoclonal antibody-based assay to detect <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> lipopolysaccharide in blood by conjugating <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, an immunogenic protein carrier to maximize IgG affinity of monoclonal antibodies. A panel of specific of monoclonal antibodies was obtained that recognized both <italic>B. melitensis</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> lipopolysaccharide epitopes. An antigen capture assay was developed that detected <italic>B. melitensis</italic> in the blood of experimentally infected mice and, in a pilot study, in naturally infected Peruvian subjects. As a proof of principle, a majority (7/10) of the patients with positive blood cultures had <italic>B. melitensis</italic> lipopolysaccharide detected in the initial blood specimen obtained. One of 10 patients with relapsed brucellosis and negative blood culture had a positive serum antigen test. No seronegative/blood culture negative patients had a positive serum antigen test. Analysis of the pair of monoclonal antibodies (2D1, 2E8) used in the capture ELISA for potential cross-reactivity in the detection of lipopolysaccharides of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> O9 showed specificity for <italic>Brucella</italic> lipopolysaccharide. This new approach to develop antigen-detection monoclonal antibodies against a T cell-independent polysaccharide antigen based on immunogenic protein conjugation may lead to the production of improved rapid point-of-care-deployable assays for the diagnosis of brucellosis and other infectious diseases.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Brucellosis is a OneHealth disease reflecting the risk for human infection by interaction with and relation to affected animal populations. The disease is often difficult to diagnose because of lack of precise or accessible diagnostic reagents, and because culture is complex, hazardous and relatively insensitive. Brucellosis disproportionately affects the poor and dispossessed with human and animal burdens of disease in the Middle East, North Africa, Mongolia and other regions that are simply unknown. The diagnosis of brucellosis most often rests on serological tests—antibody detection—based on agglutination of fixed <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>. We have developed the basis for developing a new test based on the detection of the <italic>B. melitensis</italic> lipopolysaccharide, which provides rapid and definitive identification of the presence of the organism in clinically obtainable body fluids. A new approach—protein conjugation to the lipopolysaccharide antigen—was taken to enhance the affinity of the monoclonal antibodies that were generated for the test. These reagents were tested in a mouse model of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> and in humans from the brucellosis-endemic region of Peru, and provided the data for the basis of further clinical development and clinical trials for the rapid, point-of-care diagnosis of brucellosis that will also provide new tools for assessing the global burden of disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human brucellosis is most commonly caused by two species of the genus <italic>Brucella</italic>, typically <italic>B. abortus</italic> from cattle and <italic>B. melitensis</italic> from goats and sheep. The definitive diagnosis of brucellosis rests upon demonstration of the causative bacterium in a suspected patient's body fluid, typically by culture isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-RuizCastaneda1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Pappas1">[2]</xref>. While detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Baddour1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Navarro3">[13]</xref> or antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-AlShamahy1">[14]</xref> would be expected to be diagnostic for new cases of brucellosis, DNA has been reported to persist in blood after successful treatment of solidly diagnosed cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Vrioni1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Maas1">[16]</xref>. Therefore PCR amplification-based tests are not useful to confirm brucellosis relapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Vrioni1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Maas1">[16]</xref>. Because culture is technically challenging and hazardous in many clinical laboratories, brucellosis is most commonly diagnosed using serological methods that use fixed, whole <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> as antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-AlDahouk1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Dabdoob1">[21]</xref>. Such methods include the Rose Bengal, slide agglutination, and tube agglutination tests, sometimes accompanied with the use of 2-mercaptoethanol to distinguish IgG from IgM antibodies when determining the presence of active infection requiring antibiotic therapy; newer data obtained using genome-level screens suggest the potential utility of recombinant <italic>B. melitensis</italic> proteins for characterization of human infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Cannella1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Liang2">[24]</xref>. Sometimes, when prozone or other interfering immune phenomena occur where clinical brucellosis may be associated with non-agglutinating antibodies, the Coomb's indirect antibody test or the BrucellaCapt assay can detect anti-<italic>Brucella</italic> antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Gomez1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Bosilkovski1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Franco1">[32]</xref>. ELISA to detect IgM or IgG antibodies that react with <italic>B. abortus</italic> lysates are not recommended for diagnosis because of limited specificity, but a competitive ELISA to detect smooth <italic>Brucella</italic> LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Lucero1">[33]</xref> and a rapid antibody-detecting test such as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-based lateral flow assay has favorable performance characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Gomez1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Bosilkovski1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Franco1">[32]</xref>. Nonetheless, ELISA tests based on whole cell <italic>B. abortus</italic> lysates may suffer from false positive results. False positive serological results may be also found with other pathogenic bacteria because of cross-reaction with <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, <italic>Yersinia enterocolica</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> (at low dilutions) can confound serological diagnosis but diseases caused by these agents are rarely confused with brucellosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Shemesh1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Westerman1">[39]</xref>. Nonetheless, serological diagnosis provides only an indirect measure of infection.</p>
<p>The present investigation aimed to develop new monoclonal antibodies against the immunodominant LPS of <italic>B. melitensis,</italic> towards the development of new tools for the direct detection of <italic>Brucella</italic> LPS antigen for diagnostic purposes. We adopted a new approach to enhance the affinity of IgG antibodies for the LPS antigen by coupling purified <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) prior to immunization and boosting, which would be predicted to induce T cell-dependent affinity maturation of the anti-LPS antibody response by B cells. Supernatants from hybridomas which screened positive for anti-<italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS by ELISA were further characterized by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. A capture ELISA using the purified monoclonal antibodies was tested for its ability to detect <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS antigen in sera from experimentally infected mice and Peruvian patients diagnosed with brucellosis by blood culture.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Purification of <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> lipopolysaccharide</title>
<p><italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> 16M was grown under aeration to stationary phase at 37°C in tryptic soy broth (TSB). Cells were recovered by centrifugation and approximately 10 g of pelleted cells were inactivated by autoclaving (121°C, 40 min). Cell pellets were used to isolate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using the hot phenol-water method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Baker1">[40]</xref>. All manipulations of live <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> were performed under Biosafety Level 3 conditions approved by the Select Agent program carried out at the University of California, Davis under conditions established and supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The purified LPSs were treated with RNase, DNase and proteinase-K (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), and the hot phenol-water treatment was repeated. <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS fractions obtained from both upper phenol saturated aqueous layer (aqueous phase) and lower water saturated phenol layer (phenol phase) were pooled. Purified LPS was analyzed on a 4–12% gradient Tris-Glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) under reducing conditions. The presence of LPS in the gels was detected with a periodic acid silver stain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Kittelberger1">[41]</xref> and protein with Coomassie blue stain (BioRad, Hercules, CA). <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS was quantified using a colorimetric assay to measure 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Karkhanis1">[42]</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> 055: B5 LPS (Sigma Chemicals) was used as standard. We also extracted LPS from other Brucella species (<italic>B. abortus</italic>, <italic>B. suis</italic>, <italic>B. canis</italic>, <italic>B. ovis</italic>), <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica 09</italic> and <italic>B. melitensis manB mutant</italic> by following the earlier mentioned procedure.</p>

<title>Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugation to <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS and monoclonal antibody development</title>
<p>Three mg of purified <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS was used for conjugation with KLH (SoluLink, Inc., San Diego, CA). Briefly, periodate-treated <italic>B. melitensis</italic> 16M LPS was linked to succinimidyl 4-hydrazinonicotinate (SANH)-modified KLH. To estimate conjugation efficiency, KLH-conjugated <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS was analyzed on 10% Bis-Tris SDS PAGE gels (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, U.S.A) under reducing conditions and stained with periodic acid silver that detects LPS.</p>

</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>LPS immunoblot analysis</title>
<p>To determine the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS, an immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Towbin1">[45]</xref>. <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS was electrophoresed on a 4–12% gradient Tris-Glycine SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using standard methods. The blotted membrane was blocked (Superblock, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lake Barrington, IL) and strips were incubated individually in neat hybridoma supernatants for 2 h at room temperature. The strips were washed three times in TBS-Tween 20, 0.05% (TBST) and incubated with 1∶3000 dilution (1% Superblock in TBST) of goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM phosphatase labeled antibodies (KPL, Maryland, U.S.A) for 1 h and washed four times in TBST. The blots were incubated in substrate solution (BCIP/NBT-1 Phosphatase Substrate, KPL) for the color development.</p>
<p>To evaluate the cross reactivity of monoclonals, LPS of other Brucella species (B. abortus 2308 and B. suis 1330) and mutant (<italic>B. melitensis</italic> manB), E. coli 0157:H7 and <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> were electrophoresed, transferred and probed with hybridoma supernatants as described above.

<title>ELISA with whole cell antigen of <italic>B. abortus</italic> and <italic>B. melitensis</italic></title>
<p>To determine the relative reactivity of mAbs for <italic>B. abortus</italic> and <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, a native whole cell antigen ELISA was used. Whole cell antigen was prepared by growth of <italic>B. abortus</italic> 2308 and <italic>B. melitensis</italic> 16M in tryptic soy broth with aeration at 37C for 16 h. Bacteria were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.75, and 0.1 ml of antigen was incubated in a U-bottom microtiter plate with serial dilutions of mAbs for 1.5 h with rocking at 37°C. Three washes were performed by centrifugation (1000×<italic>g</italic>, 15 min) and resuspension in 0.1 ml PBS. After the last wash, bacterial pellets were suspended in a 1∶250 dilution of goat anti-mouse HRP conjugate and incubated 1.5 h with rocking at 37°C. After three washes, pellets were resuspended in HRP substrate and incubated at room temperature to allow for color development. After stopping the enzyme reaction, samples were filtered through 0.2 uM filters (MultiScreen HTS, Millipore) to eliminate bacteria and read at 450 nm.

For the assay, Superblock blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, IL, and USA) was used for blocking, TBST was used for washing the plate and 1% Superblock blocking buffer in TBST was used to dilute antibodies and conjugates. LPS-coated plates were blocked (for 1 hr at 22°C followed by three washes. mAbs were diluted (2 µg–0.02/ml) and added 200 µl per well in duplicate and incubated overnight at 4°C. The wells were washed three times with TBST and 200 µl of diluted (1∶5,000) goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The plate was washed four times and 100 µl of chromogenic substrate (TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate system, KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each well and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of 2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

<p>A total of 15 C57BL/6/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 2.8×10<sup>5</sup> CFU of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> 16M. At weeks 1, 3 and 8 after infection groups of 5 mice were euthanized and blood collected at necropsy. Colonization of liver and spleen was determined by serial dilution of tissue homogenates and plating on tryptic soy agar (TSA). These experiments were carried out under ABSL-3 containment at UC Davis and approved by the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. As negative control, sera from uninfected mice (N = 3) were obtained. Serum samples were diluted 1∶5 in phosphate-buffered saline and were passed twice through 0.22 µM filters for biological safety reasons. All samples were streaked on TSA + blood plates to confirm a lack of viable bacteria before testing for antigen by ELISA.</p>

The available serological standard tests (Rose Bengal test, lateral flow assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Smits1">[29]</xref> were used to screen patients for brucellosis. Routine diagnostic tests for brucellosis confirmation included the standard tube agglutination assay and 2-mercaptoethanol test (to distinguish IgM and IgG agglutinating antibodies) and were also carried out on this set of patient samples, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Liang1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Liang2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Franco1">[32]</xref>. A commercially available ELISA test kit, based on a <italic>B. abortus</italic> whole cell lysate putatively used for brucellosis, was also used (Genway IgG Brucellosis ELISA, Catalog GWB-3C0D26, San Diego, CA).</p>
<p>Normal human sera (N = 10) purchased from a commercial blood bank in USA (Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, TN) were spiked with measured quantities of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS for testing in the capture assay; unspiked sera served as negative controls. Sera from human brucellosis cases were obtained at the time of blood culture positivity; 10 negative control sera from Peru (culture negative and Rose Bengal Test negative) were used.</p>
<p>The antigen-detection ELISA was developed by coating plates with capture mAb 2D1 (200 ng/well) in 0.06 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) incubated overnight at 4°C in a humid chamber. Blocking and washing steps, antibody dilution buffer and color development were done as described above. Test serum samples were diluted (1∶25 dilution) in 1% Superblock TBST and 200 µl of the diluted sample was added per well in duplicates and incubated over night at 4°C. For human serum samples from Peru, the dilution was done in TBST and heat inactivated (56°C for 15 minutes) before adding to the wells. The plates were washed after incubation in test serum samples. For detection, 200 µl of biotinylated mAb 2E8 (1∶5,000 dilution, 0.5 mg/ml) was added per well and incubated for 2 hr. Plates were washed 4 times and 200 µl of 1∶8,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Scientific, Ill, USA) was added and incubated for one hr. The plates were washed and colorimetric assay developed as described above.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report the development of a monoclonal antibody-based <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> antigen detection assay based on new monoclonal antibodies developed using a novel LPS-protein conjugation approach. Here we made <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS into a T-dependent antigen by chemical conjugation to a carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to enhance immunogenicity by inducing helper T cell function. Such an approach has been demonstrated to increase titers and affinities of antibody responses against T cell-independent antigens such as bacterial capsular polysaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Lee1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Dull1">[55]</xref> and the potential for enhancing affinity maturation of poorly antigenic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-KublerKielb1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Vincent1">[57]</xref> as well as T-independent antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Roulland1">[58]</xref> such as LPS. The immunization strategy used here yielded a panel of monoclonal antibodies with varying properties. Hybridomas producing mAbs that recognized both <italic>B. melitensis and B. abortus</italic> LPS and one that produced a mAb that selectively recognized <italic>B. melitensis</italic> were obtained. An antigen capture assay was developed that was able to detect <italic>B. melitensis</italic> LPS in the serum of experimentally-infected mice and blood culture-positive brucellosis cases in Peru.</p>
<p>The present work is consistent with previous reports of mAb development against <italic>Brucella</italic> LPS in detecting both shared and unique epitopes (O-antigen, A- and M- epitopes) within <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-AlShamahy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Vizcaino1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Weynants1">[63]</xref>. Using the new panel of mAbs, we found that in the mouse model of brucellosis that LPS antigen was detectable at 1 and 3 weeks after infection. However, while colony counts of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> remained robust in liver and spleen eight weeks after infection, LPS antigen was no longer detectable. This discrepancy may relate to the human data reported here in which we found only a moderate sensitivity (70%) of LPS antigen detection at clinical presentation and poor sensitivity (10%) when in seropositive, blood culture negative patients. This observation is consistent with the known imperfect sensitivity of blood culture for the diagnosis of brucellosis, and suggests the compartmentalization of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> during human infection into sites where neither bacteria nor LPS are released into blood after acute infection. We do not believe that the performance of the capture ELISA reported here is due to lack of performance of the mAbs for two reasons: 1) the mAbs used were determined to detect both <italic>B. melitensis</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> LPS; and 2) human brucellosis in Peru is caused exclusively by <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, so that non-<italic>B. melitensis</italic> brucellosis cases are unlikely to have occurred in our patient population. It is possible that the intracellular location of <italic>Brucella</italic> may reduce the sensitivity of LPS antigen detection. Regarding the specificity of the mAb detection ELISA described here, the pair of mAbs—2D1 and 2E8—were chosen specifically not to detect either <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 or <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, which was confirmed by Western immunoblot. Regardless, these infections present quite differently than brucellosis and would not be confused by an experienced clinician; hence antigen detection assays for brucellosis would not likely yield false positive results in these disease. Indeed, it may be possible to use the relevant mAbs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002926-t001">Table 1</xref>) to detect infections by either of these organisms in the appropriate clinical context.</p>
<p>The antigen-detection mAbs described here also have a One Health application, and could readily be adapted for screening herds of livestock for active infection that present either animal or human health risk. The ability of this panel of mAbs to identify <italic>B. suis</italic> antigen was not assessed here; it would be unlikely that <italic>B. canis</italic> infections would be identified given the lack of LPS in this species. The assay here only was tested with <italic>B. melitensis</italic> infection, and further work needs to be done to assess which of the mAbs would be most effective to identify <italic>B. abortus</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Here we did not assess the ability of the mAb capture assay to detect persistent antigenemia to suggest persistent infection, which has been suggested by persistent DNAemia after <italic>B. melitensis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002926-Vrioni1">[15]</xref>. We believe, however, that our data are consistent with the detection of active bacteremia and disease, which persistent DNAemia does not necessarily indicate. Chronic and occult brucellosis is difficult to diagnosis, likely due to low organism burden, hence we would not expect the mAb capture ELISA described here to be sensitive in diagnosing this manifestation of brucellosis. Nonetheless, the utility of antigen detection to diagnosis manifestations of brucellosis such as focal or chronic forms remains to be determined. Finally, antigen detection in specimens other than serum needs to be further assessed in other endemic settings and other clinical specimens such whole blot, blood clot, bone marrow, urine, abscess aspirates and cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
