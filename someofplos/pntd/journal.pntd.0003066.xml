<abstract>
<p>Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic>. The tissue damage characteristic of BU lesions is known to be driven by the secretion of the potent lipidic exotoxin mycolactone. However, the molecular action of mycolactone on host cell biology mediating cytopathogenesis is not fully understood. Here we applied two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) to identify the mechanisms of mycolactone's cellular action in the L929 mouse fibroblast proteome. This revealed 20 changed spots corresponding to 18 proteins which were clustered mainly into cytoskeleton-related proteins (Dync1i2, Cfl1, Crmp2, Actg1, Stmn1) and collagen biosynthesis enzymes (Plod1, Plod3, P4ha1). In line with cytoskeleton conformational disarrangements that are observed by immunofluorescence, we found several regulators and constituents of both actin- and tubulin-cytoskeleton affected upon exposure to the toxin, providing a novel molecular basis for the effect of mycolactone. Consistent with these cytoskeleton-related alterations, accumulation of autophagosomes as well as an increased protein ubiquitination were observed in mycolactone-treated cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> analyses in a BU mouse model revealed mycolactone-dependent structural changes in collagen upon infection with <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, associated with the reduction of dermal collagen content, which is in line with our proteomic finding of mycolactone-induced down-regulation of several collagen biosynthesis enzymes. Our results unveil the mechanisms of mycolactone-induced molecular cytopathogenesis on exposed host cells, with the toxin compromising cell structure and homeostasis by inducing cytoskeleton alterations, as well as disrupting tissue structure, by impairing the extracellular matrix biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Buruli Ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> infection. It has been recognized for many years that BU pathogenesis is mediated by the potent exotoxin mycolactone; however, the molecular action of this toxin on the host cell biology that drives its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here we present a proteomic-based study that explores the molecular action of mycolactone on host cells biology. Our results provide further molecular evidence for the cytoskeleton-disarrangement induced by mycolactone, and unveil its impact on cytoskeleton-dependent cellular functions. Moreover, we extend the field of action of this toxin to the biosynthesis of collagen, implicating mycolactone on the decrease of dermal collagen found on BU lesions. Given the dependence of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> virulence on its toxin, these findings on mycolactone's molecular action on host cells and tissues are of major importance for the understanding of BU pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-MacCallum1">[1]</xref>. Infection usually starts in the subcutaneous tissue and initially gives rise to non-ulcerative lesions. Histologically, increasing areas of necrosis contrast with the smaller central zone, in which acid-fast bacilli concentrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Connor1">[2]</xref> during both an intracellular phase as well as extracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Silva1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Torrado1">[4]</xref>. With disease progression, necrosis advances, radiating from the focus of infection and involving all cells and structures in its path <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Connor2">[5]</xref>. If left untreated, necrosis extends to the corium and the lesion breaks down into a severe ulcer. In the ulcerative stage of the disease bacteria disseminate and become predominantly extracellular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Silva1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Torrado1">[4]</xref>, being found throughout the necrotic tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Connor2">[5]</xref>. The treatment of BU consists primarily in a lingering antibiotic protocol with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-World1">[6]</xref>, however surgical resection of infected skin is still necessary for advanced stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Kibadi1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, the frequent delay in treatment seeking hampers disease management and increases morbidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Quek1">[8]</xref>, with serious long-term sequelae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ellen1">[9]</xref>. Prevention is also difficult as little is known about disease transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Marsollier1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Marsollier2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Marsollier3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Portaels1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Merritt1">[14]</xref> and no vaccine is currently available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Nackers1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Fraga1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>M. ulcerans</italic> pathogenicity and the tissue damage characteristic of BU are mediated by its toxin mycolactone, a potent cytotoxic and immunosuppressive polyketide-derived macrolide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Connor1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Pahlevan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Torrado2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Torrado3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Oliveira1">[22]</xref>. Mycolactone is produced as a mixture of congeners, with one major form, which is conserved within a given geographical area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-MveObiang1">[23]</xref>. Mycolactone A/B is the main variant produced by African isolates; Australian isolates produce mycolactone C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-MveObiang1">[23]</xref> and the Chinese isolate MU98912 used in this study produces mycolactone D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Hong1">[24]</xref>. Regarding mycolactone's action, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies mainly performed in the mouse fibroblast L929 cell line have shown that the toxin diffuses passively through the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Snyder1">[25]</xref>. Further studies also show that cells incubated with the toxin display a distinctive cytopathicity, characterized by early actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell round-up and detachment from the bottom of the well, and an arrest in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George3">[26]</xref>, culminating in an apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George2">[19]</xref>. Recently, Guenin-Macé et al. unveiled that the toxin targets the actin-cytoskeleton regulator Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), inducing its hyperactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-GueninMace1">[27]</xref>, and Hall et al. described that mycolactone inhibits co-translational translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus inhibiting the production of nearly all proteins that transit through the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Hall1">[28]</xref>. However, despite these advances, the molecular action of this toxin on the host cell biology that drives its pathogenesis is not fully understood.</p>
<p>This work had the purpose of conducting a characterization of the proteome of mycolactone-treated cells, in order to better understand the effects of this toxin on host cell biology. At first, we performed a kinetic characterization of mycolactone's cytopathic, cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on L929 cells. Based on this, specific incubation times and toxin doses were chosen for the proteomic study by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Functional studies were performed in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models to verify our findings in mycolactone-exposed cells and investigate their role in BU pathogenesis. The data obtained showed that cytoskeleton and collagen biosynthesis are severely affected by mycolactone, supporting the involvement of cytoskeleton on mycolactone-induced cytopathogenicity and identifying a new activity of the toxin on the decrease of the collagen content in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>-infected tissues.</p>

<title>Kinetic characterization of mycolactone cytopathic, cytostatic and cytotoxic effects</title>
<p>The time- and dose-dependent kinetics of the cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of mycolactone were investigated by an integrated analysis of cell cycle and cell death in L929 cells. Doses of mycolactone were selected through a pre-screening MTS assay based on the concentrations reported for human ulcer exudates (0–300 ng/mL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Sarfo1">[29]</xref>. MTS assay showed a threshold around 15 ng/mL, above which mycolactone is progressively cytotoxic reaching a plateau at 50 ng/mL (data not shown). Therefore, the range of mycolactone concentrations tested in this study was narrowed to 12.5–50 ng/mL.</p>
<p>Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figure 1</xref> show that the ethanol (vehicle) equivalent (&lt;0.002%), as well as the mycolactone concentration below the threshold (12.5 ng/mL), had no detectable cytopathic (rounding and detachment) or cytotoxic effects. Cytotoxic doses of mycolactone (&gt;12.5 ng/mL) induced detachment, cell cycle arrest in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase at 48 h and 72 h of treatment and the appearance of a sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> population, compatible to apoptotic cells, more evident at 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with cell cycle data, annexin-V/PI assays revealed an annexin-V<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>−</sup> population for the highest mycolactone concentrations (25 and 50 ng/ml) at 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figures 1B</xref>), indicative of apoptotic cells.</p>

<p>It was previously reported that cells incubated with mycolactone re-grow when mycolactone is removed from the medium, indicating that mycolactone's effect might be reversible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George1">[17]</xref>. To further investigate the reversibility of mycolactone's effect, cells were incubated with different concentrations of mycolactone for 48 h and afterwards washed and incubated in fresh media for an extra 48 h period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figure 1</xref>, 48 h+48 h). We found that cells that had previously been incubated with the lowest cytotoxic concentration of the toxin (25 ng/mL) re-adhere, recover the normal cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figure 1A</xref>, 48 h+48 h) and appeared to overcome the cytotoxic stimulus, since no increase in the sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> or annexin-V<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>−</sup> populations was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figures 1A and 1B</xref>, 48 h+48 h). On the other hand, cells that had been previously incubated with the highest cytotoxic dose (50 ng/mL), while remaining in suspension, were not able to overcome the initial stress induced by mycolactone and became committed to death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figures 1A and 1B</xref>, 48 h+48 h). These data demonstrate that the reversibility of mycolactone's effect occurs within a window of concentrations around 25 ng/mL.</p>
<p>Overall, within the range of studied mycolactone concentrations, we found doses that did not induce observable cytotoxic effects, doses that induced a reversible stress, and doses that irreversibly triggered an apoptotic cell death.</p>
<p>To further characterize our model, the kinetics of the cytopathic effects, namely cytoskeleton alterations and cell round-up and detachment, were also assessed. In cells incubated with mycolactone, we observed not only the previously described alterations for actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George3">[26]</xref>, but also changes in the tubulin cytoskeleton, which appeared bended into a microtubule hank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g002">figure 2A</xref>). Within 12–18 h of exposure to the toxin, actin ultrastructures (stress fibers and lamellipodia) were lost, and, although still attached, most of the cells were completely round-up by 18–24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g002">figures 2A and 2B</xref>). At 24 h, half of the cells were already in suspension, while the remaining cells eventually detached in the following 12 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George3">[26]</xref>: detachment being probably a consequence of cell round-up and loss of adhesion structures.</p>

<p>Mouse fibroblasts L929 cells seeded on coverslips were incubated for 12, 18 or 24/mL of mycolactone. Cytoskeletal changes were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using rhodamine-phalloidin conjugate (red) and a tubulin-specific antibody (green). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The cellular shape was visualized by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy.

<title>Mycolactone causes time-dependent proteomic changes related to cytoskeleton and collagen biosynthesis</title>
<p>To study the effects of mycolactone on host cell biology, the total cellular proteome from mouse fibroblast L929 cells incubated with 50 ng/mL of mycolactone (dose that triggers a commitment to apoptotic cell death) or the ethanol equivalent (control), was separated by 2-DE. To establish a temporal perspective of mycolactone's action, three incubation times were chosen: 24 h (when cells are detaching, but viable and mounting a response to the mycolactone-induced stress, associating with the first detectable consequences of mycolactone on the fibroblast proteome); 48 h (when cells become committed to death, coinciding with the onset of an apoptotic population); and 48 h+48 h, (when most of the cells are in the process of apoptotic cell death, with only 40% of viability) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The comparison of control cells proteome at different time-points did not reveal any significantly changed spots, showing that ethanol (vehicle) represents a suitable control. In contrast, the comparison between the proteome of control and mycolactone-treated cells at each time-point revealed a time-dependent increase in the number of changed spots, with 4 spots changed at 24 h, 10 at 48 h and 20 at 48 h+48 h. All 20 spots were identified by mass spectrometry and found to correspond to 18 proteins comprising 5 up- and 13 down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g003">figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>To reveal the cellular processes altered by mycolactone, the proteins were clustered into functional groups according to UniProt database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org" xlink:type="simple">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>). The major groups comprised (i) cytoskeleton-related proteins (Dync1i2, Cfl1, Crmp2, Actg1, Stmn1); (ii) stress response proteins (Hspa1b, Uba52); and (iii) collagen biosynthesis enzymes (Plod1, Plod3, P4ha1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s001">figure S1</xref>). This reveals that mycolactone results in an alteration of cytoskeleton-related proteins and down-regulation collagen biosynthesis enzymes. On the other hand, stress response proteins were up-regulated. An additional group (caspase targets) was created clustering proteins identified as caspase substrates (Fdps, Psme3, Btf3) through the web caspase substrates database CASBAH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.casbah.ie" xlink:type="simple">www.casbah.ie</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Luthi1">[30]</xref>. Consistent with being caspase substrates, these proteins were only decreased in the last time point (48 h+48 h) when most of the cells were undergoing an apoptotic death process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g001">figure 1</xref>). Four additional proteins were classified as miscellaneous proteins (Prdx4, BSA, Unc119b, Ftl1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s001">figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Intracellular structure: Mycolactone impairs cytoskeleton dynamics and functions</title>
<p>The proteomic study revealed several regulators and structural components of both microfilaments and microtubules affected by mycolactone treatment after 24 h (Dync1i2, Cfl1), 48 h (Crmp2, Actg1) and 48 h+48 h (Stmn1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s001">figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Cytoplasmic dynein 1 intermediate chain 2 (Dync1i2) is a non-catalytic subunit of the microtubule-associated molecular motor dynein, which is involved in the transport of elements of the Golgi apparatus, endosomes and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Allan1">[31]</xref>. The here detected early (24 h) down-regulation of Dync1i2 (spot 1) suggests that this transport may be compromised in mycolactone-treated cells.</p>
<p>Three other proteins altered in cells treated with the toxin are cytoskeleton regulators (Cfl1, Crmp2, Stmn1). Cofilin 1 (Cfl1, spot 4), a well-established regulator of actin dynamics, promotes microfilament assembly or disassembly depending upon the concentration of Cfl1 relative to actin and other actin-binding proteins, as well as upon its phosphorylation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Bernstein1">[32]</xref>. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (Crmp2), which was identified in two spots (spot 6 and 7), is a multifunctional adaptor protein which can induce microtubule assembly by binding to αβ-tubulin heterodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Schmidt1">[33]</xref>, whereas stathmin (Stmn1, spot 18) has been described as a microtubule-destabilizing oncoprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Belletti1">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, the isoelectric points (p<italic>I</italic>s) of spots 4 (Cfl1) and 6 (Crmp2) differed in the gel from their expected theoretical values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g003">figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref>), suggesting posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation. Given that the regulatory activity of Cfl1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Bernstein1">[32]</xref> and Crmp2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Schmidt1">[33]</xref> can be modulated by phosphorylation, we studied the phospho-status of these proteins with the Pro Q Diamond phosphostaining. Indeed, the analysis of the phosphoprotein stained gel revealed that both spots were phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s002">figure S2</xref>). Thus, mycolactone increases the phospho-Cfl1 at 24 h, decreases both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of Crmp2 at 48 h, and decreases Stmn1 in the latest time point (48 h+48 h).</p>
<p>In addition to the alteration of cytoskeleton regulators, the proteomic study revealed that the cytoskeleton is also altered on its structural components. Actin gamma (Actg1), a component of microfilaments, is down-regulated at 48 h in mycolactone-treated cells.</p>
<p>Overall, these results show that cells exposed to mycolactone undergo a process of cytoskeleton remodeling involving regulators and structural components, providing a novel molecular basis for the effect of mycolactone on this organelle.</p>

<title>Mycolactone impairs autophagy, a cytoskeleton-dependent cellular function</title>
<p>Two stress response proteins (Hspa1b, Uba52) were up-regulated upon treatment with mycolactone. Spot 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s001">figure S1</xref>) was identified as a fusion protein (Uba52) consisting of N-terminal ubiquitin and C-terminal 60S ribosomal protein L40. The detected spot position in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g003">figure 3</xref>) in comparison with the theoretical positions for the fusion protein (p<italic>I</italic> 9.87/14.7 kDa), ubiquitin (p<italic>I</italic> 6.56/8.6 kDa) and the ribosomal protein (p<italic>I</italic> 10.32/6.2 kDa) suggest the presence of ubiquitin. Indeed, all three spot-specific peptides covered amino acids 13–55 revealing that ubiquitin is present. The here detected increase of free ubiquitin after 48 h of mycolactone treatment could result from an inhibition of ubiquitin ligases or from an up-regulation of its expression. To investigate this in more detail, protein ubiquitination was studied by western blot, which revealed that mycolactone exposure results in an increase of ubiquitinated proteins, more evident at 48 h and 48 h+48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, these data show that rather than an inhibition of ubiquitin ligases, mycolactone induces an up-regulation of the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS).</p>

<p>The UPS and the lysosomal degradation system (autophagy) are the two main cellular degradative pathways. These systems crosstalk each other and the up-regulation of one may occur in response to a down-regulation/dysfunction of the other. Autophagy is known to be dependent on microtubule cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Webb1">[35]</xref> and dynein-driven transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ravikumar1">[36]</xref> with dynein playing a role in the delivery of autophagosome contents to lysosomes during autophagosome-lysosome fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ravikumar1">[36]</xref>. Since microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g004">figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s001">figure S1</xref>) were found to be affected by mycolactone, we hypothesized that the mycolactone-induced cytoskeleton-related changes might impair the autophagic process leading to the up-regulation of the UPS. Therefore the role of mycolactone in autophagy was further investigated.</p>
<p>During autophagy the cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form LC3-PE (LC3-II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. As the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, LC3-II is degraded together with the intra-autophagosomal components by lysosomal hydrolases. Thus, lysosomal turnover of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II reflects autophagic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Tanida1">[37]</xref>. Processing of this marker was analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Western blot revealed an increase of the autophagosome marker LC3-II in cells treated with mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5B</xref>) compatible with an inhibition of autolysomes formation. In agreement, an increase of LC3-positive cytoplasmic vesicles upon toxin exposure was also detected with the immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5C</xref>, red-stained). To further understand these results, we treated L929 cells with different stimuli and added bafilomycin A1 to inhibit the autolysosomal degradation step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Klionsky1">[38]</xref> 2 hours before protein extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5D</xref>). The increase of LC3-II induced by mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5B and 5C</xref>), together with the lack of difference in LC3-II in cells treated with mycolactone in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5C</xref>), suggests a block of autophagy at the terminal stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Klionsky2">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, the higher LC3-I levels observed in cells exposed to mycolactone, when compared with cells where autophagy was induced by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g005">figure 5C</xref>), suggests that most probably autophagy is being induced due to cell detachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Fung1">[40]</xref> or as a feedback response to the blockage of the autophagic terminal stage. These data indicate that mycolactone inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and in turn impairs autophagy.</p>
<p>Taken together, this reveals that mycolactone mediates up-regulation of the UPS and inhibition of autophagy. Since autophagy counteracts several stresses, including infection by intracellular pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Deretic1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Sumpter1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Gong1">[43]</xref>, mycolactone-induced impairment of autophagy may have implications for the progress of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Extracellular matrix: Mycolactone impairs collagen biosynthesis</title>
<p>Proteomics identified several enzymes of collagen biosynthesis progressively down-regulated in mycolactone-treated cells: Plod1 (24 h), Plod3 (48 h) and two isoforms of P4ha1 (48 h+48 h). Further studies showed that these proteins were transcriptionally down-regulated after 24 h of mycolactone exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003066.s003">figure S3</xref>), thus the differential down-regulation of the different proteins probably reflects different protein stability. These enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of lysine (Plod1 and Plod3) and proline (P4ha1) residues, which is essential for the formation and stabilization of collagen fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Krane1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Yamauchi1">[45]</xref>. The here detected down-regulation of these enzymes suggests that collagen fibers stability may be compromised in mycolactone exposed cells. Interestingly, histopathological studies from the 1960's reported a collagen decrease in human BU lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Connor2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Clancey1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Dodge1">[47]</xref>; however this feature has been overlooked and it was never subject to studies to determine its cause or its relevance for BU.</p>
<p>To investigate if mycolactone was responsible for a decrease in tissue collagen, an experimental model of BU disease, the mouse footpad infection with <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, was used. Mice were challenged with virulent mycolactone-secreting (MU98912), avirulent mycolactone-negative (MU5114) strains of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> or PBS as a control. Pathology progression was assessed by measuring footpad swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g006">figure 6A</xref>) and, at different time-points, footpads were collected for histological processing and collagen scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g006">figure 6B</xref>). The results showed that, in footpads infected with mycolactone-secreting <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> (MU98912), the progressive increase of pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g006">figure 6A</xref>) was associated with a decrease of the collagen score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g006">figure 6B</xref>), preceding the breakdown of the lesion into an ulcer (by day 40 post-infection). In contrast, infection with the mycolactone-negative strain (MU5114) did not induce pathology nor did it alter the collagen content in infected footpads, similar to what was observed for the PBS-injected control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g006">figure 6A and 6B</xref>). These results suggest that the decrease in collagen content is not a consequence of the infection or the elicited immune response, but rather caused by mycolactone. To verify this, mice were challenged with purified toxin or ethanol equivalent as control. The results showed that mycolactone induced footpad swelling associated with a decrease of the collagen score, while the vehicle did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003066-g006">figure 6D and 6E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Even though, the methodology used has some limitations, since it excludes the analysis of transmembrane and secretory proteins, which were found to be severely affected by mycolactone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Hall1">[28]</xref>, this work is the first proteomic study on the effect of mycolactone on cells, unveiling important information about the toxin action.</p>
<p>It has been known for years that the actin-cytoskeleton of mycolactone-treated cells suffers early structural rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George3">[26]</xref>. Recently, it was also shown that these changes were mediated by the mycolactone-induced hyperactivation of the actin-cytoskeleton regulator WASP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-GueninMace1">[27]</xref>. In this study we show that mycolactone causes structural changes in microtubules and we identify several regulators and structural components of both microfilaments and microtubules affected by the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> toxin. These data confirm the cytoskeleton as a major target of mycolactone and further specifies the mechanisms of the toxin's cellular action. Moreover, given the cytoskeleton's dynamic nature, with constant remodeling, it remained unclear how these changes contribute to the tissue damage characteristic of BU lesions. Since the proteomic data pointed likewise to an involvement of the UPS further experiments were performed confirming its mycolactone-dependent up-regulation. UPS and autophagy constitute the main intracellular processes of protein degradation taking part in the cellular protein quality control system. Thus, UPS and autophagy are critical in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and their activities are strictly orchestrated. Moreover, perturbations in the flux through either pathway have been reported to affect the activity of the other system, and a number of mechanisms have been proposed to rationalize the link between the UPS and autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Korolchuk1">[49]</xref>. Therefore, it was investigated if the detected mycolactone-dependent changes affect autophagy. The here obtained data indicate that autophagosome-lysosome fusion is impaired in mycolactone-treated cells. Given that the delivery of autophagosome contents to lysosomes is dependent on microtubule cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Webb1">[35]</xref> and on dynein-driven transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ravikumar1">[36]</xref>, the mycolactone-induced impairment of autophagy appears to occur secondarily to mycolactone-induced cytoskeleton alterations. Further evidence of a dysfunctional vesicle-lysosome fusion is given by another altered protein in mycolactone-treated cells. Proteomics revealed that the cell culture medium constituent BSA (clustered on miscellaneous proteins) was increased in cells treated with mycolactone. As degradation of extracellular proteins occurs in lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Buktenica1">[50]</xref>, the observed BSA accumulation suggests likewise that the endosomes-lysosome fusion may be compromised. Since the delivery of autophagosome to lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ravikumar1">[36]</xref> and retrograde transport of endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Allan1">[31]</xref> is mediated by dynein the here observed down-regulation of one of its components (Dync1i2), suggest an impairment of dynein-driven transport upon mycolactone exposure. Further work is needed to explore the effect of mycolactone on cytoskeletal motors-mediated transport, however the down-regulation of a molecular motor subunit (Dync1i2) together with the microfilaments' and microtubules' architectural changes, induced by the toxin, hint at a dysfunctional cytoskeletal motors-mediated transport within mycolactone-treated cells. Other cytoskeleton dependent functions, like phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Adusumilli1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Coutanceau1">[52]</xref>, cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-GueninMace1">[27]</xref> and cell shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George1">[17]</xref> are also described to be impaired in mycolactone treated cells. Thus, these evidences imply that mycolactone induces a nonfunctional cytoskeletal-architecture, affecting cytoskeleton-dependent functions, with consequences for cellular homeostasis. Moreover, our proteomic study revealed several regulators and structural constituents of both actin- and tubulin-cytoskeleton (Cfl1, Crmp2, Stmn1 and Actg1) affected by mycolactone. These alterations may reflect a cell feedback response to the abnormal cytoskeletal architecture as an attempt to restore the physiological cytoskeletal conformation and dynamics. In particular, the early alterations found on cofilin, a well-known regulator of actin dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Bernstein1">[32]</xref>, and on dynein, recently found to play a role in the production of normal bundled stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Meiri1">[53]</xref>, may represent an immediate cellular response to actin polymerization mediated by mycolactone-induced WASP hyperactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-GueninMace1">[27]</xref>. Thus, a growing body of evidences supports a model in which the cytoskeletal disarrangement induced by mycolactone impairs multiple cytoskeleton-dependent cellular functions with cytotoxic consequences for the host cells.</p>
<p>These cytoskeletal changes might have also implications early on infection, during the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> intracellular phase, when the pathogen has to survive and proliferate inside the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Silva1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Torrado1">[4]</xref>. Autophagy is being increasingly recognized as an important component of immunity, playing specific roles in shaping the immune system development, fuelling host innate and adaptive immune responses, and directly controlling intracellular microbes as a cell-autonomous innate defense mechanism. As an evolutionary counterpoint, intracellular pathogens have evolved to block autophagic microbicidal defenses and subvert host autophagic responses for their survival or growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Deretic1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Sumpter1">[42]</xref>. Importantly, studies have implicated autophagy in the control of many pathogenic bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Gong1">[43]</xref>, from which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Songane1">[54]</xref> should be highlighted here due to its genetic proximity to <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>. Thus, the mycolactone-induced impairment of autophagy, mediated by its action over the cytoskeleton, might represent a virulence mechanism of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> to impair host cell immunity against intracellular pathogens.</p>
<p>One of the main findings of this work is the identification of a novel activity of mycolactone, with the demonstration of its role in the decrease of collagen content in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>-infected tissues. Collagen decrease in human BU lesions was described in the 1960's, in the first histopathological studies of this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Connor2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Clancey1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Dodge1">[47]</xref>, however, this phenomenon has been overlooked, even when, more recently, Guarner et al. described this feature as one of the most reliable criteria for the histopathological diagnosis of BU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Guarner1">[48]</xref>. This previously unappreciated feature of the disease was never subject to studies to determine its cause or its relevance for BU progression and associated sequelae.</p>
<p>Here we link, for the first time, the activity of mycolactone with the collagen reduction in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>-infected tissues. Our results from the <italic>in vivo</italic> model show that collagen decrease is not a consequence of the infection or the immune response, but of the presence of mycolactone. In fact the inoculation of the purified toxin shows an association between decrease of collagen and the presence of mycolactone. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we showed that in L929 cells mycolactone transcriptionally down-regulated several ER-resident collagen-modifying enzymes (Plod1, Plod3 and two isoforms of P4ha1). Additionally, Hall et al. described a post-transcriptional mechanism in which mycolactone blocks co-translational translocation of proteins into the ER, thus inhibiting the synthesis of the majority of ER-resident (like the collagen-modifying enzymes) and secretory proteins (like extracellular matrix proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Hall1">[28]</xref>. Although these mechanisms have not been verified <italic>in vivo</italic>, altogether, these data suggest that mycolactone inflicts a transcriptional and post-transcriptional inhibition of the collagen biosynthesis pathway, which translate into a degeneration of collagen fibers in mycolactone-exposed tissues.</p>
<p>Our data also show that the mycolactone-induced collagen degeneration precedes the breakdown of the lesion into an ulcer, suggesting that collagen decrease may be involved, together with cell death, in the tissue destructuration that culminates in the emergence of an <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>-induced ulcerative lesion. Moreover, it may be a mechanism of pathogen dissemination, given that in early lesions bacteria concentrate in a smaller central zone, while in advanced lesions bacilli are dispersed throughout the necrotic area. Finally, this collagen decay in BU lesions may also be implicated in the development of the sequelae characteristic of this devastating skin disease. BU has a very high morbidity rate associated with contractures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ellen1">[9]</xref>. Wound contraction is a natural mechanism by which open wounds close during the healing process, but also results in significant tissue distortion with loss of joint mobility and cosmetic disfigurement. Although the mechanism of wound contraction is not fully understood, it is associated with the abnormal generation of thicker collagen fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ehrlich1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Berry1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ehrlich2">[57]</xref>. Therefore, it is conceivable that during the healing process, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts repopulating the lesion overcome the collagen-deficiency through abnormal- or over-production of collagen leading to the extreme contractures characteristic of BU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-World2">[58]</xref>. In fact, a recent paper by Andreoli et al. described an increase in activated myofibroblasts and an abundant production of extracellular matrix proteins in antibiotic-treated BU lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Andreoli1">[59]</xref>. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis, but if proven correct the use of collagen-based materials as a bed for the skin graft, or even as a replacement in smaller legions, may decrease the contracture and thus the morbidity in BU patients.</p>
<p>Overall, our results provide molecular and functional evidence of the impact of mycolactone on the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-dependent cellular functions, and extend our knowledge on the action of the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> toxin to collagen biosynthesis, providing new perspectives on BU pathogenesis and paving the way for future therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>Protocol for mycolactone extraction/purification was adapted from the one previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-George1">[17]</xref>. Briefly, MU98912 was cultured in Dubos medium supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex, at 32°C. At late exponential growth phase, bacteria were harvested and lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (2∶1) for 4 hours. The organic phase was separated from bacterial debris and hydrophilic components by addition of a 0.2 volume of water, followed by centrifugation. The organic phase was dried and resuspended in ice-cold acetone. The individual lipid components of the acetone-soluble lipid fraction were separated by chromatography using the CycloGraph system (Analtech). The separated fractions were analyzed by thin layer chromatography, and the fractions corresponding to mycolactone were pooled, dried down, weighed, resuspended in absolute ethanol, and stored at −80°C under nitrogen atmosphere in the dark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Marion1">[61]</xref>.

<p>Protein was precipitated in 80% (v/v) acetone and the protein pellet resuspended in urea buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.15% (w/v) DTT, 0.5% [v/v] carrier ampholytes and Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail). The protein separation was done as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ohlmeier1">[62]</xref>. Briefly, 100 µg protein extract was diluted with urea buffer to a final volume of 420 µL and in-gel rehydration was performed overnight. IEF was carried out in IPG strips (pH 3–10, non-linear, 18 cm; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) with the Multiphor II system (GE Healthcare) under paraffin oil for 55 kVh. SDS-PAGE was done overnight in polyacrylamide gels (12.5% T, 2.6% C) with the Ettan DALT II system (GE Healthcare) at 1–2 W per gel and 12°C. The gels were silver stained and analyzed with the 2-DE image analysis software Melanie 3.0 (Gene-Bio, Geneva, Switzerland). To verify the reproducibility three biological replicates for each time point and condition as well as three technical replicates were analyzed (all analyzed gels are in Supplementary Information). An expression change was considered significant if the intensity of the corresponding single spot differed reproducibly more than twofold and was reproducible for all three experiments. The expected spot position in the 2D-gel according to the known protein sequence was calculated with the Compute p<italic>I</italic>/Mw tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ca.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html" xlink:type="simple">http://ca.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html</ext-link>). For the detection of phosphorylated proteins 400 µg of protein were separated by 2-DE, stained with Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's instructions, scanned to detect the phosphorylation signals, silver stained and rescanned. Images of both scans were matched with the 2-DE image analysis software Melanie 3.0 (Gene-Bio).</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry (MS)</title>
<p>For the protein identification, 400 µg of protein were separated by 2-DE. Selected spots were excised, digested with trypsin (recombinant; Roche), and prepared as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003066-Ohlmeier1">[62]</xref>. In brief, the extracted and dried peptides were dissolved in 5 µl alpha-Cyano-3-hydroxycinnamic acid (98%, recrystallized from ethanol-water, 5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA) and 0.5 µl applied onto the sample plate using the dried-droplet method. Peptide masses were measured with a UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Proteins were identified according to their spot-specific peptide mass fingerprint and/or peptide sequence with the bioinformatic tool BioTools Version 3.2 (Bruker) with the following search parameters (tolerance: MS = 10–50 ppm, MS/MS = 0.5–0.9 Da, enzyme: Trypsin, engine: Mascot, database: NCBInr, modifications: Oxidation (M)). A protein identification was accepted if at least three major peaks matched to the protein with the highest score (full MS and MS/MS data in Supplementary Information).</p>
<p>If the protein spot was detected at a lower molecular mass than expected, suggesting processing or fragmentation, the spot-specific peptides in the mass spectrum were also analyzed to confirm which parts of the corresponding protein sequence matched with these peptides. If the mass spectrum of the spot lacked peptides observed for the complete protein and had a different position in the 2D gel than expected it was indicated as a protein fragment. Therefore, both the spot position observed by 2-DE and the specific peptides in the corresponding mass spectrum were analyzed to indicate a putative protein fragment.</p>
