<abstract>
<p>MicroRNAs have been shown to contribute to a repertoire of host-pathogen interactions during viral infection. Our previous study demonstrated that microRNA-30e* (miR-30e*) directly targeted the IκBα 3′-UTR and disrupted the NF-κB/IκBα negative feedback loop, leading to hyperactivation of NF-κB. This current study investigated the possible role of miR-30e* in the regulation of innate immunity associated with dengue virus (DENV) infection. We found that DENV infection could induce miR-30e* expression in DENV-permissive cells, and such an overexpression of miR-30e* upregulated IFN-β and the downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>MxA</italic> and <italic>IFITM1</italic>, and suppressed DENV replication. Furthermore, suppression of IκBα mediates the enhancing effect of miR-30e* on IFN-β-induced antiviral response. Collectively, our findings suggest a modulatory role of miR-30e* in DENV induced IFN-β signaling via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether miR-30e* has an anti-DENV effect <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases; though it is caused by the Dengue virus (DENV) in tropical/subtropical areas, it has shown tendency toward becoming a global public health concern, with estimated annual numbers of 50–100 million dengue infection cases and 500,000 people with severe disease who require hospitalization worldwide. Thus far no licensed vaccine or specific anti-DENV treatment for dengue is clinically available. Understanding the interaction of DENV with their human hosts is key to identifying potential therapeutic targets. In this work, we found that microRNA miR-30e* significantly suppressed DENV replication by promoting NF-κB-dependent IFN-β production. Our findings identifies miR-30e* as a possible restriction host factor for DENV infection, via positively modulating the antiviral innate immune response. Thus, this work broadens the understanding of the pivotal roles of miR-30e* in the interaction between DENV and the host.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue is an important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans, characterized by a spectrum of symptoms ranging from relatively mild dengue fever (DF) to more severe, and commonly lethal, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Gubler1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Henchal1">[2]</xref>. Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of dengue, is a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. DENV is divided into 4 antigenically related but distinct serotypes, types 1–4 (DENV1–DENV4). An estimated more than 50 million people contract dengue virus annually, leading to approximately 500,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths, particularly among children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Guzman1">[3]</xref>. Despite an urgent need for effective counter-DENV strategies, thus far neither effective vaccine nor specific antiviral treatment exists for dengue.</p>
<p>The host innate immune system acts as the first line of defense against viruses, and establishment of viral infection requires the pathogen to antagonize such innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Katze1">[4]</xref>. Type I interferons (IFNs), which mainly include IFN-α and IFN-β, are vital components of the anti-viral innate immune system. Rapid synthesis and secretion of these cytokines is critical for host cells to establish an antiviral state. The initial induction of type I interferon is dependent on the recognition and activation of pathogens by pattern-recognition receptors, which further activates transcription factors, such as NF-κB. Under basal conditions, the NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by IκBα, which are subject to IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation under stimulation, resulting in degradation of IκBα and translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Hayden1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Vallabhapurapu1">[6]</xref>. Activation of NF-κB in turn leads to the gene encoding IFN-β (<italic>Ifnb1</italic>) transcription and IFN-β production combined with IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Maniatis1">[7]</xref>, which ultimately rendering the cell to establishment of an antiviral state by increasing a subset of IFN-stimulated genes coding antiviral proteins or microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Pfeffer1">[8]</xref>. NF-κB activation is positively regulated by various signaling molecules involved in the repression of its natural inhibitors, such as IκBα. Recent study revealed that zinc finger protein ZBTB20 promotes toll-like receptor-triggered innate immune responses by repressing IκBα gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Liu1">[9]</xref>. Our previous work also demonstrated that miR-30e* promoted nuclear localization and activation NF-κB, via directly interacted with IκBα 3′-UTR and suppresses IκBα expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Jiang1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22 nucleotide (nt) short non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that modulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by targeting mRNAs for degradation or by inhibiting translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Ambros1">[11]</xref>. Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs are not only involved in maintenance of normal cell functions, but also participate in host-virus interactions and play a pivotal role in the regulation of viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Umbach1">[12]</xref>. For example, miR-122, a liver-specific miRNA, facilitates the replication of the viral RNA by targeting the 5′ nontranslational region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Jopling1">[13]</xref>. In addition, miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654 are reported to inhibit replication of the H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the PB1 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Song1">[14]</xref>. Previous studies also provide evidence that modulating cellular miRNAs may be one of the mechanisms that interferon system combat viral infection. Wang <italic>et.al</italic> demonstrated that cellular inducible miR-155 feedback positively regulates host antiviral innate immune response by promoting type I IFN signaling via targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Wang1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified that cellular miR-30e* was up-regulated by DENV infection. Further investigation indicated that miR-30e* suppressed DENV replication by promoting IFN-β production. Additionally, we found that the antiviral effect of miR-30e* is mainly dependent on targeting IκBα in DENV-permissive cells. Therefore, our data suggest that miR-30e* might be an effective approach for improvements of nucleic acid inhibitors of DENV and implies a new therapeutic strategy for DENV infection in humans.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of miR30e* in DENV infection, HeLa cells were infected with DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3, respectively, and analyzed for miR-30e* expression by real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that DENV1 infection of HeLa at MOI of 1 for 6 h led to a transcriptional induction of miR-30e* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003088-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>The antiviral role of miR-30e* is mediated by targeting IκBα</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Effective activation of antiviral innate immune responses is essential for the host antiviral defense, which is tightly regulated by a variety of molecular regulators, including miRNAs. Recent evidence indicates that some viruses encode miRNAs that dampen host antiviral immunity, and on the other hand, cellular miRNAs coded by the host can be antiviral via targeting host genes or viral coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Gottwein1">[24]</xref>. In this work, we report that in DENV-infected cells, inducible miR-30e* restores IFN-β production and inhibits DENV replication, presumably through targeting IκBα and subsequent activation of NF-κB. Our study identifies miR-30e* as a possible restriction host factor for DENV infection via positively modulating the antiviral innate immune response. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies will be required to determine the potential clinical significance of the proposed role of miR-30e* in modulating host cell response to DENV infection, although it remains highly challenging to establish an applicable animal model mimicking DENV pathogenesis, especially immunopathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Yauch1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Zompi1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that miR-30e* might be a multifunctional microRNA. It is likely miR-30e* might be involved in maintenance of physiological conditions such as heart development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-VacchiSuzzi1">[27]</xref> and adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Chartoumpekis1">[28]</xref>, as well as in pathogenesis of diseases such as neural tube defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Hosako1">[29]</xref>, cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Jiang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Silva1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Schepeler1">[33]</xref> and trauma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Yang1">[34]</xref>). It was previously shown that the expression levels of miR-30 family were higher in PBMCs collected from patients with chronic hepatitis C compared with those from healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Scagnolari1">[35]</xref>. Additionally, Pedersen <italic>et.al</italic> reported that the miR-30 family could be induced by type I IFN in Huh7 cells and primary hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Pedersen1">[36]</xref>. However, the functions of miR-30 and the underlying molecular mechanism of this process remain unclear. The key finding of our present study is the identification of inducible miR-30e* in the modulation of DENV multiplication by restoring the innate immune response via activating NF-κB signaling. Since it is not yet totally clear how miRNA is involved in the intrinsic immune system's neutralization of virus threat, this work provides an example of possible mechanisms via which a host cell miRNAs participate in modulating DENV-triggered innate immunity. As IFNs are main mediators of the host antiviral defense system, it would be interesting and important to illustrate the significance of miR-30e* for other viruses, which is under active investigation in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Host innate immunity is the first line of antiviral defense, functional to recognize viral components and produce type I IFN and other proinflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN is extensively employed in clinical therapy of viral infection. However, the efficacies of IFN therapy vary with different viruses, disease stages and the other host factors that influence host responses to IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Borden1">[37]</xref>. The long co-evolutionary history of viruses and their hosts leads to co-development of the antiviral capability of hosts and counter-antiviral strategies of viruses. Previous reports have demonstrated that DENV is usually a weak inducer of type I IFN responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Wu1">[16]</xref>. It has been recognized that DENV-encoded nonstructural protein NS2B3 physically targets human mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA), and the interaction and cleavage of MITA could block IFN production and subverts the host innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Yu1">[38]</xref>. Our current results extend previous investigations into the modulation of the IFN system and specifically, the ability of a host cellular miRNA, namely, miR-30e*, to upregulate and restore type I IFN production. While our current study has shown that miR-30e* might be a physiologically relevant regulator of IFN function in response to DENV infection, further investigation is needed in the future to evaluate whether it can be of therapeutic significance in the context of <italic>in vivo</italic> DENV infection. And it requires to be clarified whether promotion of NF-κB dependent innate immunity against DENV infection could simultaneously cause immunopathologic events associated with cytokine overproduction. Furthermore, it is also of note that by showing that viral replication remained relatively unchanged after miRNA and siRNA production was globally abrogated through knocking down Dicer, Bogerd <italic>et al</italic> recently reported that many viruses are refractory to miRNA or small interfering (siRNA) modulation in the host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Bogerd1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003088-Bogerd2">[40]</xref>. This study is important because it raises the question whether application of miRNA- or siRNA-based strategies could be therapeutically effective in suppressing viral infection in the clinic. On the other hand, however, as the above study was performed via knocking out Dicer and global endogenous miRNA/siRNA production, it remains to be clarified whether using a high dose, exogenous miRNA could be effective to suppress DENV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study shows that miR-30e*, as a positive regulator, participates in antiviral innate immune responses once induced in cells upon DENV challenge. This work broadens the understanding of the roles of miR-30e* in the interaction between host and DENV, and further studies to decipher the biological basis for the antiviral activities of miR-30e* will be of theoretical as well as practical importance in developing useful antiviral strategies.</p>
