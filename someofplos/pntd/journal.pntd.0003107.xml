<title>Background</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by several species of trematode of the genus <italic>Schistosoma</italic>. The disease affects more than 200 million people in the world and causes up to 280,000 deaths per year, besides having high morbidity due to chronic illness that damages internal organs. Current schistosomiasis control strategies are mainly based on chemotherapy, but many researchers believe that the best long-term strategy to control disease is a combination of drug treatment and immunization with an anti-schistosome vaccine. Among the most promising molecules as vaccine candidates are the proteins present in the tegument and digestive tract of the parasite.</p>

<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>In this study, we describe for the first time <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> syntenin (<italic>Sm</italic>Synt) and we evaluate its potential as a recombinant vaccine. We demonstrate by real-time PCR that syntenin is mainly expressed in intravascular life stages (schistosomula and adult worms) of the parasite life cycle and, by confocal microscopy, we localize it in digestive epithelia in adult worms and schistosomula. Administration of siRNAs targeting <italic>Sm</italic>Synt leads to the knock-down of <italic>syntenin</italic> gene and protein levels, but this has no demonstrable impact on parasite morphology or viability, suggesting that high <italic>SmSynt</italic> gene expression is not essential for the parasites <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mice immunization with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt, formulated with Freund's adjuvant, induces a Th1-type response, as suggested by the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt-stimulated cultured splenocytes. The protective effect conferred by vaccination with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt was demonstrated by 30–37% reduction of worm burden, 38–43% reduction in the number, and 35–37% reduction in the area, of liver granulomas.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Our report is the first characterization of syntenin in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and our data suggest that this protein is a potential candidate for the development of a multi-antigen vaccine to control schistosomiasis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis affects more than 200 million people worldwide and causes up to 280,000 deaths per year. In terms of global mortality and morbidity, this disease is the most important human helminth infection. Current control strategies are based on chemotherapy, but recurrent re-infection of people living in endemic areas makes many researchers, and also the World Health Organization, search for an effective vaccine to provide protection against schistosomiasis. Substantial efforts have been committed to the characterization of new antigens for an anti-schistosome vaccine and, in order to find new targets for vaccine and/or drug development, we searched transcriptomics and proteomics of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and identified the protein syntenin (<italic>Sm</italic>Synt) for analysis. In this study, we characterize <italic>Sm</italic>Synt and evaluate its potential as a vaccine candidate to protect mice against <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. We demonstrate that <italic>Sm</italic>Synt is expressed in schistosomula and adult worms, the intravascular stages of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and it is located in the intestinal tract of the worms, an important host/parasite interface. Furthermore, vaccination of mice with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt confers partial protection against <italic>S. mansoni</italic> challenge infection and ameliorates parasite-induced liver pathology. Our data suggest that <italic>Sm</italic>Synt is a potential candidate in the development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis, which is caused by trematode worms of the genus <italic>Schistosoma</italic>, is considered the most important human helminth infection in terms of global mortality and occurs primarily in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, higher mortality rates, such as 280,000 deaths per year, have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-vanderWerf1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Lustigman1">[2]</xref>. Around 800 million people live in areas with risk of infection in 76 countries worldwide, of which at least 200 million people are infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Steinmann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-WHO1">[4]</xref>. This disease has also high morbidity rates, being responsible for the loss of up to 4.5 million DALYs (disability adjusted life years) annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Steinmann1">[3]</xref>. Many countries invest in intervention strategies based on short-term control programs using mass drug administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Prichard1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-McManus1">[6]</xref>. Conversely, even with massive treatment, disease endemicity has not decreased because poor sanitary conditions lead to constant re-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Harder1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Gryseels1">[9]</xref>. In addition, the possibility of the emergence of drug resistant parasites has been raised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-McManus2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Gray1">[11]</xref>. Many researchers consider that the best strategy for achieving the reduction of disease transmission and morbidity is through immunization with an anti-schistosome vaccine combined with the current drug treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Bergquist1">[12]</xref>. A vaccine that induces even a partial reduction in worm burdens could considerably reduce pathology and limit parasite transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Chitsulo1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to find new targets for vaccine development, we searched the genomic and transcriptomic data of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and identified the protein syntenin for analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Berriman1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Cardoso1">[15]</xref>. Syntenin is a scaffold supporting protein that is important in assembling protein complexes involved in the organization of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Zimmermann1">[16]</xref>, in cellular trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Zimmermann2">[17]</xref>, in endocytic recycling of transmembrane receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Beekman1">[18]</xref>, in biogenesis of small extracellular vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Grootjans1">[19]</xref> and in exosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Baietti1">[20]</xref>, thus playing important roles in cell growth, development and differentiation. Zimmermann and colleagues (2002) characterized the binding of mammalian syntenin-1 with plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and showed it to be important for the regulation of the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Sales1">[21]</xref>. Syntenin is also known to play a role in tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Boukerche1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Helmke1">[23]</xref> and in maintaining neuronal synapsis integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Enz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Koroll1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The functional variety of syntenin binding partners suggests that the protein might have several roles in many essential cellular processes and this hypothesis motivates the present study. Immunological inhibition of schistosome syntenin might block these key functions and debilitate the parasites. Our goal is to characterize <italic>S. mansoni</italic> syntenin (<italic>Sm</italic>Synt) and to test it as a potential vaccine in the murine model of schistosomiasis. We determine that <italic>Sm</italic>Synt is expressed and located on the syncytial surface of the gastrodermis of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> adult worms and schistosomula. Further, we show that high levels of expression of syntenin are not essential for parasite survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, we find that vaccination with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt induces a Th1-type of immune response in mice as well as partial reduction in worm burden and liver pathology in vaccinated animals.</p>

<title>Mice and parasites</title>
<p>Six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) animal facility. Cercariae of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (LE strain) were routinely obtained from infected <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> snails at René Rachou Research Center (CPqRR-Fiocruz, Brazil) or at the Molecular Helminthology Laboratory at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (Tufts University, USA) and prepared by exposing infected snails to light for 2 h to induce shedding of parasites. Cercariae numbers and viability were determined using a light microscope prior to infection. Schistosomula were cultivated for at least 7 days <italic>in vitro</italic> after transformation of cercariae, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Basch1">[26]</xref>. For developmental analysis, adult worms were obtained by perfusion of the portal hepatic vein from Swiss Webster mice, 6–7 weeks after infection with approximately 100 cercariae. Parasite eggs were recovered from the livers of these mice.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analysis of the schistosome <italic>syntenin</italic> (<italic>SmSynt</italic>) gene</title>
<p>Bioinformatic analyses of the <italic>SmSynt</italic> gene (Smp_068530) were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Pinheiro1">[27]</xref>. Briefly, protein sequence of <italic>Sm</italic>Synt was obtained from <italic>Schistosoma</italic> database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schistodb.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.schistodb.org</ext-link>) and used as a query in BLAST searches against the non-redundant protein sequence database to identify syntenin homologs. Alignment of these protein sequences was generated with ClustalX 2.0. The boundaries of the conserved structural domains known as PDZ domains were defined based on ScanProsite online software. Molecular weight (MW) and isoelectric point (pI) were calculated with the Compute pI/Mw tool. Posttranslational modification predictions were conducted with the following software: signal peptide prediction was performed using the SignalP 3.0 server, transmembrane helices were analyzed by TMHMM version 2.0 and SOSUI, O-glycosylation spots were determined by YinOYang, N-glycosylation sites were defined by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server and phosphorylation sites were predicted with NetPhos 2.0 server. For phylogenetic analyses, the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method, excluding positions with gaps. The numbers represent the confidence of the branches assigned by bootstrap (in 1000 samplings). All evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Tamura1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<p>Two groups of 10 mice each (female C57BL/6, aged 6–8 weeks) were subcutaneously injected with 25 µg of r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt or PBS (negative control) on days 7, 22 and 37. Both preparations were formulated with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) for the first immunization and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) for the following two. Fifteen days after the last immunization, mice were challenged through percutaneous exposure of abdominal skin to water containing 100 cercariae (LE strain) for 1 h. Forty-five days after challenge, adult worms were perfused from the portal veins of each animal and the vaccine protection level was calculated, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Fonseca1">[32]</xref>. Two independent experiments were performed and, in the second vaccination trial, c<italic>Sm</italic>AQP was also used as a negative control, since vaccination with this protein has been shown not to lead to any worm burden reduction or pathology reduction in mice following challenge infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Figueiredo1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title>Measurement of specific anti-rSmSynt antibodies</title>
<p>Following immunization, sera were collected from mice in each experimental group at two week intervals. The levels of specific anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Cardoso1">[15]</xref>. Briefly, microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 5 µg/mL r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt and polyclonal anti-<italic>Sm</italic>Synt antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a (Southern Biotechnology, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Color reaction was induced by adding 100 µL of 200 pmol OPD (o-phenylenediamine) in citrate buffer (pH 5.0) plus 0.04% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to each well for 10 min. The color reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL of 5% sulfuric acid to each well. Plates were read at 495 nm in an ELISA plate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
<p>For subsequent western blot and immunolocalization experiments, anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt antibodies were affinity purified. To perform this, 500 µg of the recombinant protein was first adsorbed to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked with TBST (tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2 with 0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with 2 mL of pooled serum samples from the fourth bleed (day 45 - after the third immunization and before challenge) for 16 h at 4°C. After another set of washings with TBST, bound antibodies were eluted with 400 µl 0.014% triethylamine for 5 min at room temperature and then neutralized by the addition of 100 µL 10× TBS. This material was dialyzed against TBS pH 7.0 at 4°C using a Spectra/Por2 membrane (MWCO 6 to 8 kDa; Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA).</p>

According to the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schistodb.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.schistodb.org</ext-link>) the <italic>syntenin</italic> gene is located on chromosome 6. The <italic>SmSynt</italic> gene is around 15 kb in size and consists of 4 exons, sized 399 bp, 176 bp, 264 bp and 55 bp, all of them with similar (∼30–40%) GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>Sm</italic>Synt cDNA potentially encodes a 297-aa protein, predicted as a soluble 32-kDa protein with a pI of 8.8. Analysis with ProScan online software revealed that the <italic>Sm</italic>Synt sequence has two predicted adjacent conserved structural domains termed PDZ domains, comprising residues 113–192 and 197–272. Four phosphorylation sites were predicted in the second PDZ domain, at S<sup>204</sup>, S<sup>225</sup> and T<sup>199</sup> and T<sup>262</sup>. Phosphorylation of one or more of these amino acid residues might change <italic>Sm</italic>Synt interactions with other proteins, changing the way it regulates cellular processes. Three additional residues at the N-terminal region might also be phosphorylated, S<sup>6</sup>, S<sup>20</sup> and S<sup>89</sup>; and two asparagine residues are predicted to be N-glycosylated, N<sup>38</sup> and N<sup>50</sup>.

From day 30 onwards, mice immunized with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt produced significantly higher levels of anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt IgG antibodies when compared to PBS-immunized animals (p&lt;0.01). The measurement of IgG isotypes revealed that immunization with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt induced the production of anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt IgG1 and IgG2a after the second injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, a reduced IgG1/IgG2 ratio was observed after the third immunization and this suggests the development of a Th1 immune response induced by vaccination with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt formulated with Freund's adjuvant. Additionally, western blot analysis was performed to determine whether polyclonal antibodies raised against r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt following vaccination were able to recognize the native protein in schistosome extracts. A major protein of the expected size of <italic>Sm</italic>Synt (∼32 kDa) was detected in adult worms and schistosomula extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Sera from naïve mice were used as a control and these did not appreciably detect schistosome proteins (data not shown). This result indicates that the anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt antibody was able to recognize native <italic>S. mansoni</italic> syntenin.</p>

<title>Cytokine profile after rSmSynt vaccination</title>
<p>Following vaccination, we measured the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 in supernatants of spleen cells stimulated with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt. We detected significantly higher levels of IFN-γ (1235±240 pg/ml) and TNF-α (1024±134 pg/ml) in spleen cells from animals immunized with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt when compared to the PBS-immunized control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g007">Figures 7A–B</xref>, r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt stimulus group).

<p>These results indicate that immunization with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt formulated with Freund's adjuvant induces a Th1 immune response characterized by the production of high levels of the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α and the absence of the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5.</p>
<p>Moreover, we evaluated the cytokine profile after challenge with cercariae. Similarly to previous analysis, Th1 cytokines IFN-γ (1315±2329 pg/ml) and TNF-α (1182±204 pg/ml) were detected in the supernatant of spleen cells from animals immunized with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g007">Figures 7D–E</xref>, r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt stimulus group).

<p>Concanavalin A (ConA) or LPS were used as positive controls to confirm that splenocytes were responsive to stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g007">Figure 7</xref>, ConA/LPS group).

<title>Immunization with rSmSynt induces partial protection in mice</title>
<p>Two independent vaccination trials were conducted in C57BL/6 mice. The animals were immunized three times with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt or PBS as a control, both formulated with Freund's adjuvant and then, protective immunity was evaluated 45 days after challenge with 100 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae. Mice vaccinated with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt showed a 37% reduction in adult worm burden in the first trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) and a 30.4% reduction in the second trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). We also observed reductions in the number of eggs in mouse livers. The number of eggs per gram of liver tissue was reduced 30.7% and 27.0% in in the first and second trials, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Fig. 8C and D</xref> – left bars). However, this reduction was proportional to the female worm burden reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Fig. 8C and D</xref> – right bars), which suggests that the vaccination probably did not affect the ability of the females to produce and release eggs. Additionally, analysis of the hepatic tissue demonstrated that r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt immunization reduced liver pathology. Histopathological analysis showed a 35–37% reduction in granuloma area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>), and 38–43% reduction in liver granuloma counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>), as compared to control mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003107-g008">Figure 8G</xref> shows a representative image of a granuloma from a liver section of a PBS control mouse (on the left) and a r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt-vaccinated mouse (on the right).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Searching for new vaccine targets, our group has tested many <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Lopes1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Garcia1">[42]</xref>, including the tegument protein <italic>Sm</italic>29 which conferred up 50% protection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Cardoso1">[15]</xref>. We showed that worms recovered from mice immunized with r<italic>Sm</italic>29 had a reduced expression of almost 500 genes, among them, some surface antigens, such as <italic>Sm</italic>23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Cardoso1">[15]</xref>. Reduced expression of these genes may impair parasite adaptation to the host in the face of an ongoing anti-parasite immune response in the <italic>Sm</italic>29-vaccinated animals. Herein, we examine one of these down-regulated genes, syntenin. Up to now, nothing is known about the function of syntenin in schistosomes and other parasitic helminths. However, in other systems, syntenins are important scaffold proteins, involved in many essential cellular processes such as vesicle transportation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Zimmermann2">[17]</xref> and cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Zimmermann1">[16]</xref>. In this study, we clone and characterize schistosome syntenin (<italic>Sm</italic>Synt) and test its vaccine potential.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that <italic>Sm</italic>Synt forms, together with its homologs from <italic>S. japonicum</italic> and <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic>, a clade containing only trematode syntenins, divergent from other eukaryotic groups. <italic>Sm</italic>Synt displays low identity to human and mouse homologs (39% for both) and higher identity to <italic>S. japonicum</italic> syntenin (74%). Syntenins from all analyzed species contain two conserved PDZ domains in tandem, connected by a four-amino acid linker that is also highly conserved. The PDZ domain is a widespread protein-protein interaction component that is found in bacteria, fungi, and metazoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Ponting1">[43]</xref>. PDZ domain–containing proteins are involved in the control of diverse and essential physiologic processes, depending on their binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Nourry1">[44]</xref>. Likely <italic>Sm</italic>Synt also binds to partner proteins via its PDZ domains but, as yet, no <italic>Sm</italic>Synt-binding protein has been identified.</p>
<p>The expression of <italic>Sm</italic>Synt is higher in the schistosome intravascular life stages, which involves infection and disease development in the human host. We carried out RNA interference studies in schistosomula and adult worms to knock-down <italic>Sm</italic>Synt transcript levels and then, we observed the development and behavior of these worms in culture for several weeks. We observed up to 95% knock-down of <italic>syntenin</italic> gene expression and a marked reduction in <italic>Sm</italic>Synt protein levels in all parasite stages tested; nevertheless, following gene knock-down we observed no evident phenotypic alteration in the life stages analyzed. This demonstrates that high level <italic>Sm</italic>Synt expression is not essential for schistosome survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. We hypothesize that robust syntenin expression <italic>in vivo</italic> is crucial for the parasites. Previous studies of syntenin knock-down in other systems revealed interesting phenotypes: in zebrafish, the depletion of syntenin-a in the whole embryo impairs body-axis formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Livak2">[45]</xref>; in tumoral lineages, the absence of syntenin diminishes cell migration and metastatic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Slack1">[46]</xref> and in neurons, syntenin knock-down promotes an increase in the numbers of neurites and branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Latif1">[47]</xref>. Further studies are required to define the function and requirement of schistosome syntenin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The immunolocalization experiments using polyclonal anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt indicated that <italic>Sm</italic>Synt is mainly present in the intestinal tract in adult parasites, and to the internal tissues of larval stage schistosomula. The schistosome gastrodermis consists of a syncytial epithelium with many vacuolar compartments, irregular villi and numerous lamellae that project into the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Figueiredo1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Martins2">[48]</xref>. Likely <italic>Sm</italic>Synt plays a role in cellular trafficking in this tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Zimmermann2">[17]</xref>. Since the schistosome gastrodermis is essential for blood feeding and is accessible to host macromolecules such as albumin and immunoglobulins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Sales1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Livak1">[29]</xref>, we decided to test <italic>Sm</italic>Synt as an immunogen in the development of an anti-schistosome vaccine. We designed a plasmid with a synthetic <italic>Sm</italic>Synt cDNA with optimized codon usage that allowed us to produce the recombinant protein efficiently in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Recombinant <italic>Sm</italic>Synt was purified and used in the formulation of our vaccine, together with Freund's adjuvant. Immunization with this formulation induced high levels of anti-r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt IgG production after the second vaccination. The ratio between the IgG subtypes (IgG1/IgG2a) decreased after the third immunization, which suggests a shift to Th1 immune response. Confirming this hypothesis, cytokine analysis of the supernatants of cultured splenocytes stimulated with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt yielded high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α (characteristic of Th1 immune responses). Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, were detected in very low levels with no difference from the control group. Our group has previously performed other vaccine trials and the majority of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> antigens tested as vaccine candidates that conferred partial protection against cercariae challenge induced a Th1-type immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Cardoso1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Fonseca1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Farias1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Garcia1">[42]</xref>. In the case of vaccination with <italic>Sm</italic>Synt, the shift to Th1 occurred after the third immunization and was maintained after the challenge with cercariae, which helped to control schistosomiasis infection. It has been shown that IFN-γ promotes the recruitment and activation of macrophages to kill worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Jankovic1">[49]</xref>. Further, IFN-γ knock-out mice (or mice treated with specific anti-IFN-γ antibodies to deplete their IFN-γ levels) are unable to protect against schistosome infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Smythies1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Pearce1">[51]</xref>. Both IFN-γ and TNF-α increase the levels of nitric oxide produced by recruited macrophages, which is also related to a protective immune response against <italic>S. mansoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Pearce1">[51]</xref>. With this description of the immune profile of r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt-vaccinated mice, we next investigated whether this molecule could induce protection in a murine model of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. Two independent experiments were performed and, in both, the vaccine conferred partial protection resulting in 30–37% reduction in worm burden. It also ameliorated liver pathology, as shown by a 38–42% reduction in the number, and a 35–37% reduction in the area, of granulomas. These liver pathology results might be related to the elevated levels of IL-10 detected in the supernatant of cultured, stimulated splenocytes from r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt-immunized mice. High levels of IL-10 were detected in the end of immunization schedule and also after the infection with cercariae. Based on these results, our hypothesis is that this cytokine might play a role in the regulation of Th2 responses, reducing the inflammation in liver pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003107-Sadler1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, here, we demonstrate that <italic>SmSynt</italic> gene is mainly expressed during the intravascular life stages and it is located in the gastrodermis of adult worms, suggesting its possible role in the blood feeding process. Knocking-down expression of <italic>SmSynt</italic> has no noticeable impact on the parasites <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, vaccination of mice with r<italic>Sm</italic>Synt generates a Th-1 immune response which partially protects them against challenge schistosome infection and leads to reduced liver pathology. This outcome makes <italic>Sm</italic>Synt a candidate for further development as an anti-schistosome vaccine, perhaps as part of a multiple, protective-antigen cocktail.</p>
