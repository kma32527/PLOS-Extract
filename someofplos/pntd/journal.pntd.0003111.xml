<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic> and <italic>P. lutzii</italic> cause paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> main diagnostic antigen is glycoprotein gp43, and its peptide sequence is 81% identical with a <italic>P. lutzii</italic> ortholog here called Plp43. <italic>P. lutzii</italic> (“Pb01-like”) apparently predominates in Midwestern/Northern Brazil, where high percentages of false-negative reactions using <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> antigens have recently been reported. The aim of this work was to produce recombinant Plp43 to study its antigenic identity with gp43.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We expressed rPlp43 as a secreted major component in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and studied its reactivity in immunoblot with PCM patients' sera from Southwestern and Midwestern Brazil.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Principal Findings</title>
<p>We showed that rPlp43 is not glycosylated and bears glucanase activity. The protein did not react with anti-gp43 monoclonal antibodies in immunoblot, suggesting absence of the corresponding gp43 epitopes. Nevertheless, common epitope(s) might exist, considering that gp43-positive PCM sera recognized rPlp43 in immunoblot, while gp43-negative sera (33 out of 51) from patients resident in Midwestern Brazil were also rPlp43-negative. Two genotyped <italic>P. lutzii</italic> were from patients with gp43-negative sera, suggesting that non-reactive sera are from patients infected with this species.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our data suggest that gp43 and Plp43 bear one or only a few common epitopes and that gp43 cannot be used in diagnosis of PCM patients infected with <italic>P. lutzii</italic> probably because Plp43 is poorly expressed during infection.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Paracoccidioides lutzii</italic> is currently recognized as a distinct species from <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> that until then was solely responsible for paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). Serological diagnostic of this primary systemic mycosis is quite sensitive due to the expression of <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> antigen gp43, which has specific peptide epitopes recognized by patients' sera. Unexpected PCM false-negative reactions have recently been reported for patients from Midwestern/Northern Brazil, where <italic>P. lutzii</italic> (“Pb01-like”) apparently predominates. In our work, 33 PCM false-negative sera from Midwestern Brazil, including two cases of <italic>P. lutzii</italic> genotyped isolates, did not recognize recombinant Plp43 (gp43 ortholog from Pb01) or gp43 (native purified or recombinant), suggesting Plp43 is possibly underexpressed in vivo. Gp43-positive sera reacted with rPl43 showing that common epitopes do exist, although anti-gp43 MAbs did not recognize the orthologous <italic>P. lutzii</italic> protein. The main finding of our work is that gp43 cannot be used in diagnosis of PCM patients infected with <italic>P. lutzii</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Until recently, all fungal isolates causing paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) were considered to be from a single species named <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic>. Multilocus studies including 65 clinical and environmental isolates from Latin American countries showed that <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> is a complex of at least three phylogenetic species: S1 (species 1), the most numerous; PS3 (phylogenetic species 3), composed of clonal samples from Colombia; and PS2 that is phylogenetically cryptic and groups six isolates bearing the most polymorphic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Matute1">[1]</xref>. Later studies including samples from Midwestern and Northern Brazil showed that 17 isolates formed a more distant clade from S1/PS3/PS2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira1">[2]</xref>. They have the same genetic profile as Pb01, which has been highly used as model in the <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carrero1">[3]</xref>. Independent and concatenated genealogies derived from the concordance method of phylogenetic species recognition supported the “Pb01-like” clade as a new phylogenetic species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira1">[2]</xref>, recently recognized a distinct species, named <italic>P. lutzii</italic>, based not only on phylogeny, but also on comparative genomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Desjardins1">[4]</xref>, recombination analysis, and morphological features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> and <italic>P. lutzii</italic> are temperature-dependent dimorphic fungi and PCM is a primary granulomatous systemic mycosis, whose infection occurs by inhalation of fungal conidia produced by environmental mycelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>. Infectious particles transform into the pathogenic yeast form in the pulmonary alveolar epithelium, where infection starts, but the yeasts can then spread to other body sites. Active pulmonary or lymphatic PCM forms occur in up to 2% of infected individuals, who can reach 10 million throughout endemic areas of Latin America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Colombo1">[6]</xref>. Differences in clinical manifestations related to the <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> species are suggested, but that kind of association needs further investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mycological diagnosis based on the finding of fungal species identified in clinical specimens is still gold standard for mycoses. In PCM caused by <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>, serological diagnosis and follow up are also useful and accurate tools used by clinicians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-deCamargo1">[7]</xref>. This is due to the expression of fungal glycoprotein gp43, which is a major antigen bearing species-specific peptide epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia1">[8]</xref>. The Pb<italic>GP43</italic> gene is composed of two exons encoding 416 amino acids that include a 35-residue signal peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Cisalpino1">[9]</xref>. The translated protein is structurally related to beta-1,3-glucanases, however the expressed protein in culture medium is inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Cisalpino1">[9]</xref>. Processed extracellular gp43 contains a single <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site that is occupied by a high-mannose chain bearing 13 to 14 non-phosphorylated mannose residues and one terminal β-D-galactofuranose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Almeida1">[10]</xref>. This sugar chain can be removed enzymatically with endoglycosydase H (Endo H), generating a faster migrating band in SDS-PAGE gels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia2">[11]</xref>. Besides other types of interaction with the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Travassos1">[12]</xref> the molecule also contains a well-studied T-cell epitope (P10) that elicits protective cellular immunity in experimentally infected animals and can be used in immunotherapy in association with standard chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Taborda1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Marques2">[15]</xref>. Gp43 is secreted as clusters through defined regions of the cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Straus1">[16]</xref>. Surface gp43 is partially responsible for adherence of yeast cells to components of the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Vicentini1">[17]</xref>, like laminin and fibronectin, in adhesion assays with Vero cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-MendesGiannini1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Gp43 has been tested in numerous serological assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-deCamargo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Travassos1">[12]</xref> and spontaneous anti-gp43 idiotype antibodies that could be useful in PCM diagnosis were also found in PCM patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Souza1">[19]</xref>. The antigen is highly specific for PCM caused by <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> when the immunoassays preserve its natural conformation or eliminate sugar epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-DeCamargo1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-MendesGiannini2">[22]</xref>. That is true for both native and recombinant gp43 produced in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carvalho1">[21]</xref>, which can be purified from culture supernatants using affinity columns coupled with anti-gp43 monoclonal antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia3">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>The most used test for PCM diagnosis is double immunodiffusion (I.D.) because of its simplicity, high sensitivity, and specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-deCamargo1">[7]</xref>. Whole <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> preparations, generally from yeast-form culture supernatants, are commonly used as antigen. In these preparations, gp43 is the antigenic component responsible for PCM specificity and positivity above 80% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Blotta1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia4">[25]</xref>. False-negative reactions have been attributed to intense pulmonary infection, immune depression, and to low affinity antibodies recognizing carbohydrate epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Blotta1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Neves1">[26]</xref>. The Pb<italic>GP43</italic> gene is highly polymorphic at exon 2 and the most informative in multilocus studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Matute1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Morais1">[27]</xref>. As a consequence, gp43 has isoforms varying in isoelectric point (pIs) according with the genotype group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Morais1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia5">[ reviewed in 28]</xref>. Experimental evidence with recombinant gp43 shows, however, that most PCM sera can recognize different <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carvalho1">[21]</xref>. That is probably due to one common epitope that is specifically recognized by MAb17c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Camargo1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>P. lutzii</italic> (“Pb01-like”) apparently predominates in Midwestern Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>, where high percentages of false-negative I.D. reactions using <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> antigens have recently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Batista1">[30]</xref>. That suggests that gp43 is not recognized by sera from patients living in those areas. Since gp43 peptide sequence is only 81% identical with the closest <italic>P. lutzii</italic> ortholog, here called Plp43 (PAAG_05770 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html</ext-link>), the aim of this work was to produce recombinant Plp43 and to study its immunological identity with gp43. We followed this strategy because we could not detect Plp43 in Pb01 extracts using anti-gp43 antibodies. Therefore, we could not purify or characterize native Plp43. Our preliminary results thus suggested that either Plp43 was expressed in Pb01 at undetectable amounts in our culture conditions or it showed substantial antigenic differences to prevent recognition by anti-gp43 monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. By working with recombinant Plp43 produced in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> we observed that the molecule is not glycosylated and that it preserves glucanase activity. We tested the recombinant protein with a panel of PCM sera from proved cases, besides anti-gp43 MAbs. Our data suggest that gp43 and Plp43 bear one or only a few common epitopes and that gp43 cannot be used in diagnosis of PCM patients infected with <italic>P. lutzii</italic> probably because Plp43 is poorly expressed during infection.</p>

<p>Anti-gp43 monoclonal antibodies have previously been obtained in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia2">[11]</xref>. PCM sera were obtained from patients showing varied clinical forms and that were either untreated or under treatment. Sera from Brazilian Midwest (51 samples) were from Dr. Rosane Hahn's collection (UFMT, Cuiabá, Brazil). The corresponding patients were diagnosed with PCM using mycological methods of visualizing the fungus in clinical samples. Sera from Brazilian Southeast (50 samples) were from Dr. Zoilo Pires de Camargo's collection (UNIFESP, São Paulo, Brazil); positivity in I.D. serological tests denoted PCM. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee with protocol numbers 0366/07; 1796/10 by Universidade Federal de São Paulo and CAAE: 17177613.6.0000.5541 by the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT).

Cell pellets were suspended in one-half the initial volume of BMMY (BMGY with 1% methanol instead of glycerol) and incubated at 30°C under agitation for 3 days. Inducing methanol (1%) was added daily and expression of rPlp43 was verified in stained SDS-PAGE profiles of culture supernatants from <italic>P. pastoris</italic> clones. <italic>P. pastoris</italic> EV was used as negative control.

<title>Plp43 Sequence Features and Heterologous Expression</title>
<p>According to the <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> genome data at the Broad Institute site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/MultiHome.html</ext-link>), the closest gp43 homologous sequence from Pb01 (PAAG_05770) bears 416 amino acids translated from a 1,251-long ORF. The DNA sequence has a predicted intron of 76 residues, while in <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> the gp43 intron is 78-bp long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Cisalpino1">[9]</xref>. The Pb01 peptide sequence is 81% identical to Pb18 gp43. In the alignment seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g001">Figure 1</xref>, note that the signal peptide is conserved and predicted to be 23-residue long. Nevertheless, <italic>N</italic>-terminal sequencing of purified gp43 suggested that it expands 35 residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Cisalpino1">[9]</xref>. In that case, the secreted proteins have a predicted molecular mass of about 42 kDa; however the Pb01 sequence has a pI value of 9.4, while in <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> the calculated gp43 pI values vary between 6.8 and 8.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia5">[28]</xref>, showing important amino acid shifts. In the molecular model, the Plp43 <italic>N</italic>-terminus is linear, in contrast to the gp43 beta sheet found in the same region. Number 4 denotes a similar change, but closer to the <italic>C</italic>-terminus. In 2 and 3 there is a spin in the secondary structure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g001">Figure 1</xref> also shows that the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site is absent from Pb01 Plp43, while the glucanase NEP site is preserved, thus suggesting that the protein is not <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and possibly retains full enzymatic activity, as opposed to gp43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Cisalpino1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, we called the gp43 ortholog in <italic>P. lutzii</italic> Plp43. Also note in the molecular model that the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation region is linear in gp43, but forms a beta-sheet in Plp43. The P10 epitope shows enough alterations in its core to theoretically impair Plp43 recognition by T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Taborda1">[13]</xref>. On the other hand, the gp43 MAb3e epitope is mostly conserved.</p>
<p>Previous unpublished results in our lab suggested that Plp43 was either unexpressed in Pb01 within our in vitro conditions or undetectable with anti-gp43 polyclonal antibodies. Therefore, due to the consequent difficulties to work with native Plp43, we expressed the corresponding Pl<italic>P43</italic> gene in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g002">Figure 2</xref>) in order to study the protein antigenic and enzymatic features.</p>

<p>For Plp43 heterologous expression, we used total RNA isolated from <italic>P. lutzii</italic> Pb01 in RT-PCR reactions with specific primers that allowed elongation of processed Plp43 lacking the first 25 <italic>N</italic>-terminal residues and two <italic>C</italic>-terminal residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The corresponding PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T, sequenced, and subcloned into pHIS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Sheffield1">[31]</xref> and pPIC9 (Invitrogen) vectors for expression in bacteria and in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, respectively. Expression of Plp43 in <italic>E. coli</italic> Bl21 pLysS resulted in intracellular expression of an approximately 45-kD insoluble protein (data not shown). The recombinant molecule was enriched in a Ni-Sepharose 6 fast flow column under urea-denaturing conditions, used in preliminary immunological assays and also to obtain anti-Plp43 polyclonal rabbit serum.</p>
<p>Plp43 expression in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> induced for three days in methanol resulted in a major secreted component (rPlp43) in culture supernatants migrating at 45 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Due to cloning procedures detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>, rPlp43 has three amino acid residues translated from pHIS1 nucleotides remaining at the 5′ end.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, translated Plp43 does not have any predicted <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site in the processed molecule, since the NRT motif in gp43 is altered to KRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We confirmed that Plp43 is not glycosylated by treating rPlp43 with Endo H: note in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g002">Figure 2B</xref> that both treated and untreated rPlp43 migrated equally in SDS-PAGE, while control native gp43 (or <italic>P. pastoris</italic> recombinant gp43r3, not shown), migrated faster due to the cleavage of a high-mannose chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carvalho1">[21]</xref>. Migration of rPlp43 and gp43 was similar probably because rPlp43 has extra amino acid residues resulting from cloning procedures.</p>
<p>We also tested if Plp43 is an active glucanase by assaying rPlp43-containing <italic>P. pastoris</italic> culture supernatants for enzymatic activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g002">Figure 2C</xref> highly suggests that rPlp43 is indeed an active exo-glucanase, considering that an equivalent protein amount of culture supernatant from methanol-induced <italic>P. pastoris</italic> harboring an empty vector was 50% less active against PNPG.</p>

<title>Reactivity of Recombinant rPlp43 with Anti-MAbs</title>
<p>We tested both HisPlp43 (not shown) and rPlp43 for reactivity with anti-gp43 MAbs in immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and did not observe any reactivity with MAb3e, Mab17c, Mab19g, MAb21f or MAb32 (11, 34). These results suggested that the epitopes recognized by these MAbs are not present in Plp43. MAb17c is used in affinity columns for gp43 purification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Camargo1">[29]</xref>; however, due to the above results it could not be used to purify rPlp43. Therefore, we used <italic>P. pastoris</italic> culture supernatants containing rPlp43 (and not the purified protein) in the following experiments. We chose to work further only with rPlp43 because it is expressed in a soluble form in culture supernatants, therefore matching the soluble controls of native gp43 or <italic>P. pastoris</italic> gp43r3.</p>

<title>Reactivity of rPlp43 with PCM Patients' Sera</title>
<p>We tested the rPlp43 reactivity in immunoblot with PCM patients' sera from Midwestern (M) and Southern (S) Brazil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003111.s001">Table S1</xref>). Sera from Southwestern Brazil (50 total) were I.D.-positive (1∶2 to 1∶32 or higher) against total Pb339 antigen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003111.s002">Table S2</xref>) containing high amounts of gp43 as major component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-DeCamargo1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia6">[38]</xref>. The assays were performed for either PCM diagnosis or treatment follow up at Dr. Camargo's laboratory. Sera from Midwestern Brazil (51 total) were from patients confirmed for PCM with direct microscopy, however they were I.D.-negative at Dr. Hahn's laboratory. These I.D. assays were carried out with similar Pb339 total antigen preparations mentioned above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-DeCamargo1">[20]</xref>. We then re-evaluated these sera using I.D. with known amounts of purified gp43, which allows for better sensitivity than culture supernatant preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carvalho1">[21]</xref>. A total of 16 out of 51 were then I.D.-positive (pure to 1∶32) against purified gp43 (). The 33 sera from Midwestern PCM patients that were I.D.-negative (51M to 79M) became the focus of the present work, because they apparently did not recognize gp43.</p>
<p>In order to prove this hypothesis, we tested all sera listed on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003111.s001">Table S1</xref> using chemiluminescence immunoblot, at a single dilution of 1∶1,000, in order to achieve the highest possible sensitivity. As antigen, we used rPlp43 (in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> culture supernatant); we added controls of purified native gp43 and recombinant gp43r3 from <italic>P. pastoris</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carvalho1">[21]</xref> treated or not with Endo H. Upon treatment with Endo H, a large percentage of gp43 is deglycosylated, but generally not 100% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia2">[11]</xref>. Therefore, we were able to visualize reactivity with both forms, since deglycosylated gp43 migrates faster at about 38 kDa. However, previously to using Endo H-treated antigen, all sera were tested with both gp43 and gp43r3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows the types of data we obtained and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003111-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the results. Sera from group 1 and serum 99M showed strong bands with both glycosylated and deglycosylated gp43 and gp43r3, as expected from their positive I.D. reactions. They also reacted strongly with rPlp43. Serum 100M had similar profile, except for the lack of reactivity with rPlp43, suggesting that the gp43 epitopes recognized by this serum are absent in Plp43. Sera from group 2, all of them I.D.-negative from Midwestern Brazil, did not react with any tested antigen. Four sera (group 3 and 101M) were only reactive with glycosylated gp43 and gp43r3, suggesting cross-reactivity with carbohydrate epitopes, which are not specific for PCM and are also absent in Plp43. Therefore, all ID-positive sera reacted with deglycosylated gp43, which proved the specificity of the reaction (serum 99M was an exception), and also with rPlp43 (with exception of 95M and 99M). That suggested that one or more gp43 peptide epitopes are present in Plp43. On the other hand, ID-negative sera did not recognize gp43 or rPlp43 peptide epitopes in a sensitive immunoblot reaction. Serum 99M was an exception probably because I.D. was not sensitive enough to detect low amounts of antibody. Considering that the so far scare literature data point to high concentration of <italic>P. lutzii</italic> in Midwestern Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>, our results suggest that the I.D.-negative patients were infected with <italic>P. lutzii</italic>. We believe that this is the case based on two Midwestern gp43-negative serum samples (51M and 52M) for which we had the corresponding fungal isolates collected from the respective patients. The <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> cultures isolated from these patients (Pb51M and Pb52M) were genotyped as <italic>P. lutzii</italic> using PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) of a <italic>HSP70</italic> fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Carrero1">[3]</xref>, thus supporting our working hypothesis. In addition, Plp43 might be poorly expressed during infection with <italic>P. lutzii</italic>, considering that none of the I.D.-negative sera reacted with Plp43.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We presently expressed Plp43, which is the closest <italic>P. lutzii</italic> ortholog of <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> main diagnostic antigen gp43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia1">[8]</xref>. We showed evidence that gp43 cannot be used in serology of PCM caused by <italic>P. lutzii</italic> because it is not recognized by sera of patients likely to be infected with this species. The same sera did not react with recombinant Plp43 either, suggesting it is under expressed during infection. Although Plp43 peptide sequence is 81% identical with gp43, it has key differences resulting from polymorphism in characteristic gp43 motifs. The NRT <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated site is mutated to KRT in translated Plp43 and we here experimentally confirmed that the recombinant protein is not <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated when expressed in yeast. We also observed that the NEP glucanase site is preserved in Plp43 and our results suggest that it is an active glucanase, as opposed to gp43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Cisalpino1">[9]</xref>. In addition, we tested the rPlp43 ability to bind to fibronectin in affinity-ligand assays and at least one gp43 motif responsible for fibronectin binding is apparently preserved in rPlp43 (data not shown). Glycoprotein gp43 is mostly responsible for <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> binding to Vero cells and both laminin and fibronectin are involved in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-MendesGiannini1">[18]</xref>. Four gp43 peptides were able to inhibit binding at different percentages, but the highest inhibition (57%) was achieved with NLGRDAKRHL. When comparing gp43 and Plp43 sequences, only peptides that inhibited binding at percentages lower than 30% were conserved, specifically, SAQQKKDTLRYI (91,7% identical in Plp43) and ITEDDFKNIA (80% identical in Plp43).</p>
<p>The calculated pI for mature Plp43 is 9.5, while in gp43 isoforms the pIs vary between 6.37 and 8.35 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Morais1">[27]</xref>. Orthologous mature glucanase sequences from <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> (HCAG_04584) and <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> (BDFG_01423) have molecular masses around 43 kDa and are 72% identical to Plp43. Their pIs are also basic, about 8.5–8.7. On the other hand, the corresponding orthologs from <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (XP_001398868.1) and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (Afu1g03600), <italic>C. albicans</italic> (CAWG_01085), <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (XP_002491361.1), and <italic>Trycophyton tonsurans</italic> (EGD99595.1), all of them with preserved NEP active sites, are acidic (pIs 4.5 to 5.0), but with similar molecular mass (44 kDa). A phylogenetic tree shows clear separation between the basic/neutral and the acidic sequence clades (data not shown).</p>
<p>Our main goal was to assay Plp43 reactivity with PCM patients' antibodies in comparison with gp43. This is a key type of information in PCM diagnosis of individuals infected with <italic>P. lutzii</italic>. Epitopes recognized by anti-gp43 MAbs 3e, 19f, 21f, 17c, and 32 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Camargo1">[29]</xref> were not detected in Plp43 when HisPlp43 and rPlp43 were tested in immunoblot. Nevertheless, at least one common epitope is likely to exist, considering that gp43-positive PCM sera also reacted with rPlp43, however less intensely. On the other hand, gp43-negative sera were also rPlp43-negative. These sera came from patients resident in Midwestern Brazil, where <italic>P. lutzii</italic> is apparently prevalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>. Indeed, two fungal samples corresponding to gp43/Plp43-negative sera were genotyped as <italic>P. lutzii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003111-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The Brazilian Midwestern sample we presently analyzed was composed of 51 PCM sera. If our assumption is correct, about 69% (anti-gp43 negative sera), are from <italic>P. lutzii</italic>-infected patients, thus corroborating the phylogenetic studies showing prevalence of the species in that particular endemic area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Teixeira2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Theodoro1">[39]</xref>. It remains to be further tested if gp43-negative sera from PCM patients living in other endemic areas could also be from <italic>P. lutzii</italic>-infected patients, or if negative reactions are really due to intense pulmonary infection/immune depression or low affinity antibodies recognizing carbohydrate epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Blotta1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Neves1">[26]</xref>. It is worth noticing that reactions against gp43 carbohydrate epitopes cannot be considered specific to PCM because these epitopes are promiscuous among fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Puccia1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>We believe that Plp43 is expressed at low amounts by <italic>P. lutzii</italic> both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, considering that anti-HisPlp43 rabbit serum presently produced did not react with any Pb01 culture supernatant, intracellular or cell wall extract component in immunoblot (data not shown). Regulation of gp43 expression is still poorly understood and transcription levels vary with the isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Rocha1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003111-Rocha2">[41]</xref>. We have studied the 5′ non-translated region of the Pb<italic>GP43</italic> gene and observed that it differs from that of the Pl<italic>P43</italic> gene, probably leading to distinct regulation and lower transcription.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data suggested that although there is at least one common epitope between gp43 and Plp43, gp43 cannot be used in diagnosis of PCM patients infected with <italic>P. lutzii</italic> because Plp43 is apparently poorly expressed during infection.</p>
