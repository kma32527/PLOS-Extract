<title>Background</title>
<p>Although immunopathology dictates clinical outcome in leprosy, the dynamics of early and chronic infection are poorly defined. In the tuberculoid region of the spectrum, <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> growth is restricted yet a severe granulomatous lesion can occur. The evolution and maintenance of chronic inflammatory processes like those observed in the leprosy granuloma involve an ongoing network of communications via cytokines. IL-10 has immunosuppressive properties and IL-10 genetic variants have been associated with leprosy development and reactions.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>The role of IL-10 in resistance and inflammation in leprosy was investigated using <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> infection of mice deficient in IL-10 (IL-10−/−), as well as mice deficient in both inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2−/−) and IL-10 (10NOS2−/−). Although a lack of IL-10 did not affect <italic>M. leprae</italic> multiplication in the footpads (FP), inflammation increased from C57Bl/6 (B6)&lt;IL-10−/−&lt;NOS2−/−&lt;10NOS2−/−. While IL-10−/− mice exhibited modest FP induration compared to B6, NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/− mice developed markedly enlarged FP marking distinct phases: early (1 month), peak (3–4 months), and chronic (8 months). IFN-γ-producing CD4+CD44+ cells responding to <italic>M. leprae</italic> cell wall, membrane, and cytosol antigens and ML2028 (Ag85B) were significantly increased in the evolved granuloma in NOS2−/− FP compared to B6 and IL-10−/− during early and peak phases. In 10NOS2−/− FP, CD4+CD44+ and especially CD8+CD44+ responses were augmented even further to these antigens as well as to ML0380 (GroES), ML2038 (bacterioferritin), and ML1877 (EF-Tu). Moreover, fragmented nerves containing CD4+ cells were present in 10NOS2−/− FP.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>The 10NOS2−/− strain offers insight on the regulation of granuloma formation and maintenance by immune modulators in the resistant forms of leprosy and presents a new model for investigating the pathogenesis of neurological involvement.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Despite effective antimicrobial therapy, 30–50% of leprosy patients develop immunological complications called leprosy reactions before, during or even years after being cured. Leprosy reactions are a major risk for neuritis that leads to peripheral nerve damage, disfigurement and disability. Unfortunately, why and how leprosy reactions occur is not well understood. Based on the latest human genetic leprosy susceptibility research and mouse infection models, we generated a double knockout mouse strain (10NOS2−/−) which has deficiencies in two key immune factors, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). We investigated the dynamics of the immune response to <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> infection and chronicled the types of immune cells recruited to the site of infection. 10NOS2−/− mice developed a substantial induration in response to infection, as well as an increased interferon-gamma response to components of the leprosy bacillus. Interestingly, these animals also exhibited CD4+ T cell infiltration into the nerves, a phenomenon which has not been previously reported in leprosy mouse models. This new model provides insight into potential mechanisms whereby immune modulators may regulate leprosy reactions and neuritis and could aid the development of tests for monitoring and treatment of leprosy patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease that is still diagnosed in &gt;200,000 new patients every year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Talhari1">[1]</xref>. Its clinical spectrum is associated with a diverse and often dynamic immune response ranging from strong cell mediated immunity (CMI) at one end to complete anergy toward <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> antigens at the other. As patients are often not diagnosed until years post-infection, the early stage determinants of disease resolution or progression are not yet understood. Likewise, much remains unknown regarding the immunopathogenesis of leprosy neuropathy which can occur even after successful antimicrobial therapy. Several global research collaborations are actively endeavoring to develop effective vaccines and new diagnostic methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Duthie1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Spencer3">[10]</xref>, but considerable additional effort is needed to ultimately eliminate leprosy.</p>
<p>The majority of leprosy patients are classified into the borderline area of the spectrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Scollard1">[11]</xref> where there appears to be a partial immunity of an undefined nature which allows neither complete anergy nor resolution of disease. Borderline leprosy can be immunologically unstable, permitting upgrading and downgrading responses due to immunological fluctuations or acute reactional episodes that may cause significant tissue destruction. In an effort to investigate this broad range of responses within the lesion, we have evaluated the <italic>M. leprae-</italic>induced footpad (FP) granuloma in a number of mouse strains with immune defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Krahenbuhl1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Adams2">[16]</xref>, including inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout mice (NOS2−/−) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Adams3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Cooper1">[18]</xref>. NOS2−/− mice respond to <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection in a manner that resembles borderline tuberculoid disease in that bacterial growth is restricted and they develop a large granulomatous response, composed of epithelioid macrophages and numerous lymphocytes, which infiltrates surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine produced primarily by macrophages and T cells. IL-10 polymorphisms have been associated with leprosy resistance or susceptibility in several endemic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Franceschi1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Aggarwal1">[25]</xref>, and variations in IL-10 expression have been noted in relation to the occurrence and treatment of reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Sreenivasan1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Geluk3">[28]</xref>. In addition, Toll-like receptor 2 polymorphisms have been linked to susceptibility and increased production of IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Kang1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Marques1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, IL-10 appears to play a major role in the course of this chronic infectious disease although the precise mechanisms of action within the site of infection are unknown. A better understanding of its involvement could benefit our ability to control the pathological consequences of leprosy.</p>
<p>Based upon these collective observations, we hypothesized that mice having an IL-10 deficiency would exhibit a more robust immune response toward <italic>M. leprae</italic>. Furthermore, a lack of IL-10 in the absence of NOS2 would further intensify the NOS2 immunopathological response, conceivably driving that model toward a more inflammatory or “reactional” state. Therefore, we examined <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection in IL-10−/− and NOS2−/− mice, as well as double knockout mice (10NOS2−/−), and evaluated three issues directly in the FP granulomas over the course of long term infection: 1) growth of the bacilli and histopathology, 2) host cellular dynamics evoked by <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection in the FP lesion, and 3) characterization of <italic>M. leprae</italic> antigen-specific T cells. Results show that while NOS2 is largely responsible for regulating the magnitude of T cell infiltration into the granuloma, a concomitant lack of IL-10 results in intensified <italic>M. leprae</italic> antigen responsiveness and T cell invasion of nerves.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>These studies were performed under a scientific protocol reviewed and approved by the National Hansen's Disease Programs Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Assurance #A3032-01), and were conducted in accordance with all state and federal laws in adherence with PHS policy and as outlined in <italic>The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Eighth Edition</italic>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Maintenance of viable <italic>M. leprae</italic> inoculum</title>
<p><italic>M. leprae</italic> strain Thai-53 was propagated in athymic <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). <italic>M. leprae</italic> were harvested from the FP and viability was assessed by radiorespirometry, which measures the oxidation of <sup>14</sup>C-palmitic acid to <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Truman1">[32]</xref> and vital staining, which utilizes Syto9 and propidium iodide to determine cell wall integrity (Bacterial Viability Staining Kit, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Lahiri2">[33]</xref>. <italic>M. leprae</italic> bacilli were stored at 4°C and used within 24 hours of harvest.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Female mice 5–7 weeks old were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) from the following strains: IL-10−/− (B6.129P2-<italic>IL-10</italic><sup>tm1Cgn/J</sup>), NOS2−/− (B6.129P2-<italic>NOS2</italic><sup>tm1Lau/J</sup>) and C57BL/6J mice (B6). IL-10−/−/NOS2−/− double knockout mice (10NOS2−/−) were generated by crossing IL-10−/− and NOS2−/− strains to produce offspring bearing both knockout mutations. Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in laminar flow animal isolators, in sterile cages, and maintained on sterile food and water. Like the parental strains, the 10NOS2−/− mice thrived in these conditions and were good breeders. They exhibited no overt differences in phenotypic or clinical features.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title><italic>M. leprae</italic> growth assay</title>
<p>Mice were infected with freshly harvested, viable <italic>M. leprae</italic> via inoculation of a low dose of 6×10<sup>3</sup> bacilli in 0.03 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into each hind FP. To assess bacterial multiplication, <italic>M. leprae</italic> were harvested from the FP and acid fast bacilli (AFB) were counted as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Truman1">[32]</xref>. <italic>M. leprae</italic> were enumerated at 3 months to verify early bacterial growth, at 6 months because maximum growth is reached in the control strain at this time, and at 12 months to check for clearance or continued growth in the knockout strains. FP tissue was examined by histology.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Feet were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, decalcified in 10% (w/v) sodium citrate and 22.5% (v/v) formic acid, and embedded in paraffin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Hagge2">[15]</xref>. Cross-sections (4 µm) from the distal, mid and proximal areas of the metatarsus were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. An Olympus BX53 microscope (Center Valley, PA) equipped with a Retiga 2000R Firewire Digital camera and cellSens Imaging Software was used to assess and capture images from the stained tissues.</p>

<title>FP granuloma and induration assay</title>
<p>Mice were infected with <italic>M. leprae</italic> via inoculation of a high dose of 3×10<sup>7</sup> bacilli in 0.03 ml PBS into each hind FP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Hagge1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Hagge2">[15]</xref>. Induration was measured weekly using a Vernier caliper. To characterize the granulomatous response, FP were harvested at 1 month (early), 4 months (peak induration), and 8 months (chronic) post-infection and evaluated for cell phenotypes, cytokine expression, and <italic>M. leprae</italic> antigen responsiveness.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>O.C.T. medium (Tissue Tek, Inc., Torrence, CA) embedded FP tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Serial 4 µm sections (Frigocut 2800E, Leica Microsystem, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) were fixed in cold acetone and, after blocking with avidin and biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), stained with rat anti-mouse CD4 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Biotin-labeled mouse anti-rat F(ab)<sub>2</sub> fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was applied, and immunohistochemical visualization was achieved with Vectastain <italic>Elite</italic> ABC kit (Vector), the AEC Substrate kit (Vector), and hematoxylin counterstain.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2h">
<title>Isolation of total RNA and preparation of cDNA</title>
<p>RNA was prepared from FP tissue of individual mice as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Hagge2">[15]</xref>. cDNA was generated from 0.5 µg RNA using random hexamers and an RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at 42°C for 1 hr in a thermocycler (9600, Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). Controls for DNA contamination were prepared from RNA samples using the reverse transcription reagents minus the reverse transcriptase. All sample and control preparations were aliquoted and stored at −70°C.</p>

<title>Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</title>
<p>Real-time RT-PCR for IFN-γ transcripts were carried out via Taqman technology using specific primer sets and probes and Universal Master Mix (Applied BioSystems) in an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied BioSystems). Semiquantitative analysis of the data was performed using the ΔΔC<sub>T</sub> method and expressed as a fold increase in cytokine expression over uninfected FP. Data were normalized for template variation using the GAPDH RT-PCR value for the same template.</p>

<title><italic>M. leprae</italic> viability assay</title>
<p>FP tissue, which was fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at −20°C until processing, was rehydrated in water and suspended in TRIzol reagent.

Based on this RLEP count, the RNA equivalent of 3×10<sup>3</sup> <italic>M. leprae</italic> from the purified RNA fraction was converted to cDNA using an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). As a control for possible DNA contamination, “mock” cDNA was prepared using an equivalent amount of RNA, polymerase mix, and primers without the reverse transcriptase. The viability of the <italic>M. leprae</italic> in each sample was determined on cDNA, using Taqman technology, the standard curve method, and primers and probes specific for <italic>esxA</italic> (encodes the ESAT-6 protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Davis1">[35]</xref>.</p>

<p>We first assessed growth of <italic>M. leprae</italic> in NOS2−/− mice using the standard mouse FP growth assay, which exploits the fact that a minor inoculum of <italic>M. leprae</italic> (≤10<sup>4</sup>) into the FP of immunocompetent mice can initially evade immune-mediated killing, grow locally for approximately 6 months, and peak at 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> bacilli when growth is halted by the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Welch1">[42]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, multiplication of the bacilli was similar in the B6 and NOS2−/− strains and peaked on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> AFB per FP by 6 months post infection. Extended observation demonstrated that <italic>M. leprae</italic> growth did not continue past the 6 months peak in the NOS2−/− but showed a trend toward improved clearance at 12 months (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0049).</p>

(B) B6 (black circles) and NOS2−/− (diamonds) mice were inoculated with 3×10<sup>7</sup> <italic>M. leprae</italic> in each hind FP and FP induration was measured monthly using a Vernier caliper. (C) FP granuloma cells were harvested from B6 (black bars) and NOS2−/− (striped bars) mice 4 months post inoculation with 3×10<sup>7</sup> <italic>M. leprae</italic>. Non-adherent cells were plated at 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and stimulated with <italic>M. leprae</italic> membrane antigen for 48 hr.

<p>The <italic>M. leprae</italic> growth assay is limited in that the minimal infection site that develops in immunocompetent mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, [B6]) is insufficient for in depth investigation of the granuloma. Therefore, we utilize the FP induration assay, where adequate numbers of <italic>M. leprae</italic> are administered in the initial inoculum to induce a granuloma which can then be monitored via induration and at the cellular level throughout chronic infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, B6 FP reached peak induration of 0.72±0.13 mm at 3 months post infection and maintained this level for several months. In contrast, induration in NOS2−/− FP was significantly augmented by 1 month (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), continued to increase until it peaked at 2.36±0.51 mm at 4 months, then declined over the next 8 months.</p>

In B6 mice, minimal interstitial infiltrates of mononuclear cells can be seen between muscles in the ventral portion of the FP (bottom of figure). In IL-10−/− FP, more extensive mononuclear cell infiltrates are seen in the subcutis as well as greatly expanded granulomatous inflammation that has replaced approximately 25% of the total muscle mass. In NOS2−/− FP, granulomatous inflammation has replaced nearly 50% of the muscle mass, as is also seen in 10NOS2−/−.

<p>In order to investigate the immune modulators within the site of infection, FP lymphocytes were harvested at 4 months and stimulated with <italic>M. leprae</italic> membrane antigen in vitro. Striking differences between the B6 and NOS2−/− strains were seen in cytokine and chemokine production. Large amounts of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-2), chemokines (CCL-3 and CCL-4), and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), as well as other analytes associated with inflammation (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-9, IL-13, IL-17, CCL-2 CCL-5, G-CSF and GM-CSF [data not shown]) were generated by the NOS2−/− cells compared to B6 FP cells. In contrast, similar levels of IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, KC, and eotaxin (data not shown) and very low levels of the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), were produced by both strains. Interestingly, significantly elevated levels of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) were generated by the NOS2−/− FP cells compared to B6 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004).</p>
<p>Because IL-10 has immunosuppressive properties, we questioned whether its generation in the NOS2−/− mice may be an attempt to temper the inflammatory response generated at the site of infection. If so, we postulated that inhibiting both IL-10 and NOS2 could push the model to a more inflammatory state. Our initial attempts to inhibit both IL-10 and NOS2 involved supplementing the drinking water of <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected IL-10−/− mice with L-NIL, a selective inhibitor of NOS2. These mice developed an enlarged FP induration over an 8 week period (data not shown). In order to perform longer term studies, however, we generated a NOS2 and IL-10 double knockout strain (10NOS2−/−) by cross-breeding mice with the individual knockouts.</p>

<title>10NOS2−/− limit growth of <italic>M. leprae</italic> in the FP but exhibit an enhanced magnitude in the granulomatous response</title>
<p>10NOS2−/−, alongside IL-10−/−, NOS2−/− and B6 mice, were inoculated with 6×10<sup>3</sup> viable <italic>M. leprae</italic> in both hind FP and tissues were harvested at 3, 6 and 12 months post inoculation to assess growth of the bacilli. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, AFB counts from all knockout groups demonstrated a pattern of growth that was similar to the B6 strain in that they controlled infection and peaked at 6 months on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> AFB per FP, albeit counts were somewhat higher in NOS2−/− (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0477) and 10NOS2−/− (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0146). Again, there was improved clearance in the NOS2−/− (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0069) at 12 months, as well as in the 10NOS2−/− (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0413). Although a restriction of growth of <italic>M. leprae</italic> was achieved by all groups, histological assessment indicated significant variations in the granulomatous responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Mild interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in B6 FP. More extensive cellular infiltration was observed in IL-10−/−, and the most extensive infiltrates were seen in NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/−. In all strains, the infiltrates were composed of mononuclear cells, with few granulocytes. In both NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/−, the inflammatory infiltrates replaced muscle bundles in the FP, but no active necrosis of muscle was seen and no epidermal changes were observed.</p>

<title>Induration and IFN-γ expression in <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected 10NOS2−/− FP over long term infection</title>
<p>In order to further investigate granuloma dynamics, we assessed induration, cellular recruitment, IFN-γ expression, and bacterial viability over the course of long-term infection of the FP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, induration in B6 FP reached a peak of approximately 0.5 mm at 1 month post infection and was maintained at this level for several months. FP thickness in IL-10−/− was greater than in B6 mice throughout infection (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). A strongly amplified pattern of induration was observed in NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/− permitting division into three phases for investigation: early (1 month), peak (3–4 months) and chronic (&gt;8 months). By 1 month, both NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/− FP were significantly more indurated than either IL-10−/− or B6 FP (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), and by peak phase both of these strains similarly exhibited &gt;4 times the induration of IL-10−/− or B6 FP (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). During the later phase of chronic infection, 10NOS2−/− showed a slower decline than NOS2−/− in FP induration and eventually diminished into a final plateau of approximately twice that of IL-10−/− and B6 FP (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, all strains demonstrated robust IFN-γ expression in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection. B6 and IL-10−/− mice exhibited a &gt;1 log increase in IFN-γ expression over uninfected FP throughout infection. In NOS2−/− FP, IFN-γ expression was increased more than 2 log over that in B6 FP at 4 months (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Expression of IFN-γ was significantly greater in 10NOS2−/− FP compared to all other strains at 1 month, and this high level of expression was maintained throughout infection.</p>
<p>To verify that the augmented induration and IFN-γ expression seen in NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/− FP was not due to enhanced bacterial growth in these strains, we determined <italic>M. leprae</italic> counts and viability in this high dose model. Compared to initial counts at 1 day, the number of <italic>M. leprae</italic> remained relatively constant in B6 and IL-10−/− FP or decreased slightly in NOS2−/− and 10NOS2−/− FP at 4 months post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, <italic>M. leprae</italic> exhibited high viability in all strains at 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003149-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) but bacterial viability declined significantly in all strains by 4 months, again indicating that the lack of NOS2 and/or IL-10 did not compromise immune-mediated killing of the bacilli.</p>

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Harboe1">[45]</xref>: the <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected Schwann cell can act as an antigen-presenting cell and signal destruction of the infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Spierings1">[46]</xref>; the inflammatory response can injure the nerve as an “innocent bystander”; a cell mediated immune response may become destructive when T cells necessary for the protective response induce tissue damage depending on the type and quantity of the local cytokine response, as during Type 1 reactions. We did not see infection of Schwann cells by <italic>M. leprae</italic> in the B6 or any of the knockout strains; hence, the first mechanism for nerve damage is unlikely in our model. While the second mechanism may play a role, the elevated IFN-γ response in the absence of IL-10 and appearance of T cells inside damaged nerves in the 10NOS2−/− FP would suggest the latter mechanism. Thus, a lack of IL-10 appears to result in a neuropathologic response in the inflammatory NOS2−/− model.</p>
<p>IL-10 up-regulation can suppress lymphocyte-driven immunity, and in leprosy IL-10 is detected in multibacillary lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Yamamura1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Teles1">[50]</xref>. This <italic>M. leprae</italic>-induced IL-10 could contribute to the development of the T cell anergy seen at the Th2-dominant lepromatous end of the leprosy spectrum by steering the immune response toward a phagocytic rather than antimicrobial program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Montoya1">[51]</xref>. In vitro, <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection stimulates monocytes to produce IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Sieling1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Lima1">[54]</xref>, and IL-10 supplementation of infected macrophage cultures extends maintenance of <italic>M. leprae</italic> viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Fukutomi1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Fukutomi2">[56]</xref>. In an experimental model, IL-10 expression is elevated in <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected IFN-γ knockout mice which exhibit less resistance to infection compared to control mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Adams1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, IL-10 is also detected in paucibacillary leprosy lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Venturini1">[48]</xref>. Its presence along with various Th1 cytokines has been suggested to be a mechanism for tempering immunopathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Stefani1">[57]</xref>. Iyer et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Iyer1">[58]</xref> proposed that the observation of both IL-10 and TNF in Type 1 and Type 2 reactions indicated the simultaneous suppression of proinflammatory pathways and activation of regulatory pathways to control tissue damage from excessive inflammation.</p>
<p>This study represents the first time IL-10 deficiency has been investigated 1) in vivo, 2) at the site of infection and 3) over acute and chronic infection in an experimental leprosy model. Similarities in <italic>M. leprae</italic> growth profiles across the strains suggest that an absence of IL-10, either alone or combined with a NOS2 deficiency, did not provide a more growth restrictive environment in the already highly resistant B6 strain. <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected IL-10−/− mice exhibited slight exacerbations compared to B6 in histopathology, FP induration, and antigen responsiveness with no evidence of survival or resumed <italic>M. leprae</italic> growth over the course of infection. In contrast, IL-10−/− mice infected with BCG or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> exhibited high Th1 cytokine responses and enhanced inflammation with persistent granulomas containing reduced bacterial loads in short-term lung studies compared to wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Murray1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Redford1">[62]</xref>. Nevertheless, a longer term study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Higgins1">[63]</xref>, demonstrated eventual morbidity due to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> regrowth.</p>
<p>In our studies with NOS2−/− mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Adams3">[17]</xref> and this paper), we found that <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection of the FP resulted in a large granuloma composed of numerous epithelioid cells and dense collections of lymphocytes. The granuloma infiltrated muscle bundles and partly destroyed them, with recruited cells exhibiting elevated levels of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, as well as IL-10; yet bacterial growth remained restricted as compared to B6. Similarly, previous studies using <italic>M. avium</italic> infection of NOS2 deficient mice have shown increased granuloma formation and cellularity and an up-regulation of Th1 cytokine, chemokine and IL-10 expression in the absence of bacterial replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Gomes1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Ehlers1">[65]</xref>. Thus, we questioned whether disruption of both IL-10 and NOS2 would exacerbate the NOS2 model further toward a more inflammatory or even “reactional” state. Infection of 10NOS2−/− FP with <italic>M. leprae</italic> resulted in a markedly enhanced accumulation of <italic>M. leprae</italic>-responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the granuloma and a CD4+ T cell infiltration into the local nerves, an outcome not seen in the single knockout mice nor previously reported in mouse models for leprosy.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that peak inflammation developed within 3–4 months after <italic>M. leprae</italic> inoculation, a time when the bacteria have been killed. While ∼15% of reactions are identified at the time of leprosy diagnosis, reactions and neuropathy continue to occur during the first year of treatment (Scollard et al., submitted for publication) and even years after successful multidrug therapy (MDT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Ranque1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-deOliveira1">[68]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that antimicrobial therapy which kills the bacilli may cause release of increased or different antigens thereby heightening the risk for subsequent immunological complications in some patients. No <italic>M. leprae</italic>-specific antigens have yet been identified in relationship to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Thus, the three induration phases revealed interesting contrasts among the mouse strains regarding which <italic>M. leprae</italic> antigens were recognized, which lymphocytes targeted them, and when they were targeted over the course of long term infection. In the 10NOS2−/− FP, there was a significantly stronger IFN-γ response to the crude antigens and ML2028 (Ag85B), as well as to ML0380 (GroES), ML2038 (bactoferritin), and ML1877 (EF-Tu) by both CD4+ and especially CD8+ T cells at the site of infection. Interestingly, the GroES, Ag85B, and EF-Tu antigens of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> have been reported to function as plasminogen receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Xolalpa1">[69]</xref>. Activation of the mammalian plasminogen-plasmin system has been proposed to be a mechanism whereby pathogens can contribute to bacterial dissemination and tissue damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003149-Lahteenmaki1">[70]</xref>. Whether these <italic>M. leprae</italic> homologues promote tissue damage via this pathway is an interesting prospect for investigation.</p>
<p>Despite 30 years of global MDT programs and redefined elimination targets, leprosy remains a persistently reported disease in a number of endemic countries. However, even if all current active cases of leprosy were detected and provided MDT today, a significant portion of those patients would still experience subsequent progressive disease complications for years to come due to immunological perturbations. Leprosy reactions are a major cause of permanent neuropathy and disability especially in patients with borderline disease. Our findings present the 10NOS2−/− strain as an interesting model for investigating lymphocyte recruitment into the granuloma and nerves throughout long term infection in the resistant forms of leprosy. Determining the antigens recognized by T cells at the site of <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection could significantly further understanding of immunopathogenesis. This in turn, could provide stepping stones for the development of <italic>M. leprae</italic>-antigen specific diagnostics to improve detection, monitoring, and treatment of leprosy patients.</p>
