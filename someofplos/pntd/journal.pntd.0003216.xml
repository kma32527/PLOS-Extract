<title>Background and purpose</title>
<p>The ability to track changes in gene expression following viral infection is paramount to understanding viral pathogenesis. This study was undertaken to evaluate the nCounter, a high throughput digital gene expression system, as a means to better understand West Nile virus (WNV) dissemination and the inflammatory response against WNV in the outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model over the course of infection.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The nCounter Mouse Inflammation gene expression kit containing 179 inflammation related genes was used to analyze gene expression changes in multiple tissues over a nine day course of infection in SW mice following intraperitoneal injection with WNV. Protein expression levels for a subset of these cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using a multiplex protein detection system (BioPlex) and comparisons of protein/RNA expression levels made.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Expression analysis of spleen, lung, liver, kidney and brain of SW mice infected with WNV revealed that <italic>Cxcl10</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> are differentially expressed in all tissues tested except kidney. Data stratification of positively confirmed infected (WNV (+)) versus non-infected (WNV (−) tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from WNV infection. Significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in <italic>C3ar1</italic> was found in WNV (−) spleen. <italic>Il23a</italic> was significantly upregulated, while <italic>Il10rb</italic> was down-regulated in WNV (−) lung. <italic>Il3</italic> and <italic>Mbl2</italic> were down-regulated in WNV (−) liver. In WNV (+) livers, <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Tlr2</italic>, chemokines <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl3</italic>, <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, cytokines <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Il18</italic>, cytokine-related gene <italic>Il1r</italic> and cytokine agonist <italic>Ilrn</italic> were significantly upregulated. In WNV (−) brain tissues, <italic>Csf2</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> were significantly upregulated. Similar gene and protein expression kinetics were found for <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl4 and Ccl5</italic> and correlated with the presence of infectious virus. In summary, the utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes in SW mice associated with WNV infection was demonstrated.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The nCounter, a high throughput digital molecular detection and quantitation system, was used to define the inflammatory response of SW mice to WNV infection following intraperitoneal injection in multiple tissues over a 9 day course of viral infection. Data analysis identified expression profiles common and unique to major tissues. Complementary protein suspension array analysis of a subset of genes demonstrated the expression kinetics of RNA and protein expression compared to infectious virus production. Data stratification of WNV (+) versus WNV (−) tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response versus tissue-specific responses due to infection with WNV over time. The results generated from this study will allow for further hypothesis generation and testing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus endemic to parts of the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. WNV naturally cycles between mosquitoes and birds but also infects humans and other animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Lim1">[1]</xref>. Humans infected with WNV develop a febrile illness that is self-resolving but a subset of cases, 20–25% will develop a febrile illness and 1 out of 150–250 WNV infections will progress to develop meningitis or encephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Mostashari1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Watson1">[4]</xref>. There are currently no approved antiviral therapies or vaccines for human use. Since its introduction to North America in 1999, WNV has become the leading cause of mosquito-borne epidemic encephalitis in the United States (US) and now poses a significant public health risk. From 1999 to 2012 the number of WNV infections has totaled 37,088 cases of which 16,114 cases were reported to be neuroinvasive and 1,549 were fatal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm</ext-link>). Since its introduction, the US has experienced annual epidemics of WNV disease that peaked in 2002–2003. Subsequently, the numbers of WNV cases remained relatively constant until a steady decline was observed beginning in 2008. However, 2012 saw a dramatic resurgence in the number of WNV cases reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Beasley1">[5]</xref> reinforcing the ongoing risk that WNV poses to human and animal health in North America and the unpredictable nature of outbreaks. Over the past few years, relatively large outbreaks of neuroinvasive disease in humans and horses involving multiple lineages of WNV have also been reported from several European countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Chowers1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Danis2">[8]</xref>. Rapid screening technologies, coupled with a better understanding of the host response to viral infections would be of great value in responding to future outbreaks of such diseases.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, inbred mouse strains (i.e. C57BL/6, 129 Sv/Ev, BALB/C and C3H) of varying ages have been used extensively as model systems to study host responses and determinants of WNV neuroinvasive disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Brown1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Shrestha1">[11]</xref>. Using various inbred and knockout mouse strains, several laboratories have shown varying degrees of susceptibility to WNV infection, in addition to identifying aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses that offer protection against WNV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Samuel1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Mehlhop2">[18]</xref>. Alternatively, ICR (CD-1) outbred mice have been used to demonstrate loss of neuroinvasiveness for some attenuated WNV strains. NIH Swiss or Swiss Webster outbred mice have been utilized to demonstrate differences in neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence between naturally occurring and engineered WNV strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Beasley2">[19]</xref>, to study molecular determinants of neuroinvasiveness in related lineage 1 WNV strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Beasley3">[20]</xref>, and for evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Seregin1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Zhang1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>In recent studies, microarray analysis has been used to detect changes in gene expression after viral infection to help better understand the immune mechanisms governing viral pathogenesis. Gene expression profiling of human embryonic kidney cells, human glioma cells and human retinal pigmented cells, as well as various mouse cell lines, infected with WNV <italic>in vitro</italic> have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Koh1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Cho1">[29]</xref>. With the development of multiple WNV mouse models, gene expression analysis has been applied to whole tissues of WNV-infected mice. The first microarray analysis of WNV mouse model used NIH Swiss mice and gene expression analysis focused primarily on brain, spleen and liver tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Venter1">[30]</xref>. A more recent study used <italic>Mavs<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Ifnar<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Mavs<sup>−/−</sup>Ifnar<sup>−/−</sup></italic> double-knockout mice to demonstrate complex innate immune signaling regulated tissue tropism between the spleen and liver of WNV infected mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Suthar2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>To better understand the dynamic changes in gene expression profiles across multiple peripheral tissues, high-throughput digital gene expression analysis was utilized to investigate the inflammatory response throughout the course of infection in the WNV Swiss Webster (SW) weanling mouse model. The nCounter molecular detection and quantitation system was used to examine how infection with highly neuroinvasive WNV strain 382–99 (often termed “NY99”) altered the kinetics of the inflammatory response through the course of infection in a common outbred mouse model of neuroinvasive WNV disease. The nCounter identifies and quantitates RNA transcripts free of enzymatic amplification, with high levels of sensitivity, linearity, and multiplexing, and can simultaneously analyze up to 850 individual transcripts at concentrations as low as 0.5fMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Geiss1">[32]</xref>. In this study, the utility of the nCounter system enabling rapid gene expression analysis for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of WNV infection in mice was demonstrated. Genes common to multiple tissues that are differentially expressed when WNV RNA is detected and genes that are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner following active WNV infection across multiple tissues over the entire course of infection are reported.</p>

<title>Cells and Viruses</title>
<p>West Nile virus (WNV) strain 382–99 was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The virus was passaged once each in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (CE) and rhesus monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2) prior to receipt at WRCEVA, and then twice in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) to generate the stock used for this study. Vero E6 cells (ATCC, CRL1586) were maintained in MEM, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1,000 IU/ml penicillin, and 1,000 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Viral Titers</title>
<p>WNV titers in culture supernatants, serum and homogenized tissue samples from animal experiments were determined by standard plaque assay on Vero cells. Briefly, samples were serially diluted in PBS in the range 1∶10<sup>1</sup> to 1∶10<sup>6</sup>. One hundred microliters (100 µl) of sample was added to each well of a 12-well plate with a confluent monolayer of Vero cells. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, then 2 ml of overlay was added to each well (final concentration = 1% agar with 1× MEM, 2% Bovine Growth Serum, 0.6 mM L-glutamine, 1,000 IU/ml penicillin, 1,000 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1× MEM non-essential amino acids). Plates were incubated in a 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. At 2 days post-infection, 1 ml of overlay supplemented with 2% neutral red (Sigma) was added. Plaques were enumerated using a light box at day 3 post-infection.</p>

<title>Mouse Experiments</title>
<p>A nine-day serial-sacrifice experiment was performed using thirty 3 to 4-week-old female Swiss Webster mice (Charles River Laboratories) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of WNV in a volume of 100 µl of PBS. Three mice were euthanized per day during days 1 to 9 post infection (p.i.). Three PBS mock infected control mice were sacrificed on day 1 p.i. Serum, brain, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen tissue were collected from each mouse. Each tissue sample was divided into two equivalent sized pieces. One piece was placed in 1 ml TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) for RNA extraction. The other piece was placed in 500 µl PBS and homogenized for viral titer determination. Animal studies were performed at UTMB under ABSL3 conditions in accordance with a protocol approved by UTMB's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Chemokine Analysis</title>
<p>Tissue homogenates were gamma-irradiated (5 megarads) prior to analysis at BSL2. Samples were processed according to manufacturer instructions and then analyzed using a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Briefly, the tissue homogenates were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,000 rpm at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The cleared supernatants were aliquoted into 96-well plates in pre-determined wells; this plate was centrifuged at 1,250 rpm to remove any remaining debris. The supernatant was transferred to a 96-well flat bottom plate and processed for use on the Bio-Plex system. The cytokines were coupled to cytokine-specific multiplex beads (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions using the pre-designed assays Bio-Plex Pro mouse cytokine 23-plex immunoassay.

<title>Nucleic Acid Extractions</title>
<p>All sample RNAs were extracted from TRIzol (Life Technologies) treated brain, lung, kidney, liver and spleen tissue homogenates according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-fifth of the total volume of chloroform was added, mixed, incubated 15 min at 25°C and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm 15 min at 4°C. To the aqueous layer, a 70% volume of 100% isopropyl alcohol was added. Samples were mixed, incubated 10 min at 25°C then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, air dried briefly at room temperature (RT) and resuspended in RNase-free, DEPC treated water (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored at −80°C until needed.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p>All reactions were performed on 96 well FAST PCR plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 25 µl (20 µl master mix plus 5 µl sample) optimized for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A volume of 20 µl qRT-PCR master mix was prepared per manufacturer instructions (AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). Tissue homogenates were analyzed using 1 ng total RNA and reactions performed in triplicate. Each plate contained 3 negative (no template controls) and 3 positive controls containing 1,000 copies of Alien-armored RNA (Asuragen, Austin, TX). Alien armored RNA was prepared per manufacturer instructions and diluted to 200 copies/µl in water. Reactions were performed on ABI 7500 thermal cyclers (Life Technologies) under the following Real-Time Fast thermal cycling conditions: 45°C for 10 minutes for reverse transcription of cDNA synthesis, 95°C for 10 minutes for inactivation of the reverse transcriptase, activation of 25X RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, and denaturation of the RNA/cDNA hybrid; followed by amplification at 40 cycles of 97°C for 2 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were purchased from Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (Novato, CA). Primer and probe sequences were as follows; WNV 19-F <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′AGGTCCTTCGCAAGAGGT 3′</named-content>, WNV 19-R <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′GYGCCAAGTGYACVACGT 3′</named-content>, WNV 19-Probe <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ FAM-GCCAAGATCAGCDTKCCAGCBA-BHQ1 3′</named-content>. Upon receipt, oligos were reconstituted in sterile 1× Tris-EDTA Buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, Teknova, Hollister, CA) to a concentration of 100 mM. Working stocks were made by diluting primers and probes to a concentration of 10 mM with TE Buffer.</p>
<p>A standard curve of Cq vs. amount of infectious virus RNA added to each reaction was generated and used to determine the PFU equivalent viral RNA amounts reported using standard plaque assays on Vero cells and total RNA extracts from viral culture supernatants.</p>

<title>nCounter Gene Expression Profiling</title>
<p>The nCounter Mouse Inflammation gene expression Kit was purchased from NanoString Technologies (Seattle, WA) and consists of 179 inflammation-related mouse genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s011">Table S1</xref>) and 6 internal reference genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nanostring.com/products/gene_expression_panels" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nanostring.com/products/gene_expression_panels</ext-link>). The nCounter assay was performed using 100 ng of total RNA. Hybridization reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with 5 µl diluted sample preparation reaction and incubated at 65°C for a minimum of 18 h. Hybridized reactions were purified using the nCounter Prep Station (NanoString Technologies) and data collection was performed on the nCounter Digital Analyzer (NanoString Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each assay data collection was performed at maximum density (1155 fields of view). RNA concentrations were determined using a Qubit (<italic>1.0</italic>) Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).</p>
<p>The raw data were normalized to six genes within each tissue type with the lowest coefficient of variation using the nSolver software following manufacturer's instructions (NanoString Technologies). The normalized results are expressed as total mRNA counts.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2i">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Gene expression analysis was performed in Excel using a heteroscedastic Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and changes in gene expression profiles were consider significant if p&lt;0.05; uncorrected for multiple T-test. For graphing purposes Prism version 6.0a (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used. Correlation coefficient was measured using Pearson's <italic>r</italic>. To adjust for values equal 0 for PFU and genome equivalents, log (x+c) was used to normalize all PFU and genome values prior to statistical analysis; c = lowest measured value/2.</p>

<title>Gene Association Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis used the raw Nanostring mouse gene expression data, captured as mRNA counts harvested from brain, liver, lung, spleen and kidney tissue. Each of the organ-specific datasets consisted of 179 distinct gene rows and 30 columns. The number of columns corresponded to 3 mice sacrificed each day for 9 days post-infection with WNV. An additional three columns corresponded to a single set of three “mock” values, harvested from un-infected mice to serve as a reference. The columns were further annotated by a ‘1’ if viral RNA was detected in the harvested tissue and ‘0’ if viral RNA was not detected. For each organ dataset, the data between ‘0’ and ‘1’ states was binned separately. Separate time series for ‘0’ and ‘1’ were generated by averaging over the ‘0’ and ‘1’ mice separately each day. Changes in gene expression between ‘0’ and ‘1’ states were then quantified. The expression level of a specific gene <italic>y</italic> was deemed to be up-regulated if the sign of median (<italic>y</italic>(1))-median(<italic>y</italic>(0)) was positive and down-regulated if the sign was negative. The magnitude of the change was quantified by calculating the Kullbeck-Leibler divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Kasturi1">[33]</xref> between the gene expression distributions in ‘0’ and ‘1’ states. Finally, a weighted gene expression correlation network was constructed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of genes. The sign of the Pearson coefficient determined whether the time series were correlated (+) or anti-correlated(−).</p>

<title>WNV Infection in the Swiss Webster Mouse Model</title>
<p>Outbred Swiss mice are highly susceptible to peripheral challenge with neuroinvasive strains of WNV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Beasley2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Zhang1">[23]</xref>.

To better characterize the WNV Swiss outbred mouse model, 3 to 4 week old Swiss Webster (SW) female mice were infected with the prototypical North American WNV NY99 (strain 382–99) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Three mice were randomly chosen and sacrificed daily during days 1 to 9 post infection (p.i.) and serum, spleen, lung, liver, kidney and brain were collected for determination of infectious WNV loads using a standard plaque assay and qRT-PCR protocol. Mice first displayed clinical signs of disease (hunching, ruffled fur, and tremors) on day 6 p.i. and one mouse was paralyzed on day 9 p.i. Consistent with previous studies in outbred and inbred mouse strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Samuel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Diamond1">[14]</xref>, peak viremia (∼10<sup>3.5</sup> PFU/mL) was detected 48–72 hours (h) p.i. and dropped below the plaque assay limit of detection (LOD) by day 6 p.i.

<p>Dissemination of WNV to peripheral organs was detected by plaque assay as early as day 2 p.i. in the spleen and lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, respectively). In the spleen, the amount of infectious virus peaked at day 4 p.i. (∼10<sup>4</sup> PFU/g) and was detectable up to day 8 p.i. Levels of infectious virus in the lung remained constant beginning on day 2 through day 7 p.i. (∼10<sup>4</sup> PFU/g). No infectious virus was detected in the liver throughout the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Infectious WNV was detected at day 3 p.i. in the kidney and was detectable up to day 8 p.i. (∼10<sup>3.5</sup> PFU/g) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Low levels of infectious virus (10<sup>3</sup> PFU/g) were detected in the brain beginning at day 5 p.i. and with a marked increased at days 8 and 9 (&gt;10<sup>6</sup> PFU/g) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g001">Figure 1 F</xref>). Increased viral titers correlated well with the onset of tremors at day 6 p.i.</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from brain, lung, liver, kidney and spleen homogenates for analysis using a WNV specific qRT-PCR protocol to determine infection by the presence or absence of genomic viral RNA. Using this method, viral RNA was detected on day 1 p.i. in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and day 2 p.i. in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast to the plaque assay, viral RNA was detected in the liver on day 3 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), on day 1 p.i. in the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) and on day 4 p.i. in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The qRT-PCR method enabled determination of WNV RNA spread (and by extension, presence of virus) to visceral tissues with greater sensitivity than plaque-assay (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003216-t001">Table 1</xref>). As with the infectious virus titers, at least some of the viral RNA detected in organ samples collected at days 1–3 may be attributed to presence of virus or virus-infected cells in blood. For the liver, viral RNA was detected only starting at day 3. Viral RNA “titer” in the liver from day 3 through day 9 was stable at 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> PFU equivalent/gram, potentially indicating that the viral RNA detected had a source other than infected liver tissue.</p>

<title>Dynamic Gene Expression Profile of Tissue-Specific Inflammatory Responses</title>
<p>The dynamic gene expression profiles of the inflammatory response in WNV-infected SW outbred mice were analyzed using the nCounter system, a next generation digital gene expression system that allows for multiplex-gene expression analysis in one reaction without the need of enzymatic RNA amplification. A predefined 179-gene expression mouse inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s011">Table S1</xref>) panel was used to analyze daily changes in gene expression profiles (GEP) in the spleen, lung, liver, kidney and brain in mice infected with WNV compared to mock control SW mice. A general picture of GEP trends was obtained by comparing significance versus fold changes for each gene per day. This preliminary analysis identified 41 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the spleen, 114 in the lung, 19 in the kidney, 61 in the liver and 9 in the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The very large number of DEG identified in the lung from 4 to 8 days p.i. was an unexpected finding and to our knowledge no previous studies have shown this.</p>
<p>Genes which had changes in their expression levels most strongly correlated with detection of viral RNA were identified (Red and Blue circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g003">Figure 3</xref>) by generating gene expression networks for brain, liver, spleen, and kidney. This analysis identified genes that changed their expression levels above the 95th percentile of the tissue-specific Kullbeck-Leibler (K-L) divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Kasturi1">[33]</xref> calculated between gene expression in WNV RNA(+) tissue relative to WNV RNA(−) tissue. This general analysis revealed that expression of DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), an apoptosis promoter gene was down-regulated in infected brain tissue and was associated with a reduction in expression of 14 of other genes in that tissue. For spleen, <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Max</italic>, and <italic>C1qb</italic>, were all upregulated in infected tissue and showing an association with a large number of other genes in that tissue (large blue circles). <italic>Cd401g</italic> was down-regulated in spleen and also showed association with a large number of other genes in this tissue (large red circle). For kidney, two transcriptional effectors, <italic>Nr3c1</italic> and <italic>Creb1</italic> were the genes showing an association with a large number of other genes. Even though the lung showed 114 DEG, no connections between genes were found at the significance threshold used in this analysis. Liver analysis is not shown as we could not conclusively demonstrate liver infection thus rendering correlations non-informative.</p>

Blue indicates upregulation of the gene and red labels down-regulation. Edges between two genes X and Y in the networks indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient P(X,Y) with an absolute value over 97.5-th percentile. Orange nodes are first-degree neighbors of the MTR genes. Black edges indicate a positive correlation coefficient (i.e. between the two genesand green indicates a negative coefficient (anti-correlation). Nodes are sized by degree, i.e. how many other genes the node is connected to. Lung is not shown because there were no connections present at the significance threshold used. Liver is not shown as there was no conclusive evidence of liver infection.</p>

<p>Gene clustering revealed the majority of the DEG in the spleen was observed on days 3 to 5 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) coinciding with observed peak viral titers in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In the lung, the number of up-regulated genes roughly equaled that of down-regulated genes between days 5 to 8 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) around the time peak viral titers were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). No infectious virus was detectable in the liver. However, the number of DEG that were upregulated between days 4 to 9 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) followed similar trends when compared to observed genomic WNV RNA detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In the kidney, the number of DEG peaks at day 8 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), although infectious virus was not consistently detected and viral RNA peaked at day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, after day 1 p.i., all DEG in the kidney were down-regulated. In the brain, the number of DEG was small compared to the spleen and lung and these were mostly down regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>DEG in three of the five tissues collected were then analyzed. DEG common to the spleen, lung and liver totaled 14 and included seven chemokine and cytokine genes, 3 signal transduction genes, 2 TLR genes and 2 transcriptional regulators (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003216-t002">Table 2</xref>). DEG common to the lung, liver and kidney were alternative complement pathway gene <italic>Cfb</italic>, and chemokine gene <italic>Cxcl2</italic>. A complement factor gene (C7) is differentially expressed (DE) in the lung, liver and brain. A signal transduction gene (<italic>Nox1</italic>) is DE in the spleen, liver and brain. A cytokine gene (<italic>Tnf</italic>) is DE in the spleen, kidney and brain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003216-t002">Table 2</xref>). Large numbers of DEG were found to be common to two tissue types and a number of genes were uniquely expressed in a tissue-specific manner (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003216-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to better understand biological mechanisms that may be involved in the inflammatory response against WNV infection, the list of DEG from each individual tissue was then used to perform a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Huangda1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Huangda2">[35]</xref>. This analysis identified several biological pathways that were consistently activated in the tissues studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003216-t003">Table 3</xref>). Among the top pathways identified in most tissues were cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, Toll-like receptor signaling, chemokine signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, MAPK signaling and complement and coagulation cascades. The complete pathway enrichment for each tissue is summarized in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003216-t003">Table 3</xref>). Brain was not included in this analysis due to an insufficient number of DEG identified.</p>

<p>STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) was used to identify protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks for all DEG within each tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Jensen1">[36]</xref>. STRING is a database of known and predicted functions that are derived from direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations derived from genomic context, high throughput experiments, conserved coexpression and previous knowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Jensen1">[36]</xref>. Networks for spleen, kidney, lung, liver and brain were generated (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s002">Figure S2A–E</xref>). Brain was included in this analysis even though no biological pathways were identified for this organ using DAVID as a PPI network could be generated using STRING with the limited number of DEG. Consistent with the analysis of DEGs described above, the most significantly activated pathways within the PPI network for each tissue (with the exception of the brain) were cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions for the lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s003">Figure S3</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s004">Figure S4</xref>), spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s006">Figure S6</xref>), followed by Toll-like receptor signaling pathways for the lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s008">Figure S8</xref>), complement and coagulation cascades for the liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s009">Figure S9</xref>) and JAK-STAT signaling pathway for the kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003216.s010">Figure S10</xref>).

<title>Protein Expression and Viral Kinetics in Tissue-Specific Responses</title>
<p>Expression levels for 23 cytokine proteins in homogenized tissue extracts (constituting a subset of the 179 genes analyzed by the nCounter) were determined using a multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Plex Pro). Changes in protein expression, measured as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), were analyzed using a heteroscedastic student's t-test and changes in protein expression were considered significant for p&lt;0.05. A general picture of protein expression trends was obtained by comparing significance versus fold changes for each protein MFI per day on a volcano plot for spleen, lung, liver, kidney and brain (data not shown). These analyses identified 19 cytokine proteins in the kidney, 18 in the liver, 17 in spleen, 14 in the brain and 10 in the lung that were differentially expressed (data not shown). In the spleen, multiple proteins were down-regulated at day 1 p.i. however, the majority of proteins were significantly upregulated at later time points and DE proteins peaked between days 3 and 4 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003216-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

<title>Viral Infection and Chemokine Expression Kinetics</title>
<p>A subset of chemokine genes was then examined to assess their expression kinetics relative to viral infections in the spleen, lung, kidney and brain. Due to the fact that no infectious virus was recovered from the liver in this study, no correlations between viral infection and chemokine expression kinetics could be undertaken. Previous studies using inbred mouse strains have reproducibly shown the up-regulation of chemokines such as <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl4</italic> and <italic>Ccl5</italic> in various tissues in response to WNV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Shirato1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Klein1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Glass1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Bardina1">[43]</xref>. Our study also found these chemokines to be differentially expressed in various tissues.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Technological advances have allowed profiling of living systems at the genome, transcriptome, and proteome levels in response to various stressors or disease states. In this study, the first in-depth characterization of WNV infection in the SW outbred weanling mouse model was performed using the nCounter platform for multiplex-gene expression analysis in a single reaction without the need of enzymatic target amplification. Unlike other platforms, (such as microarray and/or next generation sequencing) the nCounter platform enables high throughput, sensitive, quantitative, and reproducible gene expression analysis of multiple samples over the course of infection without the need for complex data analysis or confirmation of results by qRT-PCR. Thus, the nCounter enabled rapid gene expression profiling of a large number of inflammatory response genes from multiple tissues over the course of WNV infection in an outbred mouse model and to rapidly differentiate between general versus specific gene expression changes in WNV (+) vs. WNV (−) tissues.</p>
<p>The temporal and dynamic analyses of viral burdens, kinetics and tissue tropisms generated results similar to those described for WNV infection using inbred mouse models, such as the C3H/HeN, C57BL/6 and BABL/C (for extensive reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Samuel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Suthar1">[13]</xref>). Therefore, despite the high susceptibility of SW mice to neuroinvasive WNV disease, their responses to infection are generally comparable to those of more resistant inbred strains such as C57BL/6. Following peak viremia, WNV dissemination to secondary tissues was observed in the spleen, lung, kidney, and brain of infected SW outbred mice. Although the animals used in these studies were not perfused prior to collection of tissues, we assumed some of the infectious virus detectable at days 1 to 3 could be present from blood. However, in all cases but the liver the tissue titers were high enough (equal to or greater than the concurrent PFU/mL virus titer in serum) to suggest local replication was occurring. Overall, these studies demonstrated similar viral kinetics and tissue tropisms in SW outbred mice and inbred mice used to study WNV infection. Brown <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Brown1">[9]</xref> described differences in survival rates of 6-week-old C3H and C57BL/6 mice despite comparable levels of neuroinvasion and similar virus loads in the periphery. Use of the nCounter system, coupled with other genomic and proteomic tools, in focused comparative studies between mouse strains and assessing other host variables that appear to influence susceptibility, such as age, should provide novel insights into specific responses that correlate with protection against neuroinvasion and/or lethal WNV disease following peripheral infection.</p>
<p>Infection of the lung had only been previously described in wild-type (WT) C3H/HeN and C57BL/6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Brown1">[9]</xref> and in <italic>IFN-α/βR<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Samuel2">[17]</xref>. Relevant to this observation, recent studies found a strong correlation between respiratory insufficiency and mortality in WNV infected hamsters where infection of the ventrolateral medulla, responsible for respiratory control, was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Morrey1">[44]</xref>. In this study, DEG profiles of the lung revealed an increase in expression for <italic>TLR2</italic>, <italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>TLR6</italic> and <italic>TLR7</italic> genes. Previous studies in <italic>TLR3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have shown increased susceptibility and resistance to WNV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Wang3">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Daffis1">[46]</xref>. <italic>TLR7</italic> and the adaptor protein MYD88 have been shown to be required against lethal WNV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Town1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Szretter1">[47]</xref>. In other systems <italic>TLR2</italic> signaling has been shown to be activated by the hemagglutinin protein of measles virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Bieback1">[48]</xref>, Core/NS3 protein of HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Dolganiuc1">[49]</xref> and in mice infected with HCMV, LCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Zhou1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Zhou2">[51]</xref> and HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-KurtJones1">[52]</xref>. Interestingly a recent study on influenza demonstrated TLR2/6 signaling to induce a protective role in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Tuvim1">[53]</xref>. Whether this increased expression of TLR2 and TLR6 mediates protective immunity against WNV infection in the lung remains to be further studied.</p>
<p>In the context of WNV infection, the liver is generally considered to be non-or poorly permissive to WNV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Brown1">[9]</xref>. Although the studies presented here demonstrated detection of genomic WNV RNA using qRT-PCR despite lack of recovery of infectious virus from this tissue at any timepoint, it is unclear whether this represents a low level of viral replication in this organ. Similar to this observation, in another recent study, the livers of WT C57BL/6 infected subcutaneously with a Texas 2002 WNV strain (lineage I) were shown to be infected using sensitive qRT-PCR but not plaque assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Suthar2">[31]</xref>. The data presented here also indicate that expression of complement factors during WNV infection in SW mice is tissue specific, and suggest complement expression in the liver to be the result of a systemic acute phase response to WNV infection and not necessarily the result of infection of the liver.</p>
<p>In the kidney, chemoattractant genes <italic>CXCL2</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic> and <italic>CCL22</italic> were down-regulated. Previous studies have shown that polymorphonuclear leukocytes have increased <italic>CXCL1</italic> and <italic>CXCL2</italic> expression when infected with WNV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Bai1">[54]</xref>. Interestingly, this study also found increased expression of <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic> and <italic>CCL5</italic> proteins in WNV-infected kidney tissue. Expression of locally secreted chemokines has been shown to aid in the recruitment of leukocytes in the initiation and amplification phase of renal inflammation. However, these can also cause renal damage through the release of pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Anders1">[55]</xref>. Thus the rapid down modulation of these genes can serve to limit acute inflammation and prevent renal damage. Whether the decreased expressions in these studies are associated with this balance response remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Consistent with earlier studies in inbred mouse strains, DEG that were identified in the spleen, lung, kidney, liver and brain were primarily associated with chemokine, cytokine, complement, cytoskeletal and signal transduction, pathogen-associate molecular patterns and transcriptional regulator functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Brown1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Fredericksen1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Venter1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Suthar2">[31]</xref>. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEG using DAVID also helped identify chemokine/cytokine interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Huangda1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Tobler1">[56]</xref>, Toll-like receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Qian1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Diamond2">[60]</xref>, NOD-like receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Suthar1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Qian1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Quicke1">[61]</xref> and complement and coagulation pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Suthar1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003216-Mehlhop2">[18]</xref> which are known to control WNV infection in inbred mouse models. Data stratification of infected vs. non-infected tissues from WNV infected SW mouse allowed differentiation of gene expression responses that we considered to be a general inflammatory response to WNV infection versus tissue specific responses due to infection with WNV. Complementary high throughput protein analysis enabled gene and protein expression kinetics that serve to further validate the gene expression analysis alone.</p>
<p>The nCounter system and complementary methods employed here provide a powerful platform for detailed comparative analysis of the kinetics and magnitude of host responses to WNV infection. Gene expression profiling using the nCounter system provided a rapid and sensitive platform to follow dynamic gene expression changes through the course of WNV infection. Future applications for this technology include comparable studies using variably attenuated WNV strains in the SW mouse model, or virulent WNV strains such as NY99 in more resistant mouse models, to comprehensively define specific innate and adaptive immune responses associated with protection and immunity for the purpose of designing and testing of antiviral therapies and vaccines against WNV infection and neuroinvasive disease. Finally, similar studies using other flaviviruses in similar or different animal models should enhance understanding of host responses common to infection by these viruses.</p>
