<title>Background</title>
<p>Treatment of Chagas disease, caused by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, relies on nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZL), which present side effects in adult patients, and natural resistance in some parasite strains. Hydroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH) is a new drug candidate with demonstrated trypanocidal activity; however, its safety is not known.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>HepG2 cells dose response to NFOH and BZL (5–100 µM) was assessed by measurement of ROS, DNA damage and survival. Swiss mice were treated with NFOH or BZL for short-term (ST, 21 d) or long-term (LT, 60 d) periods. Sera levels of cellular injury markers, liver inflammatory and oxidative stress, and fibrotic remodeling were monitored.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>HepG2 cells exhibited mild stress, evidenced by increased ROS and DNA damage, in response to NFOH, while BZL at 100 µM concentration induced &gt;33% cell death in 24 h. In mice, NFOH ST treatment resulted in mild-to-no increase in the liver injury biomarkers (GOT, GPT), and liver levels of inflammatory (myeloperoxidase, TNF-α), oxidative (lipid peroxides) and nitrosative (3-nitrotyrosine) stress. These stress responses in NFOH LT treated mice were normalized to control levels. BZL-treated mice exhibited a &gt;5-fold increase in GOT, GPT and TNF-α (LT) and a 20–40% increase in liver levels of MPO activity (ST and LT) in comparison with NFOH-treated mice. The liver inflammatory infiltrate was noted in the order of BZL&gt;vehicle≥NFOH and BZL&gt;NFOH≥vehicle, respectively, after ST and LT treatments. Liver fibrotic remodeling, identified after ST treatment, was in the order of BZL&gt;vehicle&gt;NFOH; lipid deposits, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction and in the order of NFOH&gt;vehicle&gt;BZL were evidenced after LT treatment.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>NFOH induces mild ST hepatotoxicity that is normalized during LT treatment in mice. Our results suggest that additional studies to determine the efficacy and toxicity of NFOH are warranted.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Hydroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH) is a promising drug candidate with demonstrated trypanocidal activity in experimental models of <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection and chronic disease development. In this study, we monitored the safety of NFOH in established <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Our data show that NFOH did not induce hepatocyte cell death. Short-term or long-term treatment of mice with NFOH did not induce hepatic stress measured by cellular injury, inflammation or fibrosis. Benznidazole, the currently used treatment against acute infection in humans, was more toxic and induced chronic inflammation and liver injury in mice. We conclude that NFOH should be studied further to determine its potential safety for human use as an anti-parasite therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chagas disease is endemic in 21 countries, and the World Health Organization estimates that approximately 9-million people are infected by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Schofield1">[1]</xref>. The acute phase lasts for ∼2-months, and is characterized by high parasitemia and fever. Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is the most severe clinical consequence of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, which is detectable in 30% of the patients several years after the primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-World1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>A considerable advancement in the knowledge about the biology of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasite has been made in the last few decades (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Nagajyothi1">[3]</xref>). Yet, treatment of Chagas disease still relies on two drugs, namely nifurtimox (NFX, Bayer) and benznidazole (BZL), that were developed during the 1960s and are currently manufactured and distributed by Roche (Rochagan, in Brazil), and Maprimed and ELEA laboratories (Abarax) in Argentina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Maya1">[4]</xref>. Since the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> life cycle involves intracellular division and subsequent parasite release to peripheral blood, a long-term treatment period (usually an oral dose for 60 days) is required. Both drugs are well tolerated by infants and used as standard treatment to control acute infection by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Urbina1">[5]</xref>. However, chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is a complex malady that involves immune mechanisms as well as parasite persistence. Several studies have noted that treatment with BZL or NFX is not always effective in controlling the chronic disease in chagasic patients. Moreover, these drugs trigger multiple side effects in adults, resulting in noncompliance with long-term treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Coura1">[6]</xref>. Further, BZL and NFX are not effective against all naturally occurring <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains, and some strains have been documented to acquire resistance to these drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Andrade1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Camandaroba1">[9]</xref>. Thus, alternative therapeutic drugs that are well-tolerated, safe, and effective against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> are urgently needed.</p>
<p>Due to their limited commercial potential, development of new drugs for Chagas disease is perhaps not a viable option. Instead, drug repurposing–finding a new indication for an existing drug—has enormous potential in developing a new therapy against parasitic diseases. Nitrofurazone (NF), commercialized as a topical medicine for bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, has recently been shown to inhibit trypanothione reductase, the main enzyme responsible for xenobiotic metabolism in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Henderson1">[10]</xref>. Subsequently, NF was found to have significant anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Davies1">[11]</xref>. Unfortunately, NF showed toxicity against mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-GonzalezBorroto1">[12]</xref> and long-term treatment with NF induced ovarian cancer in mice and rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Takegawa1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Kari1">[14]</xref>, spurring the identification of alternative chemicals with specific activity against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> only. Among the latter, hydroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH) was identified as a derivative of NF. The reduction of nitrofurazone is pH-dependent and in acidic medium the hydroxylamine derivative, involving four electrons, is the principal product formed. In aqueous-alkaline medium, the reduction of nitrofurazone occurs in two steps, the first involving one electron to form the nitro-radical anion and the second corresponding to the hydroxylamine derivative formation. NFOH presented the same voltammetric behavior and electroactivity, indicating that the molecular modification performed in NF did not change its capacity to be reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Chung1">[15]</xref>. We and others have shown NFOH has 2-fold more cytotoxic activity than the parental compound NF against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Chung1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Barbosa1">[16]</xref>. The mechanism of action of NFOH against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is not completely clear; however, like all nitroheterocyclic compounds, it is enzymatically reduced at the nitro group resulting in the generation of nitroanion (RNO<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>) and hydronitroxide (RNHO<sup>•−</sup>) free radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Castro1">[17]</xref>. NFOH has also been shown to at least partially interfere with mRNA trans-splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Barbosa1">[16]</xref> and cruzipain activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Trossini1">[18]</xref> that are essential for parasite invasion as well as differentiation to replicative form.</p>
<p>Before NFOH can be tested and promoted further as an anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> drug for human use, it is essential that we evaluate its safety profile. In a therapeutic regimen administered to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infected mice, NFOH and BZL provided comparable control of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and survival from infection (84% and 67%, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Davies1">[11]</xref>, while NF caused 75% mortality in infected mice. Accordingly, in this study, we have evaluated the liver toxicity of NFOH in comparison with BZL by using <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic> models. We treated HepG2 liver cells and mice with the two drugs and assessed inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell survival or tissue remodeling. We chose to treat mice with NFOH for short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) periods that were similar to the recommended regimen for the BZL treatment of children and adults exposed to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Cell, mice and treatment</title>
<p>A hepG2 human hepatocyte cell line was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Maryland, USA). The cells were cultured in complete DMEM high glucose media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Female Swiss mice were bred at the Instituto de Patologia Experimental mouse facility. Swiss mice have been widely employed as animal models for experimental chemotherapy in Chagas disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-ArajoJorge1">[19]</xref>. NFOH was kindly provided by Dr. Man Chin Chung (Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Brazil). BZL (Roche Pharmaceuticals, Brazil) was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health, Province of Salta, Argentina. Mice (30-day old) received NFOH (150 mg/kg/day) or BZL (150 mg/kg/day), suspended in 9% NaCl/5% Tween-80 (vehicle solution), as an oral dose of 100 µl, once a day (six days per week). The selected doses of the BZL and NFOH mimicked the dose per kg and dose regime (two months of daily treatment) of humans. All experiments were carried out in female mice because they develop disease symptoms similar to those seen in human infection. Additionally, we have noted that the female mice exhibited a higher tolerance to infection than did male mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Davies1">[11]</xref>. One set of mice (n = 9/group) received the treatment for 21 days to allow us to determine the acute (short-term, ST) liver toxicity of the drugs. Another set of mice (n = 9/group) received the treatment for 60 days to facilitate our knowledge of the chronic (long-term, LT) liver toxicity of the drugs. Mice given the vehicle solution were used as controls. After treatment, mice were sacrificed, and sera samples and liver tissues stored at −80°C until use.</p>

<title>Cell survival and proliferation</title>
<p>HepG2 cells were cultured as above, seeded at 7.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well microplate, and incubated overnight in complete media at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were treated in serum-free medium with NFOH or BZL (5, 50 and 100 µM) for 24–48 h. To examine the drug-induced changes in cell viability and proliferation, after the drug treatment, we incubated the cells for 30 min in the presence of AlamarBlue reagent (Life Technologies/Invitrogen, 10% final concentration). Resazurin, the active ingredient of alamarBlue reagent, is a non-toxic, cell-permeable compound that is blue in color and virtually non-fluorescent. Upon entering cells, resazurin is reduced to resorufin, a compound that is red in color and highly fluorescent. Viable cells continuously convert resazurin to resorufin, increasing the overall fluorescence and color of the media surrounding cells. Fluorescence was measured at Ex<sub>540</sub>/Em<sub>590</sub> nm on a SpectraMax Microplate Reader. Results were analyzed as per the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Flow cytometry analysis of ROS production and DNA damage</title>
<p>HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of NFOH or BZL for 24 h, as above. For the quantitation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 5 µM CellROX Green reagent was added to each well in complete media, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. CellROX Green is cell-permeant and non-fluorescent, or very weakly fluorescent, in the reduced state. Upon oxidation, the reagents exhibit strong fluorescence and remain localized within the cell. Cells were washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>
<p>For assessing the effect of NFOH and BZL in inducing DNA damage, HepG2 cells were treated with NFOH or BZL for 24 h, as above. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4°C, and permeabilized with 90% methanol. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with mouse anti-8-oxo-dG antibody (250-fold dilution, EMD Milipore, Billerica, MA) and for 30 min with PE-conjugated, anti-mouse IgG (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells stained with isotype-matched IgGs were used as controls. Samples were visualized on an LSRII Fortessa Cell Analyzer, acquiring 30–50,000 events in a live cell gate, and further analysis performed by using FlowJo software (version 7.6.5, Tree-Star, San Carlo, CA).</p>

<title>Cellular injury markers</title>
<p>The activities of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), alternatively called aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), respectively, were determined by using commercially available assay kits (Wiener Lab, Rosario, Argentina). Briefly, for the GOT/AST assay, 50 µl of sera sample or liver homogenate (∼100-µg protein) was added to reagent A containing 12 mM 2-oxoglutarate, 0.18 mM NADH, 420 U/l malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and 600 U/l lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The reaction was started by adding 80 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 240 mM L-aspartate, and the resultant oxaloacetate formation coupled with NADH oxidation by MDH monitored at 340 nm. For the GPT/ALT assay, 50 µl of sample was added to reagent A containing NADH, 2-oxoglutarate (as above) and 1200 U/l LDH. The reaction was started by adding 80 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 500 mM L-alanine, and resultant reduction of pyruvate coupled with NADH oxidation by LDH monitored at 340 nm (ε = 6,220 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>).</p>

<title>Oxidative/nitrosative stress</title>
<p>We measured lipid peroxides, a biomarker of oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman1">[20]</xref>, by using a LPO Assay Kit (Cayman). Briefly, liver homogenate LPOs were extracted into chloroform, mixed with methanol (1∶1, v/v), and added in triplicate (55 µl/well) to 96-well plates. The reaction was started with addition of 50 µl/well of 4.5 mM FeSO<sub>4</sub>/0.2 M HCl, 3% ammonium thiocyanate (chromogen) solution. The redox reaction with ferrous ions was stopped after 5 min, and absorbance monitored at 500 nm (standard curve: 0–500 µM 13-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid).</p>
<p>The level of protein nitrosylation, an indicator of nitrosative stress, was determined by Western blotting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman2">[21]</xref>. Tissue homogenates (10-µg protein) were resolved on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes by using a vertical Criterion Blotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed in TBS (20.4 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6), blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk (NFM), and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-3-nitrotirosine antibody (clone 2A8.2, 1∶2000, Millipore). After washing with TBS-T (TBS/0.1% Tween-80), membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1∶10,000, Southern Biotech), and signal was developed with an enhanced chemiluminiscence detection system (GE-Healthcare). Membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific) and probed with anti-β-actin antibody (1∶10,000, Sigma) to confirm an equal loading of samples. All antibody dilutions were made in NFM. Spot densitometry for protein bands was carried out using a FluorChem HD2 Image Analyzer (Alpha Innotech).</p>

Cryostat tissue-sections (fixed in OCT cryostat-embedding medium, TissueTek) were stained with Oil red O to examine lipid/fat deposition.</p>
<p>In general, we analyzed each tissue section for &gt;10-microscopic fields (100× magnification), and examined three different tissue sections/mouse (n = 3–4 mice/group) to obtain a semi-quantitative score. Presence of inflammatory cells was scored as I (absent), II (focal or mild, 0–1 foci), III (moderate, ≥2 foci), IV (extensive inflammatory foci, minimal necrosis, and retention of tissue integrity), and V (diffused inflammation with severe tissue necrosis, interstitial edema, and loss of integrity). Inflammatory infiltrates were characterized as diffused or focal depending upon how closely the inflammatory cells were associated. Fibrosis and lipid deposition were assessed by measuring the Masson's Trichrome-stained collagen area (blue) and Oil Red O-stained intrahepatocyte lipid area (red), respectively, as a percentage of the total area by using Simple PCI software (version 6.0; Compix, Sewickley, PA) connected to an Olympus polarizing microscope system (Center Valley, PA). All pixels with blue stain in Masson's trichrome-stained sections and red stain in Oil Red O were selected to build a binary image, and utilized for calculating the percentage of the area occupied by collagen and lipid droplets, respectively. The fibrotic area was further scored as I (&lt;10% of total area), II–III (10–30% of total area), III–IV (30–60% of total area) and V (&gt;60% of total area). Oil red O (intrahepatocyte lipid deposition) was scored as I (absent), II (&lt;10% of total area or patchy distribution of tiny red droplets), III (10–30% of total area or scattered tiny red droplets), and IV (&gt;30% of total area or intense red staining of variable size droplets) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman3">[23]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of NFOH in HepG2 cells</title>
<p>We first evaluated the dose response of the HepG2 cell line to NFOH and BZL. Hepatocytes express cytochrome P450 isoforms, including Cyp2E1 that elicit ROS generation under stress conditions. Additionally, impairment of mitochondrial permeability transition, fatty acid β-oxidation, and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration are all potential mechanisms of ROS generation under stress conditions. We noted a 40–75% increase in CellRox fluorescence (detects intracellular ROS, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1A.a</xref>) in 27–72% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1A.b</xref>) of the HepG2 cells treated with 5–100 µM NFOH. The maximal increase in ROS generation was observed when HepG2 cells were treated with 50 µM NFOH treatment. The 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine(8-oxo-dG) is the major product of DNA damage and concentrations of 8-oxo-dG within a cell are used as a measurement of oxidative stress. We noted an up to 33% increase in 8-oxo-dG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1B.a</xref>) in 23% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1B.b</xref>) of the HepG2 cells treated with increasing concentrations of NFOH. Despite the increase in ROS and DNA damage biomarkers, cell viability, measured by AlamarBlue assay, was not significantly altered by NFOH treatment for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1C.a</xref>) or 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1C.b</xref>). In comparison, HepG2 cells treated with increasing concentrations of BZL showed no statistically significant increase in ROS generation and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1A&amp;B</xref>); however, a cytotoxic response to increasing concentrations of BZL was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The maximal cytotoxicity (33% cell death) was observed when cells were treated with 100 µM BZL for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1C.a</xref>) or 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1C.b</xref>). Together, these data suggest that NFOH (5–100 µM) induces a mild stress response in hepatopcytes, while BZL at 100 µM concentrations is cytotoxic and causes cell death.</p>

<title>NFOH does not cause short- or long-term liver toxicity in mice</title>
<p>We used a well-established experimental model of Swiss mice for assessing the <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity properties of NFOH.

<p>We measured elevation in GOT and GPT activities as a general biochemical marker of liver injury after 21 d (ST) and 60 d (LT) treatment with NFOH (controls: vehicle solution).

<title>Phagocyte activation and oxidative damage in response to NFOH</title>
<p>The host defense response to NFOH or BZL can result in activation of macrophages and neutrophils that produce oxidative burst, nitric oxide (<sup>•</sup>NO), and HOCl supported by induction of NADPH oxidase, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman3">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Alvarez1">[25]</xref>, and MPO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Winterbourn1">[26]</xref>, respectively. The cytotoxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in oxidation of cell constituents, including proteins, lipids, and DNA, which lead to deterioration of cellular structure and function. Additionally, <sup>•</sup>NO reacts with O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> and forms peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>) and peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) that cause increased protein 3-nirotyrosine (3NT) formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Dhiman4">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>We investigated host defense responses to NFOH and BZL by measurement of MPO activity and oxidative/nitrosative stress. The level of MPO activity in liver homogenates of mice treated with NFOH for ST or LT was not statistically different when compared to that noted in mice given vehicle only, and was within the basal-level range (100–150 milli-units/mg protein). The BZL-treated mice exhibited a 20–40% increase in liver level of MPO activity when compared to that noted in NFOH-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). LPO refers to highly reactive hydroperoxides of saturated and unsaturated lipids, formed by oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Girotti1">[28]</xref>. NFOH and BZL treatment for ST or LT resulted in no significant increase in the liver levels of LPO formation in comparison to those in control mice treated with vehicle solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The basal level of LPO (&lt;0.25 n mol/mg protein) in all mice, irrespective of ST or LT treatment with NFOH, BZL or vehicle was within the lowest detection range. The polypeptide-bound 3-NT residues, formed by peroxynitrite attack, were monitored by Western blotting. These data showed that the 3-NT level in liver homogenates of mice given ST NFOH or BZL treatment was increased by ∼2.5-fold when compared to those in normal controls, and were similar to those noted in mice given vehicle only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g003">Fig. 3C&amp;D</xref>). The 3-NT contents normalized to β-actin were unchanged after LT exposure to NFOH, BZL, or vehicle in treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g003">Fig. 3C&amp;D</xref>). Overall, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g003">Fig. 3</xref> suggested that treatment of mice with NFOH or BZL caused a short-term increase in nitrosative stress that was likely a placebo effect, and, in general, both anti-parasitic drugs did not elicit long-term liver injury by phagocyte activation and oxidative damage in mice.</p>

<p>Next, we determined the effects of NFOH and BZL treatment on liver inflammation.

<p>Different strategies with the overall aim of finding a cure for Chagas disease are currently under investigation. The major challenges to testing and implementation of therapeutic use of the currently available drugs (BZL and NFX) include the resistance of many of the naturally occurring parasite isolates (e.g. Colombiana) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Camandaroba1">[9]</xref> and low efficacy of treatment during indeterminate and chronic phase of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Coura1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Camandaroba1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, additional challenges are faced in immuno-suppressed chagasic patients that become recipients of transplanted organs or are HIV co-infected.

NFOH, derived from hydroxymethyl substitution at the primary amide of nitrofurazone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Chung1">[15]</xref>, also has a higher solubility in water than does NF and BZL, which likely would facilitate its oral administration. In a murine model of acute <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, NFOH was highly effective in controlling parasitemia evidenced by the observation that infected mice, after NFOH treatment, exhibited no signal for parasite DNA by a highly sensitive PCR approach, and sero-converted with depletion of anti-parasite antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Davies1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>NFOH is a derivative of nitrofurazone (NF). NF is highly toxic and shown to result in single strand DNA breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Olive1">[41]</xref> and oxidative DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Hiraku1">[42]</xref>, and is considered to be potentially carcinogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Takegawa1">[13]</xref>. Considering the high toxicity of NF, it is important to evaluate the toxicity of NFOH <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> before it is recommended for treatment of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in humans. Accordingly, the present study was designed to examine the adverse effects of NFOH treatment in HepG2 cells and ST and LT treatment of NFOH in mice. We focused on examining the effects of NFOH on hepatocytes and liver because the liver is the main detoxifying organ in mammals. Metabolism of xenobiotics in the liver involves phase I and phase II reactions that add hydroxyl and methyl groups, respectively, to a given compound. NFOH is a nitrofurazone with an <italic>N</italic>-hydroxymethylation at the primary amide and was anticipated to cause significantly reduced toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Davies1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies evaluating the dose response of HepG2 cells clearly demonstrated that NFOH at higher concentrations (50–100 µM) induced mild stress as was evidenced by the observation of ROS production and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1A&amp;B</xref>). However, the NFOH-induced stress was controlled as we observed no cell death in NFOH-treated HepG2 cells. Under similar conditions, cytotoxicity of BZL was evidenced by induction of cell death in 33% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Others have shown the nifurtimox and BZL inhibited DNA and protein synthesis in hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Goijman1">[43]</xref>. In murine studies, the selected doses for toxicity evaluation were the same as those that we have previously tested in mouse models of acute and chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. We included mice treated with BZL and vehicle (NaCl/Tween-80) as controls. Our data showed a moderate increase in sera levels of GOT and GPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) after ST and LT treatment with NFOH that was similar to that noted in mice treated with vehicle only. Further, MPO activity and LPO production, measured as markers of neutrophil activation and macrophage oxidative burst, were present at the lowest limits of detection in all mice given NFOH or vehicle throughout the treatment schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g003">Fig. 3A&amp;B</xref>). These data, along with the observation of no significant change in TNFα mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) suggested to us that NFOH did not induce hepatic stress associated with cellular injury, oxidative stress, and innate immune cell activation <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> after ST or LT treatment. Our observation of a &gt;5-fold increase in hepatic levels of MPO activity and TNF-α expression in the livers of mice within 3 d after a single dose treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, 20-µg/Kg/100 µl peanut oil) in other studies suggest that when compared with TCDD effects, NFOH has no acute liver toxicity. The notion of NFOH being liver-safe is also supported by the observation of a higher degree of GOT release (5-fold), MPO activity (20–40%), and TNF-α protein levels (up to 20%) in BZL-treated mice in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g002">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g004">4</xref>). Others have also shown the BZL toxicity by alterations in mitochondrial function in liver of treated rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Rendon1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>We corroborated the biochemical findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g001">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g004">4</xref>) of NFOH safety by histological observations of tissue inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis, and lipid deposition in the livers of mice treated for ST or LT with NFOH, and compared the findings with BZL-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g005">Figs. 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g007">7</xref>). NFOH-treated mice consistently exhibited none-to-low levels of inflammatory infiltrate and fibrotic lesions in liver tissue sections that were similar to or lower than was noted in vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g005">Figs. 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g007">7</xref>). The extent of liver inflammatory infiltrate was significantly higher in BZL-treated mice, especially after LT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g005">Figs. 5</xref>). Likewise, BZL-treated mice exhibited an acute liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003231-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) similar to what we have noted in TCDD-treated mice (unpublished data). The extent of lipid deposition in liver tissue after LT treatment with BZL and NFOH was comparable to lipid deposits provoked within three days after treatment with a single dose of TCDD. Though not withdrawn from market, BZL has been demonstrated to be more toxic than NFOH with regard to elicitation of liver inflammatory responses, fibrosis, and a cellular dysfunction at mitochondrial level, both in our data presented in this study and other published reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Castro1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003231-Castro2">[33]</xref>. We surmise that NFOH only causes a mild transient hepatic injury similar to that caused by vehicle treatment only in mice. Our results encourage further research on carcinogenicity, and mechanism of action of NFOH to address its potential safety for human use as an anti-parasite therapy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results showed that ST and LT treatment with NFOH elicited similar or lower levels of liver oxidative stress, inflammation and tissue remodeling responses, when compared to that noted by a similar regimen of treatment with vehicle only. In comparison, BZL that has been used for the treatment of human chagasic patients was more toxic and induced chronic inflammation and liver injury. Our data provide the impetus for future studies focusing on further characterization of anti-parasite efficacy, toxicity, and carcinogenicity of NFOH, aiming to determine its potential safety to be considered as a drug candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease.</p>
