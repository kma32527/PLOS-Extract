<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic>, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer in humans, is unique among the members of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> genus due to the presence of the virulence determinant megaplasmid pMUM001. This plasmid encodes multiple virulence-associated genes, including <italic>mup011</italic>, which is an uncharacterized Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) PknQ.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>In this study, we have characterized PknQ and explored its interaction with MupFHA (Mup018c), a FHA domain containing protein also encoded by pMUM001. MupFHA was found to interact with PknQ and suppress its autophosphorylation. Subsequent protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation analyses showed that this interaction involves the FHA domain of MupFHA and PknQ activation loop residues Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>174</sup>. FHA domains are known to recognize phosphothreonine residues, and therefore, MupFHA may be acting as one of the few unusual FHA-domain having overlapping specificity. Additionally, we elucidated the PknQ-dependent regulation of MupDivIVA (Mup012c), which is a DivIVA domain containing protein encoded by pMUM001. MupDivIVA interacts with MupFHA and this interaction may also involve phospho-threonine/serine residues of MupDivIVA.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Together, these results describe novel signaling mechanisms in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and show a three-way regulation of PknQ, MupFHA, and MupDivIVA. FHA domains have been considered to be only pThr specific and our results indicate a novel mechanism of pSer as well as pThr interaction exhibited by MupFHA. These results signify the need of further re-evaluating the FHA domain –pThr/pSer interaction model. MupFHA may serve as the ideal candidate for structural studies on this unique class of modular enzymes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> is a slow growing pathogen, which is prevalent in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> possesses unique signaling pathways with only 13 STPK containing genes. This is strikingly different from its closest homolog <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> and surprisingly closer to the human pathogen, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. PknQ, MupFHA and MupDivIVA are regulatory proteins encoded by the virulence determining plasmid pMUM001 of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>. In addition to characterizing the STPK, we focused on deciphering the basis of interaction between the three partner proteins leading to the identification of critical residues. Present study describes the newly identified phosphoserine-based interactions, which is unique amongst the FHA-domain containing proteins. We confirmed our results using structural analysis via specific mutants and their interaction profiles. Importantly, these data highlight the significance of FHA domains and their role in understanding cellular signaling. This work will encourage further studies to elucidate role of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> signaling systems. It will also raise questions like how less studied tropical bacterial pathogens acquire eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr protein kinase and exhibit unusual mechanisms to interact with its partner domains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Buruli ulcer is a disease of skin and soft tissues caused by the bacteria <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Roltgen1">[1]</xref>. It is the third most important mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Mosi1">[2]</xref>, and the prevalence continues to increase in tropical and sub-tropical countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Yotsu1">[3]</xref>. <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> evolved from an <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> ancestor through reductive evolution and acquired a large virulence determinant plasmid (pMUM001) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Doig1">[4]</xref>. This plasmid encodes genes for mycolactone synthesis that are required to circumvent the host immune response, as a strain lacking this plasmid is avirulent. Therefore, the pMUM001 plasmid is considered to be a key determinant of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Hong1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Scherr1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Pathogenic species of mycobacteria require stringent control on cell division for survival in their host, and thus are likely to acquire specialized mechanisms through evolution to achieve this control. Signaling proteins that sense environmental changes and mediate cell response are important for regulating cell division. For instance, bacterial Serine/Threonine Protein Kinases (STPKs) are known to regulate cell division by sensing and responding to specific signals in the host environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Ruggiero1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, according to phospho-proteome analysis, numerous Ser/Thr phosphorylated proteins have been identified in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, suggesting that STPKs may regulate multiple cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Canova1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Singhal1">[12]</xref>. Indeed, eleven STPKs have been identified in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and the majority of them have been shown to be involved in pathogenesis and drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Kumari1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Scherr2">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>ForkHead-Associated (FHA) domain containing proteins are the key interacting partners of STPKs that mediate the signals inside the cells emanating from the cognate kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Alderwick1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gupta1">[18]</xref>. FHA domains are highly conserved modules, known to bind phosphorylated residues within the proteins involved in diverse processes in bacteria, such as protein secretion, antibiotic resistance, transcription, peptidoglycan synthesis, metabolism and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gee1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Sharma1">[20]</xref>. Most of the FHA domain containing proteins in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> are phosphorylated by STPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gupta1">[18]</xref>, and these proteins have been shown to recruit several other proteins in addition to being STPK substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gee1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gupta1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Sureka1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on the importance of STPKs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> physiology and virulence, we explored the molecular transducers and their associated FHA domains in the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> genome. We identified 13 STPK-encoding genes <italic>in silico</italic> and focused on a novel STPK- PknQ, encoded by the virulence-associated plasmid pMUM001. We identified MupFHA (Mup018c) and MupDivIVA (Mup012c) as the substrates of PknQ and characterized the interaction of PknQ and MupDivIVA with MupFHA. MupFHA contains one FHA domain that interacts with PknQ, as well as with phosphorylated MupDivIVA. Importantly, we found that the interactions of these three <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> proteins encoded by the virulence-associated plasmid are dependent on phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues.</p>

<title>Homology modeling</title>
<p>To generate the structure of PknQ, intracellular kinase domain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PknB (PDB ID: 1MRU) that shows 42% identity with the PknQ sequence, was chosen as template. We focused on the predicted catalytic domain of PknQ (1 to 280 aa). The three-dimensional models for PknQ were generated using MODELLER version 9v1. General features were evaluated on the basis of the MODELLER's energy and DOPE scores while detailed reliability indices were obtained by the PROCHECK program. The PROSA Z-score was calculated using PROSA-II. Best models were chosen and further refinements were carried out. Disordered activation loop region was identified and loop refinement procedure was applied using the automatic loop refinement method provided in MODELLER 9v1 auto-model class protocol. In order to model the loop reliably, 500 loop models were sampled followed by model validation using DOPE scores and Verify 3D. PTM-Viena server was used to modify the protein and phosphate group was added at 2 different positions- Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>174</sup>. <italic>Ab initio</italic> loop modeling was further used to minimize the post-translation modification effects. For this purpose, loop modeling protocol of standalone version of Rosetta 3.4 modeling suite was used and 50 outputs were taken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Kaufmann1">[23]</xref>. On the basis of energy score and visual inspection of the loop we identified top 3 best loop models and used for further studies.</p>
<p>Similarly, structural modeling of the FHA domain was performed with MODELLER 9v1. MupFHA protein sequence spanning the residues 10 to 100 was modeled (containing the FHA domain and the interaction motif). In order to use the maximum benefits of sequence identities and to model the maximum part of sequence contacting FHA domain, multi-template approach provided by MODELLER 9v1 was utilized and the two templates of Rv0020c FHA domain (PDB ID: 2LC1, 3PO8) were used to predict the three dimensional homology model of MupFHA. The 3D models for native FHA domain and mutants were generated, on the basis of previously generated structures of Rv0020c and pThr peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pennell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Roumestand1">[25]</xref>. The templates were pair-wise structurally aligned. Further models were built and validated as described for PknQ homology modeling.</p>

<title>Protein docking</title>
<p>Protein-protein dockings were performed using HEX 6.3 molecular docking program, correlation type were chosen as shape and 2000 solutions were chosen for final evaluation. Other parameters were chosen as default. Structures of the wild type FHA domain and mutants were used for docking with PknQ containing pSer<sup>170</sup> and pThr<sup>174</sup>. First 10 solutions were analyzed for each docking and best docked poses were chosen. A short minimization was performed with Gromacs to minimize the complexes. Intermolecular interactions and docking scores were analyzed.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation</title>
<p>Three complexes were prepared using molecular dynamics simulation- (1) a double phosphorylated PknQ-FHA complex, (2) mutant complex having single phosphorylation on Ser<sup>170</sup> and mutation at pThr<sup>174</sup> to alanine (PknQ-pSer170/Thr174Ala), (3) phosphorylation at Thr<sup>174</sup> and mutation at pSer<sup>170</sup> to alanine (PknQ-Ser170Ala/pThr174). All the simulation studies were performed on GROMACS 4.5.5 using ffG43a1p force field provided by Gromacs official website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads/User_contributions/Force_fields" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads/User_contributions/Force_fields</ext-link>) and uploaded by Graham Smith, which included extended parameters for modified residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Miller1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The protein complex was dissolved at the center of a cubic box, solvated with single point charge water molecules. Solute-box distances of 1.0 nm were specified. To simulate the protein-protein complex system and in order to solve the issue of surface effects, periodic boundary conditions were applied. To neutralize the net charge on the protein, Na<sup>+</sup> ions were added. A short energy minimization step was performed on the solvated system with steepest descent algorithm for 50000 steps.</p>
<p>Two phases of equilibration were conducted for 100 ps each- under constant Number of particles, Volume and Temperature (NVT) followed by constant Number of particles, Pressure and Temperature (NPT). Positional restraints were applied on the protein to allow solvent molecules to relax around the structure. In the second stage, positional restraints were lifted and the system was coupled to a heat bath at 300 K using the Berendsen thermostat and allowed to equilibrate for 100 ps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Fuzo1">[27]</xref>. In an NPT ensemble, the Parrinello-Rahman barostat was used for controlling the pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Bussi1">[28]</xref>. Time constants for controlling the temperature and pressure were set to 0.1 ps and 2 ps, respectively.</p>
<p>The production run was performed with suitable parameters for 10 ns at a temperature and pressure of 300 K and 1 atm, respectively. Coordinate sampling was performed at every 2 fs time interval. Bond-lengths were constrained using the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Xie1">[29]</xref>. Various utilities of GROMACS-4.5.5 package were used for detailed analysis of MD trajectories. All of the Gromacs MD simulations were run in the HPC-Supercomputer facility (CSIR-IGIB, India) on 32 Cores at 11.4 ns/day maximum performance speed.</p>

<p>To identify the total number of STPKs present in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, we performed a BLASTp search using the sequence of the catalytic domain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PknB (1–331 aa), corresponding to the most conserved mycobacterial STPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-AvGay1">[37]</xref>. Using this approach we identified 13 distinct ORFs encoding for STPKs, of which twelve are encoded on the chromosome and one (Mup011 or PknQ) is encoded on the virulence-associated plasmid pMUM001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> STPKs showed that they possess unique kinase modules that are divergent from its close homolog, <italic>M. marinum</italic>. Out of the 24 putative STPK encoding genes present in <italic>M. marinum</italic>, only 13 are retained in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>. This finding suggests that although <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> has evolved from <italic>M. marinum</italic>, it has retained only those STPKs that are necessary for its survival in humans while excluding those that may confer adaptation to <italic>M. marinum</italic> in fish. STPKs are broadly classified on the basis of conserved catalytic Arg/Asp (RD) residues present between subdomains VIa and VIb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Arora1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Johnson1">[38]</xref>.

<title>Structural and biochemical characterization of PknQ</title>
<p>PknQ contains 660 amino acids with an estimated isoelectric point of 6.46. The domain analysis indicates that the cytosolic N-terminal region possesses the characteristic Ser/Thr kinase domain (kd), which is separated from the extracellular C-terminal domain harboring a FepB-like iron transporter module through a transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

Homology modeling of PknQ<sub>kd</sub> and subsequent structural analysis revealed that the kinase domain consists of two lobes joined by a hinge segment. Catalysis occurs at the interface of the two lobes, where the catalytic amino acid residues interact with both ATP and the protein substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Based on our analysis of homology modeling and sequence similarities, we identified the residues Lys<sup>41</sup> and Asp<sup>134</sup> important for the phosphorylation reaction.</p>

<p>We next generated the two phospho-ablative mutants of Thr<sup>164</sup> and Thr<sup>166</sup> sites, since their homologous residues are known to be the most conserved phosphorylated residues in the activation loop of STPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Arora3">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Canova2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Duran1">[46]</xref>. Equal amounts of PknQ and its mutants were used in the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays with [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. In the quantitative analysis, there was no significant loss in phosphorylation observed in the PknQ<sup>T164A</sup> single mutant, while PknQ<sup>T166A</sup> and PknQ<sup>T164/166A</sup> showed significant loss in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>174</sup> residues were also present in the activation loop of the PknQ catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In order to determine the impact of phosphorylation of these residues together with the residues of the juxtamembrane region, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate mutations at these sites. We observed that the PknQ<sup>S170A</sup> mutant had a marked reduction in phosphorylation activity, suggesting that this site is critical for PknQ activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). PknQ<sup>T174A</sup> and PknQ<sup>T260A</sup> mutants also exhibited ∼80% loss in phosphorylation signal. Comparison of PknQ, PknQ<sup>K41M</sup> and PknQ<sup>T174A</sup> phosphorylation indicated that PknQ<sup>T174A</sup> is partially active and is distinct from PknQ<sup>K41M</sup> derivative, which is completely inactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>). No loss in phosphorylation levels was observed with other single site mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of these residues (including the juxtamembrane region) does not seem to play a major role in PknQ autokinase activity. Hence, the most important phosphorylation sites in the PknQ are Ser<sup>170</sup>, Thr<sup>174</sup>, Thr<sup>166</sup> and Thr<sup>260</sup>. In most bacterial STPKs, activity is regulated by threonine residues in the activation loop and not by serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Prisic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Arora1">[30]</xref>. Thus, it was surprising that Ser<sup>170</sup> plays a major role in PknQ activation and indicates a novel feature of PknQ in the mycobacterial kinome.</p>

<title>Identification of PknQ interacting proteins in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic></title>
<p>In order to regulate and amplify signals, protein kinases associate and interact with a number of proteins within the cell. Most of the bacterial protein kinases are known to exhibit synteny with their substrates. In <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, analysis of <italic>pknQ</italic> genetic loci revealed a possible operon between <italic>mup012c</italic> and <italic>mup018c</italic>. These genes code for proteins whose homologs are known as key kinase substrates in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and many other bacteria. The search for kinase interacting domain took us to the FHA domain that is present in Mup018c (renamed as MupFHA). In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, several STPK-FHA domain containing protein partners are broadly conserved at the same genetic loci, such as PknB-Rv0019c, PknF-Rv1747 or PknH-EmbR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gupta1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Molle1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Molle2">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>FHA domains are comprised of approximately 55–75 amino acids with three highly conserved blocks- GR, SXXH, and NG- separated by divergent spacer regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Weiling1">[49]</xref>. Structurally, the FHA domain contains an 11-stranded β-sandwich with small helical insertions at the loops connecting the strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Weiling1">[49]</xref>. Recent reports suggest that the FHA domain-containing proteins interact with and recruit other phospho-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gee1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gupta1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Sureka1">[21]</xref>. In eukaryotes, STPKs associate with multiple signaling domains, such as the BRCT, 14-3-3, Polo box, SH2, WW, WD40, and FHA domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gupta1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Yaffe1">[50]</xref>, while in bacteria, only FHA domains have been identified as the conserved STPK interacting domains. In addition, their role has been studied in important cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Weiling1">[49]</xref>. In order to determine the status of FHA domain containing proteins in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, we performed a BLASTp search using Rv0020c of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as a query <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Grundner1">[51]</xref> and found six additional FHA domain containing proteins (compared to <italic>M. marinum</italic>, which has ten FHA domain containing proteins, including the one encoded by the pMUM003 plasmid in <italic>M. marinum</italic> DL240490). A domain analysis and homology search showed that all of the proteins have functional homologs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> except MupFHA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003315-t002">Table 2</xref>). To further explain the relationships of MupFHA with other FHA domain homologs in other bacteria that carry a megaplasmid, for example non-pathogenic bacteria <italic>Mesorhizobium cicero</italic>, we performed BLASTp search with MupFHA sequence in the <italic>M. cicero</italic> database. There are two FHA domain containing proteins encoded by the <italic>M. cicero</italic> megaplasmid. However, the two proteins named Mesci_6382 and Mesci_6368 are annotated as type-VI secretion system FHA domain proteins and thus, are different from MupFHA. Similarly, in another pathogenic bacterium, <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, the virulence-associated plasmid pLB1 encodes an FHA domain protein YscD that is a part of the type-III secretion apparatus. Thus, it is possible that MupFHA, YscD, Mesci_6382 and Mesci_6368 are related evolutionarily. However, MupFHA does not contain any such secretory domain indicating divergence at some point. Thus, these analyses indicate that the MupFHA is a unique FHA domain containing protein present in the virulence-associated plasmid of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>.</p>

<title>Structural analysis of PknQ and MupFHA domain interactions through docking</title>
<p><italic>mup018c</italic> (<italic>mupFHA</italic>) is present in the vicinity of <italic>pknQ</italic> (<italic>mup011</italic>), suggesting that the two proteins encoded by these genes may interact with each other. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we first performed multiple sequence alignment of MupFHA and other known FHA-domain containing proteins. The alignment shows that the five most conserved residues of FHA-domain (Gly<sup>40</sup>, Arg<sup>41</sup>, Ser<sup>55</sup>, His<sup>58</sup> and Asn<sup>76</sup>) are also present in MupFHA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Next, we generated a structural model of the FHA domain of MupFHA using <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rv0020c as a template. MupFHA was found to contain 11 β-strands as is true for all the FHA-domain containing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pennell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Weiling1">[49]</xref>. PknQ<sub>kd</sub> and MupFHA models were then used for the docking studies and to characterize the key interacting residues. Amongst the major phosphorylation sites of PknQ (Thr<sup>166</sup>, Thr<sup>174</sup>, Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>260</sup>), Thr<sup>166</sup> and Thr<sup>260</sup> do not make close contact with MupFHA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, the docking was further performed using PknQ phosphorylated at Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>174</sup>. PknQ was found to interact with the residues present in the loops β3–β4, β4–β5 and β6–β7 of MupFHA, as described previously for other FHA domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pennell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Ali1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Durocher1">[53]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows the various docked complexes emphasizing the role of activation loop residues PknQ-pSer<sup>170</sup> (Sep170) and PknQ-pThr<sup>174</sup> (Tpo174) in stabilizing the complex formed with MupFHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>).

Rv0020c contains a Thr at position corresponding to MupFHA-Ser<sup>75</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) that also forms H-bond with pThr of the phospho-peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pennell1">[24]</xref>. The MupFHA model differs from the known Human Rad53 structure with respect to the binding of pThr<sup>174</sup> with the other absolutely conserved residue MupFHA-Arg<sup>41</sup>. MupFHA-Arg<sup>41</sup> was not found to interact with pThr<sup>174</sup>; instead it forms H-bond with PknQ-pSer<sup>170</sup>. MupFHA-Arg<sup>41</sup> holds PknQ-pSer<sup>170</sup> like a clip with the help of MupFHA-Arg<sup>56</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5B and 5D</xref>), reminiscent of pSer binding by Human PNK-FHA and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rv0020c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pennell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Ali1">[52]</xref>.

Rad53-FHA1 contains an asparagine at this site which also forms H-bond with pThr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Durocher1">[53]</xref>. This analysis indicates that residues Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>174</sup> of PknQ are important for its interaction with MupFHA.</p>

<p>To further apprehend the interaction between these two proteins, we performed docking of the FHA domain mutants of the two absolutely conserved residues- Arg<sup>41</sup> and Ser<sup>55</sup> with the wild-type PknQ<sub>kd</sub>. Significant loss of H-bonds within PknQ activation loop was observed in both the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5E and 5F</xref>). Serine to alanine substitution at position 55 of MupFHA led to the loss of H-bonding with PknQ-Thr<sup>174</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Similarly, MupFHA<sup>R41A</sup> mutation abolished the formation of H-bonds with PknQ-Ser<sup>170</sup> that were essential for holding the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).

The snapshots of complexes at different time points suggest that the dually phosphorylated form of PknQ makes the most stable complex with MupFHA.

<p>Analysis of charge distribution in the complex suggests that in the dually phosphorylated model, Ser<sup>55</sup> and Ser<sup>75</sup> of MupFHA play an important role in the recognition and form 3–4 H-bonds during interaction with PknQ-pThr<sup>174</sup>. PknQ-pSer<sup>170</sup> interacts with the Arg<sup>41</sup> and Arg<sup>56</sup> residues of MupFHA. These interactions are maintained even when there is a Thr<sup>174</sup> to alanine substitution in PknQ. When Ser<sup>170</sup> is substituted to alanine, MupFHA-Arg<sup>56</sup> becomes available for H-bonding. There is a relative movement of Arg<sup>56</sup> so that it now interacts with PknQ-pThr<sup>174</sup>. The analogous interaction of MupFHA-Arg<sup>56</sup> and PknQ-pThr<sup>174</sup> has also been observed previously in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pennell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Ali1">[52]</xref>, but is not seen when there is a pSer<sup>170</sup> residue in PknQ. Thus, MupFHA-Arg<sup>56</sup> moves towards PknQ-pThr<sup>174</sup> only when pSer<sup>170</sup> is absent. In this case, when H-bonds between PknQ-Thr<sup>174</sup> and MupFHA-Arg<sup>56</sup> were analyzed, it indicated that before 4 ns there is no significant interaction, but after 4 ns, 2–3 H-bonds are formed between these two residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>The RMSD values were then calculated and plotted for all the three complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The graph shows an initial structural rearrangement (1–2 ns) contributing to higher fluctuations in RMSD values for all the three protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The complexes formed with single phosphorylated residue of PknQ exhibit higher structural rearrangements and higher RMSD fluctuations compared to the double phosphorylated protein complex. These results indicate that Thr<sup>174</sup> and Ser<sup>170</sup> of PknQ are important mediators of the interaction with MupFHA. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>170</sup> may regulate interaction of MupFHA with PknQ by making MupFHA-Arg<sup>56</sup> and Arg<sup>41</sup> unavailable for pThr<sup>174</sup>.</p>

<title>Interaction of MupFHA with PknQ.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Affinity pull-down assay of PknQ with MupFHA and its FHA domain mutants. Immobilized His<sub>6</sub>-PknQ was allowed to interact with GST-tagged MupFHA and its mutants (MupFHA<sup>R41A</sup> and MupFHA<sup>S55A</sup>). GST served as a negative control for the pull-down assay and showed no interaction, which confirmed the specificity of the PknQ∶MupFHA interaction (lane 4). The eluted fractions were immunoblotted with anti-GST antibodies to assess the levels of interactions. The upper panel shows ponceau-stained membrane and lower panel is the corresponding immunoblot. As evident from the immunoblot, MupFHA was eluted together with PknQ, while MupFHA<sup>R41A</sup> and MupFHA<sup>S55A</sup> were weakly co-eluted. Purified MupFHA was used as a positive control for immunoblotting (lane 6). (<bold>B</bold>) Histogram showing ELISA-based interaction of PknQ with MupFHA and its variants. PknQ strongly interacts with wild-type MupFHA, while the interactions with MupFHA<sup>R41A</sup> and MupFHA<sup>S55A</sup> mutants were significantly decreased (also observed in the pull-down assay). The experiment was performed three times (error bars show standard error of three values) and GST/no protein were used as negative controls.

No interaction was observed with PknQ<sup>K41M</sup>, while loss of PknQ-Thr<sup>166</sup> did not significantly affect its interaction with MupFHA.

<p>To further validate the interaction of the FHA domain with PknQ, we studied specific protein-protein interactions through sandwich ELISA. His<sub>6</sub>-PknQ was adsorbed on a 96-well plate and allowed to interact with equimolar amounts of GST-tagged substrates. Significant interaction was observed between His<sub>6</sub>-PknQ and GST-MupFHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Interaction assays of PknQ were also performed with the GST-MupFHA<sup>R41A</sup> and GST-MupFHA<sup>S55A</sup> mutants. The interactions were severely disrupted by mutating the two residues of MupFHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Thus, our results confirmed that the interaction of PknQ∶MupFHA occurred via the FHA domain and requires Arg<sup>41</sup> and Ser<sup>55</sup>.</p>

<title>Specificity of MupFHA domain towards phospho-residues</title>
<p>Docking studies and MD analysis indicated the critical role of the activation loop residue Ser<sup>170</sup> in the PknQ∶MupFHA interaction along with the pThr<sup>174</sup>. FHA domains are primarily pThr binding domains. In fact, such pThr specificity helps in decreasing the potential interaction sites of FHA domains, as 90% of all Ser/Thr kinase activity in eukaryotes is directed towards serine phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Mann1">[54]</xref>. However, in prokaryotes, and even more so in <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, STPKs more often act upon threonine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Prisic1">[11]</xref>. However, PknQ is an exception, as it requires Ser<sup>170</sup> in addition to threonine residues. Therefore, to investigate the role of Ser<sup>170</sup> in PknQ∶MupFHA interaction, we performed an ELISA with MupFHA and PknQ<sup>S170A</sup>. Our results showed a loss of interaction between MupFHA and PknQ<sup>S170A</sup> compared to wild-type PknQ and PknQ<sup>T166A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). The interaction of PknQ<sup>S170A</sup> was similar to the kinase inactive mutant PknQ<sup>K41M</sup>, which is the completely unphosphorylated form of the kinase. We also compared this interaction with interaction of other key phospho-residue mutants (Thr<sup>174</sup> and Thr<sup>260</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Apart from Ser<sup>170</sup>, the only residue important for interaction is Thr<sup>174</sup> confirming the results obtained from structural modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, MupFHA-PknQ interaction was probed in competition ELISA-based assays using synthetic peptides phosphorylated either on threonine or serine residue. Immobilized MupFHA was first incubated with pSer, pThr or random unphosphorylated peptide and competitively replaced by PknQ. In this assay, the MupFHA-PknQ interaction was proportionally dependent on MupFHA∶phospho-peptide binding. We observed that both pThr and pSer peptides showed affinity to MupFHA but not the unphosphorylated random peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Notably, the binding of MupFHA with both phospho-peptides was not very strong, which probably indicates the role of neighbouring residues (of phospho-acceptor site) in these interactions. To further probe the pSer/pThr interaction, we also utilized <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> kinase PrkD that autophosphorylates on Ser<sup>162</sup> residue, in addition to several threonine and tyrosine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Arora1">[30]</xref>. MupFHA was allowed to bind with PrkD and PrkD<sup>S162A</sup> where the interaction was found to be reduced after mutation of Ser<sup>162</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Together, these results indicate the affinity of MupFHA with both pThr and pSer.</p>

<title>Identification of MupFHA phosphorylation sites and role of the FHA domain in PknQ-mediated phosphorylation of MupFHA</title>
<p>To identify the MupFHA residues phosphorylated by PknQ, PAA analysis was performed.

We subsequently identified the phosphorylation sites in MupFHA by mass spectrometry. PknQ phosphorylated MupFHA on four threonine residues (Thr<sup>8</sup>, Thr<sup>123</sup>, Thr<sup>210</sup>, and Thr<sup>214</sup>), which confirmed the results obtained from the PAA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003315-t003">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Since the FHA domain of MupFHA is involved in its interaction with PknQ, it was essential to study the role of the FHA domain in its phosphorylation. Therefore, the two conserved FHA domain residues, Arg<sup>41</sup> and Ser<sup>55</sup>, were mutated to alanine and the effect on PknQ-mediated phosphorylation of MupFHA was subsequently analyzed. We found that the MupFHA<sup>R41A</sup> and MupFHA<sup>S55A</sup> mutants had an approximately 40% and 80% loss of phosphorylation signal compared to wild-type protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>). These results indicate that FHA-mediated interaction of MupFHA is necessary for its phosphorylation by PknQ. This cooperation between FHA domain residues and other phosphorylated residues most likely helps in enhancing and regulating the interaction as well as phosphorylation of MupFHA. Importantly, these results are also in agreement with the docking studies where the Arg<sup>41</sup> and Ser<sup>55</sup> mutations weakened the interaction between MupFHA and PknQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g005">Fig. 5E and 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Autophosphorylation of PknQ is regulated by MupFHA</title>
<p>In the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CDC1551 strain, the FHA domain containing protein EmbR2 (a structural homologue of EmbR) affects the kinase activity of PknH. Although EmbR2 is not phosphorylated by PknH, it inhibits the kinase autophosphorylation and inactivates the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Molle3">[55]</xref>. Similarly, Rv0020c, a FHA domain containing protein of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, regulates the cell wall regulator pseudokinase MviN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gee1">[17]</xref>. In our study, we found that MupFHA specifically inhibited PknQ activity in the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, indicating that their interaction may have a negative impact on the kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). To further investigate the effect of the MupFHA interaction on PknQ activity, we used mass spectrometry to assess changes in phosphorylation patterns. PknQ was allowed to autophosphorylate in the presence of MupFHA and then analyzed by mass spectroscopy to determine the phosphorylation sites. Our results showed that PknQ only autophosphorylates on eight sites in the presence of MupFHA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003315-t004">Table 4</xref>) as compared to 20 sites in the absence of MupFHA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003315-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results confirm that MupFHA acts as a negative regulator of PknQ kinase activity. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Thr<sup>166</sup>, Ser<sup>170</sup> and Thr<sup>174</sup> residues was impervious to MupFHA-based inhibition, underscoring the critical requirement of activation loop residues in the activity of PknQ. The kinase activation process involves initial phosphorylation on activation loop residues and subsequently other sites are phosphorylated to generate its active conformation. Inhibition by MupFHA may reduce/abrogate these conformational changes and therefore the kinase may only be able to reach its fully active conformation either in the absence of MupFHA or by any other ligand that might abolish this interaction.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Ser/Thr phosphatases are the only known negative regulators of STPK-mediated signaling and there is no such phosphatase encoding gene present on the pMUM001 plasmid. Therefore, MupFHA may help in regulating the activity of PknQ by limiting phosphorylation to specific substrate(s) and act as a principal controller of this signaling scheme.

PAA analysis showed that phosphorylation was located at serine and threonine residues of MupDivIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g010">Fig. 10C</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of MupDivIVA identified six phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0003315-t005">Table 5</xref>). Incidentally, all phosphorylation sites were found to be localized within DivIVA core domain (42–83 aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g010">Fig. 10D</xref>). Comparison of MupDivIVA phosphorylation sites with only phosphorylated threonine residue identified in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Wag31 revealed that the three serine phosphorylation sites are present in the same DivIVA region in both the proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0003315.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). Such strikingly similar phosphorylation patterns may indicate their conserved role. The three serine phosphorylation sites were mutagenized to alanine and were compared for their phosphorylation levels. The triple mutant MupDivIVA<sup>S43/45/49A</sup> showed ∼70% loss of phosphorylation, indicating the importance of serine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g010">Fig. 10E</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the FHA domain recognizes phosphorylated proteins, we hypothesized that MupFHA may interact with the phosphorylated MupDivIVA through a three-way regulatory process with PknQ. To evaluate this hypothesis, the MBP-tagged proteins MupDivIVA-P (phosphorylated) or MupDivIVA-UP (unphosphorylated) and GST-tagged MupFHA were used in a sandwich ELISA. We found that MupDivIVA phosphorylation increased its affinity for MupFHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g011">Fig. 11A</xref>). Furthermore, there was a considerable loss in interaction with MupDivIVA when the conserved FHA domain residues of MupFHA were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g011">Fig. 11B</xref>). These results confirm that the FHA domain mediates the interaction of MupFHA with phosphorylated MupDivIVA. Therefore, MupFHA interacts with MupDivIVA through a phosphorylation dependent manner, which is regulated by PknQ. Further, we used MupDivIVA to probe pSer binding affinity of MupFHA. We compared the interaction of MupDivIVA phosphorylation site mutants with MupFHA. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rv0020c was used to compare pThr specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003315-g011">Fig. 11C</xref>). This analysis revealed role of phosphorylated serine/threonine residues in MupFHA∶MupDivIVA interaction while only pThr residues regulate Rv0020c∶MupDivIVA interaction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we analyzed the STPK-mediated signaling system of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, which is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer. <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> is a slow growing bacterium (slower than <italic>M. marinum</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Marsollier1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Tonjum1">[63]</xref> and this slow growth together with restrictive temperature requirements are the major reasons for our limited understanding about this important human pathogen and its signaling systems. Using <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, we identified 13 STPKs in the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> genome that are distinct from its close relative <italic>M. marinum</italic> that has 24 STPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Narayan1">[39]</xref>. STPKs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> have been classified in five clades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Narayan1">[39]</xref>, and phylogenetic analysis reveals that <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> also has individual STPKs related to all five clades with an over-representation of the PknF/PknI/PknJ clade. Analyses of STPKs and FHA domain encoding genes confirmed that <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> underwent reductive evolution compared to <italic>M. marinum</italic>.</p>
<p>The presence of PknQ on the virulence-associated plasmid pMUM001 makes the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> kinome exclusive than <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and other characterized bacterial kinomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Stinear1">[64]</xref>. Three such plasmids have been identified in the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species, including pMUM001 (<italic>M. ulcerans</italic> Agy 99), pMUM002 (<italic>M. liflandii</italic> 128FXT), and pMUM003 (<italic>M. marinum</italic> DL240490) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pidot1">[65]</xref>. These three plasmids are involved in mycolactone synthesis and most likely in pathogenesis. In addition, all of the plasmids encode a homolog of STPK (MUP011, MULP_022, and MUDP_075, respectively), although a frameshift mutation suggests that MUDP_075 is a pseudogene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pidot1">[65]</xref>. Notably, these plasmids have a conserved kinase locus (from the STPK gene [<italic>mup011</italic>] to the FHA domain-containing protein [<italic>mup018c</italic>]), although pMUM003 is slightly different, most likely due to a frameshift mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pidot1">[65]</xref>. Large plasmids, such as pMUM001, which encode proteins involved in adaptation to new environments, represent regular theme among many other bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, and <italic>Shigella</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Stinear1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Galyov1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Pallen1">[68]</xref>. These species share a nearly identical genome structure and sequence with other species in their genera, but due to the acquisition of virulence-associated plasmids, these bacteria tend to acclimatize better to new conditions. In the plague causing bacteria <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, the virulence-associated plasmid pLB1 encodes a STPK YpkA that acts as a direct inducer of cell death by promoting apoptosis and actin depolymerization during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Galyov1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Juris1">[69]</xref>. Interestingly, other than YpkA, pLB1 encodes several other antigens, and one of them, the type III secretion apparatus protein YscD also possesses an FHA domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Gamez1">[70]</xref>. The role of a virulence-associated plasmid in the pathogenesis of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> has previously been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Doig1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Stinear2">[71]</xref>, but its significance beyond mycolactone biosynthesis has not been appreciated until now. Our results demonstrated that multiple proteins encoded on pMUM001 are regulated by phosphorylation, and therefore this plasmid may be an important component of signaling cascades in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of PknQ in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, we elucidated the biochemical characteristics of this kinase. Our biochemical characterization identified both common and novel features. PknQ kinase activity is dependent on cofactors such as Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, the kinase is activated by Fe<sup>2+</sup>, while its activity is inhibited by Fe<sup>3+</sup>. This inhibition occurs in the presence of hemin, indicating that PknQ activity is regulated by iron and its redox state in the cellular milieu. The role of iron in the regulation of its kinase activity is justified by the presence of a FepB-like iron transporter domain at the C-terminus of PknQ. However, further studies are required to validate this aspect of PknQ signaling.</p>
<p>To understand the activation mechanism of PknQ, several mutants were generated. We found that the autophosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the activation loop region regulates PknQ activity. In most <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> STPKs, activity is regulated by two threonine residues present in the activation loop. Analogous residues (Thr<sup>164</sup> and Thr<sup>166</sup>) are also phosphorylated in PknQ, but only Thr<sup>166</sup> is critical for autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, a novel serine residue, Ser<sup>170</sup>, was found to regulate the autokinase and substrate phosphorylation activities of PknQ. In fact, phosphorylation of activation loop residues is known to be required for stabilization of kinases as it can induce specific conformational changes important in substrate binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Huse1">[72]</xref>. Thus, further structural studies on PknQ are needed to understand the role of each phosphoresidue and how this serine phosphorylation is mechanistically different from threonine phosphorylation.</p>
<p>We also identified the FHA-domain containing protein MupFHA as an interacting partner of PknQ. To understand how MupFHA and PknQ interact, we generated structural models to establish the basis of MupFHA and PknQ interaction. Interestingly, the PknQ and MupFHA interaction highlighted several novel aspects. The structural analyses suggest that PknQ-MupFHA interaction follows the canonical binding mode of pThr interaction with specific arginine and serine residues of FHA-domain. However, MupFHA additionally interacts with a pSer residue present in the activation loop of PknQ. The structural models were validated by experimental analysis using ELISA and affinity pull-down assays, thus establishing the structure-activity relationship for PknQ. Together, these findings highlighted the unconventional molecular recognition patterns of kinase∶FHA interactions.</p>
<p>The second unique aspect of the MupFHA∶PknQ interaction is the role of MupFHA as a negative regulator of PknQ. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report of any bacterial FHA-mediated regulation of the cognate kinase activity. It has been previously reported that EmbR2 inhibits PknH phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Molle3">[55]</xref>, but this is restricted to the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CDC1551 strain. Nevertheless, MupFHA signaling is unique, as PknH does not phosphorylate EmbR2, while MupFHA is a substrate of PknQ. This regulation of kinase activity by FHA domains could have important implications in the spatio-temporal regulation of cellular signaling. It is important to note that the critical activation loop residues were phosphorylated even in the presence of MupFHA, thus indicating that MupFHA may only regulate the secondary phosphorylation sites and substrate binding of PknQ. To understand this inhibition further, we applied mass spectrometry and found a significant reduction in number of phosphorylation sites. However, the mass spectrometry analysis did not quantitate the phosphorylation stoichiometry of each site and we cannot rule out the possibility that the phosphorylation of key activation loop residues is also inhibited.</p>
<p>The third aspect of MupFHA signaling is the ability of both PknQ and MupFHA to interact with another phosphorylated protein, MupDivIVA. Our results indicate that PknQ phosphorylates MupDivIVA, which is a homolog of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Wag31, another DivIVA domain-containing protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Kang1">[60]</xref>. Wag31 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is already known to be phosphorylated by PknB and PknA and this phosphorylation is critical for cell growth and peptidoglycan synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003315-Jani1">[59]</xref>. Upon phosphorylation, MupDivIVA also interacts with MupFHA in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Therefore, this study provides insights into three-way regulation involving dynamic signaling between PknQ, MupFHA, and MupDivIVA.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study is the first analysis of signaling pathways in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and has revealed many novel aspects of signaling systems among <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species. Our results indicate that PknQ could be an important sensor of extracellular cues in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and can propagate the signals to MupFHA and MupDivIVA. Moreover, iron and MupFHA may act as quenchers in this phosphorylation cascade. Taken together, our data underscore the importance of structure-activity studies in unraveling the PknQ-MupFHA signaling axis in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and provide an interesting starting point to work towards understanding this pathogen.</p>
