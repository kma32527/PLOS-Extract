<abstract>
<p>Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase is an enzyme involved in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, and catalyzes the inter-conversion of D-ribose 5-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate. Trypanosomatids, including the agent of African sleeping sickness namely <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, have a type B ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. This enzyme is absent from humans, which have a structurally unrelated ribose 5-phosphate isomerase type A, and therefore has been proposed as an attractive drug target waiting further characterization. In this study, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B showed <italic>in vitro</italic> isomerase activity. RNAi against this enzyme reduced parasites' <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, and more importantly, bloodstream forms infectivity. Mice infected with induced RNAi clones exhibited lower parasitaemia and a prolonged survival compared to control mice. Phenotypic reversion was achieved by complementing induced RNAi clones with an ectopic copy of <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> gene. Our results present the first functional characterization of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B, and show the relevance of an enzyme belonging to the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway in the context of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> infection.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Within the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, ribose 5-phosphate isomerase catalyzes the inter-conversion of ribose 5-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate. There are two types of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, namely A and B. The presence of type B in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, and its absence in humans, make this protein a promising drug target. African sleeping sickness is a serious parasitic disease that relies on limited chemotherapeutic options for control. In our study, a functional characterization of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B is reported. Biochemical studies confirmed enzyme isomerase activity and its downregulation by RNAi affected mainly parasites infectivity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Overall this study shows that ribose 5-phosphate isomerase depletion is detrimental for parasites infectivity under host pressure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>African sleeping sickness is a vector borne disease of mammals, caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<italic>T. brucei</italic>), for which the development of more effective, safe, and affordable chemotherapies remains a major goal. Vaccines are unlikely to be suitable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-MacGregor1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Lejon1">[3]</xref>, and therefore disease control relies exclusively on chemotherapy. The glucose-based metabolism is a key metabolic pathway for bloodstream forms, the mammalian infective stages. The absence of a fully functional mitochondrion along with a remarkable high proliferation rate makes parasites entirely dependent on glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Clayton1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Hellemond1">[5]</xref>. The glucose-based metabolism comprises two pathways: the glycolytic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Despite using the same substrate, the pathways have different functions. Glycolysis catabolizes glucose for ATP requirements, while PPP includes an oxidative branch, mainly involved in the maintenance of cell redox homeostasis, and a non-oxidative branch in which ribose 5-phosphate is produced for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. Enzymes involved in the PPP non-oxidative branch include ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase, transaldolase and transketolase, and in contrast with enzymes involved in the glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Albert1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Bressi1">[15]</xref> or in the oxidative PPP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Cordeiro1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Dardonville1">[17]</xref>, have been less studied. In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, enzymes of the non-oxidative branch downstream ribose-5-phosphate isomerase are apparently developmentally regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Cronin1">[18]</xref>. Ribose 5-phosphate epimerase and transketolase activities were only detected in procyclics, the parasite form present in the insect vector. This suggests that in the mammalian host, bloodstream forms constrain sugar metabolism to the production of ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH via the oxidative phase of the PPP, most likely to meet the remarkably high proliferation rate of these parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-CominiMA1">[19]</xref>, and/or to protect themselves against a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Husain1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Ralser1">[21]</xref> in a context of an <italic>in vivo</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (Rpi) catalyzes the inter-conversion between ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) and ribose 5-phosphate (R5P). Contrary to trypanosomatids, which have a Rpi type B (RpiB), the presence of a structurally unrelated Rpi type A (RpiA) in humans together with the adverse phenotype observed in <italic>rpiA<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>rpiB<sup>-</sup></italic> knockout <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Sorensen1">[22]</xref> have led to suggest RpiB as an attractive drug target candidate that waits further characterization.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate the importance of RpiB in <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream form viability and infectivity.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of poly-His-tagged recombinant <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB and <italic>Tc</italic>RpiB</title>
<p>The <italic>TbRPIB</italic> and <italic>TcRPIB</italic> genes were excised from the pGEM-T Easy vector (using NdeI/EcoRI restriction enzyme combination), gel purified and subcloned into pET28a(+) expression vector (Novagen). The resulting constructs presented a poly-His tag (6× Histidine residues) at the N-terminal and were used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21DE3 cells. Both recombinant proteins were expressed by induction of log-phase cultures (500 ml; OD<italic><sub>600</sub></italic>  = 0.6) with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D- thiogalactopyranoside) for 3 h at 37°C and agitation at 250 rpm/min. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, for 40 min, at 4°C), resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.6). The sample was sonicated, according to the following conditions: output 4, duty cycle 50%, 10 cycles with 15 s each. Centrifugation (4000 rpm, for 60 min, at 4°C) was followed to obtain the bacterial crude extract. The recombinant enzymes were purified in one step using Ni<sup>2+</sup> resin (ProBond) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed sequentially with 2–3 ml of the buffer A, 20 ml of the bacterial crude extract, 2 ml of buffer A 25 mM imidazole, 2 ml of buffer A 30 mM imidazole, 2 ml of buffer A 40 mM imidazole, 2 ml of buffer A 40 mM imidazole, 2 ml of buffer A 50 mM imidazole, 10 ml of buffer A 100 mM imidazole, 5 ml of buffer A 500 mM imidazole and 8 ml of buffer B (1 M imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 200 mM Tris, pH 7.6). <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB and <italic>Tc</italic>RpiB were eluted in the fractions of buffer A containing between 100 and 500 mM of imidazole.

<p><italic>Tb</italic>RpiB activity was assessed through <italic>Km</italic> determination for R5P and Ru5P, through 4-deoxy-4-phospho-D-erythronohydroxamic acid (4-PEH) (kindly provided by Dr. Laurent Salmon) inhibitory capacity against <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB, and through 4-PEH inhibition mechanism characterization. Firstly, to determine the <italic>Km</italic> for R5P and to characterize 4-PEH-inhibition mechanism, a direct spectrophotometric method at 290 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Wood1">[30]</xref> was used, to quantify Ru5P formation. <italic>Km</italic> determination was performed at R5P concentrations in a range between 3.1 and 50 mM in Tris/HCl (pH 7.6). For 4-PEH inhibition mechanism characterization, the experiment was performed in the presence of 0.5 µg of enzyme and 0.1, 0.4, 0.7 or 1 mM of inhibitor. All inhibitors were tested in the presence of 3.1 mM R5P. A negative control was made using heat inactivated enzyme. The <italic>Tc</italic>RpiB enzyme was used as a positive control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Stern1">[31]</xref>. A calibration curve for Ru5P, using the referred method, was established to determine enzyme activity. An absorbance of 0.0381 at 290 nm was considered for 1 mM Ru5P. To determine the <italic>Km</italic> for Ru5P and to test 4-PEH inhibition as well, a modification of Dische's Cysteine-Carbazole method was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Domagk1">[32]</xref>. To determine <italic>Km</italic>, an incubation mixture contained 5 µl of 0.05 µg of enzyme in buffer A [100 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.4), 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol] plus 5 µl of Ru5P, giving final concentrations between 0.625 and 10 mM Ru5P, was used. For inhibition assay, Ru5P concentration used was 1.25 mM. Incubation was done for 10 min at room temperature. Following incubation, 15 µl of 0.5% cysteinium chloride, 125 µl of 75% (v/v) sulfuric acid and 5 µl of a 0.1% solution of carbazole in ethanol were added. After 30 min standing at room temperature, the <italic>A<sub>546</sub></italic> was determined. A blank without enzyme was run for each substrate or inhibitor concentration. Reaction linearity was checked varying enzyme concentration and time. To estimate the remaining Ru5P, a calibration curve was generated. In this assay conditions, 1 mM of Ru5P gave an <italic>A<sub>546</sub></italic> of 0.270 in a final reaction volume of 155 µl.</p>

The coverslips were incubated in PBS containing 10% FCS during 60 min, at room temperature, in a humidified atmosphere and washed twice with PBS/2% FCS. Then, incubated with primary rat or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB (1∶100 and 1∶1000 respectively, both diluted in blocking solution) overnight, at 4°C, followed by two washes with PBS/2% FCS (5 min each one).

<title><italic>Tb</italic>RpiB expression and subcellular localization</title>
<p>Rabbit and rat polyclonal antibodies were generated against the <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB recombinant protein.

Similarly a significant decrease on RpiB levels in the extracts of <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB RNAi induced parasites is shown by Western blot.

To ascertain RpiB subcellular localization in bloodstream forms, two complementary approaches, immunofluorescence and digitonin fractionation, were performed. Fluorescent confocal microscopy analysis suggests that <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB despite being localized mainly in the cytosol can be also found in glycosomes due to colocalization with the glycosomal marker, aldolase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Clayton2">[38]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003430-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Upon digitonin fractionation, RpiB showed an intermediate pattern between the glycosomal marker, aldolase (still partially in the pellet after 200 µg/ml digitonin treatment) and the cytosolic marker, enolase (almost all in supernatant with 25 µg/ml digitonin), being practically released with 100 µg/ml digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003430-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

<p>To test the importance of RpiB for parasite infectivity in a disease model, two groups of BALB/c mice were inoculated with the wt parental cell line and other two groups with the RNAi cell line.

A Western blot confirmed the reduction of the protein level in 48 h RNAi induced parasites used for mice infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003430-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Blood samples were taken from all mice at daily intervals to chart parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003430-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Animals achieving a parasitaemia greater than 10<sup>8</sup> trypanosomes per millilitre were euthanized. <italic>In vivo</italic> growth of the <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB RNAi Dox(-) trypanosomes was not significantly different from that of wt Dox(-) parasites. However a significant decrease in the parasitaemia of induced <italic>versus</italic> non-induced RNAi cell lines was seen. Within 6 days of inoculation, contrary to mice infected with induced RNAi cell line (in which overall parasitaemias remained below the detection limit, 5×10<sup>4</sup> trypanosomes/ml), mice infected with control parasites developed high levels of parasitaemia. As a consequence, and in contrast to mice infected with wt and <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB RNAi Dox(-) parasites, which were culled sooner (between eighth to thirteenth day post-infection), <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB RNAi Dox(+) were euthanized from the eighteenth day post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003430-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we demonstrated that <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB, like the related <italic>Tc</italic>RpiB and <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> RpiB (<italic>Ld</italic>RpiB) enzymes, has <italic>in vitro</italic> ribose 5-phosphate isomerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Stern1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Kaur1">[43]</xref>. Based on the theoretical homology model, <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB is predicted to be dimeric. Although the dimer comprises a complete functional unit, tetramers are observed in all available RpiB structures except that of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> RpiB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Stern2">[36]</xref>. Similarly to <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> and <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> Rpi enzymes, <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB has the ability of using both R5P or Ru5P as substrates, but with remarkable preference for Ru5P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Stern1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Yoon1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Skrukrud1">[45]</xref>. However, the differences in affinity are more pronounced in trypanosomes enzymes. Indeed, these differences were higher for <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB compared to <italic>Tc</italic>RpiB. Analysis of the three enzymes from trypanosomatids (<italic>Tc</italic>RpiB, <italic>Ld</italic>RpiB and <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB) shows that <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB and <italic>Ld</italic>RpiB have the highest <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value for R5P substrate, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Stern1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Kaur1">[43]</xref>. Nevertheless, we can speculate that such differences may result in part by the fact that parasite enzymes were expressed and purified as recombinant proteins in bacteria and not purified directly from trypanosomes extracts. Consequently, differences in protein post-transcriptional processing and/or changes in protein conformation cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>RpiB is expressed on <italic>T. brucei</italic> procyclic and bloodstream forms, and our data indicate its higher expression in procyclics. Interestingly, a previous study has shown higher levels of <italic>TbRPIB</italic> mRNA (Tb927.11.8970) in logarithmic phase procyclic forms compared to bloodstream forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Jensen1">[46]</xref>. However, its biological meaning, if any, remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Regarding RpiB subcellular localization in bloodstream forms, the protein despite found mainly in the cytosol is also present in glycosomes. This might explain why a previous proteomic analysis failed to find <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB enzyme in purified glycosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Colasante1">[47]</xref>. The glycosomal localization observed within the dual-localization can be justified by the presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal, PTS2 (-KVAIGADHI-), at the N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Opperdoes1">[48]</xref>. Moreover, other enzymes of the hexose-monophosphate pathway, although present in glycosomes, were also found mainly within the cytosol (e.g. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase and transketolase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Stoffel1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Duffieux1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Tb</italic>RpiB is clearly needed for optimal <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite growth, although we do not know whether it is essential for survival since some protein remained after RNAi. Nevertheless, our results show that <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB is important for parasites infectivity <italic>in vivo</italic>, through the appearance of RNAi revertants and reversion of the phenotype in complemented parasites. Infectivity defects of bloodstreams with reduced levels of <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB were shown on a monomorphic <italic>T. brucei</italic> strain. This strain is abnormally virulent and typically mice do not survive longer than ≈10 days. In the future, it would be interesting to test the role of RpiB in a more chronic infection, as the one caused by pleomorphic strains. Interfering with the PPP non-oxidative branch showed to be detrimental under host pressure, in these highly proliferative parasitic forms, which can be due to a defective production of ribose 5-phosphate towards nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. Moreover, another enzyme capable of producing ribose 5-phosphate, ribokinase, is essential for parasites survival since attempts to remove the two alleles were unsuccessful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Kerkhoven1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Tb</italic>RpiB is not the first protein reported as dispensable under standard laboratory culture conditions but crucial for parasites growth in the animal host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Ong1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Vigueira1">[53]</xref>. In rich culture conditions, parasites may uptake essential nutrients from the extracellular medium, which may not be as available in blood. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic>, parasites need to deal with pressure from the host immune response.</p>
<p>As for other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Signorell1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Mackey1">[55]</xref>, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results differ from the ones achieved in RNA interference target sequencing (RITseq) screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Alsford1">[56]</xref>. Indeed, proteins described to be significantly important for parasites fitness by Alsford and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Alsford1">[56]</xref> were not in others studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Signorell1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Mackey1">[55]</xref>. Despite large-scale RNAi screens have already proved useful, caution should be taken due to some level of false negatives and positives, inherent to high-throughput approaches and more importantly due to off-target effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Mohr1">[57]</xref>. Furthermore, variations between different large-scale RNAi screenings were already been reported and explained by the use of different <italic>T. brucei</italic> strains, RNAi constructs and methods for assessing cell growth highlighting the importance of using complementary approaches in such studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0003430-Jones1">[58]</xref>. Despite all, both studies are in agreement and show a role for <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB on parasites growth.</p>
<p>To further investigate if bloodstream forms deleted of RpiB are completely cleared in mice, studies with gene knockout parasites should be done.</p>
<p>Overall our results clearly show a role of RpiB for bloodstream <italic>in vitro</italic> optimal growth and more importantly <italic>in vivo</italic> infectivity, but also suggest a conserved role among different <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> species. In conclusion <italic>Tb</italic>RpiB emerges as a new potential therapeutic target against African sleeping sickness.</p>
