<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chagas disease, caused by the parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, is an endemic disease of Latin-American countries, affecting an estimated 8 million people in 21 countries. It is spread by the bite of triatomine reduvid bug. Due to immigration towards non-endemic regions, the disease can spread and affect people around the world via blood transfusions. Infection usually occurs in childhood, and some patients may develop acute myocarditis; however, most remain asymptomatic for many years before chronic cardiac and/or gastrointestinal manifestations appear. Chagas disease is characterized by an acute phase, which is generally asymptomatic, or oligosymptomatic, an indeterminate phase, which may persist for several years, and a chronic phase in which dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias are primarily observed and sudden death may occur. Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years. In this work, we demonstrate the pathophysiological role of proteins secreted by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> on cardiac arrhythmias. The antigenicity of these fractions was tested by an immunological test using chagasic patients’ sera associated with arrhythmias. We showed that perfusion of the proteins secreted by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, in an isolated beating rat heart model, induced cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia and complete atrioventricular block.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chagas disease is an important public health problem in Latin America currently affecting an estimated 8 million people in 21 countries and spreading by human migration to a number of non-endemic regions [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the etiologic agent of the disease in mammals; the parasite is transmitted by blood-sucking triatomine bugs, blood transfusions or trans-placentally [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This illness is characterized by an acute phase, which is generally asymptomatic, or oligosymptomatic, an indeterminate phase, which may persist for several years, and a chronic phase in which dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias are primarily observed. Chagas cardiomyopathy has been attributed to an alteration in intracellular ions, an imbalance between adrenergic and cholinergic innervations, to cellular and humoral autoimmunity and to parasitic effects or micro-ischemic disturbances [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Cardiac arrhythmias are one of the most important alterations in Chagas heart disease and may be associated with sudden death [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The principal disorders reported are atrial, ventricular extrasystoles, intraventricular and/or AV conduction disturbances and primary ST-T wave changes [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Classically, arrhythmias have been linked to autonomic dysfunction [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], anti-adrenergic and anti-cholinergic autoantibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and to wall motion abnormalities [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although, Chagas patients may present with arrhythmias and sudden death in the absence of ventricular dysfunction (known as the arrhythmogenic form) [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the causes associated with nonstructural arrhythmias are poorly understood. Notably, ST and T abnormalities, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias and low voltage QRS have been reported in a recent acute outbreak characterized by high parasitemia [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which suggests that the secreted proteins of the parasite may be involved in arrhythmia generation.</p>
<p>The interaction between the parasite and the host cell has gained attention in the pathophysiology of Chagas disease. Parasite surface proteins, such as mucins, trans-sialidases and mucin-associated proteins (MAPs), are adhesion factors involved in the invasion of the host cell [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, these proteins are able to increase the intracellular calcium concentration to facilitate the entry of the parasite [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent report described a calcium overload in the ventricular myocytes of chagasic patients [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that may be related to parasite signaling and could be responsible for the arrhythmias observed in Chagas disease. However, there are few reports that have linked protein secretion by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> with arrhythmias [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, the aim this study is to demonstrate that proteins present in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-conditioned medium are able to produce arrhythmias in an isolated beating rat heart model.</p>

<title>Animal samples</title>
<p>Sprague Dawley IVIC female rats (300–400 g.) were obtained from the Bioterio Services at IVIC. The animals were allowed to acclimate for 2 weeks prior to the study. They were housed in a clean wire mesh cages (10 rats per cage) and maintained under standard laboratory condition of 12 hours natural light and 12 hours darkness at ambient room temperature. The rats were fed on pellets and water was made available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>

<title>Cell culture and conditioned media</title>
<p>Vero (African green monkey kidney cells, ATCC CCL-81; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.) were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in complete Minimum Essential Medium (Mediatech, Herndon, Va.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md), 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 μg of gentamicin/ml (all Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Confluent Vero cultures plated in a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> Easy Flask were infected with 2x10<sup>5</sup> EP strain trypomastigotes/ml. EP human strain at a rate of 2 parasites per cell. The EP strain of <italic>T cruzi</italic> was isolated from a fatal human case in 1967 as describe by Contreras et al [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Free parasites were removed after 24 hours and the complete medium was changed at this point to medium FBS-free. The fifth or sixth day post-infection the conditioned serum-free medium was collected. The criteria for harvesting of the conditioned infected medium (CMi) were that a minimum of 75% of the <italic>Vero</italic> cells should remain adhered and that at least 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> trypomastigotes/ml should be present in the supernatant. The medium was centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to separate the parasites, and the supernatant was subsequently filtered using a 0.2 μm membrane filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) before being stored at -20°C until use. Control medium (CMc) was collected from uninfected Vero cells cultured under the same conditions.</p>
<p>Cells were enzymatically detached with a 1:1 mixture of trypsin (0.25% v/v) and EDTA (0.25%), were lysed at 4°C with ten rounds of sonication for 20 s at power level 3 with a 550 Sonic Desmembrator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh PA, USA). The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate the cell debris, and the supernatant was subsequently filtered using a 0.2 μm membrane filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) before being stored at -20°C until use.</p>
<p>The supernatant fluid which had been decanted was concentrated by using low-protein binding membrane Diaflo (Millipore, AmiconCorp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) ultrafiltration cell operated in a cold room (4°C) at 50 psi. The Diaflo Model 50 ultrafiltration cell is provided with internal stirring and has a capacity of 40 ml. Supernatant from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected cells (henceforth CMi) and those from uninfected Vero cells (henceforth CMc) SFV-free were passed through a ultrafiltration membranes. In each round, the fraction was concentrated to a volume of 10 ml (4x) and washed three times with milli-Q water to remove the lower molecular weight proteins. The pore size cutoff used were 300, 50, and 10 Kda, and the ultrafiltrates obtained were a) &gt;300 Kda, b) &lt;300 and &gt; 50 Kda and c) &lt;50 Kda [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
<p>After wash, each fraction was reconstituted to a final protein concentration of 5 μg/ml using Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.81 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5.33 mM KCl, 117.24 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.56 mM D-Glucose, with L-Glutamine, Phenol Red and essential amino acids). The osmolalities of the reconstituted medium were measured using an osmometer (model Osmette A, Precision Instruments, Sudbury, MA) and were adjusted at 295–300 mOsm and pH to 7.4 with HCl. Finally, three concentrated fractions, corresponding to three molecular weight ranges, were obtained for the CMc and the CMi as follows: unfiltered, &gt; 50 kDa and &lt; 50 kDa.</p>

<title>Isolated Langendorff hearts</title>
<p>For beating heart experiments, hearts were removed from adult female Sprague Dawley rats (weighing 300–400 g) previously anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). The isolated hearts were placed in cold Tyrode’s solution (25 mM sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM glucose, 116 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM KCl, 2.5 mM Ca<sub>2</sub>Cl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. and cannulated through the aorta. The hearts were perfused in a retrograde manner with warm Tyrode’s solution (37°C) for 30 minutes. The heart rate data were collected using the isolated beating heart system (PowerLab ADInstruments, Sydney, NSW, Australia). The presence of a sinus rhythm, a heart rate (HR) greater than 160 bpm, a perfusion pressure higher than 30 mmHg, and a flow rate of 2–6 ml/min were considered to be stable values for all experiments (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, panel A).</p>

<p>The isolated hearts were perfused with conditioned media in accordance with a protocol consisting of three consecutive recirculation-reoxygenation cycles (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, panel B). During the first recirculation stage, 5 mL of deoxygenated MEM was perfused in a closed circuit at a flow rate of 6 mL/min. To avoid cardiac cell damage due to anoxia, a 2 mL/min parallel flow of oxygenated Tyrode’s solution was added, whereby a standard flow rate of 6 mL/min was achieved with partial oxygenation. During the second recirculation stage, the hearts were perfused with: 1) Vero cell lysate or &gt;50 kDa fraction (5 μg/mL) of 2) CMc (n = 5), 3) CMi (n = 8) and 4) CMi preincubated with serum samples of chagasic patients (n = 4), henceforth CMi+S. During the third stage, the hearts were perfused with MEM. Hearts in treatment received stabilization perfusion by one reoxygenation stage. The reoxygenation stage consisted of perfusing the heart with oxygenated Tyrode’s solution at a rate of 6 mL/min. All experiments were carried out under pression and perfusion controlled condition.</p>

<p>A panel of Venezuelan Chagas patients’ samples of a sera collection compiled from 2002 to 2006 by the Laboratory of Parasites Physiology and the Cardiology Service of Instituto de Medicina Tropical, Universidad Central de Venezuela, was used for physiological assays. Inclusion criteria were Chagas disease diagnosed by two distinct Chagas tests, serological diagnosis was made with Cruzi ELISA kit as recommended by the manufacturer [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a high conservation of DNA kinetoplast sequences (S35 5’-AAA TAA TGT ACG GG(T/G) GAG ATG CAT GA-32and S36 5’-GGG TTC GAT TGG GGT TGG TGT-3′) in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> allows detection of the parasite by means of an amplicon of 330 bp [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

<title>Measurement of enzyme activity</title>
<p>To demonstrate preservation of myocardial function <italic>ex vivo</italic> during recirculation-oxygenation process, we determined aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity by sampling the effusate. These activities were carried out in 10 μl aliquots of coronary effluent [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in order to provide indication of cardiac damage. The samples were collected at the end of each recirculation-reoxygenation cycle. Each sample was immediately stored at -20°C until the analysis was performed. The enzyme activity was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Invelab, Caracas, Venezuela) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>In order to quantify the relationships between continuous variables, QT, PR intervals and heart rate at the different experimental conditions, a Canonical Analysis of populations (CAP) were performed, then we performed a projection into a maximum information subspace which is known as canonical biplot analysis. CAP calculates the highest possible correlation between linear combinations of the values of studied variables, as within as between the a priori generated groups of individuals. Mean squared error (MSE), confidence interval and parameters functions was estimate on the parametric bootstrap methods for bias correction in linear mixed model (n = 250) [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

<title>Effect of conditioned medium fractions on ECG recordings</title>
<p>ECG recordings from hearts perfused with the different media are shown in <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The panels A, B, C, D and E represents the ECG recordings of five hearts, basal recording corresponds to the internal control condition of each ECG heart. The hearts were subjected to three-recirculation and reoxygenation cycles (see <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g001" ref-type="fig">fig. 1B</xref>). The recordings corresponding to the perfusion of hearts with either Vero cell lysate (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) or CMc (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) did not show significant change at any stage of perfusion. In hearts perfused with CMi (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and 2D</xref>), a complete AV block with prolonged asystole was observed, together with an episode of ventricular fibrillation.

Also, a partial reversion was observed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> cycle, and a total reversion was achieved with Tyrode perfusion (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). We did not observe any abnormal cardiac conduction effects in the ECG recordings taken from hearts perfused with the &lt;50 kDa fractions. It is known that the parasites secrete several bioactive lipids and glycolipids, thus lipid compounds were removed from conditioned medium and tested, and did not observe any abnormal cardiac conductions effect.</p>

<p>The adjusted linear mixed models (LMMs) shows that significant differences between conditions, times and its interaction (p≤0.05). The lowest heart rate percentage was found for the CMi and the highest for CMc. The average heart rate corresponds to 94.21 ± 1.16; 135.77 ± 1.18 and 150.61 ± 0.78 percent’s, for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (see <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The comparison from CMi curve with Boltzmann model shows, in group 1, a significant decrease of initial HR parameter. These alterations, especially bradycardia, may be related to AV blockade observed in EGC (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Remarkably, these changes were reversed during the reoxygenation stage of the same heart (Fig <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">2C and 2D</xref>) and/or by incubation of CMi+S (Figs. <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the Boltzmann analysis shows discrete changes of inflection times in hearts perfused with CMi and CMi+S, suggesting a HR recovery delayed effect during the early re-oxygenation stage probably related to immunogenic proteins (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, Groups 2 and 3). Also, we found difference between the initial HR values in the recirculation cycle in Cmi, this result suggests an involvement of secreted proteins in bradycardia. This bradycardia was independent of the QT interval over 450 s (Figs. <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g003" ref-type="fig">3A and 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>The Figs. <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g003" ref-type="fig">3B and 3C</xref> show the QT and PR segments estimated from EGC of isolated hearts perfused with CMc, CMi and CMi+S. This estimation was carried out over 2700 s. In both, QT and PR segments by LMMs adjusted analysis showed that condition CMi had the most variability observed compared with control condition (p≤0.05). The lowest QT interval was found for the CMi+S and the highest for CMi. The highest PR interval was observed was found for the CMi. This model demonstrates a sinusoidal behavior that cannot be associated with a tendency towards an increased PR interval (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In developing countries a proportion of chagasic patients die undiagnosed. Developing models to understand the pathophysiology of this disease and test new therapies are necessaries. The role of the secretome of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> has been gaining attention. Traditional use of secretome protein in serodiagnosis, i.e. antigenic proteins detection by ELISA test called Trypomastigote Excreted-Secreted Antigens (TESA). There are currently no studies which associate <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> secretome proteins as biomarkers for cardiac arrhythmias in Chagas cardiomyopathy. Recently, Wen et al (2012) [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] resolved the proteome signature of high and low abundance serum proteins in chagasic patients demonstrating the serum oxidative and inflammatory response profile, and serum detection of cardiac proteins parallels the pathologic events contributing to Chagas disease development. In this manuscript, we established a reproducible model using a recirculation-reoxygenation protocol that resembles the early interactions that occur between parasite secretome with cardiac cells. We found that CMi induces a biological effect on healthy, isolated beating rat heart model similar to those observed in Chagas patients. These effects may be related to the direct interaction of proteins into CM on heart cells. Some authors have demonstrated the persistence of the parasite in chronic lesions in patients [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which reinforces the hypothesis that tissue damage is related to cellular parasitism <italic>in vivo</italic>. The detection of significant neuronal cell loss in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems of Chagas cases, in the absence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi in situ</italic>, is the basis for the hypothesis of factors released from the parasite nest hidden somewhere in the host body, producing cell damage. [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, there is good <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for autoantibodies against neuroreceptors (beta-adrenergic and muscarinic) in Chagas disease [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the role of the secretome fractions of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> co-cultured with Vero cells on cardiac arrhythmias using an isolated beating rat heart model. We observed bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation and complete atrioventricular block in hearts during perfusion with &gt;50 kDa CMi. The antigenicity of the secreted proteins was tested by Western blotting using chagasic patient’s sera. The effects observed in this <italic>in vitro</italic> heart model are different from the results observed in autoimmunity studies [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], since we detected that immunogenic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-secreted proteins was able alter cardiac function independent of a systemic immune response. It should be noted that chagasic patient’s sera preincubation abolished the observed effects when the hearts were perfused with &gt;50 kDa proteins CMi, confirming the relationship between cardiovascular alterations, the immunogenic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-secreted proteins and its correlation with arrhythmias in Chagas disease.</p>
<p>We have previously [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that cardiac damage can be estimated based on the amount of AST released into the coronary effluent. In the present study, we carried out serial AST enzymatic measurements as an internal control. The enzymatic activity remained stable through the recirculation-reoxygenation protocol, indicating lack of induced myocardial tissue damage.</p>
<p>The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> invasion has been linked to the interaction of parasite membrane glycoproteins with cellular ligands and their associated signaling pathways [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Several members of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi-</italic>mucin family (TcMuc) have been linked to the process of invasion and to the increase in intracellular calcium concentration in particular. The secretion of MASP52, a member of the mucin associated protein (MASPs) family, has been associated with parasite attachment and with parasite invasion of Vero cells [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A recent report characterized the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> secretome obtained from medium conditioned by culturing the epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote forms under axenic conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], in this study, it was demonstrated that proteins are shed in vesicles and that 3.8% of the secreted proteins are involved in parasite-cell interactions. The study identified the surface glycoprotein GP90, MASP52, trans-sialidase, and an 82 kDa glycoprotein, along with additional proteins, as being secreted by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>Cruzi</italic> (<xref rid="pntd.0003512.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Ventricular arrhythmias in Chagas patients’ are related to calcium overload [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accordingly the relationship between proteins secreted by the parasite and the regulation of intracellular calcium levels could provide insight into the arrhythmias observed in isolated beating hearts perfused with high molecular weight <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> proteins. Previously, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> GP82, [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] GP90 and GP35/50 proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have been described as involved in both the modulation of calcium increase in the host cell and in determining the invasiveness of the parasite strain. Our group [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], demonstrated that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-conditioned medium was able to increase the frequency of occurrence of tachyarrhythmia and cause a decrease in the heart rate during post-ischemic recovery. A novel approach recently reported by Elliott et al [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> cathepsin-L supernatant disturbs the heart electrical activity, leading ventricular premature complex (which cause palpitations) and triggers arrhythmias in whole rat heart. In the present work, we observed a reversible ventricular fibrillation and a total AV block associated with bradycardia in a non-damage-inducing protocol, the effect was reversed by incubating the infected conditioned medium with chagasic patient’s serum, confirming that a direct interaction between the parasite secreted proteins and cardiomyocytes exist in the pathophysiology of Chagas cardiomyopathy. It is plausible that pro-arrhythmogenic proteins secreted or released by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> could act as enhancers causing the cardiac conduction system to cross an arrhythmic threshold in Chagas patients. This is the first report that implicates proteins secreted by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> with arrhythmias in an <italic>ex-vivo</italic> model.</p>
<p>We obtained a reproducible pattern of antigenic recognition of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-secreted proteins by patient’s sera suggesting that immunogenic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-secreted proteins are implicated with arrhythmias in Chagas disease. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> proteins could be used as virulence markers in the prognosis of the arrhythmias in Chagas patients.</p>
<p>To support the secretome proteins interaction a statistical analysis was carried out in order to quantify the relationships between continuous variables, QT and PR intervals and heart rates at the different experimental conditions (CMc, CMi and CMi+S). We decided to perform a Canonical Analysis of Populations (CAP). This methodology is used to project in a biplot simultaneously the structure of the <italic>a priori</italic> generated groups and the variables responsible for the separation between them. The CAP is used to obtain canonical axis that reflects the maximum separation between groups, not between individuals.</p>
<p>This statistical method has been used in other fields such as econometrics, and recently it has been used in biological systems was reported [<xref rid="pntd.0003512.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this type of analysis there are two assumptions that should be tested, 1) the mean vectors of the groups must be significantly different. This assumption is evaluated by the study of global contrast based on Wilk’s Lambda (L) which turned out to be statistically significant 132.0474 with a p-value of 4.3475e-31. 2) the variances-covariances of the variables of the groups must be equal. The three variances-covariances matrices turned out to be singular which means that the variables have linear relation between them so it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the system by eliminating variables. This was corroborated by the fact that with two dimensions we can explain almost 100% of the system variance, but it is important to remark that despite of the high quantity of redundant variables, they were ignored because of the use of Mahalanobis distance.</p>
<p>Canonical analysis of populations proved that 87.27% of the variables were represented with a quality above 50% and, 100% of the individuals were represented with a quality above 85%. This methodology permits us to elucidate two important aspects, first, we demonstrate that with just 16 variables we can explain over the 80% of the information and 13 of them are heart rate variables and the other three are PR variables. This means that the infection phenomena relative to the secretome proteins generated by the host-pathogen interaction could be successfully followed in time just by studying the heart rate. Besides not all time-points are necessary, just the mentioned above. Second, the group projections in the biplot analysis are in agreement with the results shown in Figs, <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">2 and 3</xref>, mainly in <xref rid="pntd.0003512.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> which we can see the heart rate kinetics. We can infer that there is a significant recovery from bradycardia when the conditioned infected medium were mixed with chagasic patients serum, in other words the secretome proteins could be responsible for the heart dysfunction observed. We are already working on identifying the proteins of the secretome and how are their relationships with the dysfunction of the heart.</p>
<p>The contribution of this study was to evaluate, in an isolated heart model, the arrhythmogenic role of the parasite secretome proteins. This reproducible recirculation-reoxygenation model can be an useful system to investigate new drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease arrhythmias. The dissection and simplification of a complex system as constituting Chagas infection becomes necessary to understand and control the disease, in this sense, we wanted to contribute with a simplistic model which evaluates arrhythmogenic factors. This work represents a heuristic contribution to the study of arrhythmias produced by immunogenic proteins secreted by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro</italic>. The findings of this study provide a glimpse into the role of this parasite’s secretome in the pathogenesis of the Chagas’ disease.</p>
