<abstract>
<p>Adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP) is an important phosphate metabolite abundantly found in <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> bacilli. This pathogen does not derive ATP from its host but has its own mechanism for the generation of ATP. Interestingly, this molecule as well as several antigenic proteins act as bio-markers for the detection of leprosy. One such bio-marker is the 18 kDa antigen. This 18 kDa antigen is a small heat shock protein (HSP18) whose molecular chaperone function is believed to help in the growth and survival of the pathogen. But, no evidences of interaction of ATP with HSP18 and its effect on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18 are available in the literature. Here, we report for the first time evidences of “HSP18-ATP” interaction and its consequences on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18. TNP-ATP binding experiment and surface plasmon resonance measurement showed that HSP18 interacts with ATP with a sub-micromolar binding affinity. Comparative sequence alignment between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 and αB-crystallin identified the sequence 49KADSLDIDIE58 of HSP18 as the Walker-B ATP binding motif. Molecular docking studies revealed that β4-β8 groove/strands as an ATP interactive region in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18. ATP perturbs the tertiary structure of HSP18 mildly and makes it less susceptible towards tryptic cleavage. ATP triggers exposure of additional hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18 and induces more stability against chemical and thermal denaturation. <italic>In vitro</italic> aggregation and thermal inactivation assays clearly revealed that ATP enhances the chaperone function of HSP18. Our studies also revealed that the alteration in the chaperone function of HSP18 is reversible and is independent of ATP hydrolysis. As the availability and binding of ATP to HSP18 regulates its chaperone function, this functional inflection may play an important role in the survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> in hosts.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> is the causative organism of the disease so called leprosy. It posses global health challenge due to the emergence of drug resistant <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> bacilli. In search for new drug targeting strategies, study of bacterial energy metabolism is significant. Reports claim that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> generates ATP, an important energy metabolite, which is very much required for its own biochemical activities and unlike other organisms, it needn’t require host species as a source of ATP. The growth and survival of these pathogenic bacteria in infected hosts are supported by an immunodominant antigenic membrane protein called HSP18. Hereby we report for the first time evidences of HSP18 and ATP interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> and quantified the same. We also identified the Walker-B ATP binding motif in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18. Our study reveals that HSP18 when interacts with ATP, undergoes an enhancement in its anti-aggregation property. We demonstrate here a novel report on ability of HSP18 to prevent thermal inactivation of enzymes which is also enhanced in presence of ATP. Our study provides new insights into the effect of ATP on the structure and chaperone function of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 which may be critical for survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> bacilli. This may provide a new basis for the development of new drug targeting strategy such as ATP competitive antibiotics/inhibitors in context of effective treatment of leprosy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>) HSP18 is an immunodominant antigen and membrane bound protein [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is specifically activated during intracellular growth and is involved in the survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> pathogen within macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, HSP18 is a class 3 (acr 3) heat shock protein (HSP) [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and shares high degree of sequence homology with homologs of class 3 small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) found in other mycobacterial species [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similar to all sHSPs, its sequence has been divided into three distinct regions: N-terminal region comprising residues 1–38, a highly conserved central “α-crystallin domain” comprising residues 39–121 and a flexible C-terminal tail with residues 122–148 [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, we have shown that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 is a major β-sheet protein and exist as an oligomeric assembly (29-mer) [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Along with others, we have also shown that it can exhibit molecular chaperone function [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that HSP18 can prevent the aggregation of different stressed client proteins and refold chemically denatured enzymes to its native state [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is believed that the molecular chaperone function of HSP18 may play a crucial role in the long term survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> pathogen in infected hosts [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> is an intracellular obligatory parasite that is non-culturable <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. So, it is difficult to get an idea about its pathophysiology. Therefore, several attempts were made to understand its energy metabolism which would give an idea about its nutritional requirements and its relation with its host species. Lee and his coworkers revealed that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> generates its own ATP when incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They further confirmed that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> did not derive ATP from the host species as it was unable to uptake exogenous ATP during <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation. Another report by the same group clearly demonstrated the presence of adenyl kinase, an enzyme that catalyses the reaction 2 ADP ⇆ ATP + AMP, in cell free extracts of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This confirms that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> has its own mechanism to generate ATP which is very much required for its own biochemical activities and unlike other organisms, it does not require host species as a source of ATP.</p>
<p>ATP is an important small molecule, which readily stores chemical energy in two of its phosphate bonds. Its role in altering the molecular chaperone function of heat shock proteins is well documented. Many important classical chaperones of large heat shock protein family function in an ATP dependent way [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where its hydrolysis is required for chaperone mediated refolding of substrate proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast, the role of ATP on the chaperone function of sHSPs is controversial. Mostly, many sHSPs are usually believed to be ATP independent chaperones [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. But, recently it has been demonstrated that the structure and chaperone function of different sHSPs are modulated by ATP. Quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, perturbation in the surface hydrophobicity and tryptic digestion studies have revealed that ATP induces conformational changes in α-crystallin and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> HSP16.3 [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which eventually enhances their chaperone function [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, experiments with tobacco HSP18 have shown that ATP has an opposite effect. It reduces chaperone activity of this small heat shock protein [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Decreased surface hydrophobicity appears to be responsible for such ATP effect.</p>
<p>Recently, autophosphorylation of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 has been shown by Dharmalingam and his co-workers [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They proposed that such autophosphorylation may be the basis for the survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> under various stressed conditions. Interestingly, leprosy patients are often investigated for viability of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> by PCR method where this 18 kDa gene is used as target and ATP assay method [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As HSP18 is harbored by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> pathogen; there is a possibility that this small heat shock protein is also exposed to such intracellular ATP environment. But, the information about the interaction between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 and ATP has not been reported in the literature. Moreover, if HSP18 interacts with ATP, its effect on the structure and chaperone function of this mycobacterial sHSP is yet to be explored.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified the location of ATP binding in HSP18 using molecular docking studies. Subsequently, we quantified the interaction between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 and ATP using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and TNP-ATP binding experiments. We have also investigated the effect of ATP on the structure and chaperone function of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18. We report here that ATP improves the chaperone function of HSP18. Besides, we account here the molecular basis behind the enhanced chaperone activity of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 in the presence of ATP using several biochemical and biophysical studies.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of recombinant <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18</title>
<p>Plasmid was obtained as a gift from Prof. Dharmalingham (Madurai Kamraj University, Madurai, India). Methods of expression and purification of wild-type <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 have been described previously [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Concentration of HSP18 was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 278 nm using extinction coefficient of 0.4 (mg/ml)<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>. Concentration of this protein was also determined using Bradford assay. All the biophysical assays were performed with at least three independent protein preparations.</p>

<title>Binding of TNP-ATP to HSP18</title>
<p>HSP18 (2.5 μM) was incubated with equimolar concentration of TNP-ATP in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 1 hr. at 25°C. Fluorescence emission spectra of this incubation mixture were recorded between 500–600 nm at 25°C using a spectrofluorometer from Horiba Jobin Mayer, USA (Fluoromax 4P). To the above assay mixture, 0.25 mM ATP was added and fluorescence intensity of TNP-ATP bound HSP18 complex was also measured. The excitation wavelength used was 403 nm. The excitation and emission band-passes were 5 nm each. Data were collected at 0.5 nm wavelength resolution.</p>
<p>In an another experiment, HSP18 (2.5 μM) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was titrated with 300 μM TNP-ATP. This fluorescence intensity of bound TNP-ATP was recorded at 538 nm with an excitation wavelength 403 nm using the same spectrofluorometer mentioned above. The temperature of the samples was maintained at 25°C by using a circulating water bath attached to the spectrofluorimeter. A reverse titration was also performed with 0.1 μM of TNP-ATP titrated against 2.5 mg/ml HSP18. This reverse titration was used to convert the fluorescence intensity change into bound TNP-ATP, similar to an approach taken by Cardamone and Puri for reverse titration of bis-ANS with porcine somatotrophin [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To calculate the number of TNP-ATP molecules bound per molecule of monomeric HSP18 (n) and the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for the interaction between TNP-ATP and HSP18, these forward and reverse titration data were analysed by the Scatchard equation:

<title>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements</title>
<p>Surface plasmon resonance of carboxymethyl-dextran coupled HSP18 was measured using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Briefly, carboxymethyl-dextran (CM5) sensor chips were activated using equimolar amounts of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride for 7 min (Amine Coupling Kit; Biacore). <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 (0.075 mg/ml) was coupled to the chip in a buffer containing 10 mM acetate (pH 4.5) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. To deactivate any unreacted esters and to remove any remaining unbound protein, the surface of the flow cell was then blocked with ethanolamine for 7 min. A second flow cell was activated and deactivated in the same way to yield a blank surface. All analyte solutions (adenine nucleotides—AMP, ADP, ATP and ATP-γS) were prepared in degassed, filter-sterilized PBS buffer with or without 3.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The same solution was used as running buffer during binding experiments. For the binding of adenine nucleotides with immobilized HSP18, the concentration of adenine nucleotides was varied between 0.1 μM and 100 μM. The binding was carried out at 25°C with a flow rate of 30 ml/min, and data were collected for 180 s of association and 180 s of dissociation. After the completion of the dissociation step, surface regeneration was accomplished with a 1 mini injection of 10 mM glycine HCl solution pH 2.5 at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. To analyze the data, the assay flow cell was subtracted by the control (blank) flow cell to eliminate non-specific interaction. K<sub>d</sub> was calculated by BIACORE T200 evaluation software with nonlinear fitting, the 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Large HSPs interact differently with adenine nucleotides (specifically towards ATP). DnaK and Cpn60 bind ATP with the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) values of 0.22 and 10 μM, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Several other large HSPs including HSP70, HSP104 and ClpB, which exhibit chaperone function in an ATP dependent way, bind ATP/other adenine nucleotides with dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) values in sub-micromolar range [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Though ATP influences the chaperone function of several sHSPs, their interaction with ATP is scarcely characterized/quantified in the literature. Palmisano <italic>et al</italic>. reported that α-crystallin interacts with ATP with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) value of ~128 μM (K<sub>a</sub> = 7.84 x 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

<title>TNP-ATP, a fluorescent ATP analog, binds to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18</title>
<p>In this study, we used TNP-ATP, a fluorescent ATP analog, for investigating the binding affinity/interaction of ATP with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18. This probe is commonly used for examining the nucleotide binding of various proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Structural characterization of the probe bound to different bacterial histidine kinases has revealed that TNP-ATP occupies their nucleotide-binding pocket/domain [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Free TNP-ATP exhibits very weak fluorescence in buffer solutions. But when it binds to proteins, its fluorescence intensity increases several folds [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We observed that the fluorescence intensity of 2.5μM TNP-ATP increases ~6 fold in the presence of equimolar concentration of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18, with a λ<sub>max</sub> of 538 nm (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, trace 2). ATP can efficiently displace TNP-ATP from the nucleotide binding pocket in protein: TNP-ATP complexes, resulting in decrease of TNP-ATP fluorescence which was also observed in case of HSP18. When 0.25 mM ATP was added to the HSP18-TNP-ATP complex at 25°C, significant reduction in TNP-ATP fluorescence intensity was observed (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, trace 3). We also titrated HSP18 (2.5 μM) with increasing concentration of TNP-ATP (0–10μM) (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The titration curve indicated that the fluorescence intensity of TNP-ATP bound to protein increased gradually upon the addition of TNP-ATP in the solution and the titration curve reached saturation upon the addition of ~8 μM TNP-ATP. In order to determine the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) and the stoichiometry of binding (n) of TNP-ATP per mol of HSP18 subunit, the binding data were analyzed by the Scatchard equation (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>). Prior to this analysis, a reverse titration of TNP-ATP by HSP18 was performed to convert the fluorescence intensity change into bound TNP-ATP.

<title>Estimation of binding affinity of ATP and other nucleotides (AMP, ADP and ATP-γS) using SPR technique</title>
<p>To get the idea about the binding affinity of ATP and other adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP and ATP-γS) precisely, we performed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments.

In order to explore this functionality of HSP18 and to assess whether ATP altered its ability to prevent thermal deactivation of enzymes, we incubated 10 nM MDH for 10 mins at 43°C and measured its activity. <xref rid="pntd.0003661.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> shows that MDH alone quickly lost its activity and retained only 39% activity. However, in the presence of HSP18 (30 μM), the loss of MDH activity was reduced and it retained 61% of its enzymatic activity. When 0.01–1 mM ATP was added to the assay mixture along with 30 μM HSP18, the loss of MDH activity was further retarded and MDH was able to retain 68% to 90% of its activity. Marginal improvement in the retention of MDH activity was observed upon the addition of HSP18 and higher amount of ATP (2 and 3 mM). To check the specificity, a parallel experiment was executed where HSP18 was replaced with BSA and was incubated in absence and presence of 0.01–3 mM ATP. It was found that, unlike HSP18, BSA failed to prevent the thermal inactivation of MDH under similar experimental conditions (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that like other HSPs, HSP18 also has the ability to prevent thermal deactivation of enzyme. Also, our data indicated that ATP enhanced this ability of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregation and thermal deactivation assays revealed that the enhancement in the chaperone function of HSP18 was saturated in presence of 1 mM ATP.

<title>HSP18 does not require ATP hydrolysis for its enhanced chaperone function</title>

<p>Once it was confirmed that ATP altered the chaperone function of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18, effect of ATP interaction on the conformation of this sHSP was examined. Tryptophan fluorescence, near- &amp; far-UV CD and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques were used to determine whether the altered chaperone function was accompanied by any changes in tertiary, secondary and quaternary structure/conformation of the protein. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of HSP18 decreased slightly (~7.5%) in presence of 1 mM ATP (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) which implied that tryptophan microenvironment was mildly perturbed due to the ATP interaction.

<title>HSP18 becomes less susceptible towards tryptic cleavage in presence of ATP</title>
<p>To achieve more knowledge about the conformational changes induced in HSP18 by ATP, we performed the trypsin digestion experiment. The SDS-PAGE profile of tryptic digestion products of HSP18 in absence or presence of 1 mM ATP at different digestion times using a 1:100 (w/w) ratio of trypsin to chaperone were shown in <xref rid="pntd.0003661.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>. Trypsin considerably digested HSP18 after 120 min. in absence of ATP (lane 9), but the digestibility of HSP18 by trypsin retarded in presence of 1 mM ATP (lane 10). Moreover, densitometry analysis of trypsin mediated HSP18 cleavage experiment showed that, ~43% HSP18 cleavage occurred in absence of ATP even after 30 min digestion, while only 14% cleavage of HSP18 happened in presence of 1 mM ATP at the same time point (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>).

<title>ATP induces additional exposure of hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18</title>
<p>Tryptophan fluorescence and trypsin digestion experiments suggested that ATP exerted the conformational changes in HSP18. Apart from these conformational changes, the alteration in the surface hydrophobicity of HSP18 in presence of ATP was also determined. Both large and small HSPs bind aggregation prone substrate proteins through the available hydrophobic patches at the surface and it is generally believed that surface hydrophobicity governs the chaperone function of these HSPs [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Additionally, several reports in the literature showed that the enhancement in the chaperone function of sHSPs is often accompanied by increased surface hydrophobicity [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The surface hydrophobicity of HSP18 in absence and presence of 1 mM ATP/ATP-γS was estimated using bis-ANS. This hydrophobic probe has been widely used for probing the hydrophobic sites of several HSPs. We observed that the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to "ATP (0.01 mM) incubated HSP18" was ~ 16% higher compared to that of HSP18 alone (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, trace 2). In presence of 1 mM ATP, the bound bis-ANS fluorescence intensity was increased further (~33%) (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, trace 3). We also observed similar enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to HSP18 in presence of 1 mM ATP-γS (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, trace 4). Moreover, when we depleted the ATP from the solution by dialysis, the fluorescence intensity of bound bis-ANS reversed back and the magnitude was almost identical to the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to HSP18 alone (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, traces 5–6). Altogether, our results confirmed that surface hydrophobicity of HSP18 was enhanced on interaction with ATP which resulted an increase in its chaperone activity. A similar explanation is also applicable for the enhanced chaperone activity of HSP18 in presence of ATP-γS. Furthermore, this conformational change is ATP hydrolysis independent and is reversible in nature. We also noticed that the change in the chaperone function of HSP18 in presence of ATP is also reversible in nature (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). This appears to be due to a reversible change in the surface hydrophobicity of HSP18.</p>

<title>ATP binding enhances the structural stability of HSP18 against thermal and chemical denaturation</title>
<p>Since ATP triggered exposure of additional hydrophobic sites on the surface of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18, it was a genuine curiosity that, whether this additional exposure of hydrophobic sites was caused by the formation of a molten globule-like intermediate structure or by the reorganization of hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18. A molten globule is typically a partially unfolded intermediate state of a protein, with a native-like secondary structure but grossly perturbed/disordered tertiary structure and a significant exposure of hydrophobic surface [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although, HSP18 possess native-like secondary structure in presence of ATP, the mild perturbation in the tertiary structure upon ATP interaction denies the chances of formation of molten globule-like structure of HSP18 in presence of ATP. Also, the formation of this partially unfolded molten globule-like structure would have decreased the structural stability of HSP18. But, the resistance towards the trypsin digestion in presence of ATP (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) indicated that ATP possibly made the structure of HSP18 more compact or stable.

where F<sub>N</sub>, F<sub>I</sub> and F<sub>U</sub> are the fluorescence intensities for 100% native, 100% intermediate and 100% unfolded forms, respectively. ΔG<sub>1</sub>° represents the standard free energy change between native (N) and the intermediate (I) forms, and ΔG<sub>2</sub>° represents the standard free energy change between the intermediate (I) and unfolded (U) forms. ΔG°, which is the sum of ΔG<sub>1</sub>° and ΔG<sub>2</sub>°, represents the standard free energy change of unfolding (between the N and U forms) at zero urea concentration. The standard free energy change of HSP18 in absence of ATP at 25°C was 20.77 kJ/mol (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In presence of 1 mM ATP, the ΔG° value for HSP18 was increased to 24.78 kJ/mol, suggesting an increase in the thermodynamic stability by ~4 kJ/mol. Though this difference is small but reproducible. Both chemical and thermal denaturation experiments further excluded the possibility of formation of molten globule-like structure of HSP18 in presence of ATP. Rather, ATP interaction gave rise to an energetic ladder of higher stability which is not far from the native state and has originated due to the native state minor fluctuations. Some researchers also observed the formation of such energetic ladder in various proteins. Specific mutations in T4 lysozyme produced energetic ladder [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similarly, interaction of α-crystallin with ATP also formed energetic ladder [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In both cases, creation of energetic ladder with slightly higher stability improved the chaperone function of α-crystallin. Therefore, we can conclude that higher structural stability of HSP18 upon ATP interaction is a basis for the enhancement of its chaperone function.</p>

<title>Determination of Walker-B ATP binding motif and probable ATP binding sites in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18</title>
<p>Finally, we took an attempt to get an idea about the “ATP binding motif” in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18. Previously, Ghosh <italic>et al</italic>. reported the “ATP binding motif” in human αB-crystallin [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Comparative sequence alignment of αB-crystallin with 19 ATP binding proteins, identified the sequence, <sub>82</sub>KHFSPEELKVKVLGD<sub>96</sub> as the Walker-B ATP binding motif which lies in the “α-crystallin domain” of αB-crystallin. Interestingly, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 also belongs to small heat shock protein family and possess an “α-crystallin domain” (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.). Sequence homology between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 and αB-crystallin showed that they share ~51% sequence similarity. Besides, “α-crystallin domain” of both the proteins was found to share ~57% sequence similarity (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.). Therefore, primary sequence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 was aligned and compared with that of αB-crystallin, which contained the Walker-B ATP binding motif, R/K/H-X<sub>2-10</sub>-O-X-O-D/E, where X is any amino acid and O is any hydrophobic amino acid (A/C/G/F/I/L/M/V/W). Based on sequence similarity, the sequence <sub>49</sub>KADSLDIDIE<sub>58</sub> of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 in its “α-crystallin domain” has been identified as the Walker-B ATP binding motif. The three dimensional structure of HSP18 (obtained through the homology modeling using coordinates of HSP16.9, PDB code: 1GME_A) indicated that part of this motif lies in β4 strand and is followed by a loop (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>), which is in agreement with the structure of Walker-B ATP binding motif found in different ATP binding proteins.</p>

<p>Since, we observe a high sequence similarity between αB-crystallin and HSP18, we hypothesized that the binding site for ATP in HSP18 would be similar to that of αB-crystallin. ATP usually binds to β4-β8 groove in αB-crystallin [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, first, the three dimensional structure of HSP18 was obtained through the homology modeling using coordinates of HSP16.9 (PDB code: 1GME_A) and was validated with the help of Ramachandran plot (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). <xref rid="pntd.0003661.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>. shows the distribution of phi (ϕ) and psi (ψ) angles of the protein, where majority of amino acid residues are found to be in allowed region. After successful validation of the structure of HSP18, docking of ATP was performed which revealed that ATP molecule binds to the similar groove/strands in HSP18 as was found in αB-crystallin. The terminal γ-phosphate group of ATP molecule interacts with the side chain of Ser105 which lies in β8 strand of HSP18 (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). On the other hand, the adenine moiety of the molecule was found to be in close proximity of Ile55 and Ile57 of Walker-B motif which reside in another β strand i.e. β4 strand (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). Moreover, side chains of few residues from β8 strand were found to be in close proximity to the α- and β-phosphate groups of ATP molecule. This figure also suggests that there is a possibility of hydrogen bonding between the side chains of Ser105 with γ-phosphate group of ATP, while the interaction between the adenine moiety of ATP molecule and Ile55/Ile57/Leu113 is hydrophobic in nature. The docking studies also showed that hydrogen bonding may also be possible between the carbonyl group of main chain of Ile102 residue and the hydroxyl group of sugar moiety of ATP (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). During docking studies, we also estimated the total energy (potential and kinetic energy) of HSP18 in absence and presence of ATP. The total energy for the protein was found to be −2.8 × 10<sup>4</sup> kJ/mol, whereas the total energy for docked complex was found to be −3.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> kJ/mol. These results suggested that the structure of HSP18 is stabilized upon the interaction with ATP, which is in agreement with the findings of our thermal and chemical denaturation experiments (Figs. <xref rid="pntd.0003661.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0003661.g011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Recently, Biswas and his coworkers showed that acetylation of γD crystallin destabilized its structural stability and was accompanied with lower potential energy compared to that of wild type γD-crystallin [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Additionally, we also took an attempt to understand how the local environments near to the ATP binding sites (<sub>49</sub>KADSLDIDIE<sub>58</sub> which contains residues of β4 strand and <sub>102</sub>ILASYQE<sub>108</sub> which contains residues of β8 strand) are modulated upon ATP binding. We estimated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of each residue of these two stretches (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Before addition of ATP, the total SASA for hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in <sub>49</sub>KADSLDIDIE<sub>58</sub> were 196.58 and 541.07 Å<sup>2</sup> for full residue, respectively, while the same for side chain were 105.09 and 505.88 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In docked complex, the total SASA for hydrophobic residues in <sub>49</sub>KADSLDIDIE<sub>58</sub> was increased (230 and 141.65 Å<sup>2</sup> for full residue and side chain, respectively), while the same was decreased for hydrophilic residues (517.59 and 464.65 Å<sup>2</sup> for full residue and side chain, respectively). We observed the similar trend in the other stretch (<sub>102</sub>ILASYQE<sub>108</sub>) as well. Therefore, we can say that the hydrphobic nature of local environments increases upon ATP binding. In bis-ANS experiment, we also found that the availability of hydrophobic patches at the surface of oligomeric HSP18 enhances in presence of ATP (<xref rid="pntd.0003661.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Overall, these theoretical studies demonstrated that ATP binds to β4-β8 groove/strands in HSP18, but some parts of this small molecule are at the surface of the groove and thus exposed towards the solvent.</p>

<p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 interacts efficiently with ATP only, and not with ADP and AMP. ATP possibly binds to the β4-β8 groove/strands in HSP18 and the binding affinity of HSP18 towards ATP is moderate. This moderate interaction can be concluded from the fact that the binding between HSP18 and ATP is reversible in nature. As a result of such moderate reversible interaction, minor alterations in the conformational states and stabilization energy of the protein are observed which eventually gives rise to a thermodynamically distinct state, so called energy ladders. We believe that it is the ATP induced microscopic fluctuations and shifting of energy states of HSP18 trigger the exposure of additional hydrophobic sites at the surface of protein and thus improves its chaperone function. Several reports have revealed that the molecular chaperone function of HSP18 may play a vital role in the growth and survival of the pathogen in host macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Out of these reports, one study demonstrated that the expression level of HSP18 increases under different stressed conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient depletion, oxidative stress, thermal stress etc. [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the same paper, it has been shown that HSP18 could provide tolerance to cells under such stressed conditions. As reversible binding of ATP to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 enhances its chaperone function without any significant alteration in its conformations, such association process can be of significant importance in order to protect itself as well as the pathogen under several physiological stressed environments.</p>
<p>Recently, ATP-competitive inhibitors are widely used as drugs for the treatment of another tropical disease i.e. tuberculosis [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Wolfe <italic>et al</italic>. have used a probe based proteomics approach to find out ATP-binding proteome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, a causative organism of tuberculosis and identified 122 ATP-binding proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Most of these proteins are critical for the continued existence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and may be appropriate therapeutic targets for development of ATP-competitive antibiotics. Among these 122 proteins, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> HSP16.3, a class 1 small heat shock protein, also showed binding affinity towards ATP. Interestingly, the chaperone function of this protein is also enhanced in presence of ATP [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and it is generally believed that the chaperone function of HSP16.3 is important for the survival of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> pathogen in the latent stationary phase of tuberculosis [<xref rid="pntd.0003661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 possess ~55% sequence homology with HSP16.3 and its chaperone function also enhances in presence of ATP, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> HSP18 may possibly be an important therapeutic target in leprosy. Use of ATP competitive antibiotics/inhibitors especially against HSP18 could be of significant importance in context of the effective treatment of leprosy, but these aspects needs to explored extensively.</p>
