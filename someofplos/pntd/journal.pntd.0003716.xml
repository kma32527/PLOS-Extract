<title>Background</title>
<p>Bam32, a 32 kDa adaptor molecule, plays important role in B cell receptor signalling, T cell receptor signalling and antibody affinity maturation in germinal centres. Since antibodies against trypanosome variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) are critically important for control of parasitemia, we hypothesized that Bam32 deficient (Bam32-/-) mice would be susceptible to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense infection</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>We found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>-infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice successfully control the first wave of parasitemia but then fail to control subsequent waves and ultimately succumb to their infection unlike wild type (WT) C57BL6 mice which are relatively resistant. Although infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly higher hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, their serum AST and ALT levels were not different, suggesting that increased liver pathology may not be responsible for the increased susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>. Using direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> flow cytometry and ELISA, we show that CD4+ T cells from infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced significantly increased amounts of disease-exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines (including IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6). However, the percentages of regulatory T cells and IL-10-producing CD4+ cells were similar in infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice. While serum levels of parasite-specific IgM antibodies were normal, the levels of parasite-specific IgG, (particularly IgG1 and IgG2a) were significantly lower in Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice throughout infection. This was associated with impaired germinal centre response in Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice despite increased numbers of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Adoptive transfer studies indicate that intrinsic B cell defect was responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>African trypanosomiasis continues to be a major threat to human health and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite intense studies, the immunopathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. Understanding the factors that regulate disease pathogenesis would be important in designing effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we demonstrate that the B cell adaptor molecule, Bam32, contributes to optimum resistance to experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice because its deficiency negatively impacts optimal B cell responses including germinal centre formation and parasite-specific IgG responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, Bam32 deficiency significantly enhances proinflammatory cytokine production by splenic cells, suggesting that Bam32 may act as a negative regulator of cytokine gene expression following <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection. Collectively, these findings identify Bam32 as an indispensable molecule for optimal germinal centre formation, anti-trypanosome IgG antibody response and suppression of disease-promoting proinflammatory cytokines and its deficiency leads to inability to control <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>African trypanosomiasis, also called sleeping sickness in man, is a deadly disease of humans and livestock caused by blood parasites belonging to the genus <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>. In human, the disease is caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic>; whereas the animal form of the disease is primarily caused by <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> being the most important [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, an estimated 60 million people are at risk of getting the infection with 300,000 cases of the disease occurring annually [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, this is a gross under estimation because only about 10% of the cases are appropriately diagnosed and treated [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The animal form of the disease poses a huge agricultural and economic problem in the affected region due to reduced animal yield [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is estimated that elimination of the disease would spare Africa an estimated $4.5 billion yearly as a result of improved animal production [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The control of parasitemia and resistance to African trypanosomes in mice have been linked to early interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production, which is important for activating macrophages to produce nitric oxide that has both trypanostatic and trypanotoxic effects [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, IFN-γ is also important for production of optimal amounts and isotypes of parasite-specific IgG antibodies that are important for resistance via enhanced phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, uncontrolled production of IFN-γ and other proinflammatory cytokines (including tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], IL-6, IL-1β and IL-12) has been incriminated as the major cause of death in the highly susceptible mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the other hand, IL-10 plays a regulatory role in dampening the excessive proinflammatory cytokines produced during infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Bam32 is a 32 kDa B lymphocyte adaptor protein that plays an important role in B cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking-mediated downstream events [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and has been shown to be expressed in B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Bam32 has also been shown to be important in BCR internalization [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], BCR-induced signalling, B cell survival [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and antigen presentation [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Upon B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, Bam32 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and has been shown to be associated with phospholipase Cγ2 in human B cell lines [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, deficiency of Bam32 does not affect the development of B and T cells, but significantly impairs B cell proliferation following BCR cross linking [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Importantly, Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice also show reduced T-independent type two (TI-II) B cell responses [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and high susceptibility to <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection due to defective antibody response [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Bam32 is also implicated in T cell receptor signalling and regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cytokine production [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>A strong antibody response (especially IgG and its subclasses) resulting from germinal centre reaction is required for the clearance of many pathogens including African trypanosomes [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The germinal centre is an extensive area of B cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation, selection, and class switch recombination leading to production of various antibody isotypes with high antigen binding affinity [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Upon encountering their cognate antigen, B cells become activated and require help from other immune cells (especially CD4<sup>+</sup> follicular T helper cells and dendritic cells) to initiate germinal centre formation [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The follicular CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells (Tfh) provide signals to antigen-specific B cells that guide their survival, expansion or differentiation into high affinity antibody-producing cells. Thus, Tfh are indispensable for germinal centre response [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and hence for optimal antibody-mediated immunity.</p>
<p>Since antibodies and T cell cytokine production are both required for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> clearance in infected animals, we investigated the role of Bam32 in experimental African trypanosomiasis using Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our report shows than Bam32 deficiency leads to inability to control late waves of undulating parasitemia, increased production of disease exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells, impaired germinal centre B cell response and significantly lower serum levels of trypanosome specific IgG antibodies leading to early death in the otherwise relatively resistant strain of mice.</p>

CD1 mice were immunosuppressed intraperitoneally (i.p.) with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan; 200 mg/kg) and after two days, infected i.p. with TC13 stabilates [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Three days after infection, mice were deeply anaesthetized by isoflourane and blood was collected by cardiac puncture and parasites were purified by anion-exchange chromatography by passing through DEAE-cellulose chamber [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Eluted parasites were washed in Tris-saline glucose (TSG), counted, resuspended in TSG containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and diluted to the desired concentration (10<sup>4</sup>/ml).

<title>Cell culture, direct ex vivo staining and flow cytometry</title>
<p>Following sacrifice, the spleens were made into single-cell suspensions and contaminating red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer. Cells were washed 2 times with PBS, resuspended at final concentration of 4 x 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in complete tissue culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol L-glutamine, 100 U/mL Penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and plated at 1 mL/well in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon; VWR Edmonton, AB, Canada) in the presence or absence of whole trypanosome lysate (10<sup>6</sup>/ml parasite equivalent). After 3 days, the cell culture supernatant fluids were collected and stored at -20°C until analyzed for cytokines by ELISA. Some cells were directly stained <italic>ex-vivo</italic> for CD4 and CD25 expression and intracellularly for Foxp3 using the Tregs staining kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Germinal centre B cell response was assessed by staining splenic cells with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against B220, GL7 and Fas (all purchased from eBiosciensce). Antibodies against CD4, PD1 and ICOS (eBiosciensce) were used to assess T follicular helper cells response while antibodies against CD19, Fas, GL7, CD80 and PD-L2 were used to assess memory B cells. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with phorbol myristic acetate (PMA; 50 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL), and brefeldin A (BFA; 10 μg/mL) for 4 hrs and stained for CD4 surface expression and for intracellular cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-10) expression.

<title>Deficiency of Bam32 leads to enhanced susceptibility to experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection</title>
<p>C57BL/6 mice are considered relatively resistant to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection because they control several waves of undulating parasitemia and survive for more than 100 days post-infection before eventually dying [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit increased susceptibility to infection with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> due to failure to generate opsonising IgG antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we hypothesized that they will be susceptible to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection. Therefore, we infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice intraperitoneally with 10<sup>3</sup> <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> (TC13) and monitored parasitemia as well as survival period after infection. There were no differences in the prepatent period and level of parasitemia at the early phase of the infection between WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). However, Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed fulminating parasitemia towards the late phase of the infection and succumbed to the infection (mean survival time 58 <underline>±</underline> 9 days, <xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, all the WT mice survived with low parasitemia until day 80 when the experiment was terminated. These findings suggest that Bam32 molecule is important for effective control of parasitemia and survival in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>-infected mice.</p>

<title>Comparable serum levels of liver transaminases in infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> infection in mice is associated with hepato-splenomegaly and an accompanying increase serum levels of liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This marked hepato-splenomegaly has been variously linked with increased pathology, activation and expansion of the reticuloendothelial system [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and a compensatory extramedullary haematopoiesis [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, we determined whether there was a correlation between increased susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice and liver pathology. Prior to day 28 post-infection, the liver and spleen sizes of WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice were indistinguishable (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). However, from day 48 post-infection, the liver and spleens of infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice were significantly larger than those of their WT counterpart mice. The increase in liver and spleen sizes coincided with the onset of increased and uncontrolled parasitemia in the late phase of the infection in Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice (see <xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Interestingly, despite the significantly larger spleen and liver sizes in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice, there was no difference in serum levels of ALT (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and AST (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>) between infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that the hepatomegaly may not be associated with significant liver pathology and may not be directly responsible for the early death of infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>

<title>Enhanced production of disease exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that susceptibility to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice is associated with the production of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ) by spleen cells from infected mice leading to increased serum levels of the cytokines, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and death [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice had higher and uncontrolled late phase parasitemia and succumbed to the infection significantly earlier than their infected WT counterpart mice (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), we hypothesized that the levels of these cytokines would be significantly higher than those of WT mice. Throughout the infection, the levels of IFN-γ (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), TNF-α (B) and IL-6 (C) in culture supernatant fluids of splenocytes from infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice were significantly (p &lt; 0.05–0.01) higher than those from WT mice, with the difference being more pronounced towards the time infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice were unable to control parasitemia. Interestingly, there was no significant change in the secretion of IL-10 (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in dampening systemic inflammatory response syndrome, leading to survival in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>-infected mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This pattern of cytokine response was also observed by intracellular cytokine staining where we found that the percentages and absolute numbers of IFN-γ (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E, 2H and 2I</xref>) and TNF-α (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F, 2J and 2K</xref>)-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from spleens of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> infected mice were significantly higher than those from infected WT mice. Interestingly and consistent with the ELISA data, the percentages of IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were not different between WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice, although the absolute numbers were higher than those from WT mice (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G, 2L and 2M</xref>), which could be due to higher splenomegaly during the late stage of infection (see <xref rid="pntd.0003716.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).

<p>Although the preceding observations strongly suggest that impaired B cells responses may be primarily responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to infection, it is plausible that other cells may also be important. This is because the Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice used in our studies are globally deficient in Bam32 signalling in other immune cells including T cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to investigate the role of Bam32, a B cell adaptor molecule critical for BCR signalling and antibody responses, in experimental African Trypanosomiasis in mice. We found that deficiency of Bam32 results in failure to control parasitemia during the chronic phase of the disease, leading to significantly decreased survival in an otherwise relatively resistant strain of mice. This was associated with increased production of disease-exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-16 and TNF-α), impaired production of parasite-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies and failure to sustain strong germinal centre responses during the chronic phase of infection. Since effective clearance of parasitemia is mediated by IgG antibodies against the variant surface glycoprotein and common antigens [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and death of infected mice is usually associated with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, it is conceivable that impaired production of IgG antibodies and high production of proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the contribution of Bam32 in resistance to a protozoan parasite.</p>
<p>The susceptibility to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice has been associated with several factors, including immunosuppression [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], systemic inflammatory response syndrome resulting from cytokine storm [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], impaired antibody response [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], induction of regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and hepatotoxicity particularly during the chronic phase of the disease [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We found that infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice were unable to control chronic (late stage) parasitemia and show shorter survival time than their wild type counterpart mice and this was associated with significantly increased splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. However, serum levels of ALT and AST were not different, suggesting that hepatotoxicity may not account for the increased susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection. Interestingly, cells from infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced significantly higher amounts of disease exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines (including IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6), suggesting that the uncontrolled production of these cytokines may be related to death of infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Studies on the role of Bam32 in proinflammatory cytokine production are limited. A study by Sommers et al showed that Bam32 deficiency does not affect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and their production of IL-17 and TNF-α. However and consistent with our results, there was a trend of increased IFN-γ following polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that spleen cells from infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced significantly higher amount of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6) following <italic>in vitro</italic> restimulation, suggesting that Bam32 might act as a negative regulator of these cytokines in the context of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection. The differences in the effects of Bam32 deficiency on cytokine production might be related to differences in the experimental models. The studies of Sommers et al focused primarily on T cells from uninfected mice following polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs whereas our studies were carried out under parasitic infection condition using unfractionated spleen cells. Splenic and hepatic macrophages are producers of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-6 and TNF-α) [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and plastic-adherent T cells that exhibit macrophage-like properties are the major producers of IFN-γ in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>-infected mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is conceivable that signalling via Bam32 suppresses cytokine production in immune cells. In line with this, we found that the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from μMT mice that received Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> B cells was significantly higher than those that received WT B cells or PBS (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C–6F</xref>). This suggests that signalling via Bam32 could endow B cells with the ability to downregulate cytokine production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
<p>Previous reports have linked Tregs with susceptibility to experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice, the mechanism possibly being through the production of IL-10 to dampen immune response [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We found no difference in the frequency of Tregs in spleens of infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref rid="pntd.0003716.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) mice, suggesting that Bam32 does not influence the expansion and/or survival of Tregs in mice. However, spleens of infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice contained significantly higher numbers of Tregs than those of WT counterpart mice, due primarily to increased splenomegaly. The increase in absolute numbers of Tregs in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice suggests that Tregs might contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of these mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>.</p>
<p>B cells are critical for clearance of parasitemia and survival in murine experimental African trypanosomiasis. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection has been shown to cause depletion of several B cell subsets [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and B cell deficient mice are highly susceptible to various strains of African trypanosomes [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The susceptibility of B cell deficient mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection is reversed by passive transfer of VSG-specific antibody or primed B cells [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In line with this, we found that μMT mice were unable to control their first wave of parasitemia and succumbed within 15 days post-infection. While adoptive transfer of B cells from WT mice resulted in effective parasite control and survival, the transfer of B cells from Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not result in parasite control in μMT mice. In a previous study where we mixed and adoptively transferred equal numbers of WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> B cells into μMT mice, we showed that Bam32 KO B cells do not have an engraftment disadvantage, but rather have some proliferative advantage over WT B cells in the recipient μMT mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This suggests that the differences in parasitemia and survival observed here were not related to poor engraftment of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> B cells in μMT mice. Collectively, our results suggest that intrinsic B cell defects may be primarily responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection. VSG-specific antibodies mediate complement-mediated lysis <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], agglutination [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], immobilization [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and increased uptake of trypanosomes by macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Although both IgM and IgG antibody subclasses have been shown to mediate anti-trypanosome clearance [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], it is generally accepted that the different IgG antibody classes are more important than IgM in mediating parasite control and survival of trypanosome-infected mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Thus, although serum levels of trypanosome-specific IgM antibodies were comparable in infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the impaired production of parasite-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody classes in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice could be responsible for their enhanced susceptibility to infection. Interestingly, IgG levels were most significantly decreased at later time points (from day 28 post-infection), suggesting a failure to sustain protective antibody responses over time.</p>
<p>The crosslinking of B cell receptors by their cognate antigens leads to the generation of intracellular signalling events that ultimately result in B cell activation. The activated B cells migrate to the lymphoid follicles where they undergo extensive proliferation and differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells. These follicular areas of extensive B proliferation and differentiation (also called germinal centres) are critically important for somatic hypermutation, class-switching and affinity maturation events that are dependent on cognate interaction with follicular CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells. We found that Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired germinal centre B cell response starting from day 28 post-infection, a time that correlated with onset of uncontrolled parasitemia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and lower serum levels of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in germinal centre B cells numbers between infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice early in the infection, suggesting that premature germinal centre crash occurs in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In support of this, both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining clearly revealed germinal centre deterioration by day 48 post-infection in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This is consistent with a previous study that showed germinal centre collapse in Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice after immunization with ova/alum [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite the significant differences in germinal centre B cells, we found no differences in the percentages or absolute numbers of T follicular helper cells in the spleens of infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice throughout the course of infection. In fact, Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice had higher T follicular cells at the later phase of infection, suggesting that the suboptimal GC response is not related to intrinsic defects in T follicular helper cells numbers and/or function. Collectively, these observations suggest that the impaired IgG response in infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice may be due to B cell intrinsic defects as described previously [<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003716.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. When memory B cell subsets in these mice were assessed, we found as expected that the frequency of memory B cell population (i.e. CD19<sup>+</sup>GL7<sup>-</sup>Fas<sup>-</sup>CD80<sup>+</sup>PD-L2<sup>+</sup>) increased in the spleens of infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice as the infection progressed (see <xref rid="pntd.0003716.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> for gating strategy). However, there was no difference in the frequency of memory B cells in the spleens of infected WT and Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice at different times after infection, suggesting that differences in generation of memory B cells could not account for the enhanced susceptibility of infected Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, the new set of data support our conclusion that the susceptibility of Bam32<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection is due in part to their inability to mount a strong and sustainable germinal centre response, which ultimately results in impaired parasite-specific antibody production.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Bam32 is an important molecule that contributes to optimum resistance to experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice. Deficiency of this adaptor molecule negatively impacts on parasite-specific germinal centre formation and IgG responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, it dramatically enhances proinflammatory cytokine production, suggesting that Bam32 may act as a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. Collectively, these findings identify Bam32 as an indispensable molecule for optimal anti-trypanosome IgG antibody response and suppression of disease-promoting proinflammatory cytokines and its deficiency leads to inability to control <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infection in mice.</p>

<title>Gating strategy for memory B cells.</title>
<p>To assess memory B cell subset, splenocytes were first gated on CD19<sup>+</sup> (B cells) and then gated on GL7<sup>-</sup> and FAS<sup>-</sup> (double negative) population to exclude the germinal centre B cells. Memory B cells were then assessed on expression of CD80 and PD-L2 (double positive) B cells.</p>
