<title>Background</title>
<p>In this study, a <italic>Burkholderia mallei tonB</italic> mutant (TMM001) deficient in iron acquisition was constructed, characterized, and evaluated for its protective properties in acute inhalational infection models of murine glanders and melioidosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Compared to the wild-type, TMM001 exhibits slower growth kinetics, siderophore hyper-secretion and the inability to utilize heme-containing proteins as iron sources. A series of animal challenge studies showed an inverse correlation between the percentage of survival in BALB/c mice and iron-dependent TMM001 growth. Upon evaluation of TMM001 as a potential protective strain against infection, we found 100% survival following <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> CSM001 challenge of mice previously receiving 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of TMM001. At 21 days post-immunization, TMM001-treated animals showed significantly higher levels of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic>-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgM when compared to PBS-treated controls. At 48 h post-challenge, PBS-treated controls exhibited higher levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and more severe pathological damage to target organs compared to animals receiving TMM001. In a cross-protection study of acute inhalational melioidosis with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic>, TMM001-treated mice were significantly protected. While wild type was cleared in all <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> challenge studies, mice failed to clear TMM001.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> are the causative agents of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. In addition to the recent rise in cases of glanders and the endemicity of melioidosis worldwide, these pathogens have gained attention as potential bioweapons. Further, these pathogens have huge potential for aerosol delivery and often produce fatal infection amongst untreated individuals. Both pathogens are difficult to treat, and even with antibiotic intervention, patients relapse or get re-infected. A big challenge for vaccine development against these pathogens includes identification of broadly protective antigens and a better understanding of the correlates of protection from both acute and chronic infections. Our study is the first to demonstrate significant protection against a lethal challenge with both <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species. Because TMM001 persists in immunized mice, we propose that this attenuated organism is a promising backbone-based strain from which a legitimate vaccine candidate can be generated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Melioidosis and glanders are severe zoonotic diseases caused by two closely related Gram-negative pathogens known as <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic>, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The genomic relatedness between these two pathogens suggests that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> is a host-adapted clone of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic>, which evolved from a process of reductive evolution. Genes retained by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> share 99% sequence identity with their <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> orthologs and of those, 650 genes have been identified as putative virulence determinants via <italic>in silico</italic> genomic subtraction from non-pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, the presence of very few <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> specific genes suggest it’s possible to generate a live attenuated vaccine with a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> backbone that can cross-protect against both melioidosis and glanders [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Where <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> is an environmental saprophytic pathogen ubiquitous in soil and fresh water surfaces, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> is an obligate mammalian pathogen that typically infects solipeds (horses, donkeys, etc) [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite epidemiological differences, the clinical and pathological manifestations of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> or <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> infections bear striking resemblance. Both pathogens can be contracted via the cutaneous, oral and/or inhalational routes. Depending on the dose and route of transmission, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> or <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> infection may result in an acute or chronic disease. Clinical manifestations of acute infection from either disease, which include fever, malaise, abscess formation, pneumonia and sepsis, are non-specific. The lack of pathognomonic symptoms, in addition to their ability to cause silent infection, makes rapid and accurate diagnosis problematic for these <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections. Since mortality rates among severe infections are high, and there are no reliable antibiotic therapy or licensed pre- and post-exposure vaccines, both pathogens remain top candidates for bioterrorist use and thus have been classified as category B, tier 1, biothreat agents [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The destructive potential of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> has heightened concerns among public health officials due to the increased potential of opportunistic infection among growing populations of diabetic and immunocompromised people [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For military personnel and susceptible individuals, the availability of a vaccine would be the most efficacious and cost-effective way to protect from disease.</p>
<p>Progress in vaccine development shows formulations consisting of subunits or live-attenuated strains are the most effective in conferring protection against both pathogens. Subunit vaccines consisting of purified protein [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; recombinant Hcp proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; truncated recombinant proteins LolC and PotF [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and outer membrane vesicles (OMV) [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have achieved the greatest protection to date. While encouraging, subunit vaccines provided only partial protection, which is attributed to their inability to generate broad protective immunity, specifically cell mediated immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Live attenuated vaccines are recognized for their ability to elicit strong broad immune responses that provide long-lasting protection [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus far, attenuated mutants lacking a functional <italic>purN</italic>, <italic>purM</italic>, <italic>aroB</italic>, <italic>ilvl</italic>, or <italic>bipD</italic> genes in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic>, and <italic>ilvl</italic> or DD3008 (capsule) genes in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> have been evaluated for their protective potential [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although these candidates have proven capable of providing significant protection during the acute stage of infection, none have yet to afford full protection during the chronic stage of infection.</p>
<p>To create a live attenuated <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> mutant that will generate a protective immune response against chronic infection, we focused on iron transport systems as a target of mutagenesis. For a majority of bacterial pathogens, the acquisition of iron and iron complexes has long been recognized as major pathogenic determinant and thus also represent a promising target for vaccine development. In the host environment, free iron is too scarce and iron complexes are too large to diffuse effectively through porin channels. To survive in these growth-limiting conditions, bacteria utilize siderophores and/or high-affinity outer-membrane receptors to uptake iron and iron complexes [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the case of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic>, very little information exists concerning iron uptake mechanisms in the host and their roles in virulence. In one study, Kvitko el at., generated single, double and quadruple <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> mutants defective in siderophores and/or hemoglobin utilization [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While mutants defective in these systems are often attenuated, the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> mutants remained fully virulent in a murine model of acute melioidosis [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Failure to eliminate virulence was attributed to redundancy in the iron transport system, citing a reliance on alternative iron sources and acquisition mechanisms.</p>
<p>To negate this redundancy, we targeted the inner membrane energy transfer protein TonB, an essential component that interacts with all outer membrane receptor proteins that carry out high-affinity binding and energy dependent iron uptake [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. When assessed in multiple models of infection, <italic>tonB</italic> mutants displayed severe attenuation compared to their wild-type homologs [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the case of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, Hsieh <italic>et al</italic>. showed 100% protection in challenge mice previously vaccinated with the <italic>tonB</italic> mutant homolog [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> TonB-dependent iron-transport systems, specifically their contribution to survival, persistence and potential as targets for attenuation, should be investigated further. In this communication, we describe the construction and characterization of a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei tonB</italic> mutant as a backbone strain for subsequent vaccine development against acute inhalational murine glanders and melioidosis.</p>

<title>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions</title>
<p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref rid="pntd.0003863.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37°C or 30°C, as required. For all the experiments, all <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> strains were taken from freezer stocks, plated on LB agar containing 4% glucose (LBG), and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. For liquid cultures, a few colonies (2–3) were inoculated into 20 mL of LBG broth and incubated overnight with agitation at 37°C. When employing antibiotic selection, we used kanamycin and polymyxin B at concentrations of 50 μg/mL and 30 μg/mL, respectively. For counter-selection, co-integrates were grown in YT broth (10 g of tryptone and 10 g of yeast extract) and then plated on sucrose agar (YT agar supplemented with 5% sucrose), as described by Hamad et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When appropriate, LBG broth and agar were supplemented with FeSO<sub>4</sub> at a concentration of 200 μM.

<title>Construction and Complementation of the TMM001 Strain</title>
<p>Matched adaptamers containing 3’ enzyme restriction sites and 5’ complementary sequences were amplified via touchdown PCR. The sequences of the PCR primers were as follows: Δ<italic>tonB</italic> US forward primer (AA<underline>G CTA GC</underline>C CTC GGC GCG GCG ATC CGC GAC GT) (underlined sequence indicates <italic>Nhe</italic>I site); Δ<italic>tonB</italic> US reverse primer (CGG TAT TGC CGA GAT TAA CGG TGC GGC ACG TCG T); Δ<italic>tonB</italic> DS forward primer (ACG ACG TGC CGC ACC GTT AAT CTC GGC AAT ACC G); and Δ<italic>tonB</italic> DS reverse primer (CC<underline>A AGC TT</underline>T ACG AGC ATG ACG TCG ACG AGC GGC GTC ATG TTG) (underlined sequence indicates <italic>Hind</italic>III site). The adaptamers were fused together via splicing by overlap extension (SOE) PCR to create a 1794-bp chimeric fragment containing sequences flanking the <italic>tonB</italic> gene plus its first 33 codons. The chimeric fragment was digested with <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III and ligated into the pMo130 vector to create the allelic exchange plasmid pTonB-allex. The pTonB-allex plasmid was then transformed into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> S17-1 and introduced into <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> via conjugal transfer. Merodiploids were selected based on their growth on kanamycin (Km) and polymyxin B (Pbx) agar plates and ability to turn yellow after exposure to pyrocathecol.

<p>After the <italic>tonB</italic> mutant was screened for Pxb resistance and Km sensitivity, deletion was confirmed via PCR amplification, followed by sequencing of the <italic>tonB</italic> gene and flanking DNA regions by using the following primers: confirmation forward primer (5’ GCG CCA CGC GGC CGA TTG CCG CTT TCT) and confirmation reverse primer (ACA GAA CCG TGC CGT CGC TTT). To restore the <italic>tonB</italic> mutant (renamed TMM001) to wild-type function, pMo168 carrying a functional <italic>tonB</italic> gene plus its native promoter was used for complementation. Briefly, a fragment containing the wild-type <italic>tonB</italic> gene plus approximately 120 bp of its upstream sequence flanked by enzyme restriction sites was amplified by using the following PCR primers: complementation forward primer (CC<underline>G CTA GC</underline>C TGA TTT TCC GCA AGT GAT GCA GCA CT) (underlined sequence indicates <italic>Nhe</italic>I site) and complementation reverse primer (CC<underline>A AGC TT</underline>T TAA TCG GTC AGA GTG AAG TCA TAA GGC) (underlined sequence indicates <italic>Hind</italic>III site).

In contrast, infected mice immunized with TMM001 at a dose of 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU or 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU showed 100% (<sup>★★★</sup> p = 0.0003) and 87.5% (<sup>★★★</sup> p = 0.0003) survival, respectively.</p>
<p>Dissemination and colonization of CSM001 was monitored in TMM001-treated and naïve BALB/c mice using IVIS at 72 h post challenge and every 7 days thereafter until the experiment ended. At 72 h post challenge, PBS-treated BALB/c mice exhibited a luminescent signal associated with anatomical locations corresponding to the lungs, liver, spleen and brain. However, this signal was not detected at similar locations in BALB/c mice immunized with TMM001 (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). To evaluate whether TMM001 immunization resulted in the production of sterile immunity, BALB/c mice surviving the experimental challenge were euthanized and organs harvested to be analyzed for gross pathology and bacterial persistence. Although the lungs and livers showed no signs of evident pathology, BALB/c mice presented with splenomegaly accompanied by multiple splenic abscesses (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>, panels D-F), which mirrors spleens at stage 3 of murine melioidosis infection, as we previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Bacterial counts were only recovered from the spleens of mice immunized with a dose 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> (334,666 ± 70,465 CFU per spleen) and 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> (61,917 ± 18,217 CFU per spleen) CFU of TMM001. Based on the phenotypic yellow pigment of the colonies, polymyxin B resistance and kanamycin sensitivity, we were able to conclude that all bacteria recovered were TMM001 and not CSM001.</p>
<p>In an attempt to eliminate persistence of the attenuated TMM001 strain, as well as to reduce organ pathology, an attenuated strain titration study was initiated to identify the lowest immunization dose that still provided 100% protection. The TMM001 titration study used the following CFUs for immunization: 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup>, 1.5 x 10<sup>3</sup> and 1.5 x 10<sup>2</sup>. Twenty-one days post-immunization, three mice from each immunization group were euthanized, and organs and serum were harvested for histopathological and cytokine analysis. Forty-eight hours after CSM001 (1.5 x 104 CFU) challenge, an additional 3 mice from each treatment were euthanized, and organs and serum were harvested for histopathological and cytokine analysis. As previously observed, all PBS-treated mice challenged with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> CSM001 died by day 4, with a median survival of 3 days (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The titration curve exhibits a significant dose-dependent increase in survival in TMM001<italic>-</italic>treated mice challenged with CSM001. All mice immunized with 1.5 x 10<sup>2</sup> CFU expired by day 15, with an increased mean survival of 9 days (<sup>★★</sup> p = 0.0016). Mice immunized with 1.5 x 10<sup>3</sup> CFU or 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU, survival up to 28 days increased to 62.5% (<sup>★★</sup> p = 0.0016) and 100% (<sup>★★★</sup> p = 0.00016), respectively. Assessment of bacterial burden in surviving animals showed the spleen and, to a lower extent, the liver chronically infected in the TMM001-treated but not the CSM001 strain.</p>

<p>Sera that was collected at 48 h post challenge from PBS- and TMM001-treated mice was used to identify pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses that correspond with disease outcome. Prior to challenge, a similar baseline expression of cytokines and chemokines was detectable in serum of representative animals from both the PBS- and TMM001-immunized animals (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, immune correlates of protection for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> are not clearly defined. Due to their intracellular lifestyle, these pathogens use an array of virulence factors to invade, replicate, and cause pathogenesis from within host cells, which can impede immune detection and, in some cases, protection. An extensive review of the literature suggested to us that an ideal vaccine for both pathogens would induce robust humoral and cell-mediated responses [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, we decided to examine live attenuated vaccines, as these are often cited as the most efficacious approach to vaccine development against intracellular pathogens because they mimic natural infection, inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, without causing disease. Moreover, exposure to the live attenuated strain allows the immune system to customize a protective response, in addition to generating an immune memory for lifelong protection against infection.</p>
<p>In growth curve experiments, it was found that TMM001 was unable to maintain wild-type growth kinetics (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Upon supplementing the culture with free iron, TMM001 exhibited increased growth rates more reminiscent of the wild-type, which is illustrated by a shorter lag phase and prolonged maintenance of wild-type growth kinetics. In a separate growth curve study, full rescue of the wild type phenotype in TMM011 was achieved after both the starter and sub-culture were supplemented with free iron. The correlation between free iron concentration and the growth rate of TMM001 illustrates the importance of TonB as a facilitator of iron transport, which has a direct impact on bacterial fitness.</p>
<p>The results of our survival study show an inverse correlation not only between TMM001 dose and survival but also between concentration of free iron and survival (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Compared to the wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> strain (LD<sub>50</sub> of 7.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU), TMM001 is approximately 3-fold more attenuated when grown with FeSO<sub>4</sub> (LD<sub>50</sub> of 2.38 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU); and when grown in LBG alone, the <italic>tonB</italic> mutant is attenuated by approximately 7-fold (5.59 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU). Differences in virulence are consistent with the data of the dissemination study which showed the lowest burden in animals infected with TMM001 and higher bacterial burdens in animals infected with TMM001 grown with FeSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In both experiments, FeSO<sub>4</sub> supplementation failed to fully reverse attenuation of TMM001 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This outcome was not unexpected as the concentration of free iron in the host (10<sup>-24</sup>M [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) is well below that is needed to sustain bacterial replication. While FeSO<sub>4</sub> supplementation would prolong its survival and therefore increase its virulence, TMM001 would be unable to sustain the wild-type phenotype once its internal stores of iron are exhausted. Lack of full complementation by FeSO<sub>4</sub> supplementation can also be attributed to the role of TonB in the import of other substrates. While the majority of TonB-dependent transport systems function to uptake iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, nickel chelates, and carbohydrates can also be transported by this mechanism. Overall, decreased mortality observed in animals challenged with the TMM001 grown in LBG alone illustrates the importance of iron and its TonB-mediated acquisition to virulence.</p>
<p>In a series of TMM001 titration studies, it was empirically determined that a dose of 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of TMM001 resulted in 100% protection (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) and CSM001 clearance following challenge. Protected animals developed strong <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic>-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgM responses (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), which we attribute to TMM001-mediated protection. The observation and correlation of strong IgG and IgM elicitation and protection are cited often in <italic>Burkholderia</italic> vaccine studies [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In human cases, it was found that patients with less severe, localized infection produced detectable <italic>Burkholderia-</italic>specific IgM antibody titers, whereas none were detected in patients suffering from acute disseminated infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible to suggest TMM001 treatment protects against lethal infection by neutralizing bacteria and/or preventing their dissemination to target organs via antibody-mediated mechanisms.</p>
<p>TMM001 immunization resulted in pathological differences that may explain increased survival and protection. In general, histopathological scoring shows a robust trend toward significant differences in the pathology seen in the lungs, liver and spleen of PBS- vs. TMM001<italic>-</italic>immunized animals (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, panels E-G). Further analysis of these tissues revealed two discriminatory elements of pathologic damage between vaccine treatments. First, despite the finding that the lungs and livers from both PBS- and TMM001-immunized animals displayed some degree of tissue damage, the pathological changes in TMM001<italic>-</italic>immunized mice were much less severe (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>, panel A). Second, the differential alteration in spleen architecture implied that the PBS- and TMM001-immunized animals responded differently to infection. For example, splenic tissues from PBS-treated mice show a diffuse response to injury (i.e. diffuse severe histiocytosis), while splenic tissue from TMM001<italic>-</italic>immunized mice showed a focal response to injury (i.e. granuloma formation) (<xref rid="pntd.0003863.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>, panels C-D). These histological observations suggested to us that immunization with TMM001 may result in the induction of an immune response that produces a different type of tissue damage, in addition to confining infection to prevent disseminated disease, an important cause of morbidity and mortality in many diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
<p>The histopathological differences between PBS- and TMM001-vaccinated mice suggest that TMM001 reduces disease by attenuating immune-mediate pathology at sites of bacterial proliferation. Our observation that pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses are attenuated following TMM001 treatment further supports this conclusion. In models of murine melioidosis, it has been established that increased expression of IL-1β and IL-6 follow <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> dissemination and coincide with acute sepsis and mortality [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Clinical evidence further suggests a correlation between elevated serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 and poor prognosis in patients with septic melioidosis [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our previous studies demonstrated that pre-treatment with CpG oligonucleotides protected mice from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> exposure and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MCP-1) expression in the lung [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the study by Judy, <italic>et al</italic>., a moderate pro-inflammatory response was associated with protection while excessive inflammation caused pulmonary pathology [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further, the protective effects of CpG treatment to reduce lung pathology were attributed to a reduction in neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte recruitment [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, we have previously shown that the virulence of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> strains in direct comparisons corresponds with excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit neutrophils and monocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These observations in clinical and animal model studies support a role for exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses to mediate lung pathology in disease due to <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species. Thus, treatment with TMM001 activates a moderate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response associated with protective immune responses and attenuates the exacerbation of this response that is associated with neutrophil infiltration and immune-mediated tissue damage.</p>
<p>Lastly, since <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> are genetically closely related, TMM001 was further tested for its potential to provide protection in an acute inhalational model of murine melioidosis. The significant cross protection seen in TMM001-treated mice provides an optimistic outlook for the development for a single vaccine for both pathogens. Immunization with TMM001 resulted in full protection and clearance of CSM001 when tested in an acute respiratory model of murine glanders. This live attenuated strain is unique not only because it provided full protection against both acute and chronic stages of infection but also because it imparted significant cross protection against <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> infection.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that the persistence of viable bacteria is key for protective potential. In previous vaccination studies, the failure to provide successful long-term protection has often be attributed to the quick removal of live attenuated strains from the host [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, we believe the resulting long-term protection is link to the ability of TMM001 to evade rapid clearance. This notion is supported by vaccination studies which reported long-term survivors to be generally colonized at the end of the study [<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003863.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It is plausible to propose that this persistence increases the accessibility of the immune system to protective antigens or it might contribute to the development of an environment adverse to wild-type colonization via chronic elicitation of the immune response.</p>
<p>Although its persistence is important for its protective potential, TMM001 is able to colonize and maintain in the host. Before securing approval from the division of select agents and toxin (DSAT) for removal of this strain from the Health and Human Services select agent list and becoming a legitimate vaccine candidate, the ability of TMM001 to cause chronic infection needs to be addressed. Studies are now focused on using TMM001 as a backbone to generate a further attenuated strain with the introduction of additional mutations. As TMM001 is only 7-fold less virulent than the wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> strain, we believe this to be the best strategy for optimization and do not anticipate problems with over-attenuation. Currently we are targeting genes that are contributing to persistence with the intention of developing a more attenuated strain that can persist long enough to elicit a protective immune response without establishing chronic infection. For example, we are focused on genes involved in TonB-independent mechanisms of iron assimilation. Bacterial transport systems that are shown to transport iron in this manner include the following: FbpABC transport system of <italic>Neisseria gonorroeae</italic>¸ SfuABC transport system of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, VctPDGC ABC cytoplasmic membrane transport system of <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, etc [Ref]. Looking for homologs of these systems in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mallei</italic> could provide optimal targets for further attenuation. Overall, we believe the present study represents a significant advancement in the battle against pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections, in which TMM001 could be further optimized to become an effective vaccine against glanders, melioidosis, or other <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections.</p>
