<abstract>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV), a global disease, is divided into four serotypes (DENV1-4). Cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies against envelope (E) protein of DENV bind to the Fcγ receptors (FcγR) of cells, and thereby exacerbate viral infection by heterologous serotypes via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Identification and modification of enhancing epitopes may mitigate enhancement of DENV infection. In this study, we characterized the cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against domain I-II of DENV; these antibodies poorly neutralized and potently enhanced DENV infection both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, two enhancing mAbs, DB21-6 and DB39-2, were observed to compete with sera antibodies from patients infected with dengue. The epitopes of these enhancing mAbs were identified using phage display, structural prediction, and mapping of virus-like particle (VLP) mutants. N8, R9, V12, and E13 are the reactive residues of DB21-6, while N8, R9, and E13 are the reactive residues of DB39-2. N8 substitution tends to maintain VLP secretion, and decreases the binding activity of DB21-6 and DB39-2. The immunized sera from N8 substitution (N8R) DNA vaccine exerted greater neutralizing and protective activity than wild-type (WT)-immunized sera, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, treatment with N8R-immunized sera reduced the enhancement of mortality in AG129 mice. These results support identification and substitution of enhancing epitope as a novel strategy for developing safe dengue vaccines.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) infects 390 million humans annually, and is the cause of one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in the world. Currently, there are no available licensed vaccines or antiviral drugs for dengue, so development of safe vaccine and effective therapy is urgently needed. Here, we identified two monoclonal antibodies, DB21-6 and DB39-2, which can enhance DENV1-4 infection and increase virus-induced mortality in AG129 mice. We found that serum samples from patients with severe dengue disease contain higher levels of antibodies against enhancing epitope. We proceeeded to identify enhancing epitope on E protein, and developed DNA vaccines by substitution. The substituted DNA vaccine with mutation at the enhancing epitope demonstrated augmented neutralizing activity against DENV2, and reduced enhancement of mortality as compared to wild type-immunized sera. Our results show that substitution of enhancing epitope can increase the immune response against viral infection, while reducing the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). These novel findings may be useful for developing safe and efficacious vaccines against dengue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes prevalent, global disease. It is estimated to cause 390 million infections annually, which lead to a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in tropical and subtropical countries [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although primary infection with DENV provides immunity against the same serotype, subsequent secondary infection with different DENV serotypes has a higher risk for developing severe dengue disease [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The presence of cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies bound to DENV helps viral entry into Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells, resulting in increased virus load and/or production of certain cytokines [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This phenomenon is termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At the time of writing, there is no approved vaccine against DENV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p>DENV, which exists as four related serotypes (DENV1-4), is a member of the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is a positive-stranded RNA virus that encodes three structural proteins (the capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5) [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The prM protein seems to function as a chaperone for the assembly of the E protein [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During virus maturation, the viral particle is activated by the low pH of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The prM protein is subsequently cleaved by furin to generate M protein, resulting in mature and infective virions [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Co-expression of prM and E proteins can produce virus-like particles (VLPs), which are similar in structure and antigenicity to infectious virus particles, and have been used broadly in epitope mapping, diagnosis, and vaccine development [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The E protein plays an important role in facilitating attachment of DENV to cell surface receptor(s), fusion of virus with endosomal membranes, and subsequent entry into target cells. The E protein is regarded to be the antigen involved in mediating the immune response, and the principle target of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The E protein forms 90 homodimers on the surface of the mature virion [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The E monomer consists of three domains: domain I (EDI), domain II (EDII), and domain III (EDIII) [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; EDI links EDII with EDIII. EDII is an elongated dimerization domain, which contains the conserved fusion peptide [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EDIII, an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, is considered to be the binding site of the receptor on the target cell. Several studies have shown that serotype-specific and neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies bind to EDIII [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas in human, only a small fraction of antibodies react to this region [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Recent study has shown that human neutralizing antibodies bind to complex epitopes on dengue virions [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, a large fraction of cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing human antibodies can be isolated from natural DENV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the context of dengue pathogenesis, these cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies against E or prM proteins derived from primary infection can enhance viral infection through ADE during secondary infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, identification of B-cell epitopes of DENV E protein, which induce cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies, may provide valuable information for vaccine development.</p>
<p>Although various strategies have been employed in an attempt to develop dengue vaccine (including the use of attenuated or inactive virus, and the development of subunit vaccines), a safe and effective vaccine against DENV is not yet available [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to identify and substitute the epitopes recognized by poorly neutralizing and highly enhancing antibodies to improve the dengue vaccine. In this study, we found that the cross-reactive mAbs DB21-6 and DB39-2 exhibit poor neutralizing activity and high capacity for enhancing DENV infection. We used competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the relationship between mAbs and sera antibodies from dengue patients. We proceeded to use phage display, bioinformatic analysis, and VLP mutants to identify the epitopes recognized by DB21-6 and DB39-2. To further improve the DNA vaccines against DENV2, we substituted the N8 residue of wild-type (WT) DENV2 E protein with arginine (N8R) in a plasmid for immunization. N8R-immunized sera produced higher neutralizing and protective activity than WT-immunized sera. Moreover, treatment of AG129 mice with N8R-immunized sera reduced mortality, as compared with mice treated with WT-immunized sera. Taken together, we have identified a novel cross-reactive and infection-enhancing epitope in E protein. Our results demonstrate that substitution of this enhancing epitope is a promising strategy for development of a safe dengue vaccine.</p>

<title>DENV, cell lines, and mAbs</title>
<p>Four dengue virus serotypes, DENV1 Hawaii, DENV2 16681, DENV3 H87, and DENV4 H241, were prepared as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. C6/36 cells were grown in medium consisting of 50% Mitsumashi and Maramorsch insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 50% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Antibiotic-Antimycotic, Gibco). The C6/36 cells were infected with DENV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1–1, and incubated at 28°C for 7 to 9 days. The viruses were harvested from supernatant, and then titrated in a baby hamster kidney fibroblast cell line (BHK-21) by plaque assay. The aliquots were stored at -80°C. BHK-21 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Antibiotic-Antimycotic, Gibco). Human erythroleukaemic K562 and monocytic THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS. The mouse mAbs, including DB21-6 and DB39-2, were generated by immunization of BALB/c mice with DENV2, and were produced in hybridoma cells, as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. DB21-6 and DB39-2 were isotyped as IgG1 (SouthernBiotech) and purified using protein G Sepharose 4B gels (GE Healthcare).</p>

The mixtures were then used to infect K562 cells for 2 hours at 37°C. After washing, the cells were incubated with 2% FBS in RPMI medium (Gibco) at 37°C for 3 days. The infected cells were collected and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 4°C. For staining, the cells were permeabilized with 2% FBS in PBS containing 0.1% saponin (Sigma), followed by staining with 4 μg/ml 4G2 for 0.5 hours at 4°C. The cells were washed and incubated with R-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 hour at 4°C. The cells were washed, and the percentages of infected cells were determined by flow cytometry. For infection of THP-1 cells, DENV2 16681 (MOI = 1 or 10) was incubated with diluted mAbs for 1 hour at 4°C, and then incubated with cells for 2 hours at 37°C. After 3 days, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with hDB32-6 [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

<title>Competitive ELISA of mAbs and patient serum samples</title>
<p>A total of 21 DENV2-infected patient serum samples were collected from 11 DF patients and 10 DHF patients during an outbreak between 2002 and 2003 in Taiwan. Diagnosis of DENV infection was based on IgM antibody-capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA), reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), or virus isolation in cell cultures, as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These serum samples were collected between days 4 and 22 from the onset of symptoms; such sera contained anti-dengue antibodies. All of these patients were determined to have classical DF or DHF based on the criteria published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The characteristics of patient serum samples enrolled in this study are also provided (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Competitive ELISA was performed as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, the plates were coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-DENV hyper-immune sera at 4°C overnight. After blocking, the diluted DENV2 viral supernatants (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> pfu) were added for 2 hours at room temperature (RT). The diluted mAbs and patient sera (1:100 dilution) were incubated for 2 hours at RT. After washing, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added for 1 hour at RT. The peroxidase substrate <italic>o</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Sigma-Aldrich) was then added, and the reaction was stopped with 3N HCl. The optical density (OD) was measured at 490 nm. Normal human serum (NHS) was used as a control. The percentage of competition was calculated as follows: competition (%) = [1−(OD of patient serum-mAb mixture/OD of NHS-mAb mixture)] × 100.</p>

<title>Identification of epitopes using flow cytometry-based binding assay to cells expressing WT and mutant DENV2 prM/E proteins</title>
<p>The pCBD2-2J-2-9-1 plasmid expressing prM-E proteins of DENV2 has been previously characterized and described [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace each of the selected amino acid residues, as described in the previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. After mutagenesis, the plasmids were sequenced to ensure the absence of any further mutations at non-target sites. BHK-21 cells were transfected with constructs expressing the wild-type (WT) or mutant DENV2 E protein using polyjet <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA transfection reagent (SignGen Laboratories). After 2 days, the cells were fixed, and permeabilized with 2% FBS in PBS containing 0.1% saponin (Sigma). For staining, cells were incubated with DB21-6, DB39-2, 4G2, and mixed mAbs (DB32-6, 3H5, and DB25-2) at a concentration of 1, 1, 1, and 1 μg/ml, respectively, at 4°C for 0.5 hours. After washing, the cells were incubated with RPE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and analyzed by flow cytometry. The relative index of a mAb to a mutant E protein was measured using the formula: [intensity of the mutant E/intensity of WT E (recognized by a mAb)]/[intensity of mutant E/intensity of WT E (recognized by mixed mAbs)].</p>

<title>Characterization of cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 against DENV</title>
<p>In our previous study, we generated seventeen mAbs against the E protein of DENV [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of these mAbs, DB21-6 and DB39-2 could recognize cells infected with DENV1-4 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). In addition, these mAbs recognized transfected BHK-21 cells expressing DENV2 E and EDI-II proteins (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). Thus, the cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 recognized DENV1-4 and domain I-II on E protein.</p>
<p>To estimate the <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing activity, we infected BHK-21 cells with a mixture of individual mAbs and DENV1-4. Previous studies have reported that 4G2 is an anti-flavivirus antibody with neutralizing and enhancing activity at certain concentrations [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We observed that 4G2 exerts higher neutralization activity than DB21-6 and DB39-2 against DENV2 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). In addition, DB21-6 and DB39-2 exhibited non-neutralizing activity against DENV1-4 (50% inhibition concentration, &gt;33 μg/ml) (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>).</p>

The infection percentage was measured by flow cytometry, revealing infection enhancement over a broad range of mAb concentrations (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). As compared to the other mAbs, 4G2 caused enhancement of DENV1-4 infection in K562 cells at lower antibody concentrations. DB21-6 and DB39-2 enhanced DENV1-4 infection in K562 cells at high antibody concentrations (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To further confirm enhancement of infection, we proceeded to examine the enhancement of DENV2 16681 infection by DB21-6 and DB39-2 in FcγRI- and FcγRIIA-bearing THP-1 cells.

To evaluate the <italic>in vitro</italic> enhancement of DENV2 S221 infection by mAbs, we performed ADE assays using K562 cells and THP-1 cells. As for DENV1-4 infection, high concentrations of DB21-6 and DB39-2 enhanced DENV2 S221 infection in K562 cells (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>).

In order to determine viremia in DENV2 S221-infected AG129 mice following treatment with DB21-6 or DB39-2, the viral RNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR.

<title>Identification of enhancing epitopes of DB21-6 and DB39-2</title>

<p>To further verify the epitope of DB21-6 and DB39-2, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the phage-displayed epitope using pCBD2-2J-2-9-1 as template. After confirmation of variants by sequencing, we transfected cells with the mutant plasmids, and detected binding activity by flow cytometry. The binding percentages for each transfectant were normalized to those of anti-EDIII mAbs (DB32-6, 3H5, and DB25-2) [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and relative indices were calculated (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). 4G2, which binds to residues at the fusion loop of EDII [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], was used as a control to verify the structural change of E proteins caused by mutations (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Based on the relative indices, we found that mutations at N8, R9, V12, and E13 prevented binding by DB21-6. The same method was used to identify the epitope residues of DB39-2 as N8, R9, and E13. Structural modeling was applied to show that the recognition residues are located in domain I of E protein (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The distance between these residues from the same monomers was analyzed using a structure modeling program, and was found to be less than 30°A (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>); interestingly, this distance can be spanned by a single IgG molecule [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This suggests that the N8, R9, V12, and E13 residues constitute the epitope of DB21-6. In addition, the N8, R9, and E13 residues constitute the epitope of DB39-2. Alignments revealed that the binding motif of DB21-6 and DB39-2 corresponds to the N8, R9, V12, and E13 residues, which are conserved in DENV1-4 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0003903.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables). Finally, we used VLP-capture ELISA to demonstrate that the mutations at R9, V12, and E13 affect DENV2 VLP secretion (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). The effects of these mutations on the ability to secrete VLPs might be due to a change in the structure of E protein. However, the N8R substitution did not affect DENV2 VLP secretion (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). N8 substitution tends to maintain VLP secretion and reduces the binding activity of DB21-6 and DB39-2.</p>

<title>Identification of the epitope residues of DB21-6 and DB39-2 mAbs.</title>
<p>(A) BHK-21 cells were transfected with vectors expressing WT or mutant DENV2 E protein. After 2 days, the collected cells were reacted with mAbs, and then analyzed with flow cytometry. The relative indices were measured, as shown. Substitutions of N8, R9, V12, and E13 caused a significant loss of binding activity of DB21-6. Substitutions of N8, R9, and E13 caused a loss of binding activity of DB39-2. 4G2 was used as a control. Data shown are from one representative experiment of two independent experiments. (B) The model is based on the DENV2 E protein model (PDB: 1OAN), with the positions shown from the bottom of the structure. EDI is in red, EDII is in yellow, and EDIII is in blue. The epitopes of cross-reactive mAbs are located at residues N8, R9, V12, and E13 in EDI.

<title>Evaluation of neutralizing activity of the immunized sera</title>
<p>The immunized sera were evaluated for their neutralizing activity against DENV2. Both WT- and N8R-immunized sera exhibited high neutralizing activities, while vector-immunized sera did not (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, DENV2 infection was more effectively neutralized by N8R-immunized sera than by WT-immunized sera (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). To further evaluate whether immunized sera could broadly neutralize the diverse DENV2 strains, BHK-21 cells were infected with mixtures of immunized sera and four different DENV2 strains: 16681, NGC, PL046, and Malaysia 07587.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DENV infections stimulate immune responses and elicit a small proportion of protective antibodies. However, a high proportion of non-protective antibodies are also generated, which might be associated with enhancement of viral infections. Here, we characterized the ability of DB21-6 and DB39-2 to increase the percentage of dengue virus-infected cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that these mAbs enhance mortality in AG129 mice. Through competition assay, we found that sera antibodies from infected patients compete for binding with these mAbs. Using phage-display, structure prediction, and VLP mutants, we mapped the epitopes of enhancing mAbs DB21-6 and DB39-2 on EDI protein. To investigate how to reduce the enhancing effects while maintaining neutralizing activity, we substituted the N8 residue of E protein, and immunized mice with WT or N8R plasmids with a gene gun delivery system. After three immunizations, N8R-immunized sera produced neutralizing activity against DENV2, and reduced enhancement of mortality as compared to WT-immunized sera. Thus, substitution of enhancing epitope residues can increase the immune response against viral infection while reducing the potential for ADE.</p>
<p>The antibodies induced by E protein of DENV play important roles in neutralizing effects and regulation of viral infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. There are three structural domains (domain I, II, and III) in E protein. In previous reports, some mouse mAbs that bind to domain III of E protein were found to exhibit neutralizing activity and obstruct viral infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the anti-E or prM antibodies are cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing, which may enhance viral infection through ADE [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 against EDI-II have poor neutralizing activities against DENV1-4 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). In addition, we found that DB21-6 and DB39-2 have strong ADE activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that anti-fusion loop 4G2 enhances viral infections in both <italic>in vitro</italic> ADE assays and AG129 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We also observed that 4G2 has partially neutralizing activity against DENV1-4 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) and enhances <italic>in vitro</italic> viral infections at low antibody concentrations (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Notably, we also found that DB21-6 and DB39-2 enhanced DENV1-4 infection in K562 cells at high concentrations (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, infection of DENV2 was enhanced to a greater extent by DB21-6 and DB39-2 than by 4G2 in THP-1 cells (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In addition, DB21-6 and DB39-2 enhanced mortality in AG129 mice (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) and increases the viral loads in infected mice sera (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). These results indicate that DB21-6 and DB39-2 have strong enhancing activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>ADE is regarded as an important mechanism leading to the development of severe dengue disease, including DHF/DSS [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies binding to viruses can enhance infection of FcγR-bearing cells by ADE, resulting in increased viral load and/or production of cytokines [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. High viral load is correlated with dengue disease severity and DHF [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to be able to confirm the presence of enhancing antibodies in dengue patient sera. Our results indicate that the competition percentages of DB21-6 and DB39-2 were significantly higher in DHF patient sera than those in DF patient sera (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that the higher levels of enhancing antibodies, DB21-6 and DB39-2, in serum samples of dengue patients are associated with severe dengue disease. We hypothesize that the DENV infected patients might suffer more severe symptoms, such as DHF, when the expression level of the enhancing antibodies is higher.</p>
<p>Identification of binding domain and epitope residues in the E protein may provide helpful information for investigation of neutralizing and enhancing mechanisms of dengue infection. Phage display is a powerful method for developing epitope-based diagnostics and identifying B-cell epitopes [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. After screening a phage-displayed peptide library, we found that the phage clones selected using DB21-6 and DB39-2 mAbs displayed peptide sequences containing a consensus motif, N-R-x-x-V-E (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These displayed peptide sequences may be suitable for detecting enhancing antibodies in serum samples from dengue patients, and for providing information on the pathogenesis of dengue. By alignment of displayed peptide sequences and structural modeling, the candidate epitopes were predicted and verified using VLP mutants (Figs <xref rid="pntd.0003903.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The epitope residues of enhancing mAb DB21-6 are N8, R9, V12, and E13 in domain I of DENV2 E protein (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), and the epitope residues of enhancing mAb DB39-2 are N8, R9, and E13 in domain I of DENV2 E protein (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). We aligned the N8, R9, V12, and E13 residues, and found that these residues were conserved in DENV1-4 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Thus, cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 can bind to DENV1-4. A previous report indicated that G106 and L107 are the epitope residues of enhancing mAb 4G2 [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our studies, we also confirmed that W101, G106, L107, and F108 in the fusion loop are the epitope residues of 4G2 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The epitope residues recognized by 4G2 are different from those recognized by DB21-6 and DB39-2. These findings suggest that DB21-6/DB39-2 and 4G2 enhance DENV infection through different mechanisms. In addition, the enhancing epitopes of DB21-6 (N8, R9, V12, and E13) and DB39-2 (N8, R9, and E13) are novel and have not previously been reported. Therefore, further verification of these enhancing epitopes and the detailed molecular mechanism(s) by which these enhancing antibodies propagate dengue infection are worth investigating through cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).</p>
<p>The E protein is targeted by most reported dengue vaccines, and is thus regarded as an important target [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sanofi Pasteur published data from a phase III study on tetravalent dengue vaccine, which conferred moderate protection (56%) against dengue disease [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the vaccine provided low protection (35%) against DENV2, but more than 75% protection against DENV3 and 4, and 50% against DENV1. Improvements in vaccine efficacy and the effect of the substitution of the enhancing epitope on safety are yet to be examined. Previous studies have shown that DNA vaccine candidates against DENV1 or DENV2 with substitutions in the fusion loop (at G106 and L107) and the cross-reactive epitopes of EDIII (at K310, E311, and P364) confer protective immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, enhancement of mortality by enhancing antibodies against the fusion loop was reduced in mice immunized with such vaccines. In this study, we have identified new enhancing antibodies and a novel enhancing epitope that are different from those previously reported. Mutations at R9, V12, and E13 may change the structure of E protein and affect VLP secretion. However, our VLP-capture ELISA results suggest that the N8R substitution does not affect DENV2 VLP secretion (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), which is crucial for its use in immunization. Moreover, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing assay and <italic>in vivo</italic> protection assays to show that both WT- and N8R-immunized sera exerted protective activities against DENV2 (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Interestingly, N8R-immunized sera had higher <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing activity and <italic>in vivo</italic> protective activity than the WT-immunized sera (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B–5E</xref>). These results suggest that immunization with the N8R DNA vaccine may increase neutralizing and protective immunity against DENV2.</p>
<p>An earlier investigation used mouse-adapted DENV2 S221 to study severe dengue disease via ADE in AG129 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we passively transferred diluted vector-, WT-, or N8R-immunized sera, and then challenged AG129 mice with DENV2 S221. WT- and N8R-immunized sera were protective at a 1:25 dilution, as compared to vector-immunized sera. However, the mortality of mice was enhanced by treatment with WT-immunized sera at a 1:100 dilution, as compared to treatment with vector-immunized sera. Importantly, the mortality of mice treated with N8R-immunized sera at a 1:100 dilution was not enhanced (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). When the dilution was increased to 1:400, no enhanced mortality was observed (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Our results indicate that substituting the enhancing epitope can reduce the ADE phenomenon and increase protective activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, substitution of enhancing epitope and preservation of neutralizing epitope in immunized mice provide protective immunity. Such an approach would redirect immunodominance (<xref rid="pntd.0003903.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>) and improve immunogenicity by satisfying the required neutralizing occupancy [<xref rid="pntd.0003903.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In summary, we have identified a novel enhancing epitope, enabling us to reduce the potential for ADE through N8R substitution in DENV2 E protein. This may be a viable approach for developing new dengue vaccines that can increase the anti-DENV immune response.</p>

<title>Characterization of DB21-6 and DB39-2 against DENV and E protein of DENV2 by immunofluorescence assay (IFA).</title>
<p>(A) BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV1 (MOI = 1), DENV2 (MOI = 1), DENV3 (MOI = 10), or DENV4 (MOI = 1). After 2 days, the infected cells were detected using DB21-6 and DB39-2. Uninfected cells (Mock) and NMIgG were used as negative controls. The results are shown at 400× magnification. (B and C) DENV2 E, comprising amino acids 1–400 of the E protein, was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. DENV2 EDI-II (amino acids 1–295) and EDIII (amino acids 295–400) were also inserted into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. After transfection, IFA was used to reveal that DB21-6 and DB39-2 recognized BHK-21 cells expressing DENV2 E (B) or EDI-II (C) protein.</p>
