<abstract>
<p>NETosis is a process by which neutrophils extrude their DNA together with bactericidal proteins that trap and/or kill pathogens. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. to induce NETosis using human <italic>ex vivo</italic> and murine <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Microscopy and fluorometric studies showed that incubation of human neutrophils with <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 (LIC) resulted in the release of DNA extracellular traps (NETs). The bacteria number, pathogenicity and viability were relevant factors for induction of NETs, but bacteria motility was not. Entrapment of LIC in the NETs resulted in LIC death; however, pathogenic but not saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> sp. exerted nuclease activity and degraded DNA. Mice infected with LIC showed circulating NETs after 2 days post-infection (dpi). Depletion of neutrophils with mAb1A8 significantly reduced the amount of intravascular NETs in LIC-infected mice, increasing bacteremia at 3 dpi. Although there was a low bacterial burden, scarce neutrophils and an absence of inflammation in the early stages of infection in the kidney and liver, at the beginning of the leptospiruric phase, the bacterial burden was significantly higher in kidneys of neutrophil-depleted-mice compared to non-depleted and infected mice. Surprisingly, interstitial nephritis was of similar intensity in both groups of infected mice. Taken together, these data suggest that LIC triggers NETs, and that the intravascular formation of these DNA traps appears to be critical not only to prevent early leptospiral dissemination but also to preclude further bacterial burden.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) are a relatively novel pathogen-killing mechanism for extracellular microbes independent of phagocytic uptake and degranulation. Although it was originally proposed that NETs are formed exclusively in tissues at sites of infection, NETs have also been found within blood vessels where they ensnare microbes in circulation during sepsis. Leptospirosis is a global zoonosis that has become prevalent in slum areas, where its diagnosis and treatment may be overlooked. Here, for the first time, we characterized NETs formation as a result of <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. stimulus. We also showed that mice lacking neutrophils exhibit early reduced levels of circulating NETs, but higher bacteremia, a fact that was later associated with higher bacterial burden in kidney. The present results demonstrate that <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. can trigger NET formation and that this innate immune mechanism can play a role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is an important global zoonosis that is more frequent in tropical and subtropical areas, caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus <italic>Leptospira</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Historically, the transmission of leptospirosis was mainly associated with exposure of individuals to wild or farm animals [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Humans usually become infected through contact with urine-contaminated soil and water or with infected animal tissues [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, in recent decades, leptospirosis has become an emerging disease that is prevalent in cities with sanitation deficits and a large population of urban rodent reservoirs [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, leptospirosis has become a neglected tropical disease with an endemo-epidemic pattern associated with slum settlements where deficiencies in the sanitation infrastructure are maximal [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of leptospirosis is not completely understood. It is accepted that pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. have the ability to rapidly disseminate via the blood to many organs of the host during the leptospiremic phase of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. If the host survives, the leptospiruric phase begins 5–10 days later with the increase of specific circulating antibodies after 5–7 days, which clear the bacteria in blood and most organs except the kidney, where bacteria can persist in the proximal tubules for months. As a result, an interstitial nephritis may develop, affecting kidney physiology to varied degrees, and the host will become a carrier that contaminates the environment with their urine.</p>
<p>The extracellular release of the nuclear DNA of neutrophils upon activation by bacterial or fungal species is a relatively novel pathogen-killing mechanism of neutrophils [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These DNA structures, named neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), are composed of chromatin, associated with several proteins with antimicrobial properties such as histones, elastase and myeloperoxidase, among others, and serve as a physical barrier that prevents the further spread of pathogens [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, NETs immobilize and even kill extracellular microbes independently of phagocytic uptake and degranulation. Although it was originally proposed that NETs are formed exclusively in tissues at sites of bacterial or fungal infection, NETs have also been found within blood vessels (specifically in the lung capillaries and liver sinusoids) where they ensnare bacteria in circulation during sepsis [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The role of NETs in the pathogenesis of human leptospirosis is unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we studied and partially characterized <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. as a stimulus for NET formation using human <italic>ex vivo</italic> and murine <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Our results suggest that NETs formation is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.</p>

<p>The virulent <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni (LIC) strain Fiocruz L1–130 [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Manilae (LIM) strain L495 and their mutant <italic>fla</italic>A2 [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the avirulent <italic>Leptospira biflexa</italic> serovar Patoc strain Patoc 1 [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and their mutant <italic>fla</italic>B [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been described previously. The bacteria were cultured at 30°C under aerobic conditions in liquid Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium (Difco, USA), supplemented with 10% rabbit serum (vol/vol), 0.015% L-asparagine (wt/vol), 0.001% sodium pyruvate (wt/vol), 0.001% calcium chloride (wt/vol), 0.001% magnesium chloride (wt/vol), 0.03% peptone (wt/vol) and 0.02% meat extract (wt/vol) [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The bacteria were quantified by direct counting in a Petroff-Hausser chamber (Hausser Scientific, UK) using dark field microscopy. For inactivation studies, bacteria were centrifuged at 20,000 xg for 10 min, resuspended in 4% PFA for 10 min followed by two washes with PBS or were inactivated by heat at 80°C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation and washing.</p>

<title>Isolation of human neutrophils</title>
<p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All healthy patients provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood drawn from healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and dextran sedimentation, as described previously [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cell suspensions contained more than 96% neutrophils, as determined by May Grünwald-Giemsa stained cytopreps, and the levels of monocyte contamination were always 0.2%, as evaluated by CD14 staining and flow cytometry. The cells (5x10<sup>5</sup>/mL) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin (2%).</p>

<title>NET formation assay</title>
<p>NET formation assays have been performed as previously described with minor modifications [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, neutrophils (2x10<sup>5</sup>) were seeded in 24-well flat-bottom-plates with poly-L-lysine-treated coverslips, at pH 7.4, and placed in a humidified incubator at 37°C with CO<sub>2</sub> (5%). After stimulation with PMA or <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp for 180 minutes, NET formation was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy and quantified by evaluation of the DNA released in the supernatants by fluorometry or by measuring nucleosomes with an ELISA kit (Roche).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Immunochemical staining</title>
<p>After PMA or <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. stimulation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PF), permeabilized with Triton x-100 (0.25%), stained with PI (2 mg/mL) washed and mounted on slides with polymount (Polysciences, PA, USA). In selected experiments, the generation of NETs was confirmed by labeling the cells with PI and an antibody against elastase. Images for NET evaluation were taken and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, using a Nikon E200 photomicroscope. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, the slides were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the respective primary antiserum diluted 1:200. After several washes with PBS, samples were incubated with a biotinylated secondary anti-species IgG antibody. Samples were washed and then incubated with peroxide-labeled streptavidin. Incubation with diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxidase substrate (DAB) was allowed to reach the appropriate intensity and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted and observed on a Nikon E200 photomicroscope.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Quantification of extracellular DNA</title>
<p>DNA released from neutrophils during NETosis was digested with MNase (500 mU/ml) for 15 min in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.5mM). EDTA (5 mM) was added to stop the nuclease activity. Supernatants were collected, centrifuged and DNA was measured in the supernatants using sybr gold in a fluorometer (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The calibration curve was constructed using thymus DNA of known concentration. The obtained data was confirmed using an ELISA kit for nucleosomes (Roche).</p>

<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Samples were processed for routine histology and kidney injury was scored as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, nephritis was graded blindly by a pathologist on a scale of 0–4 in a whole longitudinal section of the organ: a score of 0 corresponded to an absence of inflammatory infiltrates or necrosis, 1 denoted minimal inflammation (1 to 5 foci), 2 indicated mild inflammation (&lt; 25% of the section affected or 6–10 foci), 3 suggested moderate inflammation (25–50% of the section affected or 11–20 foci), and 4 corresponded to severe inflammation (more than 50% of the section with inflammatory infiltrates or more than 20 foci).</p>

<title>DNA isolation</title>
<p>Kidney samples were subject to mechanical homogenization in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0; 1 μM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween-20; 1% SDS) containing proteinase K (2 μg/ml) and incubated for 2 h at 56°C. One volume of phenol (pH 8.0) was added and centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was extracted once more with phenol and then four times with 0.5 volumes of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), with centrifugation at 12,000 xg for 10 min at 4°C between each step. DNA was precipitated overnight at -20°C by the addition of 100 μl of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 100% ethanol up to a volume of 1 mL, and then centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 20 min at 4°C. The DNA pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated at 55–60°C for 15–20 min. DNA was stored at -20°C until use [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

<title>Real time-PCR</title>
<p>The real time-PCR (qPCR) studies were performed with a Line-Gene K instrument and software (Bioer, China). The 5x hot firepol Eva green qPCR mix plus (Solis BioDyne, Estonia) was used for all reactions, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Initial denaturation was carried out at 94°C for 10 min, followed by 65 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 15 s at the respective annealing temperatures and 15 s at 72°C each, and a final extension at 72°C for 2 min. A melting curve analysis was performed immediately after amplification at a linear temperature transition rate of 0.3°C/s from 70°C to 89°C with continuous fluorescence acquisition. The size of PCR products was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To obtain bacterial burden values, 16SDNA bacterial gene was amplified and the number of bacteria was referred to that of the host cells [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The primer sequences were (5’&gt;3’) Fw: CATTCATGTTTCGAATCATTTCAAA, and Rv: GAAACACGGACACCCAAAGTA; the size of the amplified fragments was 331 bp.</p>

<title>Neutrophil depletion assays</title>
<p>For the depletion of Ly6G<sup>high</sup> neutrophils <italic>in vivo</italic>, C57BL/6J mice were treated with purified anti-Ly6G rat mAb (1A8, BioXCell, NH, USA). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections (0.5 mg/200 μl PBS) were administered to achieve 90–95% depletion of circulatory neutrophils, as previously described by others [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mice were treated 24 h prior to infection and every 48 h thereafter. Control animals received a similar dose of purified whole rat IgG (Jackson Laboratories, MA, USA).

<title><italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> induce NETs in a concentration-dependent manner</title>
<p>In order to investigate whether <italic>Leptospira</italic> sp. was able to induce NETs, we performed a series of initial experiments using <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni (LIC) and human neutrophils. Stimulation of neutrophils with LIC resulted in the release of fine strands of extracellular DNA with bacteria trapped at their ends (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Using PMA as a positive control, the generation of NETs was confirmed by double-labeling studies with PI, to identify DNA, and with an antibody against elastase, a major neutrophil granular-derived protein that decorates the DNA strands (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Quantitative assays of the released DNA or nucleosomes indicated that the formation of NETs was dependent on bacterial concentration (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). DNA levels in supernatants of LIC alone (without neutrophils) were not significant (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Role of NETs in a murine model of experimental leptospirosis</title>
<p>After having characterized the formation of NETs induced by <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. by human neutrophils using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model, to further characterize the role of NETs in leptospirosis, we extended our studies to an <italic>in vivo</italic> model.

<title>Neutrophil depletion increases bacteremia</title>
<p>To obtain a deeper insight into the role of NETs in the murine model of leptospirosis, we next evaluated the bacterial burden in blood, kidney and liver in animals depleted or not of neutrophils at 3 dpi. In concordance with the decreased levels of nucleosomes, animals depleted of neutrophils had significantly higher bacteremia than those that were not depleted; however, the bacterial burden in kidney and liver was several orders lower and did not show differences (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). We also evaluated the presence of neutrophils in these organs. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry studies revealed a low number of neutrophils in the infected organs in non-depleted animals (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). In addition, histopathological analysis of non-depleted mice showed an absence of significant cell exudate or necrosis (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>).

<title>Early heightened bacteremia increases late kidney bacterial burden</title>
<p>It has been shown that the level of early bacteremia is linked to a later kidney bacterial burden and tissue damage [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Having seen that the depletion of neutrophils resulted in less intravascular NETs and higher bacteremia during the acute host response, we studied whether the increased number of circulating bacteria triggered a higher kidney bacterial burden and eventually more inflammation at a later point after infection. For this aim, the kidneys of mice depleted or not of neutrophils were studied at 14 dpi for bacterial burden and histopathology. Results showed higher bacterial burden, detected either by qPCR or immunohistochemistry, in the kidneys of LIC-infected mice depleted of neutrophils compared to non-depleted mice (<xref rid="pntd.0003927.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A–7C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrated that <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. were able to induce DNA extracellular traps from human neutrophils and suggest that NETs are critical for the prevention of early bacteria dissemination in a murine model of leptospirosis.</p>
<p>The observation that the saprophyte Patoc was less effective in triggering NETosis in human neutrophils than the pathogenic LIC indicated that pathogenicity is a relevant factor for NET formation mediated by <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. In addition, neutrophil stimulation with live bacteria also resulted in higher NET formation than dead bacteria, showing that bacteria viability is also required for an efficient NETosis or a proper recognition by neutrophils. A major characteristic of <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. compared to other bacteria is their great and particular motility. Since it has been recently shown that neutrophils can sense microbial size [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], it is conceivable that they might also sense the particular motility of <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. However, the amount of DNA released by neutrophils incubated with two immotile mutants was similar to the wild-type strain, indicating that motility has no significant influence on NET formation.</p>
<p>Although NETs trap and kill microbes [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], some bacteria evade entrapment in the NET due to the release of different virulence factors including nucleases [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that NETs dramatically reduced <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> survival from over 80% to less than 5% in 180 minutes. Furthermore, the presence of a recombinant DNase restored only 30% of viability, suggesting either that the killing process is very fast and/or that even in the absence of the DNA web, which can be bactericidal <italic>per se</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the microbicidal proteins still exert their effects. In this regard, we showed that LIC was susceptible to the cytotoxic activity of recombinant histone H4. In addition, we also observed that pathogenic LIC and LIM, but not saprophyte Patoc, have the ability to degrade DNA. Although these data suggest that pathogenic species appear to exert nuclease activity, because we have only studied two pathogenic strains and only one saprophyte, our statement needs to be further confirmed by studying other species and strains. A membrane-bound protein has been described and associated with NETs escape for <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. An even more sophisticated mechanism has been described in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> related to the secretion of a nuclease and an adenosine synthase that convert NETs to deoxyadenosine, which triggers the caspase-3-mediated death of macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Whether such a mechanism also operates in <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although first full genome analysis did not include any annotation for nucleases [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], in more recent years, several nucleases or potential nucleases have been annotated in partially sequence <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. genome, usually as hypothetical proteins, as it was found in NCBI databases. In any case, it suggests that the ability of <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. to degrade DNA of extracellular traps is a potential advantage, and is probably a pathogenic determinant because it allows a percentage of bacteria to escape from the NETs entrapment.</p>
<p>Although it has been considered that guinea pigs and hamsters were the appropriate host for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it has been recently demonstrated that, although less susceptible, the mouse can also be used for pathogenesis studies [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The fact that plasmatic levels of circulating nucleosomes dramatically increased after challenge with LIC indicated that NETosis is a mechanism of host defense in early leptospirosis. However, the fact that LIC disseminates to different organs indicates that some bacteria evade NETs attack. Our observation of a nuclease activity in LIC could certainly provide the bacteria with an escape strategy.</p>
<p>If these data were confirmed in human plasma from leptospirosis-infected patients, nucleosomes could be a potential biomarker with which to detect active leptospirosis. Additionally, it would be important to elucidate the occurrence of NETosis in infected patients from leptospirosis endemic areas, such as Iquitos, Peru [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], as persistent NETosis has been related to kidney injury [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been described that as well as neutrophils, monocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], eosinophils [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], basophils [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and even mastocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also produce extracellular traps. Our observation that neutrophil depletion with mAb1A8 treatment reduced almost 80% the plasmatic levels of circulating nucleosomes suggest that neutrophils are the main source of circulating extracellular traps, but did not discriminate if the remaining neutrophils are the source or other cells also contribute to the release of DNA traps in mice. Of note, neutrophil depletion and reduced NET formation were associated with a higher bacteremia, suggesting that besides other bactericidal properties of neutrophils, NETosis is an important mechanism of the host with which to prevent the increased dissemination of pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. These data are in partial agreement with the reported higher bacteremia of <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> in neutrophil-depleted mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] although NET formation was not explored in that study.</p>
<p>Considering that bacterial burden has been associated with the inflammation degree of kidney in experimental murine leptospirosis [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], our finding of nephritis of similar intensity in neutrophil-depleted and non-depleted infected mice at 14 dpi was unexpected. Many factors may be considered in order to explain this situation. First, LIC-induced nephritis was only mild to moderate in C57BL/6J mice, making it more difficult to account for some variations. Second, lympho-monocytic cells constitute the majority of the cell population present in the inflammatory exudate, in agreement with the murine hematological formula, which has a strong preponderance of lymphocytes (75–90%) versus granulocytes (10–25%) [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Third, neutrophil-depleted infected mice had higher bacterial burden, which may balance the absence of neutrophils and their eventual contribution to tissue injury by generating reactive oxygen intermediates and releasing lytic enzymes [<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003927.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; finally, NETs may play a more direct role in the interstitial nephritis induced by LIC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, here, we showed that <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. are able to induce extracellular traps in human neutrophils. The entrapment in the NETs results in the killing of a significant number of <italic>Leptospira</italic>; however, pathogenic but not saprophytic ones, express nuclease/s that might enable some of them to evade this protective mechanism. Intravascular formation of NETs also occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> upon LIC infection and appears to be a key mechanism by which the host attempts to control bacterial dissemination.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that NETs have been associated with leptospirosis. However, our results need further confirmation in other species, including humans.</p>
