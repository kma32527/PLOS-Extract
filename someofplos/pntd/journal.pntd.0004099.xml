<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chagas' disease affects millions of people worldwide and is caused by a microorganism called <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. Treatment options for patients with Chagas' disease is still limited to a small number of drugs, all of them very toxic with important side effects that can be debilitating for the health of patients. Understanding the molecular details of how <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infects humans is an important step toward the development of new drugs for this disease. As part of its life cycle, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> has to invade cells in order to replicate and produce new parasites. This is a complex event, which involves different proteins produced by both the parasite and the human host cells. Among them, there is a large family of highly polymorphic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> proteins important to guide the parasite to the target cells. Here we show that notwithstanding their differences, all members of this family share a small region comprised of nine amino acids that is important for cell recognition and infection by the parasite. Exploring these findings may provide researchers with new insights on how to prevent <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> cell invasion and lead to novel therapeutic alternative for this debilitating disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chagas’ disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical and neglected disease caused by the parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. The disease affects 7 to 8 million people worldwide most of them living in South and Central American countries, accordingly to recent assessments from the World Health Organization, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs340/en/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs340/en/</ext-link>). However, migration has spread the disease to all countries in the Americas and several European and Western Pacific countries. In endemic areas, the parasite is transmitted to humans primarily by triatomine insect vectors (kissing bug) while in non-endemic countries, transmission is restricted by contact with contaminated blood or tissues, such as blood transfusions and organ transplants [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Chagas’ disease can be a life-threatening and debilitating illness to those that develop cardiomyopathy or one of the digestive forms of the disease making it a significant burden for health care and society at large [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Treatment options for patients with Chagas’ disease is still limited to a small number of drugs, all of them very toxic with important side effects that can be debilitating for the health of patients. These drugs are most effective if administered during the acute phase of the disease, a narrow period that lasts for a few weeks soon after infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. But because infected individuals are often asymptomatic or experience only mild fever during the initial stages of the disease, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose correctly Chagas’ disease until it is too late for treatment. In addition to these limitations, there have already been several documented cases of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains resistant to currently available drugs [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is therefore urgent to develop therapeutic alternatives for Chagas’ disease. To understand the molecular details on how <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> interacts with host-cell proteins is an important step toward this goal and to the development of novel therapeutic agents for the disease.</p>
<p>To tackle these challenges, our group has been studying a large family of surface glycoproteins firstly described in our laboratory, which has been implicated in cell adhesion and invasion by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This protein was initially identified as an 85-kDa surface protein expressed selectively by the infective forms of the parasite and named Tc-85 [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Today we know that this protein belongs to a large family of proteins encoded by multiple genes, which are collectively known as the gp85/trans-sialidase (gp85/TS) multigene family [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With hundreds of genes in the genome, all gp85/TS proteins share in common a sialidase domain with Asp-boxes motifs and the peptide motif VTVxNVxLYNRPLN [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Based on sequence similarity, the proteins encoded by this gene family were further subdivided in eight groups [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Proteins that clustered in group I are the only proteins that have enzymatically active trans-sialidase domains, which can remove sialic acid residues from glycoproteins present on the mammalian cell surface and transfer it to glycoproteins on the parasite cell membrane. It has been claimed that the trans-sialidase activity is essential for parasite invasion [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The Tc-85 proteins belong to the group II of the gp85/TS family but lack enzymatic activity and cannot transfer sialic acid. Instead, they have been implicated in cell adhesion and parasite cell entry [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They interact with different receptors present in the extracellular matrix and cell surface, such as laminin [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the intermediate filament proteins cytokeratin and vimentin [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], fibronectin [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], mucin [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the prokineticin-2 receptor [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In earlier studies, we showed that the peptide VTVTNVFLYNRPLN (denominated FLY for short, and derived from the VTVxNVxLYNRPLN motif) present in Tc-85 is a cytokeratin binding site important for parasite cell adhesion and invasion [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Binding of Tc-85 to cytokeratin activates ERK1/2 signaling cascade, resulting in an increase in the number of parasites per cell [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Also, using phage display as a surrogate for the peptide, we showed that the peptide FLY may contribute to tissue tropism by targeting the parasite to specific vascular beds [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Taken together, our studies suggest an important role for cytokeratins and the peptide FLY present in proteins from the gp85/TS family in parasite cell adhesion and invasion.</p>
<p>Herein, we expanded these studies to explore other common peptide motifs found in the gp85/TS proteins in order to check for their possible role in parasite cell adhesion and invasion. By sequence similarity of proteins belonging to the group II, we identified several peptide conserved among all members of this family. Using peptide phage display, these peptides were expressed in bacteriophage and analyzed for their capacity to bind to cells. The results have shown that one of the selected peptides bind to cells and inhibits parasite cell invasion. Interestingly, this peptide also binds to cytokeratin and vimentin, and is found in the three dimensional structure of the protein side by side with the peptide FLY comprising a β-anti-parallel fold that is part of the Laminin-G-like domain (LamG) present in all gp85/TS family members. Therefore, the results herein reported provide further evidence supporting the claim that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> interacts with intermediate filament proteins, with the LamG domain of the gp85/TS family members being an important element in parasite cell adhesion and invasion.</p>

<title>Identification of conserved peptides in gp85/trans-sialidase group II proteins</title>
<p>To identify conserved peptide motifs shared by members of the group II of the gp85/TS family, we aligned 117 protein sequences belonging to this family. Individual sequences were obtained from the TryTryp database [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and considered as belonging to the group II of the gp85/TS family accordingly to a previously described classification [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As expected, analysis of the primary sequences showed that most proteins from group II have molecular mass ranging from 80 to 90 kDa and contain the ASP-box and the VTVxNVxLYNRPLN motifs common to all members of the family (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To visualize and quantify the results of our alignment, first we generated a grid profile to express amino acid frequencies for each position in the alignment (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Next, the moving average for each position was calculated by averaging the frequencies for the initial position plus the frequency of the following eight amino acids. This was done to minimize fluctuations and to facilitate the visualization of conserved regions in the gp85/TS family members (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We chose a moving average of 9 amino acids because it approximates the peptide length that can be displayed by the bacteriophage (see below). Moreover, similar analysis performed with moving averages corresponding to peptides of 7 up to 12 amino acids produced similar profiles. Based on these results, a cut off of 85% identity was chosen to select the 10 most conserved peptides. The selected peptides ranged from 9 to 19 amino acids in length with average identities varying from 85.5 to 92.1% (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The selected peptides were denominated TS1 to TS10 (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0004099.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). It is important to notice that almost all analyzed proteins have an amino-terminal signal peptide, which is not found in the mature protein, and therefore these regions were not considered for peptide selection (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, <bold>arrow</bold>).</p>

<title>Peptide TS9 binds to cells</title>
<p>Having identified common peptide motifs present in all gp85/TS family members, we next sought to determine whether they bind to cells. For that, we employed the phage display technique, which uses bacteriophage as a surrogate for the peptide [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this assay, the phage genome is engineered to allow the production of phage particles that expressed each individual TS peptide fused to the capsid protein III (pIII) of the bacteriophage (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Phage binding was then performed using the BRASIL method, which allows for separation and quantification of cells with their respective bound phage in a single centrifugation step [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

<p>All selected peptides were successfully displayed in the bacteriophage with the exception of peptide TS1. The latter is the longest peptide with 19 amino acids, being too large for pIII display. As is known, the pIII is involved in phage infection and it is often inactivated by peptides longer than 15 amino acids. To solve this problem, peptide TS1 was split into two shorter peptides named TS1a and TS1b, which were successfully displayed by the bacteriophage. These peptides were 16 and 12 amino acids in length, respectively, and contained a 10 amino acid overlap in sequence to increase the likelihood of preserving a potential cell binding epitope present within the original TS1 peptide (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, the epithelial cell line LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> was selected for the cell binding assay since this cell line is routinely utilized for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> culture and infection studies [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among all phage tested in our binding assay, only phage expressing peptide TS9 bound to LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> cells consistently in independent experiments (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). As expected, no binding was observed with the negative control phage Fd-tet that does not display any exogenous peptide and the positive control phage FLY bound to cells [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Binding of phage TS9 to LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> cells was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by the cognate synthetic peptide TS9 (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Phage binding was not affected by the scrambled control peptide. The scrambled peptide used as control has the same amino acid composition of peptide TS9 but with a different primary sequence (sequence LTVIFATVS). These results confirm that phage TS9 binding to cells is mediated by the displayed peptide and due to a random phage mutation. In summary, we have identified a new cell binding peptide present in all members of the gp85/TS family group II.</p>

<title>The motif including peptide TS9 is conserved in all gp85/trans-sialidases</title>
<p>Our initial analysis to select conserved peptides took in consideration only members that belonged to the group II of the gp85/TS family. To determine whether the cell binding peptide TS9 is present in all members of the family, we aligned 505 protein sequences obtained from the TryTryp database and belonging to all 8 groups of the gp85/TS family. The alignment revealed that the motif containing the peptide TS9 is conserved in all members of the family (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The motif encoded in peptide TS5 is also conserved in all members of the family while some of the other TS peptides are partially conserved in select groups. For instance, the motif encoding peptide TS3 is present in proteins belonging to groups I, II, IV, V and VI. But overall, only peptide motifs TS5, TS9 and FLY are conserved throughout all groups of the family. On the whole, the motifs TS9 and FLY co-occur in all members of the family with the exception of a few truncated members that lacks FLY only or both motifs. In summary, the motif TS9 is highly conserved throughout proteins of all groups of the gp85/TS family.</p>

<title>Cytokeratin is a receptor for peptide TS9</title>
<p>Having shown that peptide TS9 binds to LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> cells, a search to identify the cell surface receptor for this peptide was undertaken. To this end, we employed affinity chromatography with the immobilized peptide TS9. Because the peptide is displayed on the bacteriophage fused to the amino-terminal end of the pIII protein, it was immobilized on the resin by its terminal carboxyl group for better mimicking the spatial orientation of the peptide in the bacteriophage. Protein extracts from LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> cells were then incubated with the immobilized peptide and after extensive wash, bound proteins were eluted sequentially with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 8M urea (in phosphate buffer). All eluates were analyzed by protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).</p>
<p>Proteins with calculated molecular masses of 49, 53, 59 and 66 kDa were enriched in the 8M urea eluate, compared with the total extract (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The regions containing these proteins were excised from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry for protein identification. Cytokeratin-18 and cytokeratin-8 (KRT18 and KRT8) were the proteins with the highest scores identified as possible ligands for peptide TS9 present in the region of the gel corresponding to molecular masses of 49 and 53 kDa (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0004099.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, proteins indicated by arrows a and b). Interestingly, two other cytoskeletal protein (actin, 49 kDa, arrow a; and tubulin, 59 kDa, arrow c) and HSP90 (66 kDa, arrow d) were identified as a possible ligands for peptide TS9 or more likely, they result from the strong association with the cytoskeleton and associated proteins <xref rid="pntd.0004099.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>To confirm that peptide TS9 binds to cytokeratin, we employed again a phage display assay. Because there are several genes encoding different cytokeratin proteins, and cells often express more than one gene, we expanded our validation to include other recombinant members of this family (as well as vimentin, another intermediate filament protein). The results of our binding assay show that both phage TS9 and FLY bind to all intermediate filament proteins that were tested (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). The interaction is specific since no binding of phage TS9 was observed to gelatin or bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the control phage Fd-tet did not bind to any of the proteins tested. The binding profile of phage TS9 is also in agreement with the results of the affinity chromatography in which at least two different cytokeratin proteins were eluted from the peptide column. In summary, these data corroborate previous reports showing that proteins from the gp85/TS family can interact with different cytokeratins and intermediate filament proteins expressed by cells [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Peptide TS9 and FLY form a possible binding site in the LamG domain</title>
<p>Both peptides TS9 and FLY are separated from each other by approximately 100 amino acids in the primary sequence of the gp85/TS proteins and, therefore, they cannot form a linear binding site. So, we questioned whether they could be located next to each other in the tridimensional structure of the protein, thus constituting a conformational binding site. In fact, proteins belonging to the gp85/TS family are typically composed of two domains: a sialidase domain at the amino-terminus (NCBI CDD id: cl21531) and a laminin-G like domain (LamG) at the carboxyl-terminus (NCBI CDD id: cl00102). Indeed, both peptides TS9 and FLY are contained within the LamG domain, the peptide TS9 being located towards the beginning of the domain, while FLY is at the carboxyl-terminus (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). To assess the locations of peptides TS9 and FLY in the tridimensional structure of the LamG domain, we analyzed available tridimensional structure of trypanosomatid sialidases as well as a molecular model of the LamG domain from a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> group II gp85/TS family member. We selected the Tc85-11 protein (GenBank id: AAD13347) as a representative member because it is a cell binding protein belonging to the group II of the gp85/TS family [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and it was previously used in molecular modeling studies by our group [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. By searching the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) protein databank we identified a close homologue of Tc85-11 with a known tertiary structure of the sialidase from <italic>Trypanosoma rangeli</italic> (PDB id: 1WCS) [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This protein shares 50% of sequence similarity with Tc85-11 and contains both peptides TS9 and FLY with substitutions that are also present in other members of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> gp85/TS family (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). To build the Tc85-11 model we used the I-Tasser server [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] having the 1WCS structure as a template. Analysis of the crystal structure of the sialidase and the Tc85-11 model indicated that, although the peptides TS9 and FLY are further apart in the primary sequence, they are close to each other in space constituting antiparallel β-sheet structures (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). These data suggest that peptides TS9 and FLY may comprise a single non-linear conformational binding site for cytokeratins present in all members of the gp85/TS family and further implicates the LamG domain as important for parasite adhesion.</p>

<p>The gp85/TS family members have long been associated with cell adhesion and invasion by our group [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and others [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Having shown that the Tc85-11<sup>LamG</sup> domain and the gp85/TS derived peptide TS9 bind to host cells and interact with cytokeratins, we tested whether they could modulate parasite cell infection. Epithelial LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> cells were pre-incubated with synthetic peptide TS9 (200 μM) for 15 minutes before the addition of infectious trypomastigote forms to the cell culture. After 2 hours of infection, cells were washed to remove extracellular parasites, and further cultured for 48 hours. Cells were then fixed and the number of infected cells and parasites (amastigotes) per infected cells quantified. Peptide TS9 reduced <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection by 78% (<xref rid="pntd.0004099.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>).

Treatment of host cells and parasites with vehicle alone or with the scrambled version of peptide TS9 at the same concentration had no effect on parasite cell infection.

<p>Of note, the LamG fold found in gp85/TS proteins is also present in the lectin concanavalin-A (protein family, pfam13385 concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanases superfamily).

Because some members of the gp85/TS family have the capacity to transfer sialic acids between carbohydrates chains, it is enticing to ponder whether the LamG domain of the gp85/TS proteins could bind to carbohydrates and facilitate this process.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Proteins belonging to the group II of the gp85/TS family have long been implicated in adhesion to cells and extracellular matrix components but the structural details of such interactions are still largely unknown. One of the difficulties to unveil the structural details of such interactions is the large number of proteins contained in these multigene families; having hundreds of individual members, it is often challenging to associate an individual member to its ligand. Besides, the characterization of each member separately is not practical. This task is particularly challenging in the case of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> where genetic tools like RNAi cannot be used [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here we took a systematic approach to identify conserved peptide motifs shared by multiple members of the family and analyze them using bacteriophage and functional assays. This approach proved successful and led to the identification of the peptide TS9, a novel motif involved in parasite cell adhesion and invasion. Noteworthy is the fact that the identification of peptide TS9 further confirms previous results from our group and reinforces the knowledge that cytokeratins are an important ligands for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> adhesion and invasion [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It also highlights the importance in parasite biology of the LamG domain contained in all gp85/TS family members.</p>
<p>Cytokeratins are essential proteins for the cell structure and major constituents of intermediate filaments. Therefore, they are often viewed solely as intracellular proteins. However, it is of note that several studies have reported the ectopic expression of cytokeratins, such as in the extracellular milieu at the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Studies from our group and others have emphasized the important role for extracellular cytokeratin expression in host-pathogen interactions [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. And these reports pointing to an important role for extracellularly expressed cytokeratins are not limited to cell-parasite interactions. KRT8 expression on the surface of cancer cells has been associated with enhanced adhesion to fibronectin and the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Anti-KRT8 antibodies inhibit the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor binding and plasmin production by breast cancer cells, increasing tumor invasive potential [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that proteins belonging to other groups of filaments (microtubules and microfilaments) were also identified by affinity chromatography on peptide TS9. Whether they are receptors for the gp85/TS proteins remains to be investigated. It is known that amastigote forms do express proteins from the gp85/TS family and may, therefore, interact intracellularly with cytokeratins [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and other cytoskeletal proteins. This interaction may be important for parasite proliferation in the cytoplasm. In fact, the knockdown of cytokeratin-18 has been shown to affect the parasite's ability to replicate inside host cells [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. But because cells often express several cytokeratins and given the promiscuous interaction of gp85 with these different cytokeratin proteins, it is still difficult to assess the effects of a single gene knockdown on parasite cell invasion and proliferation.</p>
<p>The results of the inhibition assay in the present study suggest that peptide TS9 affects <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection by interfering with the ability of the parasite to adhere to the cell surface, cytokeratin being one of the possible cell receptors involved in this process. These data corroborate previous findings from our group that have implicated the conserved peptide FLY and, therefore, the motif VTVxNVxLYNRPLN, in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> cell adhesion to cytokeratins/vimentin and invasion [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nonetheless, we are puzzled by the fact that both peptides have sometime shown opposite effects in specific assays. For instance, peptide TS9 consistently inhibits parasite infection and blocks the interaction of LamG domain with cytokeratins; the peptide FLY on the other hand, also inhibits the binding of the LamG domain to cytokeratins but increases parasite cell infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One possible explanation for this conundrum is the fact that the peptide FLY has a direct effect on host cells, inducing cytokeratin remodeling and activation of ERK signaling cascades [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which in turn might trigger alternative pathways utilized by the parasite to enter the cells. We do not know if peptide TS9 also affects host cells in the same manner. Notwithstanding the effect on cell infection, and in aggregate, our results point to an important role for these two conserved peptide motifs, the LamG domain and cytokeratins in parasite biology. Consequently, the mapping of two highly conserved cytokeratin binding peptides (TS9 and FLY) to the same binding site within the LamG domain is unlikely to be a coincidence but further studies will be necessary to unveil the molecular details of their interactions and how they operate in the process.</p>
<p>Noteworthy is the fact that the peptide TS9 overlaps with a previously described immunodominant epitope. Peptide TS9 (<underline>FTLV</underline>ASVTI) shares the FTLV sequence found in two immunodominant peptides (ANYK<underline>FTLV</underline> and VNYD<underline>FTLV</underline>) derived from gp85/TS family members; these peptides are found within the same region of peptide TS9 [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Peptides ANYKFTLV and VNYDFTLV are dominant epitopes responsible for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activation in mice and humans, with up to 40% of all CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to them. The host immune response represents an important selective pressure against parasite populations bearing these sequences. Despite the evolutionary pressure these peptides continue to be expressed by the parasite. Our results suggest that binding to cytokeratin may explain why these peptides have not changed over time, since they are necessary for parasite cell-host interaction.</p>
<p>Of note is our observation that gp85/TS proteins contain a LamG domain. The LamG domain or LNS domain (for Laminin-alpha, Neurexin and Sex hormone-binding globulin) is found in a large number of extracellular proteins. Examples of proteins containing LamG domains are laminins, collagens, agrin, neurexins, pentraxins, sex steroid binding protein (SBP/SHBG) and concanavalin-A, among others. It is notable the different functions and binding properties exhibited by LamG domains in these proteins. When present in adhesion molecules they mediate receptor binding, cell adhesion and migration [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The LamG domains found in the sex steroid binding protein SBP/SHBG bind small molecules such as estradiol [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the other hand, the LamG domains present in pentraxins interact with a multitude of ligands derived from microbial pathogens and cellular debris produced by inflammatory processes [<xref rid="pntd.0004099.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Finally, in the concanavalin-A molecule, the LamG domain is lectin that binds to α-D-mannosyl and α-D-glucosyl residues. Whether the LamG domain in gp85/TS proteins bind carbohydrates and facilitates the transfer of sialic acids, it remains an open question. But if it does, as suggested by comparison with the concanavalin-A structure, it would probably constitute an entirely new binding site and possibly an interesting target for drug development.</p>
<p>Finally, this work outlines a novel systematic approach to study gene families found in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> and other parasites. By combining <italic>in silico</italic> analysis to reduce the complexity of a large family of proteins with phage display, we established a functional assay to screen the common peptide motifs shared by all members this family. This framework proved successful and led to the identification of a cell adhesion peptide, important for parasite cell invasion. Certainly, this approach can be applied to other gene families present in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> (or other organisms) such as mucin, mucin-associated proteins (MASP), dispersed gene family 1 (DGF-1) and GP63. Novel peptides relevant for host-parasite interaction, such as the cytokeratin binding peptide characterized in this study, may be identified and help to understand the molecular details of cell infection.</p>
