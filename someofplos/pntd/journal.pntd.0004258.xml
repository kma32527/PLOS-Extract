<abstract>
<p>The basic metabolic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is essential for biotransformation of sterols and xenobiotics including drugs, for synthesis and degradation of signaling molecules in all living organisms. Most eukaryotes including free-living flatworms have numerous paralogues of the CYP gene encoding heme monooxygenases with specific substrate range. Notably, by contrast, the parasitic flatworms have only one CYP gene. The role of this enzyme in the physiology and biochemistry of helminths is not known. The flukes and tapeworms are the etiologic agents of major neglected tropical diseases of humanity. Three helminth infections (<italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>, <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic>) are considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as definite causes of cancer. We focused our research on the human liver fluke <italic>Opisthorchis felineus</italic>, an emerging source of biliary tract disease including bile duct cancer in Russia and central Europe. The aims of this study were (i) to determine the significance of the CYP activity for the morphology and survival of the liver fluke, (ii) to assess CYP ability to metabolize xenobiotics, and (iii) to localize the CYP activity in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> tissues. We observed high constitutive expression of CYP mRNA (Real-time PCR) in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>. This enzyme metabolized xenobiotics selective for mammalian CYP2E1, CYP2B, CYP3A, but not CYP1A, as determined by liquid chromatography and imaging analyses. Tissue localization studies revealed the CYP activity in excretory channels, while suppression of CYP mRNA by RNA interference was accompanied by morphological changes of the excretory system and increased mortality rates of the worms. These results suggest that the CYP function is linked to worm metabolism and detoxification. The findings also suggest that the CYP enzyme is involved in vitally important processes in the organism of parasites and is a potential drug target.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The basic metabolic system CYP (cytochrome P450) is essential for biotransformation of sterols and xenobiotics, for synthesis and degradation of signaling molecules in all living organisms. Most eukaryotes including free-living flatworms evolved numerous paralogues of the CYP gene. Notably, by contrast, flukes and tapeworms–the etiologic agents of major neglected tropical diseases of humanity, have only one gene. However, the role of P450 in the physiology and biochemistry of helminths is not known. This report presents the first functional study of the CYP enzyme of any of the parasitic flatworms. We focused our research on the food-borne human liver fluke, <italic>Opisthorchis felineus</italic>, an emerging source of biliary tract diseases in Russia, Kazakhstan and central Europe. Here we report that this liver fluke has evolved a highly expressed functional monooxygenase system with broad substrate specificity. Tissue localization studies and suppression of CYP mRNA by RNA interference revealed the CYP function is linked to the excretory system and possibly to metabolism and detoxification. The fluke’s monooxygenase likely is a model for orthologues of the singular CYP of parasitic flatworms at large, where it plays a critical role in the pathogen’s metabolism that contributes to worm survival and drug resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The heme-containing enzymes cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are widely distributed in living organisms from bacteria to mammals [reviewed in Refs. <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CYP enzymes act as components of a monooxygenase system; they display biological functions ranging from detoxification of environmental pollutants to synthesis and degradation of endogenous signaling molecules [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 80% of existing prescription drugs undergo the unavoidable step of biotransformation mediated by cytochromes Р450. This step typically limits the speed of the biotransformation process and of excretion of the drugs [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Given these roles, CYP are functionally important for survival of invading pathogens. For example, CYP in <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> is essential for cell growth, infection, ergosterol biosynthesis, and other processes. Parasites with one allele of CYP show impaired growth, lower membrane potential, reduced virulence, and higher sensitivity to drugs [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Inactivation of both copies of a CYP gene is lethal for this microbe [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, one of the CYP enzymes participates in the synthesis of a steroid hormone necessary for worm development [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], whereas the other CYP enzyme is involved in fatty acids homeostasis [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is known that in fungi, the CYP system is an important pharmacological target because it participates in the synthesis of the cell wall of spores, in the metabolism of membrane sterols, and in production of metabolites with antibacterial properties [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that CYP enzymes may be linked to the synthesis of unique sterol-like metabolites, oxysterols, and catechol-estrogens of specific structure known from trematodes, specifically <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Oxysterols, which are oxidation products of cholesterol and are generated by enzymatic (cytochromes P450) or non-enzymatic processes [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], can be mutagenic and genotoxic and may possess pro-oxidative and proinflammatory properties that promote carcinogenesis [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Accordingly, analysis and characterization of the function of CYP of parasites can be anticipated to lead to a deeper understanding of diverse aspects of parasite physiology that contribute to cell survival, drug resistance, and maintenance and evolution of the host-parasite relationship.</p>
<p>Despite importance of the CYP system for the physiology of parasites and other pathogens and for drug detoxification, CYP enzymes of eukaryotic parasites remain poorly understood. It had long been thought that parasitic worms lost CYPs [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, monooxygenase transformation of certain drugs into inactive metabolites was demonstrated in flukes [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The role of this activity in the drug resistance of parasites was also described [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, increased formation of oxidized inactive metabolites of albendazole and triclabendazole in resistant isolates of parasitic flatworms has been reported; furthermore, inhibition of the oxidative metabolism increases sensitivity of the worms to anthelminthic drugs [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, a monooxygenase activity was discovered in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>haematobium</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings indicated the existence of a CYP system in parasitic clades of the phylum Platyhelminthes; however, data are not yet available on either the composition of the CYP system or the function of these enzymes in flatworms.</p>
<p>The liver flukes <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>viverrini</italic>, and <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> of the family Opisthorchiidae (Class Trematoda) cause serious human diseases affecting bile ducts and the gall bladder. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recognizes infection with two of these three helminths as a definitive cause of cholangiocarcinoma: the liver flukes <italic>O</italic>. <italic>viverrini</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Carcinogenic effects of an infection are also possible for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>, given the similar signs of infection development and disease course [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> (Rivolta, 1884) occurred primarily on the territory of the former USSR, but increasingly it is being found in other regions of Europe [see Refs. <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is estimated that worldwide, there are 1.6 million cases of opisthorchiasis resulting from infection with <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>. Despite its public health significance, this widespread Eurasian species is one of the most poorly studied human liver flukes.</p>
<p>The ‘CYPome’ of parasitic flatworms, including liver flukes (Opisthorchiidae, Fasciolidae), blood flukes (Schistosomatidae), and cestodes (Taeniidae) contains only one CYP gene [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, flavin monooxygenase genes appeared to be absent. Apparently, in these parasites, the main enzyme that has a monooxygenase activity toward xenobiotics is CYP. We cloned and sequenced CYP cDNA of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> (GenBank ID: JF920147), and predicted the structure of the protein it encodes. The predicted protein has conserved structure, contains functional domains (characteristic of mammalian microsomal CYP enzymes involved in biotransformation of xenobiotics) and turned out to be most closely related in its structure to the mammalian CYP2 subfamily. Furthermore, this CYP gene exhibits strong expression of mRNA. Nevertheless, little or nothing is known about the functions of the protein.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to analyze the functional organization of the metabolic system of cytochromes P450 in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>, the liver fluke of humans and other fish-eating mammals. In particular, we set out to determine the functional significance of the monooxygenase of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>, to assess its ability to metabolize xenobiotics, to identify the possible spectrum of substrate specificity of this CYP, evaluate the inducibility of the CYP gene, and to determine the necessity of expression of this gene on the phenotype of the liver fluke.</p>

<title>Animals and parasites</title>
<p>Golden Syrian hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) were purchased from the Puschino Animal Facility (Russia) and subsequently bred at the Animal Facility of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics, SB RAS (RFMEFI61914X0005), (Russia). Euthanasia was performed by decapitation, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
<p>Metacercariae of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> were collected from naturally infected fish (<italic>Leuciscus idus</italic>) from the Ob River near the city of Novosibirsk, Western Siberia. Territories where sample collection (fishing) took place were neither conservation areas nor private, nor otherwise protected; hence, no fishing permits were required. The fish species collected are not considered endangered or rare, and the fishing methods complied with the Federal Law N166-F3 of 20.12.2004 (ed. 18.07.2011), "Fishing and conservation of water bio-resources”.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> treatment of liver flukes</title>
<p>Adult liver flukes were recovered from the hepatobiliary tract of hamsters infected three months earlier with 100 metacercariae [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Newly excysted metacercariae (NEM) were hatched from metacercariae using incubation with 0.1% trypsin in sterile saline solution at 37°C for 15 min [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The parasites were incubated in the RPMI medium supplemented with 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma–Aldrich, USA) and 1% glucose at 37°C for either 4 or 24 h with one of the xenobiotics. Xenobiotics that were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma–Aldrich) were added in the form of 100× stock solutions to final concentrations of 10 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), 50 μM phenobarbital (PB; Fluka, Switzerland), 10 μM dexamethazone (DEX; Sigma–Aldrich), 50 mM ethanol, 0.1 μg/mL praziquantel (PZQ; Bayer, Germany), or 40 μM ketoconazole (Zdorovie, Russia). Cholesterol (Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 96% ethanol at the concentration of 10 mg/mL to prepare a 2000× stock solution. Bile acids (Sigma–Aldrich) were dissolved in water to prepare a stock solution 400 mg/mL and were added to the medium as a 100× solution. Hemoglobin (Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) to prepare a 2% stock solution and was added to the incubation media as a 20× solution. Forty micromolar resorufin, pentoxyresorufin (PR), and methoxyresorufin (MR) (<xref rid="pntd.0004258.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) (AnaSpec, USA) were dissolved in DMSO to prepare 100× solutions and were added to the final concentrations 0.1, 0.5, and 5 μM, respectively. The controls received an equivalent amount of the vehicle (DMSO). The incubation assays for each xenobiotic concentration and each developmental stage of the parasite were conducted in triplicate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) (anticoagulant)-treated blood and bile were isolated from a hamster and were diluted 4-fold for the experiments.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Primer design</title>
<p>Primers for real-time PCR were designed using the transcriptome of maritae of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> from Solexa. The primers and probes were as follows: the <italic>Ub</italic> (ubiquitin) gene (GenBank ID: JK649790) (UB_F: 5’-TCCGCCACTCCGTCTTACGC, UB_R: 5’-ACTAGCCGATGACATGCGGTGGA) and <italic>MrpL16</italic> (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L16) gene (GenBank ID: JK649791) (MrpL16_F: 5’-TCCCTTCCCGGCTCGTTTCGT, MrpL16_R: 5’-AGTGCTTGGCGAGCATCAGCA, MrpL16 Probe: 5’-R6G-ACAAGAGTTGCTGGACTGCGAGAA-BHQ2 (Synthol, Russia); paramyosin gene (GenBank ID:AF311774.1) (Paramyosin_F: 5’-AGAACGTCGCCTGCGCGAGG; Paramyosin_R: 5’-GGGCCCGATCGGCGGCTT); alfa-tubulin gene (GenBank ID: JK624299) (TUA_F: 5’-CGCGTCCGATGGTGTACCGTCC; TUA_R: 5’-GGTGCGAACCGGCACTTACCGT); <italic>CYP</italic> gene (GenBank ID: JF920147) (CYP_F2: 5’-ACTGGAGAATAGCAACCAAACGCCA; CYP_R1: 5’-CCCGTTCTCCATCTCGCACATCG). To measure the level of <italic>CYP</italic> gene expression in experiments with dsRNA, the CYP primers were as follows: CYP_F3: 5’-GCCCTTCGGCTTACCCCACA; CYP_R2: 5’-CCGCTGGACCTCTTGTAAGCCCA (the full ORF spanning positions 1053–1354). For droplet digital PCR primers and probes were as follows: <italic>MrpL16</italic> (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L16) gene (MrpL16_F: 5’-TCCCTTCCCGGCTCGTTTCGT, MrpL16_R: 5’-AGTGCTTGGCGAGCATCAGCA, MrpL16 Probe: 5’-R6G-ACAAGAGTTGCTGGACTGCGAGAA-BHQ2 (Synthol, Russia) and <italic>CYP</italic> gene (CYP_F2: 5’-ACTGGAGAATAGCAACCAAACGCCA; CYP_R1: 5’-CCCGTTCTCCATCTCGCACATCG; CYP Probe: 5’-FAM-TGCCG-ATTAT-TCGCC-GAACT-ATCTG-G–RTQ1 (Synthol, Russia)).</p>

<title>Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR, and Droplet Digital PCR</title>
<p>In the real-time PCR assay, we used adult worms and newly excysted metacercariae (NEM) of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>. For each data point, we used five adult worms extracted from the same hamster and 400 to 500 NEM for RNA isolation. For the real-time PCR assays with dsRNA, total RNA was isolated from individual adult worms.</p>
<p>Total RNA for real-time PCR was isolated from flukes using the TRI reagent (Ambion, USA). Concentrations of RNA were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND1000, NanoDrop Technologies, USA). One microgram of total RNA was used for the synthesis of single-stranded cDNA. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the RevertAid Kit (Fermentas, EU). Expression levels of the genes were measured by means of real-time PCR using the EVA Green Reagent Mix (Synthol, Russia) on a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, USA). As endogenous internal controls for normalization, we chose genes <italic>Ub</italic> and <italic>MrpL16</italic> because these genes had the lowest M-value (Bio-Rad) [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Triplicate real-time PCR reactions were conducted for each sample. After the PCRs, a dissociation curve was constructed using the melting curve program of the thermal cycler to confirm the presence of a single PCR product, which was further confirmed using gel electrophoresis. Tenfold serial dilution of standard cDNA samples was used for PCR efficiency calculations. The fold change in the target gene expression (that was normalized to the control) relative to the control was calculated from the threshold cycle values (C<sub>t</sub>).

<p>To identify satisfactory RT-PCR reference genes, we evaluated expression stability across developmental stages and among seven treatment regimens with xenobiotics. Expression stability for a particular gene is reflected by the M-value calculated as a mean standard deviation of the log-transformed expression ratio across samples for the particular gene relative to other reference genes remaining in the gene panel. The calculation was performed by stepwise exclusion of individual genes with the highest M-value from the other genes until reaching the last two genes with the smallest M value. Various investigators defined M &lt; 1.5 as an acceptable criterion for selection of RT-PCR reference genes [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine whether the differences existed between experimental mean values. <italic>P</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant (Statistica 6.0). The data are shown as mean ± SEM. Results of three independent experiments are presented.</p>
<p>Duplex ddPCR reaction mixes were prepared as follows. 10 μL of 2× ddPCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad, USA) and CYP and MRPL16 primers (final concentration of 300 nM) and CYP and MRPL16 probes (final concentration of 180 nM) were mixed, and cDNA template added. ddPCR workflow and data analysis were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Briefly, droplets were generated in 8-well cartridges, using the QX100 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, USA) as described. Water-in-oil emulsions were transferred to a 96-well plate and amplified. Thermal cycling conditions were: 10 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of a two-step thermal profile comprising 15 s denaturation at 95°C, and 60 s annealing/extension at 100% ramp rate at 60°C. After amplification, products were denatured at 98°C for 10 minutes, then cooled to 12°C. Plates were then transferred to the QX100 droplet reader (Bio-Rad, USA). Data acquisition and analysis was performed using QuantaSoft (Bio-Rad, USA). CYP gene expression levels were quantified and values were simultaneously normalized to <italic>MrpL16</italic> reference gene expression.

<p>After recovery from hamsters at euthanasia, the worms were rinsed in sterile 0.9% NaCl to remove residual host cell debris. The flukes were maintained in the RPMI medium containing 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma–Aldrich) and 1% glucose at 37°C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 18–24 h. To deliver CYP dsRNA, adult worms (18–40 per treatment group) were transferred to a cuvette (4-mm gap; Bio-Rad) in 0.1 mL electroporation buffer (RPMI-1640, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic, and 1% glucose) containing 50 μg of <italic>CYP</italic> dsRNA or <italic>LUC</italic> dsRNA. Each group of worms was subjected to square wave electroporation with a single 20-ms pulse at 125 V (Gene PulserXcell, Bio-Rad).

Similarly treated worms in electroporation buffer without the dsRNA served as controls. The worms were soaked for eight days with daily refreshment of the medium. The worms were collected for analysis on days 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 after electroporation. Images were acquired using the inverted microscope Axiovert 40CFL equipped with Axiocam ICC3 (Zeiss).

<p>To estimate the mortality rates, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were built using the 'survival‘ (v.2.38) R package. A 95% confidence interval was calculated (out of three independent experiments) by the log-rank test using the 'survival‘ (v.2.38) R package.

<title>CYP mRNA induction and selection of an internal reference gene</title>
<p>The level of CYP mRNA expression was assessed using real-time PCR. As endogenous internal controls for normalization, four candidate genes were chosen: paramyosin, α-tubulin (TUA), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L16 (MrpL16), and ubiquitin-related protein (Ub).</p>
<p>Based on the outcome of preliminary experiments (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> section), for assessment of the CYP mRNA level, we selected two genes: Ub and MrpL16. The CYP mRNA level was measured using simultaneous normalization to these two genes. The level of CYP mRNA was 10-fold lower at the NEM stage than in adult worms. We tested the main types of inducers of CYP on adult worms and on NEM: DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and TCDD (typical aryl-hydrocarbon receptor ligands), phenobarbital (constitutive androstane receptor activator), dexamethasone (DEX, a pregnane X receptor ligand), ethanol. In addition we used potential endogenous inducers: blood plasma [EDTA-treated blood] and bile from <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> and hemoglobin (Sigma). Results of three independent experiments are presented (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>).

<title>CYP activity</title>
<p>During isolation of the microsomal fraction of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> proteins, CYP is isolated in the inactive state P420 [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, it was not possible to determine the monooxygenase activity using the method that is widely used for studies of the activity of microsomal enzymes of mammals. Previously, genes encoding other types of monooxygenases have not been observed in datasets of nucleotide sequences of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic>, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>viverrini</italic> and other parasitic species. Thus, the main enzyme that is responsible for the monooxygenase activity in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> seems to be the cytochrome Р450. We hypothesized that the ability of the parasite to metabolize certain substrates of mammalian cytochromes P450 would mean functional activity of the cytochrome P450 of the parasite. It is believed that passive xenobiotic transfer through the external helminth surface is the predominant entry mechanism for most chemicals [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, by adding into the incubation medium various substrates for CYP and by quantifying them, we could determine the possible spectrum of substrate specificity of the monooxygenase.</p>
<p>Chlorzoxazone (CLZ), a commonly used systemic myorelaxant acting on the central nervous system [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], proved to be a highly specific substrate of CYP2E1. CLZ is readily hydroxylated to 6-OH-chlorzoxazone (6-OH-CLZ) by mammalian CYP2E1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p><bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold> shows a typical chromatogram of separation of the products of CLZ metabolism. In a sample of the incubation medium containing CLZ, we detected a peak corresponding to 6-OH-CLZ (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). To confirm whether the metabolite formed can be produced by active CYP450, during the cultivation, we used treatment with ketoconazole. This compound is a widely known inhibitor of microsomal cytochromes. It can directly interact with different CYPs at a concentration 40nM [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and inhibit enzymatic activity of CYPs at concentration 3–40 μM [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. After simultaneous addition of ketoconazole and CLZ, the concentration of 6OH-CLZ significantly decreased and was only 10% of the 6OH-CLZ level under normal culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B, 2C and 2G</xref></bold>). To the sample of the medium during treatment with ketoconazole, we also added a standard of 6OH-CLZ: there was an increase of precisely the peak that corresponds to the retention time of 6OH-CLZ (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> activity</title>
<p>Alkoxyresorufins PR, MR, and benzoxyresorufin (BR) are fluorogenic substrates of cytochrome P450 that yield a fluorescent product (resorufin) after enzymatic cleavage of the alkyl group (a monooxygenase dealkylation reaction) [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We hypothesized that an active monooxygenase in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> tissues would produce a fluorescent product, which would be visible under a rhodamine filter. After 20 h of incubation with PR, large aggregates of fluorescent particles were visible (size ~5 μm) in the region of excretory channels and excretory bladder of the fluke (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D, 3E and 3F</xref></bold>). It is noteworthy that fluorescence was not evident in the caeca and the surrounding tissues. After incubation with BR, we also observed formation of resorufin particles but in smaller amounts (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref></bold>), whereas after MR treatment, no particles were formed (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold>).

<p>As an additional control, to reduce the CYP protein activity, we added ketoconazole (a CYP inhibitor) to the medium with control worms.

Thus, the worms exhibited similar changes in phenotype after suppression of CYP expression and after treatment with the CYP inhibitor.</p>

<p>To test the hypothesis that CYP suppression reduced survival in a medium similar to the situation with the biliary tree <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conducted the following experiment. Eight days after CYP dsRNA treatment, the worms were kept for one day in RPMI medium containing hemoglobin, bile acids, and cholesterol. It turned out that the changes in the medium composition did not cause alterations of the phenotype, motility, or viability of the worms. To assess functional activity of the CYP enzyme five days after the knockdown of CYP mRNA, we tested the worms <italic>in situ</italic> for the ability to metabolize pentoxyresorufin (PR) in the tissues of the worms. The ability to metabolize PR into resorufin was decreased but remained. <bold><xref rid="pntd.0004258.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F and 4G</xref></bold> show granules of resorufin in tissues of worms. To assess the capacity of worms to metabolize PR, 3 randomly-selected parasites from each treatment group were treated for 20 h with pentoxyresorufin, and images were acquired using multiple fluorescence filters. The total size of the resorufin particles in each worm was measured. After being exported, the data were further analyzed in Microsoft Excel.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we investigated a gene from the liver fluke <italic>Opisthorchis felineus</italic> that encodes a member of the CYP family of enzymes that participate in biotransformation of xenobiotics. According to the present findings, this CYP enzyme can metabolize xenobiotics and, in parallel, can metabolize substrates selective for mammalian CYP2E1, CYP2B, CYP3A, though not CYP1A.</p>
<p>Recently numerous reports describe novel CYP, including enzymes of viral, bacterial, and nematode origin (reviewed in [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). The number of genes encoding CYP (‘CYPome’) per genome ranges from a single isoform in some species of bacteria and fungi to dozens and hundreds in flowering plants. In free-living nematodes, the ‘CYPome’ contains several dozen divergent proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. All parasitic flatworms investigated to date possess only one cytochrome P450, regardless of the habitat. In particular, liver flukes of the families Opisthorchiidae and Fasciolidae, blood flukes (Schistosomatidae), and cyclophyllidean tapeworms of the family Taeniidae, which colonize the intestine, retain only a single cytochrome P450 [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>It is possible that the mature <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> flukes that colonize bile ducts (where components of their habitat lie beyond the “barrier” of the enzymatic CYP system and of other types of oxygenases of the host’s liver) are virtually without need for a multicomponent monooxygenase system. In this context, two scenarios of functional and catalytic activity of the fluke CYP enzyme are most likely. In the first, this enzyme displays sufficiently broad substrate specificity to participate in metabolism of numerous xenobiotics, including anthelmintic drugs. In this case, the biological activity of the CYP system can be oriented toward the mechanisms of defense and adaptation of parasites. In the second, the function of this enzyme may be highly specialized and necessary primarily for one defined physiological process, for example, biotransformation of a key endogenous substrate.</p>
<p>Aggregates of fluorescent particles (size ~5 μm) accumulated in the region of excretory channels of the fluke. This finding suggested liberation of a product of the monooxygenase reaction (resorufin) in the excretory system and of activity of the CYP enzyme in this system but not in the caeca or pharynx. It appears that the function of the fluke CYP is linked to the excretory system of the parasite; possibly to metabolism and detoxification. The link of the CYP protein to the excretory system was also supported by changes in worm morphology following suppression of CYP by RNA interference (RNAi). Starting on day 3–4, a substantial increase in the size of and a change in the shape of the excretory channels and excretory bladder took place. The same morphological changes occurred following prolonged treatment with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the CYP enzymatic activity [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. After RNAi, levels of expression of CYP fell to only 30% of that of wild type worms, and the enzymatic activity as indicated by hydrolysis of pentoxyresorufin decreased significantly in tissues of the parasite. Taken together, the results demonstrated the efficacy of CYP RNA interference in attenuating the level of CYP transcription, which was reflected at the protein level by the reduction in enzyme activity <italic>in situ</italic>. Notably, increased mortality rates after CYP RNA knockdown indicated the importance of this enzyme.</p>
<p>The role of this cytochrome in the parasitic lifestyle remains unknown. The system with its broad substrate specificity and with conservative organization probably participates in critical physiological processes of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> metabolism. A question arises whether this phenomenon is related to the synthesis of proinflammatory and potentially carcinogenic compounds, e.g., oxysterol-like and catechol estrogen quinone–like chemicals released by the flukes [<xref rid="pntd.0004258.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p>CYP gene exhibited constitutive expression in adult worms and in NEM. This regulation of CYP expression in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> contrasts to the CYP gene induction mechanisms of mammals, where the enhancement of expression of subfamilies of CYP in response to xenobiotics can be several hundred–fold. Perhaps the absence of gene induction in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic> reflects continuous elevated expression of the CYP gene. Our data show that the level of expression of this gene in adult worms was similar to that of the housekeeping gene <italic>MrpL16</italic> and 10- to 12-fold higher compared to the metacercariae. Such elevated expression indicates the enzyme plays a key homeostatic role in the flukes resident in the bile ducts. Indeed, this phenomenon is likely to be related to the components of the habitat—bile and blood of the host.</p>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This is apparently the first study of CYP enzymes in parasitic flatworms. CYP enzymes participate in metabolism of xenobiotics and, in addition, can metabolize selective substrates for mammalian CYP2E1, CYP2B, CYP3A, but not CYP1A. It appears that the function of this CYP is linked to the excretory system of the fluke and possibly to metabolism and detoxification. Given the high level of the CYP gene expression, the search for the key endogenous substrate of CYP of parasitic flatworms is warranted, and can be anticipated to facilitate elucidation of the biochemical processes of this carcinogenic liver fluke and indeed flatworm parasites at large, and for understanding of the development of mechanisms of resistance to antiparasitic drugs.</p>
<p>Finally, the enzyme represents a promising drug target. Cytochromes P450 are a group of proteins involved in the synthesis of physiologically active compounds, in drug metabolism, and in biotransformation of xenobiotics. We identified only one CYP450 enzyme in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>felineus</italic>. Both from the point of view of identifying drug targets and understanding the physiology of the <italic>Opisthorchis</italic> parasite, CYP450 needs to be investigated.</p>
