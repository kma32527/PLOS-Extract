<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes amoebiasis, including amebic dysentery and liver abscesses. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> invades host tissues by adhering onto cells and phagocytosing them depending on the adaptation and expression of pathogenic factors, including Gal/GalNAc lectin. We have previously reported that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> possesses multiple CXXC sequence motifs, with the intermediate subunit of Gal/GalNAc lectin (i.e., Igl) as a key factor affecting the amoeba's pathogenicity. The present work showed the effect of immunization with recombinant Igl on amebic liver abscess formation and the corresponding immunological properties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>A prokaryotic expression system was used to prepare the full-length Igl and the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal fragments (C-Igl) of Igl. Vaccine efficacy was assessed by challenging hamsters with an intrahepatic injection of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites. Hamsters intramuscularly immunized with full-length Igl and C-Igl were found to be 92% and 96% immune to liver abscess formation, respectively. Immune-response evaluation revealed that C-Igl can generate significant humoral immune responses, with high levels of antibodies in sera from immunized hamsters inhibiting 80% of trophozoites adherence to mammalian cells and inducing 80% more complement-mediated lysis of trophozoites compared with the control. C-Igl was further assessed for its cellular response by cytokine-gene qPCR analysis. The productions of IL-4 (8.4-fold) and IL-10 (2-fold) in the spleen cells of immunized hamsters were enhanced after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation. IL-4 expression was also supported by increased programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 gene.</p>

<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Immunobiochemical characterization strongly suggests the potential of recombinant Igl, especially the C-terminal fragment, as a vaccine candidate against amoebiasis. Moreover, protection through Th2-cell participation enabled effective humoral immunity against amebic liver abscesses.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Amebiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, is the second leading cause of death from protozoan diseases. Vaccination is considered as an effective strategy against amebiasis; however, clinical vaccines have yet to be developed. We previously reported that the intermediate subunit of Gal/GalNAc lectin (Igl) of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> is a key factor related to the adherence and cytotoxicity of this parasite to host cells. This study focused on the immune efficacy and immunological characterization of recombinant Igl and its fragments. Highly effective protection was observed in the hamsters immunized intramuscularly with the C-terminal fragment of Igl (C-Igl). C-Igl was further assessed to determine the immunological basis of protection. The immunized hamsters generated high levels of specific antibodies; these hamsters also showed an enhanced complementary-mediated lysis. The spleen cells from the immunized hamsters produced the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 after these cells were stimulated by C-Igl <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results demonstrate that recombinant Igl, particularly the C-terminal fragment, is a candidate vaccine for amebiasis. Nevertheless, further studies on Igl should be conducted to explore the preliminary steps of the development of vaccines for human amebiasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amebiasis caused by infection with <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is one of the most problematic parasitic diseases affecting people in both developing and developed countries. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> causes an estimated 50 million collective cases of dysentery, colitis, and extraintestinal abscesses resulting in 40,000–100,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref004">4</xref>]. Its mortality is ranked third among parasitic diseases. Despite the medical importance of this parasite, an effective vaccine to prevent amebiasis has yet to become available. However, several <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> antigens have been proposed as potential vaccines, including galactose- and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Gal/GalNAc)-inhibitable lectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref011">11</xref>], serine-rich protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref013">13</xref>], peroxiredoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref014">14</xref>], lipophosphoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref016">16</xref>], and metallosurface protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref018">18</xref>]. The molecule showing the highest potential among these candidates is the 170 kDa heavy subunit of Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin (Hgl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref021">21</xref>]. In particularly the LecA domain (578 aa to1154 aa) in Hgl is considered to be a potential vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>A glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 150 kDa intermediate subunit (Igl) is non-covalently associated with Hgl and contributes to adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref024">24</xref>]. Immunization with native Igl as well as passive immunization with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to Igl can inhibit amebic liver abscess (ALA) formation in hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref026">26</xref>]. The two isoforms of Igl, namely, Igl-1 and Igl-2, are cysteine-rich proteins containing multiple CXXC motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref027">27</xref>]. Igl was identified as a lectin because it binds to a Gal-affinity column. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> Igl has also been detected in addition to Hgl in the protein fraction that binds to GalNAc-bovine serum albumin-coated magnetic beads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref028">28</xref>]. However, the amino acid sequences of both Igls lack a known carbohydrate recognition domain of other lectins. Igl-1 seems to be more closely associated with the pathogenicity of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref029">29</xref>]. Igl-1 is a major target of the humoral immune response in seropositive individuals. Upon evaluating the reactivity of sera from patients with amebiasis to various Igl-1 fragments, namely, the N-terminal (N-Igl), middle (M-Igl), and C-terminal (C-Igl) fragments, the highest sensitivity was observed in C-Igl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref030">30</xref>]. All sera from asymptomatic patients reacted with M-Igl and C-Igl, suggesting that antibodies to the epitopes located in M-Igl and C-Igl function in preventing the invasion of trophozoites into the host tissue. Human mAb recognizing N-Igl does not inhibit amebic adherence to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, whereas another mAb that is reactive with M-Igl and C-Igl inhibited adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluate Igl-1 (rIgl-1) and three fragments, N-Igl, M-Igl, and C-Igl, as potential recombinant vaccines in hamster model. We also analyze the significance of humoral, cell-mediated immune responses and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) signaling pathway in protection from ALA.</p>

<title>Animals and ameba</title>
<p>Groups of three- to four-week-old male hamsters were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. and Shanghai Songlian Experimental Animal Factory for vaccination. Male BABL/c mice, aged four to six weeks, were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. for experiments on Igl-elicited cytokines. Trophozoites of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> SAW755CR and HM-1:IMSS strains were grown under axenic conditions at 36.5°C in YIMDHA-S medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref032">32</xref>] containing 15% (v⁄v) heat-inactivated adult bovine serum.

<title>Preparation of vaccine antigens</title>
<p>The recombinant <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> antigens (rIgl-1, rIgl-2, N-Igl, M-Igl, and C-Igl) were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref030">30</xref>]. Briefly, the target plasmids were transformed in host bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS and inclusion bodies were harvested after inducement. The refolding of proteins were conducted using the Protein Refolding Kit (Novagen) and then refolded proteins were further purified using a Ni-NTA His•Bind Resins kit (Novagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of the recombinant antigens was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. After preparing recombinant antigens, approximately 50 μg of each recombinant protein was intraperitoneally injected into the BABL/c mice to test the toxicity of these proteins. Contaminating residual endotoxin was quantified using a commercial kit (EKT-5M, Jin Shan Chuan, Co., Ltd., China). All animals received less than 4.8 EU/kg per dose of antigen in accordance with the accepted guidelines for preclinical research.</p>

<title>Immunization course</title>
<p>A total of 15 heads of 40 g to 50 g hamsters were intramuscularly immunized with 50 μg of rIgl-1 emulsified in TiterMax Gold (Sigma–Aldrich) adjuvant. Boosters were inoculated on days 21 and 35 with the same amount of rIgl-1 in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. The control group comprising 12 heads of hamsters was sham-immunized with PBS in adjuvant. Before the challenge, a small amount of serum from each hamster was isolated for the serological test and adherence inhibition assay. In addition, 24 heads of 40 g to 50 g hamsters were intramuscularly immunized with 50 μg of N-Igl, M-Igl, and C-Igl emulsified in TiterMax Gold adjuvant in an identical course described above. The control group, which included eight hamsters, was immunized with PBS in adjuvant. Thirdly, 15 heads of 40 g to 50 g hamsters were intramuscularly immunized with 50 μg of C-Igl emulsified in TiterMax Gold adjuvant in an identical course described above. The control group, which included 12 hamsters, was immunized with PBS in adjuvant.</p>
<p>To assess antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response, three vaccination experiments were conducted by using 40 heads of 40 g to 50 g hamsters intramuscularly immunized with C-Igl (10, 10 and 20 hamsters each in three experiments) and 20 heads of 40 g to 50 g hamsters treated as control (5, 5 and 10 hamsters each in three experiments).

<title>Measurement of immuno-reactivity by ELISA, western immunoblot and dot blot analysis</title>
<p>To confirm antigen-specific antibody responses, 40 sera from C-Igl-immunized hamsters and 20 sera from sham-immunized hamsters were used. The antigen-specific binding of IgG to C-Igl, rIgl-1, and rIgl-2 were analyzed by ELISA as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref031">31</xref>]. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with C-Igl, rIgl-1, or rIgl-2 and then treated with PBS containing 1% skim milk.

<title>Determination of immune-associated gene expression by real-time PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA (1 μg) of the spleen cells from the sham-immunized or C-Igl-immunized hamsters was purified with an RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, USA). The cDNA was synthesized with a Primescript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Japan) using oligo(dT) primers. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out in a final reaction volume of 20 μl according to the manufacturer’s recommendations on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). Reactions were performed in a 96-well plate with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan), which contained primers for each cytokine gene and PD1 and PD1 ligands (PD1-L1 and PD1-L2), with β-actin as the reference gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004419.t001">Table 1</xref>). The amplification cycling conditions were as follows: 30 s at 95°C and 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C and 35 s at 60°C. Analysis by qRT-PCR of gene expression for each cytokine was conducted during the log phase of product accumulation during which the Ct values correlated linearly with relative DNA copy numbers.

<p>To examine whether antibodies from the hamsters immunized with C-Igl were able to exterminate trophozoites by complement-mediated lysis, the trophozoites were incubated with heat-inactivated serum from the immunized hamsters and guinea pigs’ complement. The numbers of living trophozoites significantly decreased after incubation with heat-inactivated C-Igl-immunized serum at 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions in comparison with control group in the presence of guinea pigs’ complement. This effect was also dependent on complement dose, and might be due to specific activation of the classical complement cascade, for trophozoites lysis was abolished by presence of 2mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 10mM EGTA. Trophozoites lysis proceeded in the sham-immunized control group indicated the presence of antibody-independent activation of the alternative complement pathway. Spontaneous trophozoites lysis in the assays was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004419.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These data indicated that immunization with C-Igl fragments stimulated antibodies that might accelerate amebic lysis by activation of the complement.</p>

<title>Expression of cytokine genes in immune hamsters</title>
<p>We investigated the expression of Th2-type and Th1-type cytokines in the protection elicited by Igl.

<p>The technique of qRT-PCR was used to confirm the expression patterns of cytokine genes in the spleen cells of the hamsters immunized with C-Igl or PBS using the same primers as in the one-step RT-PCR assay.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients who recover from amebiasis acquire a certain level of resistance to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> reinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref039">39</xref>]. Effective vaccines to prevent amebiasis could enable the eradication of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. Vaccines targeting native and recombinant forms of the protozoan Gal/GalNAc lectin proteins have been successful in protecting animals against intestinal amebiasis and ALA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref043">43</xref>]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that vaccination with native Igl can protect hamsters from ALA formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref026">26</xref>]. However, we could not completely rule out the possibility of contamination with other proteins in the fraction. In addition, this fraction appeared to contain both Igl-1 and Igl-2. The current study demonstrated that vaccination with rIgl-1 prepared in bacteria was effective for the prevention of ALA formation. Although we did not evaluate the efficacy of Igl-2 as a vaccine, Igl-1 could be a suitable vaccine candidate because the Western immunoblot analysis and dot blot analysis suggested that antibodies to Igl-2 were also elicited by immunization with Igl-1.</p>
<p>The most important observation in the current study is the effective protection achieved with C-Igl vaccination, suggesting that the domain responsible for protection from ALA formation was located in C-Igl. The result of the current study was also consistent with a previous observation, in which C-Igl is strongly recognized by sera from patients with amebiasis, including asymptomatic cyst passers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The serum antibodies produced in response to C-Igl vaccination inhibited CHO cell adherence to trophozoites in a dose-dependent manner. Antibodies elicited by immunization with C-Igl demonstrated a complement-mediated cytolytic effect on trophozoites, probably due to specific activation of the classical complement cascade. These results established recombinant Igl as a candidate antigen for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> vaccines, which may be widely applied for protection against human amebiasis. It is known that an epitope on Hgl confer antibody-mediated protection against invasive amebiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref043">43</xref>]. In Hgl, a carbohydrate recognition domain exists in the C-terminal region of the subunit. Although carbohydrate recognition domain has not yet been identified in Igl, a similar protective mechanism by antibodies may exist.</p>
<p>Extraintestinal abscesses, especially ALA, are a fatal feature of infection with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. An important question is how this parasite adheres to and crosses the liver endothelium and induces abscess formation. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the protection of hamsters against ALA conferred by the intramuscular administration of C-Igl were not completely understood. The intramuscular route of immunization demonstrated a high efficiency in inducing a systemic protective response similar to the intraperitoneal immunization route. We hypothesized that after immunization, the C-Igl antigen could directly affect dendritic cells and that the activation of B cells induced systemic immune responses via antibodies. Thus, the intramuscular route showed classic advantages such as manageability, minimal invasiveness, and no requirement of special materials. Moreover, our results suggest that vaccination could yield antibodies to protect against the development of liver abscesses if the trophozoites manage to pass from the intestine to the liver and then adhere to and cross the liver endothelium.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that multivalent vaccines, such as Gal/GalNAc specific lectin, cysteine proteinase, serine-rich protein, and trophozoite surface metalloprotease EhMSP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref044">44</xref>], can indeed be developed. Successful delivery and expression of the recombinant C-Igl fragment in the prokaryotic expression system further indicate that it can be a basic component of an effective vaccine against human amebiasis.</p>
<p>As previously reported, once amebic infection is activated, T cells may participate in the immune response against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> through the following three pathways: (i) directly lysing trophozoites in a contact-dependent manner; (ii) producing cytokines, which activate effector cells for anti-ameba activity; and (iii) providing help for B-cell antibody production. A recent study provided evidence of amebicidal activity by both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and transfer of protection conferred by Gal/GalNAc lectin-derived vaccines to naive animals merely by the transfer of immune T cells (CD4, CD8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref011">11</xref>]. In the current study, the C-Igl was identified as an effector molecule sufficient for immunizing hamsters. In addition, we demonstrated that a 48 h incubation of hamster spleen cells with C-Igl or ConA resulted in Th2 cytokine secretion and that this may contribute to Igl-mediated protection. The data also showed a correlation between partial and sterile protection against ALA with the local production of high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 genes by qRT-PCR.</p>
<p>A comparable level of IL-2 and IL-4 secreted by lymphoid cells from both spleen and hepatic lymph node of gerbils during the early stage of ALA development after responding to soluble amebic antigen. This finding indicated both Th1 and Th2 response phenotypes were present during amebiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref045">45</xref>]. In general, the Th2 cytokine responses are characterized by IL-4, -5, -6, -9 and -10 productions. Th1 responses tend to promote cell-mediated immunity whereas Th2 responses are associated with humoral immunity. In our experiments, IL-4 and IL-10 were predominantly secreted by Th2 cells after vaccination with C-Igl. Given that B cells required assistance from T cells to complete their differentiation. IL-4 may function in amebic infections by facilitating antibody production of B cells when naive B cells circulate in the blood and lymph, pass through the secondary lymphoid organs, most notably to the spleen and lymph nodes. Thus, amebic antigen-specific T cells must act to promote antibody production, probably through cytokine release and contact-dependent stimulation of B cells.</p>
<p>Levels of a Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, were evaluated in immunized hamsters and sham-immunized animals. The animals immunized with C-Igl and PBS presented an average of a 1.5-fold level difference that was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004419.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Similarly, no statistical difference was found in TNF-α and IL-6 levels between the immunized hamsters and sham-immunized animals. Th2 clones are known to be involved in the production of IL-4 and IL-5 in addition to IL-6, IL-9, and IL-10, these cells play critical roles in generating humoral immune responses including the production of IgG1. Cytokines from Th2 cells can inhibit the actions of Th1 and vice versa. The regulation of balance of cytokine profile may be determined by the character of the certain antigens.</p>
<p>Although the expression levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the C-Igl- and sham-immunized animal groups were similar after C-Igl stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>, significant cytokine upregulation was observed between the PBS- and C-Igl-stimulated groups. One hypothesis is that C-Igl possesses the ability to activate Th1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines. To verify this hypothesis, spleen cells from the non-immunized hamsters and mice were used in <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation assays. Similar RNA expression levels of cytokines by spleen cells were observed in the non-immunized hamsters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004419.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) compared with those in the sham-immunized hamsters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004419.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The results indicated that expression levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6, but not IL-4 were elevated in the C-Igl-stimulated hamster and mouse groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004419.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>), both hamster and mouse spleen cells were incapable of proliferation after C-Igl stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004419.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). In comparison, IL-4 level was elevated in the C-Igl-immunized hamsters when the cells were activated by C-Igl (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004419.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These data indicated that IL-4 secretion was an antigen specific reaction to the vaccine and IL-4 may play an important role in protecting hamsters from ALA in C-Igl-mediated protection.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours after trophozoites inoculation to the liver, macrophages at the periphery of the lesions begin to form an ill-defined border between the parenchymal cells and central necrotic area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref046">46</xref>]. In addition, IL-4 has been reported to play a pathogenic role in the persistence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection through the suppression of protective IFN-γ in intestinal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref047">47</xref>]. After vaccination with C-Igl, IL-4 and IL-10 were predominantly secreted by Th2 cells. Both of these cytokines may elicit amebicidal action by suppressing macrophages in the liver, as well as controlling excessive inflammation and protecting hamsters from ALA formation. In intestinal and extraintestinal amebiasis, host inflammatory response contributes to tissue damage. TNF-α was a critical cytokine mediator of tissue destruction during amebiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref048">48</xref>] and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is an important immunoregulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref049">49</xref>]. IL-10 counteracts an exaggerated pro-inflammatory immune response by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α.</p>
<p>The PD1–PD1-L pathway, including the PD1 receptor and its two ligands, PD1-L1 and PD1-L2, could regulate the activation, inhibition and fine-tuning of T-cell responses. Moreover, PD1-L1 was elevated after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with C-Igl in C-Igl-vaccinated hamsters. The PD1–PD-L pathway is regarded as a key regulator of the crucial balance signals needed for effective immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref050">50</xref>] and main avoidance of an excessive immune response in the presence of foreign antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref051">51</xref>] that could exert synergistic effects with IL-10. It has also been reported that expression of PD1-L1 is correlated with secretion of IL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref052">52</xref>]. IL-4 supports the generation of Th2 cells, which simultaneously activate B cells to induce systemic immune responses and yield antibodies to protect against the development of liver abscesses. Previously, longitudinal field studies also demonstrated an association between anti-lectin antibody, IL-4, and immunization of ALA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref053">53</xref>]. Not coincidentally, in an analysis of the immune response to hepatitis B virus infection, it was found that patients who recovered from acute hepatitis B virus infection activated the Th2 release of IL-4 and IL-10, which induced the B-cell production of antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, the results presented here demonstrated a model in which C-Igl induces Th2 response, which then generates a cell-mediated immune response. Possibly through IL-4 and IL-10 produced by antigen-specific Th2 cells mediated immunity and collaborated with B-cells for antibody production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004419.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, the results presented in the current study provide support for the further development of C-Igl as a target antigen for vaccination to prevent invasive amebiasis. The results also provide new insights into Igl, a cysteine-rich surface antigen of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. Further studies are underway to explore preliminary steps toward the development of a human amebiasis vaccine.</p>
