<title>Background</title>
<p>Infectious diseases pose a severe worldwide threat to human and livestock health. While early diagnosis could enable prompt preventive interventions, the majority of diseases are found in rural settings where basic laboratory facilities are scarce. Under such field conditions, point-of-care immunoassays provide an appropriate solution for rapid and reliable diagnosis. The limiting steps in the development of the assay are the identification of a suitable target antigen and the selection of appropriate high affinity capture and detection antibodies. To meet these challenges, we describe the development of a Nanobody (Nb)-based antigen detection assay generated from a Nb library directed against the soluble proteome of an infectious agent. In this study, <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> was chosen as a model system.</p>

<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>An alpaca was vaccinated with whole-parasite soluble proteome to generate a Nb library from which the most potent <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> specific Nb sandwich immunoassay (Nb474H-Nb474B) was selected. First, the Nb474-homologous sandwich ELISA (Nb474-ELISA) was shown to detect experimental infections with high Positive Predictive Value (98%), Sensitivity (87%) and Specificity (94%). Second, it was demonstrated under experimental conditions that the assay serves as test-of-cure after Berenil treatment. Finally, this assay allowed target antigen identification. The latter was independently purified through immuno-capturing from (i) <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> soluble proteome, (ii) <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> secretome preparation and (iii) sera of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infected mice. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified the target as <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> glycosomal aldolase.</p>

<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>The results show that glycosomal aldolase is a candidate biomarker for active <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections.

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The lack of diagnostic tests that are sensitive, affordable and user-friendly is the impediment to early detection and containment of infectious diseases. For these reasons, African trypanosomosis continues to pose serious threat to the communities that are unable to access laboratory services. Assays that are able to address above-mentioned challenges would greatly reduce the disease burden. Although few relatively sensitive agglutination assays for some forms of African trypanosomosis have been adapted to field conditions, the tests are not reliable indicators of active infections given the fact that they only detect antibodies. The barrier in the development of alternative tests capable of revealing ongoing infections through antigen detection is the lack of potent monoclonal antibodies that can compete with infection-induced host antibodies for the circulating parasite antigens. Using <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> as a model system, we demonstrate that Nanobodies (Nbs) targeting the parasite glycosomal aldolase can detect active infections. The strategy described addresses the technical shortcoming of conventional monoclonal antibody-based assay development by adopting an unbiased proteome screening approach combined with a phage panning strategy that is adapted to avoid interference of the infection-induced host antibody response. Hence, this study shows prospect for future development of Nb-based tests for other infectious diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infectious diseases are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity after non-communicable diseases worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref001">1</xref>]. Although the majority of these infectious diseases are treatable, the lack of better diagnostic facilities in the developing countries is a major impediment to their control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref002">2</xref>]. While disease diagnosis based on clinical signs is relatively cheap, it is not reliable as some infections are latent, mixed, and/or cause pathologies with overlapping symptoms. In some cases, disease diagnosis based on clinical signs may be of little use as the symptoms only manifest themselves when the patient has entered a terminal stage. The diagnosis of infectious diseases is facilitated by the use of sophisticated molecular techniques such as PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref003">3</xref>]. While these are reliable and increase the chance of detecting an infection even before the manifestation of clinical signs, their use in resource-constrained settings is untenable as they require automated equipment. To overcome the need for the latter, efforts are ongoing to adapt PCR to field conditions through point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref005">5</xref>] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref006">6</xref>]. The adoption of these POC nucleic acid techniques in developing countries remains uncertain given the fact that these new devices still operate on expensive reagents, require amplification steps, and sample processing. The majority of the cases of infectious diseases are found in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref007">7</xref>], where basic laboratory facilities are scarce. Therefore, most laboratories in these parts of the world have resorted to relatively inexpensive (but less sensitive) microscopy-based techniques for routine diagnosis of infectious diseases. Among other factors, the over-reliance on microscopy contributes to the high burden of infections in these regions, as most pathogens escape detection thereby allowing their proliferation and continued transmission. Hence, there is an urgent need for diagnostic tools that can immediately and reliably detect active infections under field conditions.</p>
<p>Where nucleic acid-based assays are unaffordable and sensitivity of microscopy becomes limited, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used as an alternative tool for detection of infectious diseases through antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref008">8</xref>] or antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref009">9</xref>] detection. ELISA is a robust technique which operates without sophisticated equipments therefore favoring its application in less well-established laboratories such as those found in developing countries. Furthermore, ELISA can be easily adapted to non-laboratory conditions as exemplified by the availability of several immuno-based POC tests for important infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref010">10</xref>]. Antibody-based ELISA relies on the host immune system to amplify the detection limit. Two issues arise that need to be taken into account, i.e. reduced specificity due to cross-reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref011">11</xref>] and the inability to differentiate past from ongoing infections because of the persistence of antibodies in the circulation after clearance of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref013">13</xref>]. While both issues are obviously avoided using an antigen detection format, the development of the latter faces its own hurdles. First, the antigen should be present in detectable quantities during an active infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref014">14</xref>] and should not cross-react with diagnostic tests used for the detection of other endemic parasites. Second, the capture and detection antibodies of the ELISA should be able to out-compete the host anti-pathogen antibodies which usually form immune complexes with the circulating antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref015">15</xref>]. Nanobody (Nb) technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref016">16</xref>] offers prospects for the identification of native parasite antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref017">17</xref>] as well as the detection of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref019">19</xref>] and these have rejuvenated hope for refining the developments of ELISA and immuno-based POC tests. Nbs are recombinant proteins derived from the gene coding for the antigen binding portion of heavy-chain only IgG antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref020">20</xref>]. Nbs possess a relatively high thermostability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref022">22</xref>] and are thereby attractive for the development of immunodiagnostic tests that could be applicable in hot climate such as the sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, Nbs could be used to overcome certain challenges faced by tests based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). It has been documented that host antibodies usually sequester parasite antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref015">15</xref>]. Given that MAbs are conventional antibodies, the host IgG molecules might conceal the epitopes from the MAbs employed in the diagnostic test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref023">23</xref>]. Nb-based diagnostics could circumvent this binding interference caused by the host’s antibody response. Because Nbs possess extensive CDR3 loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref024">24</xref>], this allows tight binding of epitopes distinct from those recognized by conventional antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref025">25</xref>]. In other words, Nbs should detect both free antigens as well as those bound by host antibodies, which would make Nb-based diagnostic tests rather attractive. The exploitation of the Nb technology might expedite the development of potent ELISA and immuno-based POC tests for the endemic tropical diseases.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the development of a Nb-based ELISA for the specific detection of active pathogen infections. <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>, the most important causative agent of African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT), was chosen as a model system for our studies. Besides vector control, the only way to curb the spread of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections is by case detection followed by drug treatment. Unfortunately, current diagnostic tests are not very reliable or user-friendly under field conditions. The buffy coat technique (BCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref026">26</xref>], which is a general microscopy-based test for trypanosomes, is limited by sensitivity in cases where there is low parasitemia such as in chronic infections or where sample examination is delayed. While sensitive and specific detection of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections can be achieved through species specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref027">27</xref>] or pan-trypanosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref031">31</xref>] PCRs, these molecular assays are not widely used for diagnosis of animal trypanosomes. Attempts to develop antibody-based ELISAs failed due to lack of specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref033">33</xref>]. Even if it would have succeeded, the persistence of antibodies in the circulation several months after clearance of infections would compromise its application for establishing cure as was observed with the test for fascioliasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref012">12</xref>]. An attempt to develop an antigen detection ELISA test for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> based on MAbs was hampered by a lack of sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref034">34</xref>]. Thus, limitations of the current diagnostic tests for trypanosomes require that more research be done to provide assays that meet the expectations of end-users.</p>
<p>In this study, a potent Nb (Nb474) was obtained from an immune cDNA library prepared starting from the immunization of an alpaca with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> TC13 soluble proteome. Nb474 was used for development of a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> specific antigen detection homologous sandwich ELISA (Nb474-ELISA). The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of Nbs as tools for the specific diagnosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections and of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> glycosomal fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (<italic>Tco</italic>ALD) as a candidate biomarker. Moreover, we show that the Nb474-ELISA is able to detect active <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections under experimental and natural conditions, and that it serves as a test-of-cure in experimental settings.</p>

<title>Animals, sample collection and examination</title>
<p>Mice (C57BL/6) approximately 6 weeks old (Janvier) were infected with 5000 trypanosomes per animal through intra-peritoneal route. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture (for one time bleeding) or peri-orbital route (for multiple collections at different time points). The blood was stored at 4°C for at least 17 h to allow clotting prior to serum collection for immediate examination or storage at -20°C. For quantification of parasites, the mouse tail tip was nipped with scissors and 2.5 μl of blood was drawn by pipette.

Bound phages were eluted with 100mM triethylamine (pH~10) and neutralized with 100 μl 1M Tris (pH 8.2). After three panning cycles, enrichment was assessed by phage ELISA. For phage ELISA, soluble proteins of the four <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> strains used in panning were coated in parallel on Nunc plate (1μg/well) and uncoated (control) wells were filled with PBS (100 μl). Display phages (10<sup>10</sup>) of panning rounds 0–3 were added to coated and uncoated wells. The fifth pair (blank) of wells were filled with blocking buffer only. Thereafter, anti-M13 conjugate horse radish peroxidase (HRP) (100 μl) (GE Healthcare) diluted (1/2000) in blocking buffer was added followed by 1-Step ultra 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Thermo scientific) added at (100 μl/well). The reaction was stopped with 1M sulphuric acid (50 μl/well). OD<sub>450nm</sub> was read on spectrophotometer (EL<sub>X</sub>808 Ultra-microplate reader, Bio-Tek instruments) using Gen5 software. For screening, single colonies (of the panning rounds 2 and 3) were expressed in Terrific Broth medium as mini culture (1ml) supplemented with ampicillin and 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactosidase (IPTG). Cells were harvested, disrupted by osmotic shock and the periplasmic extracts (100 μl) were added to wells coated with soluble proteome (1 μg/well). A screening strategy was adopted in order to maximize chances of selecting <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> cross-reactive Nbs. Thus, clones obtained after panning on TC13 soluble proteome were screened on MF3cl2 soluble protein; clones obtained after panning on MF3cl2 soluble proteome were screened on TC13 soluble proteome; clones obtained after panning on STIB68 soluble proteome were screened on TRT17 soluble proteome; and clones obtained after panning on TRT17 soluble proteome were screened on STIB68 soluble proteome. Negative control wells (also coated with soluble proteome) were filled with PBS (100 μl) instead of periplasmic extract. Positive binders were detected using biotinylated mouse Anti-HA IgG (Eurogentec), HRP-conjugated streptavidin (strep-HRP) (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories) and TMB substrate. Colonies were considered positive when the ratio of OD between the test and control wells was ≥ 2. All the positive binders selected were re-screened on naive mouse serum diluted (1/10) in PBS in order to identify mouse protein binders.

<title>Affinity purification of the target antigen</title>
<p>Starting materials for the purification of the antigen from soluble proteome and plasma were 7 mg <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> soluble proteome diluted in 20 ml PBS and 30 ml of serum collected at the first peak parasitemia. The purification process was started by concentrating the samples using a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) concentrator (Sartorius stedim biotech). Thereafter both fractions (the concentrate and filtrate) were tested by Nb-ELISA after normalization for protein concentration. A higher OD<sub>450nm</sub> was recorded in the concentrate compared to filtrate. Then, the concentrate was washed twice by adding 5ml PBS to the concentrator and draining by centrifugation (453 g, 4°C) until 1 ml. Washed concentrate was stored at -20°C until the antigen was purified.</p>
<p>The homologous Nb sandwich ELISA was then employed to isolate the native target antigen from the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> soluble proteome, the sera collected from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infected mice, and the secretome of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> IL3000. Four Nunc plates were coated with capturing Nb (Nb474H) (5 μg/well) overnight at 4°C. The following morning, coating was discarded and the plate was washed three times. Protein-Free T20 Blocking Buffer (Thermo scientific) was added (300 μl/well) for 3 h at 22°C. Blocking buffer was discarded and wells were washed three times. Soluble proteome diluted in blocking buffer was added (10 μg/well) to the first pair of the plates and the second pair of the plates was filled with sera (100 μl/well) diluted (1/10) in blocking buffer. Binding of the target antigen to Nb474H proceeded for 2 h at 22°C and unbound molecules were discarded. Detection Nb (Nb474B) was added (2 ng/well) and incubated for 1 h at 22°C. Subsequently, the unbound Nb474B was discarded and the wells were washed four times. Strep-HRP was added to four control wells that were purposely included to serve as reporter for sandwich formation. The rest of the wells were filled with blocking buffer (100 μl/well) for 1 h at 22°C. The plates were emptied and washed five times. Control wells were filled with TMB (100 μl/well) and wells where captured antigen was to be eluted were filled with 0.3M glycine HCl pH 3.0 (100μl/well). Elution was proceeded with gentle rocking on bench top shaker over 30 min at 22°C. The eluted samples were collected and pooled according to the starting material (soluble proteome or sera). Solutions obtained from each pair of plates (about 19.2 ml) was concentrated to 1 ml using a 5000 MWCO concentrator of 15 ml capacity and then to 30 μl using a 3000 MWCO concentrator of 400 μl capacity. The concentrators with low MWCO and capacities were employed in the last steps in order to trap the eluted native target antigen-Nb complex as well as dissociated Nbs. The eluted samples (6 μg from lysate plates and 8 μg from serum plates) were resolved on SDS-PAGE alongside Nbs (Nb474H and Nb474B) as control and proteins visualized using silver staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref043">43</xref>].

<title>Specific diagnosis of experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections in mice using a Nb474-ELISA</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to develop an assay for the specific diagnosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections. The assay consists of a Nb474-based homologous sandwich ELISA, in which a His-tagged version of the Nb was used for antigen capturing (Nb474H), while a biotin version of the Nb was used for detection (Nb474B). To test the cross-reactivity of the Nb474-ELISA, the latter was validated on soluble proteome of different species of animal infective trypanosomes. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, a significant high optical density (OD<sub>450nm</sub>) was only recorded on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> soluble proteome, whereas extracts from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> or <italic>T</italic>. <italic>evansi</italic> score negative. Next, the ELISA was evaluated for its capacity to diagnose experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections in mice. When comparing the sera of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> positive mice to the sera of naive controls, a significant difference in the average OD<sub>450nm</sub> of about 4.0 was observed between both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Having established that the Nb474-ELISA was specific for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> and that it can detect an active infection, the assay was validated in a set-up in which mice were infected with different strains of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> and other species of trypanosomes. While the ELISA identifies <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infected animals irrespective of the parasite strain, the test scores negative on mice infected with trypanosome species other than <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Additionally, the detection limit of the Nb474-based assay was also investigated as uneven OD scores on sera collected from various <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> strains are attributed to differences in parasite density. To establish the assay’s detection limit, a set of sera samples prepared from blood having different concentrations of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> TC13 parasites were tested in the homologous Nb474 sandwich ELISA. The lowest parasite concentration yielding a signal above the threshold OD<sub>450nm</sub> (at ≥2-fold negative sample) is 1.43x10<sup>5</sup> trypanosomes/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004420.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to alleviate the fear of possible loss of sensitivity of the test in case examination of sample is delayed as often observed with BCT, the ELISA was evaluated on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infected sera samples that were incubated at different temperatures for specified time periods. The results illustrate that, storing samples at 4°C or 22°C for up to 7 days does not affect the ELISA signal. However, raising storage temperature to 37°C for 3, 5 and 7 days reduced the signal up to 2, 10 and 44 folds, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004420.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Given that the ELISA signal is unaffected by sample storage at 37°C within a relatively short time frame (i.e. 1 day), this would enable the applicability of the Nb474-ELISA under realistic ‘field conditions’ where prompt examination of samples is usually delayed by an entire day due to electricity failures or transport to diagnostic laboratories.</p>

<title>Application of the Nb474-ELISA as a test-of-cure under experimental conditions</title>
<p>Next, the Nb474-ELISA was assessed for its capacity to differentiate animals with ongoing infections from those cured from trypanosomes after Berenil treatment in an experimental set-up. During the entire course of the experiment, the antigenemia and the parasitemia were monitored by the Nb474-ELISA and microscopy, respectively. During the early stages of the active infection the antigen profile correlates well with parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). After the first parasitemia peak, when the parasitemia is drastically reduced due to host immune intervention, the antigen level remains high for 4 days before showing a gradual decline. In contrast, after drug-mediated parasite clearance, no antigen could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Altogether, these results show that in experimental infections, the Nb474-ELISA can be used as a test-of-cure.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence localization, capturing and identification of the Nb474 target</title>
<p>To identify the target of Nb474, a localization study was performed whereby cultured <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> IL3000 BSF parasites were probed with Alexa Fluor labeled Nb474. The fluorescent intracellular structures observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, panels 3 and 4) had the typical appearance of glycosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref047">47</xref>]. To investigate the hypothesis that Nb474 targets a glycosomal component, a co-localization experiment was carried out using Alexa Fluor labeled Nb474 and an Anti-<italic>Tb</italic>ALD, which is a pan trypanosome marker for the glycosomes and recognizes a linear epitope. This was performed on both <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> BSF and PCF parasites. While a clear co-localization is observed for the BSF parasites, Nb474 does not label the PCF parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To verify whether Nb474 indeed binds an antigen that is unique to BSF parasites, the Nb474-ELISA was used to probe the presence of the target antigen in a soluble proteome preparation obtained from both forms of the parasite. As it can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, the ELISA scores positive for the BSF parasites, while no signal is observed for the PCF parasites. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that Nb474 targets a glycosome-associated soluble protein that is specific to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> BSF parasites.</p>

<p>Given that the Nb474-ELISA yields a strong positive score when applied to the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> soluble proteome, the sera of infected mice, or a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> secretome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004420.s006">S5 Fig</xref>), it was reasoned that these samples could be used as the source material from which the target could be purified by Nb474-mediated immuno-capturing. To this end, two distinct approaches were employed. In the first immuno-capturing set-up, Nb474H was adsorbed on 96-well ELISA plate to capture the antigen from the soluble proteome and infected serum. In the second experimental setting, Nb474H was immobilized on nickel beads via its His<sub>6</sub>-tag to capture the antigen from the secretome in an attempt to retrieve the antigen-Nb-bead complex with a Pickpen. The results of both experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, respectively. In both cases, the analysis of the eluted samples via SDS-PAGE reveals a distinct, consistent protein band with an approximate molecular mass of 40 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004420.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lane 4). The three bands were analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine the identity of the target. The mass spectrometry results pointed toward <italic>Tco</italic>ALD (UniProtKB accession no.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The continuous monitoring of infectious diseases is crucial for disease control and treatment. Improved methods for the detection of low levels of pathogen infection and transmission are vital for quick and appropriate responses to prevent any outbreaks. Over the years, immuno-based POC tests have become common diagnostic platform because of their ability to rapidly and reliably detect infections under field conditions. These assays can be formatted in two ways. Detection of infection can be antibody- or antigen-based and both formats have their advantages and drawbacks. Antibody-based diagnosis assays are relatively sensitive as the immune response of the host is used as natural amplification mechanism for pathogen detection. However, a recurring issue with these assays is cross-reactivity, which reduces their specificity. For instance, unrelated diseases associated with polyclonal B-cell/antibody amplification can increase the number of false-positive readings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref011">11</xref>]. Furthermore, in some cases host antibodies can circulate in the host long after a pathogen has been cleared thereby yielding a false image of the actual status of the infection. In contrast, antigen-based assays can differentiate between ongoing and past infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref048">48</xref>]. The hurdle in antigen-based detection is the selection of a suitable target antigen. Apart from not cross-reacting in diagnostic test for the detection of other endemic parasites, the target antigen should be present in detectable quantities during an active infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref049">49</xref>]. An additional requirement is that the capture and detection antibodies targeting the antigen should be able to out-compete the host anti-pathogen antibodies induced during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref023">23</xref>]. In this paper, we have devised a Nb-based approach that could circumvent the above-mentioned issues hampering the development of antigen-based pathogen detection. Our rationale consists of vaccinating an alpaca with whole-pathogen soluble proteome and applying a stringent panning and screening strategy to deliver the most specific Nbs. While the use of Nb technology allows the selection of specific antigen-binding entities that recognize epitopes different from those bound by conventional antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref025">25</xref>], the library generation and screening rationale are performed such as to allow the acquisition of Nbs that recognize unique antigens. Considering that the activity spectrum of diagnostic tests as well as vaccines based on highly immuno-dominant surface antigens of trypanosomes are narrowed by their variant nature, a non-biased antigen source (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> s.p.) was used to ensure selection of potent Nb(s) recognizing target(s) that are conserved across the different strains of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic>.</p>
<p>To test our strategy, we employed <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> as a case study. The application of our approach led to the identification of a potent <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> specific Nb, Nb474. By making His-tagged and biotinylated versions of this Nb (Nb474H and Nb474B, respectively), we were able to construct a homologous sandwich ELISA that was tested for its diagnostic potential in different scenarios. In an experimental mouse model, the assay is able to detect infections with different <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> strains, although there is a significant variation in the measured O.D. values. The observed variation is attributed to uneven parasite densities at the time point when samples were collected. Overall, the fact that all the strains tested show O.D. readings significantly above those of the negative samples or those taken from mice that were infected with trypanosomes other than <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> is an indication of the assay’s specificity for the diagnosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections.</p>
<p>The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infected mice display a typical parasitemia profile, which is characterized by a parasitemia peak around day 7 post infection. This first parasite wave rapidly drops due to the rapid destruction of trypanosomes by the host (commonly known as ‘trypanolytic crisis’), after which the parasitemia drops below the detection limit of parasitological techniques. Indeed, in accordance with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref050">50</xref>], the blood parasite load was very scanty by microscopy after the parasite peak despite the presence of trypanosomes in the circulation. Interestingly, the antigenemia detected via the Nb474-ELISA remains significantly high, even after the first parasite wave. Upon clearance of the parasites from the system, the signal of the Nb474-ELISA is reduced to zero, suggesting that the occurrence of the detected antigen in the circulation is linked to the presence of parasites in the host and that the antigen does not persist after parasite clearance. Hence, in experimental mice infections, the Nb474-ELISA has the ability to distinguish active infections from a cured state and can thus be employed as a test-of-cure. By being able to differentiate sick animals from cured, the assay might in part qualify as the first-line of test for drug resistance. This feature of the ELISA, from the clinician’s perspective, is useful for monitoring the efficacy of trypanocidal drugs.</p>
<p>The Nb474-ELISA was also able to diagnose <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections in experimentally and naturally infected cattle. The obtained results showed potential application of the diagnostic tool in the laboratory settings. Additionally, it seems that delayed sample investigation does not affect the assay’s sensitivity provided that the collected samples are kept under cold storage conditions. In the endemic areas, delayed sample investigation is often experienced in case of electricity failure or when there are no efficient means for sample delivery to distant laboratories. Together with its current level of performance, the option of delayed sample investigation would make this assay a suitable tool for monitoring <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections in remote settings and retrospective analysis of archived samples. We plan to further validate this assay on larger collections of field samples from different geographical locations where the disease is endemic.</p>
<p>Finally, we identified the target antigen of the Nb474-ELISA as being <italic>Tco</italic>ALD, which is a glycolytic enzyme found in the glycosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref051">51</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>Tco</italic>ALD has been reported to be a part of the so-called <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> secretome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref052">52</xref>]. However, the exact mechanism by which the enzyme reaches the host’s circulation is yet to be resolved. The findings in this paper demonstrate that <italic>Tco</italic>ALD is a suitable biomarker for the identification of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections, despite its high sequence identity with the glycosomal aldolase of other parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004420.s008">S1 Table</xref>). This is not the first report presenting aldolase as a specific biomarker for pathogen detection. The enzyme variant encoded by <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> serves as a biomarker for the diagnosis of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref053">53</xref>]. Based on the structures of aldolases encoded by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>mexicana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref054">54</xref>], <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref055">55</xref>] and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref056">56</xref>], it is expected that <italic>Tco</italic>ALD is a homo-tetramer in solution. This also explains why the Nb474 sandwich ELISA can be used in a homologous set-up. In the case of a monomeric target antigen, the same Nb could evidently not be used as a capturing and a detection reagent because the antigen would harbour only a single binding site for the Nb, which necessitates the development of a heterologous sandwich ELISA. However, the principle of a homologous sandwich ELISA is applicable for an oligomeric target antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref057">57</xref>]. The observation that Nb474 can be used for antigen capturing as well as detection suggests the occurrence of at least two Nb474-binding sites on <italic>Tco</italic>ALD. However, this remains speculative as the structural and biophysical determinants of the specific Nb474-<italic>Tco</italic>ALD interaction remain yet to be investigated. We expect that these studies will help us improve the robustness of the Nb474-ELISA to specifically monitor <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> infections in the field. Moreover, the advantage of a selective test for trypanosomosis in the regions of sub-Saharan Africa where animals are infected with human as well as animal infective trypanosomes is that it discriminates between the two parasite groups, hence enabling assessment of the potential risk for human infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004420.ref049">49</xref>]. Further development of the ELISA will bring us a step closer towards obtaining an antigen-detection immuno-based POC test that can be used for rapid and reliable detection of pathogen infections.</p>
