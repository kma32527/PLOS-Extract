<abstract>
<p>Mycobacteria of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) greatly impact human and animal health worldwide. The mycobacterial life cycle is complex, and the mechanisms resulting in pathogen infection and survival in host cells are not fully understood. Eurasian wild boar (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) are natural reservoir hosts for MTBC and a model for mycobacterial infection and tuberculosis (TB). In the wild boar TB model, mycobacterial infection affects the expression of innate and adaptive immune response genes in mandibular lymph nodes and oropharyngeal tonsils, and biomarkers have been proposed as correlates with resistance to natural infection. However, the mechanisms used by mycobacteria to manipulate host immune response are not fully characterized. Our hypothesis is that the immune system proteins under-represented in infected animals, when compared to uninfected controls, are used by mycobacteria to guarantee pathogen infection and transmission. To address this hypothesis, a comparative proteomics approach was used to compare host response between uninfected (TB-) and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected young (TB+) and adult animals with different infection status [TB lesions localized in the head (TB+) or affecting multiple organs (TB++)]. The results identified host immune system proteins that play an important role in host response to mycobacteria. Calcium binding protein A9, Heme peroxidase, Lactotransferrin, Cathelicidin and Peptidoglycan-recognition protein were under-represented in TB+ animals when compared to uninfected TB- controls, but protein levels were higher as infection progressed in TB++ animals when compared to TB- and/or TB+ adult wild boar. MHCI was the only protein over-represented in TB+ adult wild boar when compared to uninfected TB- controls. The results reported here suggest that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> manipulates host immune response by reducing the production of immune system proteins. However, as infection progresses, wild boar immune response recovers to limit pathogen multiplication and promote survival, facilitating pathogen transmission.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Mycobacteria of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) are zoonotic pathogens representing a serious health problem for humans and animals worldwide. The life cycle of mycobacteria is complex, and the mechanisms resulting in pathogen infection and survival in host cells are not fully understood. Eurasian wild boar are natural reservoir hosts for MTBC and a model for mycobacterial infections and tuberculosis. The results of this study broaden our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of zoonotic tuberculosis and fill important gaps in knowledge of this topic. The results suggested that mycobacteria manipulate host immune response by reducing the production of immune system proteins. However, as infection progresses, wild boar immune response recovers to limit pathogen multiplication and promote survival, facilitating pathogen transmission. As previously reported in other obligate intracellular bacteria, host-mycobacteria interactions probably reflect a co-evolutionary process in which pathogens evolved mechanisms to subvert host response to establish infection, but hosts also evolved mechanisms to limit pathogen infection and promote survival. Subsequently, mycobacteria benefit from host survival by increasing the probability for transmission to continue their life cycle. These results provide relevant information to develop tools to evaluate risks for tuberculosis caused by MTBC and for disease control in humans and animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) caused by mycobacteria of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) is one of the world's most common causes of death from infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref001">1</xref>]. Animal TB is caused by infection with <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> and closely related members of the MTBC. Cattle are the main health concern regarding animal TB in industrialized countries, but other mammalian species are also infected with mycobacteria of the MTBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref003">3</xref>]. Additionally, human TB cases due to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection are reported every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref005">5</xref>]. Eurasian wild boar (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) are natural reservoir hosts for MTBC in some regions and therefore vaccination strategies are being developed for TB control in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>]. Additionally, wild boar are a model for mycobacterial infection and TB reproducing some of the clinical characteristics observed in human cases such as lung pathology and latent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The life cycle of mycobacteria is complex and not fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref011">11</xref>]. It is generally accepted that after inhalation into the lung or entry to the oropharyngeal cavity, the principal entry routes, mycobacteria of the MTBC are phagocytized by macrophages. As with other intracellular bacteria, mycobacteria survive inside macrophages by escaping host immune response, which results in the formation of a granuloma that effectively contains infected cells. A change in the host-bacterial equilibrium of granulomas is thought to result in the release of infected cells outside containment and onward transmission of mycobacteria to susceptible hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref011">11</xref>]. In wild boar, mycobacterial infection occurs mostly through oral-nasal routes and mandibular lymph nodes are the most frequently affected tissue by the formation of granulomatous lesions, and the main organ responsible for infection dissemination within the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref012">12</xref>]. However, generalized infection affects lungs, therefore increasing the risk for pathogen transmission through the oral-nasal route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref013">13</xref>]. In the wild boar TB model, mycobacterial infections affect the expression of innate and adaptive immune response genes in mandibular lymph nodes and oropharyngeal tonsils, and Complement component 3 (C3) and Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) have been proposed as correlates with resistance to natural mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the mechanisms used by mycobacteria to manipulate host immune response are still not fully understood.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that the immune system proteins under-represented in infected animals when compared to uninfected controls are used by mycobacteria to guarantee pathogen infection and transmission. To address this hypothesis, in this research a comparative proteomics approach was used to characterize host response to natural <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection using the wild boar TB model. The results identified host immune system proteins that are manipulated by mycobacteria for pathogen infection and transmission.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>All animal sampling was post-mortem. Wildlife samples were obtained from hunter-harvested individuals that were shot during the legal hunting season independently and prior to our research. According to EU and National legislation (2010/63/UE Directive and Spanish Royal Decree 53/2013) and to the University of Castilla–La Mancha guidelines no permission or consent is required for conducting the research reported here.</p>

<title>Study site and sampling</title>
<p>Based on tooth eruption patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref017">17</xref>], young (Age 6–24 months; N = 14) and adult (Age &gt;24 months; N = 15) Eurasian wild boar were selected and included in the study. The animals were collected between hunting seasons 2009–2012 from Montes de Toledo, Spain in a region with 66±5% TB prevalence in wild boar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref018">18</xref>]. The hunters provided the whole carcass less than 20 min after the animal died and the necropsy were performed on site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref018">18</xref>]. Animals were subjected to detailed necropsy as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>]. Samples of dissected mandibular lymph nodes were obtained by sagittal cross-section at half the length, and tissue fragments of approximately 2 cm<sup>3</sup> were rapidly prepared and stored in liquid nitrogen for DNA, RNA and protein extraction. The remaining portion of the sample was used for culture and spoligotyping of mycobacteria (see below). After necropsy, young animals were classified as TB- (N = 5) or TB+ (N = 9) based on the absence/presence of TB-compatible lesions and negative/positive for mycobacterial culture. Adult animals were classified as TB- (N = 4), TB+ (N = 5) or TB++ (N = 6). The TB- animals were negative for mycobacteria culture and did not have TB-compatible lesions. The TB+ and TB++ animals were positive for mycobacteria culture and showed TB-compatible lesions localized in head organs (mandibular lymph nodes and/or oropharyngeal tonsils) referring to localized (potentially early) or controlled <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection or affecting multiple organs in the head and thorax that reflect disseminated TB, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004541.t001">Table 1</xref>). Adult TB++ wild boar with disseminated disease showed extensive macroscopic lesions with poor fibrotic containment of the granulomas and ulceration into the lumina of airways. All animals positive for mycobacteria culture had infection with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>. Mandibular lymph nodes were used in the study because these organs are involved in mycobacterial infection and TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<title>Protein extraction and proteomics analysis</title>
<p>Proteins from mandibular lymph nodes were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions. Precipitated proteins from individual samples of each group (TB- and TB+ young animals and TB-, TB+ and TB++ adult animals) were resuspended in 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with 4% SDS and protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Protein extracts (150 μg per sample) were on-gel concentrated by SDS-PAGE as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref020">20</xref>]. The unseparated protein bands were visualized by staining with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo Scientific), excised, cut into 2 × 2 mm cubes and digested overnight at 37°C with 60 ng/μl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 5:1 protein: trypsin (w/w) ratio in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8 containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref021">21</xref>]. The resulting tryptic peptides from each band were extracted by 30 min-incubation in 12 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 1% and the peptides were finally desalted onto OMIX Pipette tips C18 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), dried-down and stored at −20°C until mass spectrometry analysis.</p>
<p>The desalted protein digests was resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by RP-LC-MS/MS using an Easy-nLC II system coupled to an ion trap LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were concentrated (on-line) by reverse phase chromatography using a 0.1×20 mm C18 RP precolumn (Thermo Scientific), and then separated using a 0.075×100 mm C18 RP column (Thermo Scientific) operating at 0.3 ml/min. Peptides were eluted using a 180-min gradient from 5 to 40% solvent B (Solvent A: 0,1% formic acid in water, solvent B: 0,1% formic acid in acetonitrile). ESI ionization was done using a Fused-silica PicoTip Emitter ID 10 mm (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) interface. Peptides were detected in survey scans from 400 to 1600 amu (1 mscan), followed by fifteen data dependent MS/MS scans (Top 15), using an isolation width of 2 mass-to-charge ratio units, normalized collision energy of 35%, and dynamic exclusion applied during 30 sec periods.</p>
<p>The MS/MS raw files were searched against the Uniprot-<italic>Sus scrofa</italic> database (34,207 entries in November 2015) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>) using the SEQUEST algorithm (Proteome Discoverer 1.4, Thermo Scientific). The following constraints were used for the searches: tryptic cleavage after Arg and Lys, up to two missed cleavage sites, and tolerances of 1 Da for precursor ions and 0.8 Da for MS/MS fragment ions and the searches were performed allowing optional Met oxidation and Cys carbamidomethylation. A false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01 was considered as condition for successful peptide assignments and at least two peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) per protein were the necessary condition for protein identification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004541.s003">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis for biological process (BP) was done by Blast2GO software (version 3.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blast2go.com" xlink:type="simple">www.blast2go.com</ext-link>).

The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in TBS and probed with rabbit antibodies. Serum from rabbits immunized with recombinant proteins was diluted 1:500 in 3% BSA in TBS and the membrane was incubated with the diluted sera for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with TBS. Rabbit antibodies against the recombinant 40S ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14; Q29303) (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as control for normalization in Western blot analysis. The membrane was then incubated with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1:1000 in TBS. The membrane was washed three times with TBS and finally developed with TMB stabilized substrate for HRP (Promega) for 20 min. The intensity of protein bands corresponding to test and control proteins including those with lower or higher molecular weight than the recombinant protein that likely correspond to degradation and polymerization products, respectively were determined in the Western blot membrane by densitometric analysis using ImageJ 1.44p (National institute of Health, USA). The intensity of test protein bands was normalized against the intensity of the control band and analyzed by a multivariate comparison between the groups using the one-way ANOVA test followed by one-tailed Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction for samples with unequal variance (p = 0.05).</p>

<title>Host and pathogen genetic factors may impact on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection and disease in wild boar</title>
<p>The impact of host and pathogen genetic factors on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection and disease has been documented in the wild boar TB model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref024">24</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was based on wild boar naturally exposed to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> as a model to characterize host response to mycobacterial infection with emphasis on immune system proteins. Natural infections reflect better the conditions found in the field and therefore increase the relevance of the results for the characterization of mycobacterial infection under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>]. However, as previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>], this approach did have some disadvantages such as the presence of mixed infections in the animals. Nevertheless, it was possible to minimize the effect of these mixed infections on differential gene expression and protein representation analyses because they were equally present in all the TB- and TB+/TB++ animals. Additionally, results obtained in TB+ and TB++ animals experimentally infected under controlled conditions corroborated the findings in naturally infected animals for most of the differentially represented immune system proteins. Mandibular lymph nodes were used because these organs are involved in mycobacterial infection and TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref019">19</xref>]. Our hypothesis is that immune system proteins under-represented in infected animals when compared to uninfected controls are affected by mycobacteria to facilitate pathogen infection and transmission. To address this hypothesis, in this research a comparative proteomics approach was used to compare host response between uninfected (TB-) and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected young (TB+) and adult animals with different infection status [TB lesions localized in the head (TB+) referring to localized (potentially early) or controlled <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection or affecting multiple organs (TB++) that reflect disseminated TB]. The results suggested an effect of mycobacterial infection on proteins affecting different BP and MF of which immune system BP showed significant differences between uninfected and infected wild boar in both young and adult animals.</p>
<p>The analysis was then focused on the immune system proteins that play an important role in host response to mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>]. Five and six immune response proteins were differentially represented in young and adult animals, respectively. Proteins S100A9, Heme peroxidase, LTF, Cathelicidin and PGLYRP1 were under-represented in TB+ animals when compared to uninfected TB- controls but protein levels increased as infection progressed in TB++ animals when compared to TB- and/or TB+ adult wild boar. MHCI was the only protein over-represented in TB+ adult wild boar when compared to uninfected TB- controls. For selected differentially represented immune system proteins, proteomics results using pooled samples were validated by Western blot analysis in individual wild boar mandibular lymph nodes therefore providing support for the results reported here.</p>
<p>The differentially represented immune system proteins were all related to host immune response to mycobacterial infection with relevant implication in pathogen infection, multiplication and transmission.</p>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>Calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9)</title>
<p>The protein S100A9 is produced by neutrophils and has been suggested to be involved in the positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, innate immune response and autophagy among other processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref025">25</xref>], all mechanisms involved in host immune response to mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, reducing S100A9 protein levels may be a mechanism used by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> to evade host immune response and establish infection in young wild boar. However, S100A9 also mediates neutrophilic inflammation and lung pathology during active TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref027">27</xref>]. The over-representation of S100A9 in TB++ adult wild boar may be a host response to limit pathogen multiplication but it is also associated with active TB resulting in increased transmission of mycobacteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec019">
<title>Heme peroxidase</title>
<p>Heme is an important prosthetic group in hemoglobins, peroxidases, catalases, hydroxylases, and cytochromes required for various processes such as DNA transcription, RNA translation, protein stability, cell differentiation and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref028">28</xref>]. Heme peroxidase such as Eosinophil peroxidase also shows inhibitory activity against mycobacteria by inducing bacterial fragmentation and lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, most bacterial pathogens including mycobacteria require heme and iron for full virulence and have developed systems for heme acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, the under representation of Heme peroxidase in infected TB+ wild boar when compared to uninfected TB- animals may be induced by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> to evade host immune response and establish infection in young animals. As infection proceeds in adult wild boar to affect several organs in TB++ animals, Heme peroxidase protein levels are higher than in TB+ animals which may represents a mechanism for the host to inhibit pathogen multiplication. However, mycobacteria may benefit from this response in adult TB++ wild boar by acquiring Heme to increase virulence and favor transmission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Lactotransferrin (LTF)</title>
<p>Mycobacteria of the MTBC grow within macrophages to establish infection in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref011">11</xref>]. Iron (Fe) acquisition is critical for mycobacterial growth and bacteria acquire Fe bound to citrate, Transferrin and LTF and from macrophage cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref031">31</xref>]. Furthermore, host immune response to mycobacteria infection partly depends on iron regulation by the host through the tight control of iron-storage proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref033">33</xref>]. Consequently, LTF has been proposed as an adjuvant for the BCG vaccine to increase its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref034">34</xref>]. Considering the critical role that LTF plays during mycobacterial infection, protein under-representation in TB+ young and adult animals when compared to uninfected TB- controls could reflect a mechanism of host immune response to infection by reducing Fe source to mycobacteria. However, the LTF protein levels increased in TB++ adult animals suggesting a mechanism by which mycobacteria manipulate host immune response during infection progression to increase Fe availability resulting in higher bacterial growth and transmission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>Cathelicidin</title>
<p>It has long been recognized that many people and animals exposed to MTBC do not subsequently show any evidence of infection probably due to innate, non-specific inflammatory responses that control infection or reduce the infection load, therefore modulating the subsequent host acquired immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref035">35</xref>]. Cathelicidin is one of the antimycobacterial peptides delivered to phagosomes containing mycobacteria through fusion with lysosomes resulting in macrophage autophagy killing intracellular mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref035">35</xref>]. Therefore, reduction in the production of antimycobacterial peptides such as Cathelicidin increases susceptibility to TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref035">35</xref>]. As with other immune system proteins identified here as differentially represented in mandibular lymph nodes of naturally infected wild boar when compared to uninfected controls, Cathelicidin was under-represented in infected TB+ young and adult wild boar, probably reflecting a mechanism by which mycobacteria manipulate host innate immune response to facilitate infection and multiplication. However, Cathelicidin protein levels increased in TB++ adult animals suggesting a host mechanism to limit bacterial multiplication as infection progresses to increase host survival. Mycobacteria may benefit from this response in TB++ adult animals by increasing the probability of transmission to susceptible hosts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec022">
<title>Peptidoglycan-recognition protein (PGLYRP1)</title>
<p>Peptidoglycan recognition proteins are part of the innate immune system that bind to bacterial cell wall molecules such as lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and fatty acids such as mycobacterial mycolic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref036">36</xref>]. The PGLYRP1 protein showed a profile similar to Cathelicidin in response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in wild boar, again suggesting a mechanism by which mycobacteria manipulate host innate immune response to facilitate infection and multiplication but host response increases protein levels to limit bacterial multiplication as infection progresses to increase host survival. As discussed above, mycobacteria may benefit from this response in TB++ adult animals by increasing the probability of transmission to susceptible hosts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec023">
<title>MHC class I antigen (MHCI)</title>
<p>MHCI was the only protein over-represented in TB+ adult wild boar when compared to uninfected TB- controls with no significant differences between other groups. According to the protein annotation, this MHCI antigen probably belongs to the classical MHC class Ia which functions by presenting peptide antigens to pathogen-specific cytotoxic T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref037">37</xref>]. Therefore, the over-representation of MHCI in TB+ wild boar probably reflects host immune response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection. However, the T cell epitopes of MTBC including <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> are hyperconserved in different strains consistent with strong purifying selection acting on these epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref038">38</xref>]. Consequently, MTBC might benefit from recognition by T cells because this essential response for host survival may be necessary for mycobacteria to establish latent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Protein levels and the expression of coding genes for differentially represented immune system proteins were characterized by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR in individual wild boar mandibular lymph node protein and RNA samples, respectively. Western blot analysis validated the proteomics results. Additionally, Hemoglobin protein levels that were under-represented in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected adult wild boar when compared to uninfected animals were also validated by ELISA in individual wild boar serum samples. These results suggested the presence of regulatory mechanisms acting at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels depending on the age and infection status of the animals. In young infected animals, regulation was probably at the post-transcriptional level while in adult TB+ and TB++ animals the presence of transcriptional mechanisms was more evident. However, the comparison between TB++ and TB+ adult animals also suggested regulation at the post-transcriptional level to explain differences between mRNA and protein levels. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels could also be explained by delay between mRNA and protein accumulation, which requires sampling at different time points. Immune response is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref039">39</xref>] and the regulatory mechanisms that occur at the level of mRNA splicing, mRNA polyadenylation, mRNA stability and protein translation have instrumental roles in controlling both the magnitude and duration of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref040">40</xref>]. Therefore, it was not surprising to find that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms probably operated to regulate the levels of the immune system proteins identified as differentially represented in wild boar mandibular lymph node response to mycobacterial infection.</p>
<p>With the approach used in this research we were able to characterize the dynamics of wild boar immune response at the host-mycobacteria interface. However, other factors such as contact probability between hosts and mycobacteria and genetic factors of both hosts and pathogens could also affect infection prevalence and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref024">24</xref>]. The contact between hosts and mycobacteria was very probable in adult animals due to the high (66%) <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> prevalence in wild boar in this region. Consequently, as shown in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>], uninfected adult animals were probably resistant to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>. However, uninfected young animals could have been naïve to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection.</p>
<p>To address the impact of host genetic factors on infection and disease progression, the expression of genes coding for C3 and MUT was characterized as possible correlates with host resistance to natural mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>]. The results did not support a role for <italic>MUT</italic> in susceptibility to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> in these animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the results of <italic>C3</italic> expression supported a role for this molecule in the outcome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection. As reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>], <italic>C3</italic> mRNA levels increased with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in young animals as a host response to limit mycobacterial infection. However, in adult wild boar higher <italic>C3</italic> levels correlated with protection against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection, providing additional support for the central role of this molecule in the protective response against mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref015">15</xref>]. Hemoglobin protein levels that are associated with TB-induced anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref041">41</xref>] were lower in infected TB+ and TB++ adult animals when compared to uninfected controls, indicating anemia in infected wild boar, but without differences as infection progressed between TB+ and TB++ animals. The tendency in Hemoglobin protein levels in young wild boar also suggested anemia in infected animals.</p>
<p>Finally, the prevalence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> spoligotypes in infected animals was used to characterize pathogen genetic diversity in these animals and their possible impact on infection and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref024">24</xref>]. Although the frequency of the 5 spoligotypes identified was not different between groups, adult animals had a greater spoligotype diversity probably reflecting a longer exposure to mycobacteria. Two of the spoligotypes, SB0339 and SB0134 has been phenotypically and genetically correlated with high distribution (isolation frequency) and low and high TB lesion score in wild boar, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref024">24</xref>]. The SB0339 spoligotype was isolated from all groups with high frequency but the SB0134 sopligotype was identified only in adult TB++ animals. These results are in agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref024">24</xref>] and suggest that mycobacteria-derived genetic factors may impact on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection and disease in the study site.</p>
<p>The results reported here suggested that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> manipulates host immune response to facilitate infection in wild boar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004541.g008">Fig 8</xref>). As other intracellular bacteria, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> manipulate host immune response by reducing the production of immune system proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref026">26</xref>]. However, as infection progresses, wild boar immune response recover to limit pathogen multiplication and promote survival that also facilitates pathogen transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004541.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Adult TB++ wild boar with disseminated disease showed extensive macroscopic lesions with poor fibrotic containment of the granulomas and ulceration into the lumina of airways that facilitate pathogen transmission through aerogenous shedding of mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref042">42</xref>]. As previously reported for other obligate intracellular bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref043">43</xref>], host-mycobacteria interactions probably reflect a co-evolutionary process in which pathogens evolved mechanisms to subvert host response to establish infection but hosts also evolved mechanisms to limit pathogen infection and promote survival. Subsequently, mycobacteria benefit from host survival by increasing the probability for transmission to continue the life cycle. The reduction in anemia progression from TB+ to TB++ adult animals is probably associated with the increase in host survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004541.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary of the factors identified in this study with an impact on host-pathogen interactions. Mycobacteria manipulate host immune response by reducing the production of immune system proteins. However, as infection progresses, wild boar immune response recovers to limit pathogen multiplication and promote survival, facilitating pathogen transmission. Increased host survival in adult animals is probably associated with reduction in anemia progression. The upregulation of <italic>C3</italic> may be associated with protection in uninfected adult wild boar while higher lesion score in TB++ animals could be due to infection with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> spoligotypes such as SB0134.</p>

<p>These results also provided evidence to support the impact of host and pathogen derived genetic factors affecting pathogen infection and disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004541.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>C3</italic> in uninfected adult wild boar supported the role for this molecule in the protective mechanisms against TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004541.ref044">44</xref>].

These results provide relevant information to develop tools to evaluate risks for TB caused by MTBC and for disease control in humans and animals.</p>
