<title>Background</title>
<p>Chagas disease is due to the parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, a protist disseminated by a Triatome vector. This disease is endemic to Latin America and considered by WHO as one of the 17 world’s neglected diseases. In Europe and in North America, imported cases are also detected, due to migration of population outside of the endemic region. Diagnosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection is usually made indirectly by the detection of specific antibodies to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> antigens. Following initial diagnostic evaluation or screening test (qualifying or discarding blood donation), a confirmation test is performed for samples initially reactive. The test presented in this study aims at the confirmation/refutation of the infectious status of human blood samples and will permit taking appropriate clinical measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>We designed a novel array of twelve antigens and printed these antigens onto 96-well plates. We tested 248 positive samples <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, 94 unscreened blood donors’ samples from non-endemic area, 49 seronegative blood donors, 7 false-positive and 3 doubtful samples. The observed reactivities were analyzed to propose a decision-tree algorithm that correctly classifies all the samples, with the potential to discriminate false-positive results and sticky samples. We observed that antibodies levels (Sum of all antigens) was significantly higher for PCR positive than for PCR negative samples in all studied groups with Multi-cruzi.</p>

<title>Conclusion/Significance</title>
<p>The results described in this study indicate that the Multi-cruzi improves the serological confirmation of Chagas disease. Moreover the “sum of all antigens” detected by Multi-cruzi could reflect parasitemia level in patients–like PCR signals does—and could serve as an indicator of parasite clearance in longitudinal follow-ups. Validation of this assay is still required on an independent large collection of well characterized samples including typical false-reactive samples such as Leishmaniasis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Eight million people are affected by Chagas disease worldwide, almost exclusively in South America. This chronic disease is initially asymptomatic but turns out to be life threatening in 30% of the cases, years after the infection. Two therapies are available, but their efficacy is maximal if the treatment is initiated shortly after contamination. In the absence of reliable symptoms, the <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostic of Chagas Disease is thus a crucial tool to implement accurate clinical management. In order to permit universal access and a reliable confirmation of Chagas’s parasite presence, we have developed a new multiplex platform using a large number of selected antigens on easy handling 96 well ELISA microplates. In this manuscript, we present the first optimization data of the Multi-cruzi test that shows promising results for Chagas disease confirmation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chagas disease is life-threatening condition affecting 8 to 10 million persons in the world, predominantly in Latin America where the disease is endemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref001">1</xref>]. It is considered by WHO as one of the 17 world’s neglected diseases. In Europe and in North America, imported cases are also detected, due to migration of population outside of the endemic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref002">2</xref>]. The agent of the disease is the parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, a protist disseminated by a Triatome vector. Transmission also occurs by oral route, blood transfusion or congenitally. Chagas' disease is initially a silent disease that develops through different stages. Following <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> exposure, patients enter the acute phase, during which the level of circulating parasites is high. Despite this exposure the symptoms are generally rare or benign (e.g., fever and occasionally an inflammatory reaction at the bite site). After the acute phase which lasts few months, most patients enter chronic Chagas disease. During this phase, parasites are less abundant and may be confined to certain host tissues like muscle or fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref003">3</xref>]. About 70% of chronic patients will never develop severe clinical complications. These patients have the indeterminate form of chronic Chagas disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref004">4</xref>]. However, approximately 30% of the patients, will suffer life threatening cardiac disorders, digestive, neurological or mixed alterations after a latency period ranging from 10 to 30 years.</p>
<p>As there is no vaccine, prevention of Chagas disease is made through control of the parasite vector’s spreading: house improvements, personal protection to prevent vector infestation or good hygiene practices in particular regarding the fresh fruits preparation. Moreover in order to prevent infection, screening of blood and organs donors, or new-born and children of infected mothers is essential to provide early diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Different tests are available for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in the clinic or for screening of blood donations. Direct detection of parasite in the blood is performed by microscopy, haemoculture, xenodiagnosis or detection of the parasite’s nucleic acids. These assays are highly specific but lack sensitivity in the chronic stage during which parasites load in the blood is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref006">6</xref>]. Hence, diagnosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection is usually made indirectly by the detection of specific antibodies to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> antigens. FDA approved ELISA tests including either crude antigens (Ortho <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> ELISA) or a mix of fusion proteins (Abbott PRISM Chagas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref007">7</xref>]). To accurately determine the infectious status of a patient, two or three conventional tests based on different antigens are generally performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In a systematic review, Brasil et al. evaluated that commercial ELISAs have a pooled sensitivity of 99.3% (97.9%–99.9%) and a pooled specificity of 97.5% (88.5%–99.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref009">9</xref>]. The nonspecific reactions, causing inconclusive or false-positive results can explain the low specificity. Indeed, various pathogens from the trypanosomatid family (e.g., <italic>Leishmania spp</italic>. and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>) share a similar antigenic repertoire with common epitopes that can induce the production of cross-reactive antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref010">10</xref>]. Samples with an indeterminate result or low-level reactivity also present challenges for blood screening and when estimating prevalence or incidence rates for epidemiological surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref011">11</xref>]. In this context, the development of an immunoassay for detecting circulating antibodies against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> with a good performance appears to be crucial for efficient clinical management of Chagasic patients.</p>
<p>Following initial diagnostic evaluation or screening test (qualifying or discarding blood donation), a confirmation test is performed for samples initially reactive. This test will allow the confirmation/refutation of the infectious status of the human blood samples and will permit taking appropriate clinical measures.</p>
<p>Confirmation of infectious disease are classically performed through Western Blot or Dot Blot tests when available, allowing detection of discrete reactivities on specific antigens. FDA approved the usage of the Abbott ESA Chagas Dot Blot test that includes the same recombinant antigens as the Abbott ARCHITECT screening automate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref012">12</xref>]. Some homemade tests such as TESA blots (Trypanosoma Excreted secreted antigens) are also used in some countries of Latin America for confirmation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref013">13</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref014">14</xref>]. The membrane-based multiparametric approach for the serology has proved efficient but incompatible with automation, therefore the INNO-LIA Chagas test, although validated, has never been made widely available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref015">15</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref016">16</xref>]. Taking into consideration the complexity of Chagas serological interpretation and the difficult implementation of Dot Blot technology in low income countries, we developed a multiplex ELISA-based protein array for the confirmation of Chagas disease. In this manuscript we present this innovative confirmation assay Multi-cruzi carried out with 12 different antigens printed on a 96-well plate. This assay is based on the discrete estimation of antibodies diversity allowing an accurate conclusion on the patient infectious status.</p>

<p>We obtained 94 samples from the Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS) under cession agreement 20120224 after reviewing of the research protocol. The 94 blood donors tested in France were “not at risk” blood donors, meaning they are neither originating from, nor have travelled to, the endemic zone. Consequently their blood donations were not tested for Chagas disease, in conformity with local legislation.</p>

<title>BST (Barcelona, Spain)</title>
<p>107 samples were obtained from consenting blood donors enrolled at the Catalonian blood bank “Banc de Sang i Teixits”, (BST) of which 48 positive, 49 negative, 3 doubtful and 7 false-positive samples. All samples were initially screened on ARCHITECT ELISA for the Chagas disease. PCR was also performed on each sample in case of positivity on ARCHITECT ELISA (see PCR analysis section).</p>
<p>The 48 Infected Blood donors were all originating from the endemic zone (34 from Bolivia, 5 from Argentina, 2 from Paraguay, one from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Equator, Uruguay and 2 of unknown origin). They were screened and confirmed positive on three different assays (Abbott, Ortho and Biokit).</p>
<p>The three Doubtful and seven false-positive samples with inconsistent results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004596.t002">Table 2</xref>) on three different assays (Abbott, Ortho and Biokit ELISAs) were obtained from donors of the endemic zone (3 from Bolivia and 1 from Argentina) or from Spain (6 samples). Samples were considered as false-positive if reactive only on the first screening assay (Abbott) and negative on two consecutive assays (Ortho and Biokit ELISAs). Doubtful samples were reactive on two out of three tests (either Abbott and Biokit or Abbott and Ortho).</p>

<p>For each antigen we used a panel of negative and positive samples to optimize the concentration and obtain the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. Each antigen was diluted with carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) with concentration ranging from 70 to 130 μg/mL. Printing was performed under monitored temperature and controlled humidity conditions. Following spotting, plates were incubated overnight in the same conditions, then dried at 37°C for 2h and washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05%Tween20). A blocking solution (BSA in PBS) was added to the microplate for 2h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Following saturation, microplates were washed with PBST.

<title>Multi-cruzi Chagas Assay</title>
<p>Following individual validation of each antigen immunoreactivity in a classical single parameter ELISA, we selected the 12 antigens that showed the best performance properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Antigens were spotted in duplicate and organized in a 6 X 6 array in each wells of a 96-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Subsequent to individual calibration, antigens were spotted at various concentrations ranging from 70 μg/mL to 130 μg/mL. In addition to these antigens, we used internal positive control in triplicate (PC) to check for the reactivity in each well; the control allows confirming the serum was properly added to the well and all reagents (conjugated secondary antibody and substrate solution) were present and functional. The three positive control spots allow also space-orientation of the array in the reader.</p>
<p>For each antigen, we established the net intensity (mean value of duplicated spots intensity) on the 401 samples included in the study. Data obtained on negative samples were used to establish individual cut-off values for each antigen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004596.t003">Table 3</xref>). Net intensity of each antigen was then converted into positive or negative reactivity according to cut-off value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004596.t003">Table 3</xref>). For example, the net intensity of two antigens are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The net intensity of CRA antigen (solid circles) equals 896, which is below the cut-off value for this particular antigen; therefore the sample is considered as non-reactive on CRA antigen. By contrast, for the TcD antigen, the net intensity value equals 22849, which is significantly higher than the corresponding cut-off; consequently this sample is considered as reactive on TcD antigen.</p>

<title>Multi-cruzi Decision Tree Optimization</title>
<p>A total of 391 samples well characterized (excluding the doubtful and false-positive samples) were analyzed by Multi-cruzi and included in the analysis. All of them (negative or positive samples) were previously tested on Architect apart from the 94 “negative” samples (unscreened) originating from non-endemic regions.</p>
<p>In first instance, we analyzed 248 confirmed positive samples, 94 unscreened and 49 screened negative samples. Initially, intensity data were analyzed using logistic regression and multivariate analysis to propose the most optimal classification of the samples. Ultimately, this analysis guided us towards a more simplified and intuitive decision tree that we used in this study. For each population we observed the frequency of positive and negative samples in relation to the number of reactive antigens (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g003">Fig 3</xref>, for each serum we determined the reactivity on each antigen and established the number of reactive antigens). Samples were distributed in three categories: a category with reactivity on 0 to 3 different antigens (n = 142, (99.3%) considered as negative), a category with reactivity on at least 6 different antigens (n = 233 (94%, positive samples)). The third category considered as indeterminate included sixteen sera with that reacted on 4 or 5 different antigens. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses we identified three antigens that had area under the curve values above 0.980 (Surface Antigen-2, TcR39 and MAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). When we measured the Sum of intensities on these three antigens, we observed a threshold of 12000 that can clearly split this category into negative (n = 1 with a Sum of intensities &lt;12000) and positive samples (n = 15 with a Sum of intensities &gt;12000; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we evaluated a new multiplex assay for the detection of different specific antibodies against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> in sera of patients with Chagas disease. Diagnostic and screening tests are essential tools that help determining if a patient or a blood donor has an infection or not. In the context of an infection, like for Chagas disease, serological assays can even be more essential as many parasite carriers may not present any symptoms. For example, a healthy pregnant women originating from Latin America, should be tested for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection in order to anticipate parasite transmission to her infant and eventual implementation of the adequate treatment to the neonate. For several infectious diseases, diagnostic information is based on serological reactivity as PCR-based tests are only sensitive in the presence of the causative pathogen. In case of positive results on a screening test, a confirmatory test is typically performed to avoid incorrect decision due to falsely reactive samples. So far, confirmation of Chagas Disease has not been standardized. Shah et al described a dot Blot assay, including the four Fusion Protein used in the ARCHITECT automat, but its usage does not seem to be generalized so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, as the same antigens are present in the ARCHITECT and the ESA blot, their sequential utilization may introduce a bias by giving redundant information and does not comply with the requirements of a complete diagnostic</p>
<p>Oelemann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref016">16</xref>] reported the development of serological confirmation assay for Chagas disease: the INNO-LIA Chagas that used the multiparametric approach to resolve indeterminate results. In the present work, we have extended the multiparametric approach to further explore the diversity of humoral immune response and attempt to classify the samples beyond positive and negative and possibly into different clinical groups. The National Consensus on Chagas disease (Brazil) suggested the use of another assay: the TESAcruzi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref020">20</xref>]. TESAcruzi is a Western blot utilizing <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> tripomastigote secreted and excreted antigens. However, Caballero et al. showed that the use of recombinant antigens or synthetic peptides are more specific than those using crude extracts from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> epimastigote forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref021">21</xref>]. Following these observations we used well characterized synthetic antigens for which the linear amino-acids sequences were optimized in terms of size and composition to avoid cross-reactivities.</p>
<p>After selecting a panel of twelve antigens, we optimized the decision tree to separate the patients from uninfected blood donors’ samples. The interpretation algorithm is optimized to obtain a 100 percent concordance with the well-characterized seropositive and seronegative samples used in this study. Multi-cruzi technology by individually revealing reactivity on the antigens would allow solving some of ELISA’s problems such as “sticky” or false-reactive samples. Another concern for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> confirmation is cross-reactivity with <italic>Leishmania sp</italic>. In the proposed Multiplex test, we use a large number of antigens that were pre-selected for their sensitivity and specificity attributes on <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infected panels. The probability of facing multi-reactive samples that are not <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infected is reversely correlated to the number of reactive antigens. In other words, a <italic>Leishmania</italic> sample is likely to react on one, two or three antigens, but becomes unlikely to react on four or more <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> antigens. Moreover, in the cases of doubtful samples, meaning reactive on two ELISAs, Multi-cruzi assay allowed defining their status: out of three samples, two were likely negative and one was probably positive. These donors were all originating from the endemic zone (Bolivia or Argentina). For the doubtful samples that were found negative, we suggest two hypotheses: these donors were not infected by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> or infected but spontaneously cured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref022">22</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref023">23</xref>]. The doubtful sample that were found positive are possibly infected by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> yet to be confirmed. A longitudinal follow-up of these samples, would allow acceptation or rejection these assumptions. Interestingly, the two infected population used in this study are different: one was made of samples from patients suffering cardiomyopathy and the second made of blood donors that screened positive. Moreover geographical origins of the samples was also diverse as one cohort came from Brazil and the blood donors have various origins (mainly Bolivia). These observations reinforce the robustness of our test that could be used in the future either in the context of clinic or the blood screening, and on patients of various geographical origins.</p>
<p>In the absence of an appropriate confirmation assay for Chagas disease, confirmation today is mainly derived from repeated reactivity on a variety of distinct screening tests, and when results are still inconclusive, PCR is also used to circumvent a potential transmission of circulating parasite. PCR is extremely specific (100%) but unfortunately its sensitivity is not good enough to be used as a diagnostic tool for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> detection (between 50 to 90% according to Brasil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref009">9</xref>]) as the level of circulating parasites in blood decreases during the chronic phase. Interestingly Sabino et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref019">19</xref>] observed that the antibodies levels (Ortho ELISA) in patients are correlated to qPCR results. We also observed that antibodies levels (Sum of all antigens) was higher for PCR positive than for PCR negative samples in all studied groups with Multi-cruzi. However, with ARCHITECT ELISA, the correlation between PCR results and antibodies levels was only observed in the “Cardiomyopathy” group.</p>
<p>Altogether, our findings may suggest that the “sum-of–all-antigens” results obtained with the Multi-cruzi could correlate with parasitemia level in certain patients (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004596.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and may thus indicate the status of parasite clearance in a longitudinal follow-up.</p>
<p>Multiplex assays offer several advantages. First of all, using a small quantity of sample, a large quantity of results are obtained. Indeed, with our multiplex assay we were able to obtain results on twelve different antigens using few microliters of sample and in few hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref024">24</xref>]. Moreover the possibility to print a major amount of antigens, (an array of 12 x 12 spots) can permit to establish a complete immunological signature for each patients. Secondly, the Multi-cruzi assay has an internal control embedded for each individual sample. This is a security that cannot be obtained with classical ELISA procedures. Finally, Sánchez Negrette et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004596.ref025">25</xref>] have shown that two antigens classically integrated in diagnostic assays, revealed faster regression trends in response to treatment in comparison with the global ELISA signals including those antigens. The multiplex approach by giving a discrete analysis of each antigen rather than a single composite response is an extremely sensitive methodology that could be promising to anticipate disease evolution (Cardiomyopathy or Intestinal) or monitor Chagas disease therapy.</p>
<p>The results described in this study indicate that the Multi-cruzi is a reliable confirmatory assay for the serodiagnosis of Chagas disease, with the potential to discriminate false-positive results and sticky samples. This new multiplex approach will be useful to establish the serological response pattern in each patient. To clinically validate the performance of the Multi-cruzi assay, additional studies, including typical falsely reactive samples such as Leishmaniosis and a larger number of routine testing for Chagas disease samples, should be conducted. Upon further testing, the proposed decision tree may still be subject to amendments and fine-tuning.</p>
