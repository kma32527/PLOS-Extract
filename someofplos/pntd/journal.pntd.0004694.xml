<title>Background</title>
<p>From October 2014 to March 2015, French Polynesia experienced for the first time a chikungunya outbreak. Two <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes may have contributed to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) transmission in French Polynesia: the worldwide distributed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and the Polynesian islands<italic>-</italic>endemic <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> mosquito.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To investigate the vector competence of French Polynesian populations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> for CHIKV, mosquitoes were exposed <italic>per os</italic> at viral titers of 7 logs tissue culture infectious dose 50%. At 2, 6, 9, 14 and 21 days post-infection (dpi), saliva was collected from each mosquito and inoculated onto C6/36 mosquito cells to check for the presence of CHIKV infectious particles. Legs and body (thorax and abdomen) of each mosquito were also collected at the different dpi and submitted separately to viral RNA extraction and CHIKV real-time RT-PCR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>CHIKV infection rate, dissemination and transmission efficiencies ranged from 7–90%, 18–78% and 5–53% respectively for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and from 39–41%, 3–17% and 0–14% respectively for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, depending on the dpi. Infectious saliva was found as early as 2 dpi for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and from 6 dpi for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic>. Our laboratory results confirm that the French Polynesian population of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is highly competent for CHIKV and they provide clear evidence for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> to act as an efficient CHIKV vector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As supported by our findings, the presence of two CHIKV competent vectors in French Polynesia certainly contributed to enabling this virus to quickly disseminate from the urban/peri-urban areas colonized by <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> to the most remote atolls where <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> is predominating. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> was probably involved in the recent chikungunya outbreaks in Samoa and the Cook Islands. Moreover, this vector may contribute to the risk for CHIKV to emerge in other Polynesian islands like Fiji, and more particularly Wallis where there is no <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus has caused a series of outbreaks in the Pacific from 2011, including French Polynesia. <italic>Aedes</italic> (<italic>Ae</italic>.) <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito, which has colonized almost all Pacific Island Countries, is reasonably expected to have been involved in the chikungunya outbreaks. In addition, endemic <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species may have sustained chikungunya virus transmission in the less urbanized and most remote islands. In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of French Polynesian populations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> to replicate, disseminate and transmit chikungunya virus under experimental conditions. Our results provide for the first time clear evidence for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> to act as an efficient chikungunya vector. These findings corroborate previous observation that endemic <italic>Aedes</italic> species, like <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>hensilli</italic> in Yap Island, may play a critical role in sustaining chikungunya virus transmission, in place or together with the widely distributed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>. In a context where innovative vector control strategies are mostly focused on targeting the mosquito species considered as the main arbovirus vectors, the potential for endemic <italic>Aedes</italic> species to take the lead in transmitting such arboviruses should not be neglected.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV; <italic>Togaviridae</italic>: <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) infection usually produces fever, joint pain, maculopapular rash and chronic polyarthralgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref001">1</xref>].Since its emergence in the Indian Ocean islands in 2005, CHIKV has caused a series of outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia, China and Central Africa, and, following an increasing trend, CHIKV also expanded to countries in Europe, the Pacific, the Caribbean and the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>CHIKV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that genetically has diverged in four lineages: the three original West African, East Central South African (ECSA) and Asian lineages; and the new ECSA-derived Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>French Polynesia is a French overseas Territory of about 270 000 inhabitants, located in the East part of the South Pacific Ocean. Until October 2013 and the first appearance of Zika virus (<italic>Flaviviridae</italic>: <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), dengue virus (<italic>Flaviviridae</italic>: <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) used to be the only arbovirus formally proven as circulating in French Polynesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref005">5</xref>]. From October 2014 to March 2015, French Polynesia experienced its first CHIKV outbreak. Within a few weeks CHIKV transmission expanded to all the districts on the main island Tahiti and then rapidly to several islands in all five archipelagos of French Polynesia (Society, Marquesas, Tuamotu, Gambier and Austral Islands). As of March 2015, 69,000 suspected CHIKV cases had been recorded by the Direction of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref006">6</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus was introduced from the Caribbean and that it belonged to the Asian lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>CHIKV is transmitted by daytime-biting <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, mostly the wide distributed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, but also <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> that is able to survive at temperate climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref014">14</xref>]. Several other <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species have also been reported as potential vectors for sylvatic transmission of CHIKV in Africa and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In the Pacific region, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> started colonizing the islands in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. In the late 1930s infestations were reported in the North part of the Pacific (Guam, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands…) and also in Vanuatu (New Hebrides) and in the Solomon Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref017">17</xref>]. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is now present in almost all Pacific islands and because its ability to transmit CHIKV had been demonstrated, the Pacific island countries were considered at high risk for CHIKV to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref014">14</xref>]. In 2011, CHIKV was reported for the first time in New Caledonia and local populations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> were demonstrated as able to transmit CHIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In Pacific islands or remote areas where <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is not or poorly present, CHIKV may have been transmitted by endemic <italic>Aedes</italic> species, like <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>hensilli</italic> in Yap State in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref018">18</xref>]. In French Polynesia, possible contribution of the endemic <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> species in CHIKV transmission was suspected. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> may have settled in the Polynesian islands together with human population migrations from the far west to the east part of the Pacific approximately 1,500–3,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref019">19</xref>]. Because the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> gravid adult female preferentially looks for natural breeding sites such as coconut shells, tree-holes or crab-holes and because its larvae can develop in brackish water, this mosquito is widely distributed in the Polynesian islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref022">22</xref>]. In the 1980s after the occurrence of several outbreaks caused by Ross River virus (RRV; <italic>Togaviridae</italic>: <italic>Alphavirus)</italic> in Pacific islands, the ability for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> to transmit RRV was investigated and demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref023">23</xref>]. These observations suggested <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> may also be able to transmit CHIKV. In 1967, Gilotra and Shah mentioned for the first time the ability of a Samoan population of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> to experimentally transmit CHIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the vector competence of French Polynesian populations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> for CHIKV.</p>

<title>Mosquito Rearing</title>
<p><italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> mosquito colonies were established in 2014, using mosquito collected on Tahiti Island in the districts of Toahotu and Atimaono, respectively. For the purpose of the study, F14-generation eggs of each mosquito colony were hatched under negative pressure in tap water for 1 hour. Larvae were reared in plastic trays containing tap water supplemented with bovine liver powder (MP Biomedicals, USA) inside a climate chamber (Sanyo MLR-351H, Japan) set at 27°C, 80% relative humidity and 12:12h light-dark cycle. Pupae were selected with a ratio of 1 male: 4 females. Adults were then maintained in climatic conditions as indicated above and were given continuous access to 10% sucrose solution.</p>

<title>Virus</title>
<p>CHIKV strain PF14/300914-109 was isolated from the serum of patient infected in September 2014 in Tahiti, French Polynesia. Amplification of CHIKV was performed by inoculation of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref024">24</xref>] routinely maintained at 30°C in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with non essential amino acids, gentamicin, fungizone (Amphotericin B) and 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS, Life technologies, USA). Serum was inoculated at 1:40 in cell-culture medium adjusted at 1% of FBS for 30 minutes at 30°C. Inoculum was then removed and replaced by fresh 1% FBS cell-culture medium. Infected cells were incubated at 30°C for 4 days. Infected cell-culture supernatant was then harvested and underwent two successive additional passages on C6/36 cells. Each successive passage was performed as follows: infected cell-culture supernatant from the previous passage was inoculated at 3:1 in 1% FBS-cell-culture medium for 1 hour at 37°C with gentle agitation. The inoculum was then replaced by fresh 1% FBS-cell-culture medium and infected cells were incubated at 30°C for 4 days. After the third passage, the infected-cell supernatant was harvested and concentrated by using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Germany) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref025">25</xref>]. FBS was added to the CHIKV concentrate at 1:5 before storage at -80°C.</p>
<p>Virus titration was performed by inoculating C6/36 cells with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus concentrate on a 96-wells plate. Six days later, C6/36 cells were fixed directly on the plate with 70% ice-cold acetone for 10 minutes. Each well was then incubated 30 minutes at 37°C with Group-A mouse ascitic fluid (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA) diluted 1:100 in PBS followed by 30 minutes incubation at 37°C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories, France) diluted 1:100. Wells containing infected cells were counted and viral titers in 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/mL) were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Mosquito Infection</title>
<p>The day of infection, 24 hours-starved and water-deprived 5-days-old mosquitoes were transferred into four to eight nylon mesh-covered containers of about 70 mosquitoes for each population.Two hundred <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were offered the CHIKV infectious blood meal. For <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, as the survival rate in laboratory conditions seemed to be lower than for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, &gt;400 <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> females were offered the meal to ensure getting enough mosquitoes surviving at least 9 days later.</p>
<p>The infectious meal was prepared with fresh washed bovine red cells, viral concentrate (1:22) and adenosine triphosphate at 5 mM as phagostimulant.

<title>Saliva Collection</title>
<p>At days 2, 6, 9, 14 and 21 after the infectious blood meal, a subset of 18 hours sucrose-starved and water-deprived mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized. Legs and wings from each mosquito were carefully removed and the proboscis was inserted into an individual filter tips ART (Molecular BioProducts, USA) containing 20 μL of FBS. Mosquitoes were allowed to expectorate saliva for 30 min. Then the FBS was expelled into a microtube containing 80 μL of 1% FBS cell-culture medium and stored at -80°C until tested. Each saliva sample was inoculated to C6/36 cells in a single well of a 96-well plate and 6 days later, infectious wells were determined by indirect immunofluorescent assay as described above.</p>

<title>Data and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Vector competence is defined as the ability of a mosquito to be infected, to disseminate and finally to be able to transmit a given virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref031">31</xref>]. Information on the ability of the two populations of mosquitoes to get infected was provided by the detection of CHIKV by RT-PCR performed on bodies. The mosquito infection rate was defined as the number of mosquitoes with positive body divided by the number of females tested at each time point.The aptitude of the two mosquito species to disseminate the virus was based on the detection of CHIKV by RT-PCR performed on legs. The viral dissemination efficiency was defined as the number of mosquitoes with positive legs divided by the number of females tested at each time point. Evidence for the potential for each of the species to be able to transmit the virus was given by the detection of replicative CHIKV particles in mosquito saliva. The viral transmission rate was defined as the number of mosquitoes with infectious saliva divided by the number of females tested at each time point.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study we provided evidence that <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from French Polynesia were competent laboratory vectors of CHIKV. We observed that the French Polynesian population of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> displayed CHIKV infection rates similar to those previously reported for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> populations collected in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref015">15</xref>]. As previously reported for an <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> population from Mayotte, Comoros archipelago, infectious saliva was detected in the French Polynesian <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> as early as 2 dpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref010">10</xref>]. Such a short extrinsic incubation period allows the vector to quickly infect susceptible people in the household of an infected patient. Together with the observation that dissemination and transmission efficiencies increased up to 21 dpi, our results support that <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> may have been an efficient vector of CHIKV during the outbreak in French Polynesia. For <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, although the latter time points (&gt;9 dpi) were not available, we found that CHIKV infection and dissemination efficiencies were lower compared to <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. Nevertheless, as vectorial capacity relies on multiple factors (mosquito densities, feeding behavior…) <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> might have been able to sustain CHIKV transmission in areas where <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is poorly represented. Indeed, CHIKV spread very quickly in remote French Polynesian atolls, but also recently caused outbreaks in Pacific islands where <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>polynesiensis</italic> is dominating, like in the Cook Islands and Samoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004694.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
