<abstract>
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus typically causing a dengue-like febrile illness, but neurological complications, such as microcephaly in newborns, have potentially been linked to this viral infection. We established a panel of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to allow the identification of ZIKV inhibitors and demonstrate that the viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2’-<italic>C</italic>-methyladenosine (7DMA) efficiently inhibits replication. Infection of AG129 (IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptor knock-out) mice with ZIKV resulted in acute neutrophilic encephalitis with viral antigens accumulating in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Additionally, high levels of viral RNA were detected in the spleen, liver and kidney, and levels of IFN-γ and IL-18 were systematically increased in serum of ZIKV-infected mice. Interestingly, the virus was also detected in testicles of infected mice. In line with its <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-ZIKV activity, 7DMA reduced viremia and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice, which also validates this small animal model to assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of novel ZIKV inhibitors. Since AG129 mice can generate an antibody response, and have been used in dengue vaccine studies, the model can also be used to assess the efficacy of ZIKV vaccines.  </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was first isolated from a febrile Rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref001">1</xref>]. During the last 5 decades sporadic ZIKV infections of humans were reported in Gabon, Nigeria, Senegal, Malaysia, Cambodia and Micronesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref004">4</xref>], leading to a benign febrile disease called Zika fever. The latter is characterized by headache, maculopapular rash, fever, arthralgia, malaise, retro-orbital pain and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref006">6</xref>]. In 2007, an epidemic of fever and rash associated with ZIKV infection was reported in Micronesia. During this outbreak 185 cases of ZIKV infections were confirmed. The seroprevalence in the affected region was 73% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref007">7</xref>]. During the more recent ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia [FP] between October 2013 and February 2014 over 30,000 people sought medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref009">9</xref>]. Since then, ZIKV has spread to new areas in the Pacific, including New Caledonia, the Cook Islands, and Chile’s Easter Island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref010">10</xref>]. As of 2015 ZIKV is causing an epidemic in Central and South America with an increasing number of cases reported particularly in Brazil, Colombia and El Salvador [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref014">14</xref>], demonstrating that this is a truly emerging human pathogen. Hundreds of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in the wake of ZIKV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref017">17</xref>]. As a result of a marked increase in the number of cases of microcephaly among infants born to virus-infected women, Zika has been declared a public health emergency of national importance in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition, an increasing number of travelers returning sick from endemic regions were diagnosed with ZIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref024">24</xref>]. The <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, the primary vector for ZIKV transmission, is expanding in all (sub-)tropical regions of the world and was recently reported to be present in California, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>There is neither a vaccine nor a specific antiviral therapy for the prevention or treatment of infections by ZIKV. The increasing incidence of Zika fever stresses the need for both preventive and therapeutic measures. We here report on the establishment of (i) a panel of assays that allow to identify inhibitors of ZIKV replication as well as (ii) a robust animal model of ZIKV infection with brain involvement. The viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2’-<italic>C</italic>-methyladenosine (7DMA) was identified as an inhibitor of <italic>in vitro</italic> ZIKV replication and was shown to reduce viremia and to delay the time to disease progression in virus-infected mice.</p>

<title>Cells and viruses</title>
<p>ZIKV (strain MR766, passaged five times in the insect cell line C6/36) was obtained from the European Virus Archive (EVA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.european-virus-archive.com/viruses/zika-virus-strain-mr766" xlink:type="simple">http://www.european-virus-archive.com/viruses/zika-virus-strain-mr766</ext-link>). Lyophilized virus was reconstituted in DMEM and virus stocks were generated on C6/36 mosquito cell cultures (ATCC CRL-1660) grown in Leibowitz medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and 20 nM HEPES at 28°C, without CO<sub>2</sub>. At the time ZIKV caused a complete cytopathic effect (CPE) [d5-d7 post infection; pi] the supernatant was harvested and viral titers were determined by endpoint titration on Vero cells (African Green monkey kidney cells; ECACC), Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008; ATCC CRL-1586) and BHK-J21 cells (baby hamster kidney cells; ATCC CCL-10). For end point titrations, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5×10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 100 μL assay medium and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, 100 μL of ZIKV was added to each well, after which the virus was serially diluted (1:2). Following 5 days of incubation, culture medium was discarded and replaced with (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; MTS) and the absorbance was measured at 498 nm following a 1.5h-incubation period. Subsequently, cultures were fixed with ethanol and stained with 1% Giemsa staining solution (solution of azure B/azure II-eosin/methylene blue 1:12:2 (w/w/w) in glycerol/methanol 5:24 (v/v); total dye content: 0.6% (w/w) Sigma-Aldrich). The different cell types as well as ZIKV tested negative for mycoplasma.</p>

<title>CPE-reduction assay</title>
<p>Vero cells were grown in growth medium, consisting of MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies). Antiviral assays were performed using the same medium except that 10% FCS was replaced with 2% FCS, referred to as ‘assay medium’. Vero cells were seeded at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate in 100 μL assay medium and allowed to adhere overnight. To each well 100 μl of culture medium containing 50% cell culture infectious doses (i.e., CCID<sub>50</sub>) of ZIKV was added, after which 2-fold serial dilutions of the compounds were added. Following 5 days of incubation CPE was determined by means of the MTS readout method and by microscopic evaluation of fixed and stained cells. In parallel, cell cultures were incubated in the presence of compound and absence of virus to evaluate a potential cytotoxic effect. The 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to inhibit virus-induced CPE by 50%, and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>), which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to inhibit the cell growth by 50%, was visually determined. The Z’ factor was calculated by the following formula 1-[3×(SD<sub>CC</sub>+SD<sub>VC</sub>)/(OD<sub>CC</sub>-OD<sub>VC</sub>)]; VC, virus control; CC, cell control.</p>

<title>Virus yield reduction assay</title>
<p>Vero cells were seeded at a density of 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates in growth medium and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with 100 μL CCID<sub>50</sub> (MOI~0.2) of ZIKV in assay medium for 1 h at 37°C. Next, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and 2-fold serial dilutions of the compounds were added. Supernatant was harvested at day 4 pi and stored at -80°C until further use. The EC<sub>50</sub> value, which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to inhibit viral RNA replication by 50%, was determined using logarithmic interpolation.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Viral kinetics and time-of-drug addition studies</title>
<p>Vero cells were seeded at a density of 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24-well plate in growth medium and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with ZIKV at an MOI~1 in assay medium for 30 min at 37°C. After the incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, after which assay medium was added to the cells. Cells were harvested at 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours pi and stored at -80°C until further use. For the time-of-drug addition studies, cells were seeded and infected as described above and 7DMA (178 μM) or ribavirin (209 μM) was added to the medium at different time points pi (see above). Cells were harvested at 24 hours pi and stored at -80°C until further use.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Plaque reduction assay</title>
<p>Vero cells were cultured in growth medium. Cells were incubated with ZIKV for 1 h, washed and overlaid with a mixture of 2% (w/v) carboxymethylcellullose (Sigma Aldrich) and MEM supplemented with 2% FCS, 4 mM L-glutamine and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate. Two-fold serial dilutions of compounds were made in the overlay medium. Cells were fixed and stained using a 10% v/v formaldehyde solution and a 1% methylene blue solution, respectively. Infectious virus titer (PFU/mL) was determined using the following formula: number of plaques × dilution factor × (1/inoculation volume).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Immunofluorescence assay</title>
<p>Vero cells were infected with ZIKV as described for the virus yield reduction assay. After removal of the virus, 2-fold serial dilution (starting at 89 μM) of 7DMA was added to the cells. At 72 h pi, cells were subsequently fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed with PBS supplemented with 2% BSA. Anti-Flavivirus Group Antigen Antibody clone D1-4G2-4-15 (Millipore) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) were used to detect ZIKV antigens in infected cells. Cell nuclei were stained using DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-fenylindool; Life Technologies) and read out was performed using an ArrayScan XTI High Content Analysis Reader (Thermo Scientific). The EC<sub>50</sub> value, which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to inhibit viral antigen expression by 50%, was determined using logarithmic interpolation.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR</title>
<p>RNA was isolated from 100–150 μl supernatant using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Filter Service, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<title>A mouse model of Zika virus infection</title>
<p>All experiments were performed with approval of and under the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of the University of Leuven [P087-2014]. Virus stock was produced as described earlier and additionally concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Infectious virus titers (PFU/ml) were determined by performing plaque assays on Vero cells. 129/Sv mice deficient in both interferon (IFN)-α/β and IFN-γ receptors (AG129 mice; male, 8–14 weeks of age) were inoculated intraperitoneally (ip; 200 μL) with different inoculums ranging from 1×10<sup>1</sup>–1×10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL of ZIKV. Mice were observed daily for body weight change and the development of virus-induced disease. In case of a body weight loss of &gt;20% and/or severe illness, mice were euthanized with pentobarbital (Nembutal). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and tissues (spleen, kidney, liver and brain) were collected in 2-mL tubes containing 2.8 mm zirconium oxide beads (Precellys/Bertin Technologies) after transcardial perfusion using PBS. Subsequently, RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) was added to the Precellys tubes and tissue homogenates were prepared using an automated homogenizer (Precellys24; Bertin Technologies). Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation and total RNA was extracted from the supernatant using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For serum samples, the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Filter Service) was used to isolate viral RNA. Viral copy numbers were quantified by RT-qPCR, as described earlier.</p>

<title>Establishing <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral assays and the identification of 7DMA as a selective inhibitor of <italic>in vitro</italic> ZIKV replication</title>
<p>End point titrations in different cell lines revealed that Vero cells are highly permissive to ZIKV, hence, these cells were selected to establish antiviral assays. Infection with 100×TCID<sub>50</sub> of ZIKV resulted in 100% cytopathic effect 5 days after infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004695.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), as assessed by microscopic evaluation as well as by the MTS readout method. The Z’ factor (a measure of statistical effect size to assess the quality of assays to be used for high-throughput screening purposes; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref028">28</xref>]) of the CPE-reduction assay was 0.68 based on 64 samples (from 8 independent experiments) determined by the MTS readout method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004695.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). The assay is thus sufficiently stringent and reproducible for high throughput screening purposes (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004695.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The CPE-reduction assay was next employed to evaluate the potential anti-ZIKV activity of a selection of known (+)ssRNA virus inhibitors (i.e. 2’-<italic>C</italic>-methylcytidine, 7-deaza-2'-<italic>C</italic>-methyladenosine, ribavirin, T-705 and its analogue T-1105). All compounds resulted in a selective, dose-dependent inhibitory effect on ZIKV replication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004695.t001">Table 1</xref>). The antiviral effect of these compounds was confirmed in a virus yield reduction assay, a1.7log<sub>10</sub> and 3.9log<sub>10</sub> reduction in viral RNA load at a concentration of 22 μM and ≥45 μM, respectively, was noted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004695.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004695.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Since 7DMA resulted in the largest therapeutic window (SI &gt; 37; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004695.t001">Table 1</xref>), the antiviral activity of this compound was therefore next assessed in a plaque reduction assay and in an immunofluorescence assay to detect viral antigens.

<p>7DMA is, as its 5’-triphosphate metabolite, an inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Addition of the compound to infected cells could be delayed until ~10 hours pi without much loss of antiviral potency; when first added at a later time point, the antiviral activity was gradually lost. This is line with the observation that onset of intracellular ZIKV RNA production was determined to occur at 10 to 12 hours pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004695.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The reference compound ribavirin (a triazole nucleoside with multiple proposed modes of action; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref029">29</xref>]), in contrast, already lost part of the antiviral activity when added at time points later than 4 hours pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004695.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>

Hundreds of patients have been reported with Guillain-Barré syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref017">17</xref>]. Most importantly, in Brazil a dramatic upsurge in the number of cases of microcephaly has been noted in children born to mothers infected with ZIKV. The annual rate of microcephaly in Brazil has increased from 5.7 per 100 000 live births in 2014 to 99.7 per 100 000 in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref018">18</xref>]. There is, hence, an urgent need to develop preventive and counteractive measures against this truly neglected flavivirus member. We here report on the establishment of (i) <italic>in vitro</italic> assays that will allow to identify novel inhibitors of ZIKV replication and (ii) a ZIKV infection model in mice in which the potential efficacy of such inhibitors can be assessed. ZIKV was found to replicate efficiently in Vero cells and to produce full CPE within a couple of days. The Z’ factor that was calculated for a colorometric (MTS method) CPE-based screen indicated that this is a robust assay that is amenable for high-throughput screening purposes. A plaque reduction, an infectious virus yield and a viral RNA yield reduction assay as well as an immunofluorescent antigen detection assay were established that will allow to validate the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of hits identified in CPE-based screenings. Productive infection of human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes and immature dendritic cells with the ZIKV has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref030">30</xref>]. However, Vero cells may be ideally suited for high throughput screening purposes, making these cells most useful to confirm the antiviral activity of interesting inhibitors of viral replication. We employed the assays that we established to assess the potential anti-ZIKV activity of a number of molecules with reported antiviral activity against other ssRNA viruses. In particular, the nucleoside analogue 7DMA was identified to inhibit ZIKV replication with a potency that was more or less comparable between the different <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. 7DMA was originally developed by Merck Research Laboratories as an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref031">31</xref>], but was also shown to inhibit the replication of multiple flaviviruses, [i.e. dengue virus, yellow fever virus as well as West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis virus] with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging between 5 and 15 μM, which is thus comparable to the EC<sub>50</sub> values for inhibition of <italic>in vitro</italic> ZIKV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref033">33</xref>]. In line with its presumed mechanism of action, i.e. inhibition as its 5’-triphosphate of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, time-of-drug-addition experiments revealed that the compound acts at a time point that coincides with the onset of intracellular viral RNA replication.</p>
<p>To assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of ZIKV inhibitors, we established a model of ZIKV infection in mice. AG129 mice proved highly susceptible to ZIKV infections; even an inoculum of ~10 PFU/ml resulted in virus induced-morbidity and mortality. Although ZIKV-infected SCID mice (deficient in both T and B lymphocytes) developed severe disease requiring euthanasia (paralysis of the lower limbs, body weight loss, hunched back), these mice were more resistant to ZIKV infection than AG129 mice. SCID mice succumbed to infection roughly 26 days later than AG129 mice when inoculated with the same viral inoculum. Thus, ZIKV infections in mice are mostly controlled by the interferon response rather than by lymphocytes, indicating that the innate immune response to ZIKV is critical. AG129 mice have been shown to be highly susceptible to infection with other flaviviruses; in particular allowing the development of dengue virus infection models in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref035">35</xref>]. At the time of virus-induced morbidity and mortality, ZIKV was detected in multiple organs such as kidney, liver and spleen, but also in the brain and spinal cord. The latter is in line with the observation that infected mice developed acute neutrophilic encephalitis with movement impairment and paralysis of the limbs. Brain involvement in ZIKV-infected mice may be relevant for brain-related pathologies in some ZIKV-infected humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref017">17</xref>]. Interestingly, the virus was also detected at high levels in the testicles of infected mice. A few cases of sexual transmission of the ZIKV in humans have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref037">37</xref>]; the observation that the virus replicates in the testicles in mice may suggest that the virus can also replicate in human testicle tissue thus explaining sexual transmission.</p>
<p>Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL10) were found to be increased in sera of ZIKV-infected mice, indicating that infection causes systemic inflammation. In particular IFN-γ and IL-18 were continuously increased during the course of infection; both cytokines could therefore potentially function as predictive markers of disease progression and disease severity in this mouse model. Whether these cytokines are also upregulated during the acute phase of the infection in humans remains to be studied. Of note, the fact that ZIKV infection leads to the production of IL-18 suggests that the inflammasome is activated during the course of infection. Surprisingly, we could detect increased levels of IL-18, but not of IL-1β, which is also produced upon activation of the inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref038">38</xref>]. To our knowledge, the observation that the inflammasome could be implicated in ZIKV infection is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Recently, a small study was reported involving 6 ZIKV-infected patients in which during the acute phase 11 cytokines/chemokines were found to be significantly increased, of which 7 were also increased during recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref039">39</xref>]. Despite the fact that immunocompromised AG129 mice have an altered cytokine metabolism and were infected with the prototype ZIKV MR766 strain belonging to a different lineage than the one infecting the Latin American patients (African versus Asian, respectively), similarities in cytokine expression were noted between both studies. IL-6, CCL5 and CXCL10 were significantly increased in ZIKV-infected patients as well as in the infected mice. In the ZIKV-infected patients IFN-γ levels, which were markedly increased in ZIKV-infected mice, were also increased during both the acute and the reconvalescent phase of the infection, albeit non-significantly. Likewise, TNF-α levels, which were increased early in infection in mice, were (non-significantly) increased during the acute phase of infection in the patients. More studies are necessary to assess whether the cytokine profile in these 6 patients is representative for larger groups.</p>
<p>Treatment of ZIKV-infected mice with 7DMA significantly reduced viremia (between day 3 and 8 post infection) and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality. The compound was very well tolerated in mice, which is in line with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref031">31</xref>]. The reduction in viremia and, hence, the delay of virus-induced disease was relatively modest, which is not surprising given the relatively weak <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the compound as compared to, for example, the EC<sub>50</sub> values (sub μM or even nM range) of most HCV inhibitors. Most importantly, the use of this compound allowed to validate the ZIKV mouse model to assess the efficacy of ZIKV inhibitors. Whether 7DMA (or related analogues) may have future in the control of ZIKV infections remains to be explored. AG129 mice have been used as well in the development of DENV vaccines, the DENV AG120 mouse models offer multiple disease parameters to evaluate protection by candidate vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004695.ref040">40</xref>]. Hence, the ZIKV mouse model presented here may also serve to study the efficacy of vaccine strategies against the ZIKV.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we here report on a panel of <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular assays that will allow to run large-scale antiviral screening campaigns against ZIKV and to validate the antiviral activity of hit compounds. A number of molecules, including the viral polymerase inhibitor 7DMA, were found to inhibit the <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of ZIKV. Hence, 7DMA can be used as a reference compound/comparator in future studies. Moreover, a robust ZIKV mouse infection model was established; 7DMA delayed virus-induced mortality and, hence, validates this model for antiviral studies. Moreover, the model may be useful to study the efficacy of vaccination strategies against the ZIKV.</p>
