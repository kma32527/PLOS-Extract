<abstract>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has emerged as a global health concern due to its recent spread in both old and new world. So far, no CHIKV specific drug or vaccine is licensed for human use. In this study, we report production of Chikungunya virus like particles (CHIK-VLPs) using novel yeast expression system (<italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>) and its evaluation as vaccine candidate. The gene encoding structural polyprotein of CHIKV from a recent epidemic strain was cloned into yeast expression system. The multicopy integrants were processed for expression of CHIK-VLPs. The VLPs were purified and confirmed through electron microscopic analysis for their morphological identity with CHIKV. The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of CHIK-VLPs as vaccine candidate was determined in Balb/c mice. Induction of both humoral and cellular immune response was observed with different doses of CHIK-VLPs. The humoral immune response was studied through different techniques like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, IgG Isotyping and plaque reduction neutralization test. CHIK-VLPs were found to elicit high titer of antibodies that are able to recognize native CHIKV. Higher level of IgG2a and IgG1 subtypes was identified suggestive of balanced Th1/Th2 response. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization activity of CHIK-VLPs antibodies was observed even with low concentration, which shows its high specificity and neutralizing activity against two different CHIKV strains. Neonatal mice receiving anti-CHIK-VLPs antibodies were protected from CHIKV challenge. Induction of cellular immune response was confirmed through higher level of TNF-α, IL-10 and substantial level of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ indicating a balanced response. This is the first report, where CHIK-VLPs has been expressed by <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and evaluated for neutralizing activity against CHIKV. These promising results indicate the utility of CHIK-VLPs as a promising vaccine candidate against emerging CHIKV.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has emerged in many parts of tropics in last decade. The absence of an approved vaccine or antiviral drug for CHIKV makes it one of the important public health challenges. Though attempt to develop a CHIKV vaccine was initiated in 1980s, however it has not succeeded so far. The Virus like particles (VLPs) are now explored as promising vaccine candidate against many viruses viz. HBV, HPV etc. In this study, we report the production of CHIK-VLPs using novel yeast expression system (<italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>) and its evaluation as vaccine candidate. These CHIK-VLPs share morphological identity to native CHIKV. The results indicate that CHIK-VLPs induced both cell mediated as well as humoral response in a balanced manner, which fulfils its criteria as a potent immunogen. Further, antibodies generated against CHIK-VLPs demonstrated efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization activity, as evaluated through plaque reduction in Vero cells and protection in CHIKV infected neonatal mice respectively using two different CHIKV strains, which makes it a promising vaccine candidate. The yeast expressed CHIK-VLPs has high potential for development of an effective vaccine candidate against CHIKV during epidemic situations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito transmitted arbovirus of immense public health significance. It belongs to family <italic>Togaviridae</italic> and genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic>. The word Chikungunya comes from Makonde language, meaning “which bends up”, relating to the patients having contoured posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref001">1</xref>]. After its first isolation from Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV has caused numerous outbreaks, both in Africa and Asia. In the last decade, it reemerged in Kenya in 2004, from where virus spread to Indian Ocean islands, Asia, Africa and Europe. Recently it was also reported from Caribbean islands and many parts of Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>CHIKV is a spherical, enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus of about 60–70 nm. The RNA is enclosed in a ~ 40 nm nucleocapsid that is enveloped by a host derived lipid bilayer supporting viral trimeric glycoprotein-spikes, CHIKV genome is 11,805 nucleotides long. It contains two open reading frames (ORF) encoding the non-structural polyprotein (nsP1-nsP4) and the structural proteins (capsid, envelope proteins E3, E2, 6K, E1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>CHIK-fever caused by CHIKV is a febrile illness associated with rash and severe polyarthralgia that may persist for years. Polyarthralgia, particularly of small joints are the typical symptoms associated with CHIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref007">7</xref>]. The mortality rate is low (&lt; 0.5%), but is higher in infants less than 12 months old (about 3%) and elderly (more than 60 years old) with concurrent diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref002">2</xref>]. CHIKV is transmitted mainly by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. The vector control measures that can play important role in control of infection, have so far proved unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Vaccination has the potential of protecting humans and limiting transmission of CHIKV. Currently there are no licensed antiviral or vaccine available commercially. Since 1960 various efforts has been made to develop a vaccine against CHIKV. These include inactivated vaccine, live-attenuated virus vaccines, DNA vaccines, chimeric virus vaccines, subunit protein vaccines and a virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines. Among these, majority of vaccine candidates are at preclinical stage and/or phase I trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Conventional inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have been demonstrated to be immunogenic in humans. However requirement of large quantity of virus and BSL-3 containment for vaccine manufacturing are the main hurdles. Though live-attenuated vaccine elicits effective balanced immune response, however, there is a concern of reversion to virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref010">10</xref>]. A live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine (TSI-GSD218), developed by U.S. Army showed promising results in phase I and phase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref012">12</xref>] clinical trials, however, it was not pursued further due to some side effect like arthralgia in 8% of volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref013">13</xref>]. Formalin inactivated vaccine have also shown promising immunogenicity against CHIKV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref014">14</xref>]. Later subunit E1 &amp; E2 protein based vaccines were evaluated in mice model that elicited good immune response and protection with different adjuvants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref016">16</xref>]. DNA vaccine approach was also pursued with C–E2–E1 construct; however it showed practical limitations due to requirement of multiple booster immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref009">9</xref>]. Recently a novel IRES based live attenuated CHIKV vaccine showed good titre of neutralizing antibodies and protection in various mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The virus like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious, nano sized caged architecture composed of viral structural proteins. The presence of complete structural proteins makes it an excellent antigen that strongly mimics the native virus but lack the viral genome making it a safer vaccine candidate. VLPs based CHIKV vaccine candidate produced in mammalian and insect expression system induced an effective immune response even at lower antigen doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref019">19</xref>]. The efficacy of HEK cell based VLP was successfully demonstrated in human volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref020">20</xref>]. Further recombinant baculovirus derived VLP was shown to generate good neutralization antibody and also provided protection in mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref019">19</xref>]. But these VLPs have some disadvantages; CHIK-VLPs based on mammalian cell expression system are related with higher production cost and lower controllability and productivities. Moreover, in baculovirus insect cell expression system, co-production of enveloped baculovirus particles contaminates the vaccine candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref021">21</xref>]. Moreover, it is difficult to separate baculovirus particles and VLPs; VLPs produced in this system requires chemical inactivation or several downstream processing steps to remove baculovirus infectivity, which will subsequently increase the production cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> cells readily grow in suspension cultures, which is a benefit of the yeast expression system. <italic>Pichia</italic> expression system is an attractive alternate platform for production of VLPs due to its several advantages including production of protein in native conformation, cheaper operating costs, simple chemical media and free from virus contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref023">23</xref>] Further, yeast-expressed VLPs were found to be safe and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref024">24</xref>]. The first yeast derived Hepatitis B virus VLP vaccine received FDA approval in 1986. Till date, a number of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>Pastoris</italic> derived VLP-based vaccines have been approved by US FDA and commercially available worldwide against hepatitis B virus. In India, VLPs based vaccines against HBSAg, derived from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> are commercially available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref024">24</xref>]. Other <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> derived Dengue VLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref025">25</xref>], HPV-16 VLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref026">26</xref>] and Norovirus VLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref027">27</xref>] are shown to be elicit good neutralizing antibody titer.</p>
<p>With these advantages, in the present study, we first time exploited <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> expression system to develop CHIK-VLPs based vaccine candidate and evaluated its immunogenicity in a mice model.</p>

There is no significant difference with the level of IgG1 and IgG2a, whereas with respect to IgG2b, the level of IgG1 and IgG2a were found to significantly (<sup><bold>$</bold></sup>P &lt; 0.0001) higher. The level of IgG3 was found to be significantly lower (<sup>¤</sup>P &lt; 0.0001) than IgG1 and IgG2a in all doses of CHIK-VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004782.g004">Fig 4</xref>). A comparison of the magnitude of CHIKV antibody response was made between VLPs and inactivated CHIKV, in which antibody subtype profile was comparable between CHIK-VLPs and inactivated CHIKV immunized mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004782.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chikungunya fever represents one of the classic examples of arboviral infection that has spread in most parts of the world over last decade. Inspite of its global presence, no licensed vaccine or antivirals are currently available. An effective vaccine has the potential to prevent human infection as well as stop the transmission of CHIKV. Though research on development of a CHIK vaccine has been initiated since mid 1980’s, however none was yet licensed.</p>
<p>A large number of heterologous proteins have been expressed either intracellular or in secreted form using <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> system. There are a limited number of vectors for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> but most of them incorporated with tightly regulated and very strong AOX promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref035">35</xref>]. Here, pPIC9K vector was used, which is known to generate multicopy integrants and allows expression of recombinant proteins in secretory form using α-factor secretion signals. This α-factor secretion signals has a protease cleavage site that provides signals for secreted expression. Since native proteins of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> are secreted in very small amount, therefore, the secreted heterologous protein mainly comprises the total protein content of the culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Recombinant <italic>Pichia</italic> clones have been generated with multi copy integrants, which harbor multiple copies of structural polyprotein gene of CHIKV. This is achieved through integration of transgene containing CHIKV structural polyprotein within <italic>Pichia</italic> genome via homologous recombination at multiple sites. This maintains stability of the target gene, over several passages. Further introduction of a mutation in one copy of the expression cassette has no effect on the total amount of expressed proteins as other copies resulting from multiple integration process contribute markedly in the compensation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref037">37</xref>]. The host endopeptidase enables the separation of secretory signal from the expressed protein, resulting in the release of the structural polyprotein which assembled to form CHIK-VLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Further the optimization of expression parameters of CHIK-VLP revealed YPD with 2% methanol as induction medium and yield of expressed protein was highest at 48 hrs. Induction of CHIK-VLPs expression was carried out using methanol which is very cheap and economical carbon source. In denaturing PAGE, approximately 52 KD, 35 KD and 13 KD bands have been observed which corresponds to the size of CHIKV E1/E2, capsid and E3 protein respectively. So, these observations indicated the presence of all structural proteins in the VLPs. The yield of CHIK-VLP was found to be 60 mg/l in this study. This further indicates the higher productivity of VLP in <italic>Pichia</italic> system compared to other systems like mammalian (10–20 mg/l) and insect expression (40 mg/l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref019">19</xref>]. These VLPs were successfully characterized by using different anti CHIKV specific antibodies via immunoblotting. The TEM results further indicated the morphological similarity of the CHIK-VLPs to the native CHIKV particles. Average diameter of Chikungunya cores was found approximately 40 nm which is consistent with the size of CHIKV and other alphaviruses. Thus, this observation is in agreement with the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>VLPs have been known to stimulate similar immune response as native virus. Polyvalence of VLPs leads to high frequency of cross linking between B-cell receptors and VLPs epitopes that resulted in stronger humoral response as well as broader protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref038">38</xref>]. VLPs vaccines against hepatitis B virus and human Papilloma virus are commercially available. These VLPs have served as polyvalent antigen and elicited prophylactic activity for human beings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref040">40</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>Pichia</italic> system proved economical for large scale production of recombinant proteins with high safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref034">34</xref>]. This study also indicates that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> can serve as an alternate host system for large scale production of Chikungunya VLPs.</p>
<p>VLPs stimulate innate as well as adaptive immune response and act as safer effective vaccine candidate. Recently, phase I clinical trial on HEK cell based CHIK-VLPs has been successfully conducted by National Institute of Health (NIH) and it has been shown to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy human volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Our evaluation indicated that the CHIK-VLPs elicited both humoral as well as cell mediated immune response in mice. The humoral immune response was characterized by high titers of ELISA antibodies. Further, high titer of neutralizing antibodies was demonstrated by plaque reduction neutralization assay. All doses exhibited promising antibody titre. The peak ELISA antibody titer was obtained on 42 days of post-vaccination; antibody titers were 3.2 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 2.56 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 8 × 10<sup>3</sup> with 40 μg, 20 μg and 10 μg CHIK-VLPs respectively. Humoral response plays a crucial role in neutralization of viruses and their clearance. In the present study, successful recognition of native CHIKV by antibodies raised against different doses of CHIK-VLPs was demonstrated in infected Vero cells. Virus neutralizing titre was determined for sera raised against different doses of CHIK-VLPs with two different viral strains belonging to ECSA genotype. The PRNT<sub>50</sub> titer of mice sera was found to be dose dependent. This result support that antibodies raised against CHIK-VLPs not only effectively recognizes native CHIKV but also neutralize different strains of CHIKV. <italic>In vivo</italic> neutralization of different strains of CHIKV by anti CHIK-VLP sera was demonstrated in suckling mice through passive immunization. It was observed that CHIKV infection in suckling mice led to appearance of classic symptoms including increased viremia, retarded growth and hind limb paralysis. Immunized suckling mice were found to be protected as there was a 10 fold lower CHKV RNA copies at day 3 dpi and further 2500 fold lower CHIKV RNA copies were detected at day 6 dpi in IgG treated groups compared to virus control group. This passive immunization study clearly confirmed the ability of anti CHIK-VLP in both <italic>in vivo</italic> recognition as well as binding to antigenic sites of CHIKV leading to efficient neutralization.</p>
<p>Earlier studies of CHIK-VLPs in non human primates and mice revealed the important role of neutralizing antibody in the protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref042">42</xref>]. In this study VLPs are shown to elicit high titer of neutralizing antibodies leading to protection against CHIKV in neonatal mice. The VLPs have also been recently shown to be more immunogenic compared to subunit antigens E1 or E2 in mouse model due to presence of higher density of antigenic epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Titre of IgG1 and IgG2a was comparable in CHIK-VLPs and inactivated CHIKV immunized mice. This demonstrates the effectiveness of CHIK-VLPs to induce a strong immune response comparable to inactivated CHIKV. In previous studies CHIK-VLPs have been shown to protect mice against CHIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref018">18</xref>]. In these studies two booster doses with 19 μg CHIK-VLPs with adjuvant were required to protect mice, while in our study only single booster dose of even 10 μg CHIK-VLPs with adjuvant is sufficient to protect mice from CHIKV infection.</p>
<p>CHIKV specific cell mediated immune response against different formulations of CHIK-VLPs were evaluated through stimulation of splenocytes by inactivated CHIKV. Efficient stimulation of both humoral and cell mediated immune response is considered crucial for an effective vaccine. Hence the present study demonstrating induction of efficient cell mediated immune response by CHIK-VLPs is an important finding. Results of cell mediated response against CHIK-VLPs demonstrated the balanced Th1 and Th2 response. IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ mediate Th1 response and IL-4 and IL-10 mediate Th2 response. Higher expression of TNF-α, IL-10 and moderate expression of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ indicated a balanced Th1/Th2 response. Significant up regulation of TNF-α, IL-2 and IgG2a favored the Th1 response whereas production of IL-4, IL-10 and IgG1 favored the Th2 response.</p>
<p>Role of cell mediated immune response in protection against CHIKV has been studied earlier in wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref044">44</xref>], where elevated level of TNF-α and IFN-γ helps in protection against natural CHIKV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004782.ref045">45</xref>]. The induction of higher level of TNF-α and IFN-γ has been observed in mice immunized with different doses of CHIK-VLPs supports efficient generation of cell mediate immune response similar to that of native CHIKV response.</p>
<sec id="sec031">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this is the first report where, the potential of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pastoris</italic> to express CHIK-VLPs has been demonstrated. CHIK-VLPs are also found immunogenic in mice and found efficient in inducing virus neutralizing antibodies and balance Th1/Th2 response. Purified IgG from CHIK-VLPs immunized mice sera showed protection against CHIKV viremia and hind limb paralysis in neonatal mice. These results confirm the protective efficacy of CHIK-VLPs against emerging Chikungunya virus.</p>
