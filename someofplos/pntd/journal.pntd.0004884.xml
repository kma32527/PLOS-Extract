<abstract>
<p>Scrub typhus is a neglected tropical disease, caused by <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>, a Gram-negative bacterium that is transmitted to mammalian hosts during feeding by <italic>Leptotrombidium</italic> mites and replicates predominantly within endothelial cells. Most studies of scrub typhus in animal models have utilized either intraperitoneal or intravenous inoculation; however, there is limited information on infection by the natural route in murine model skin or its related early host responses. Here, we developed an intradermal (i.d.) inoculation model of scrub typhus and focused on the kinetics of the host responses in the blood and major infected organs. Following ear inoculation with 6 x 10<sup>4</sup> <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic>, mice developed fever at 11–12 days post-infection (dpi), followed by marked hypothermia and body weight loss at 14–19 dpi. Bacteria in blood and tissues and histopathological changes were detected around 9 dpi and peaked around 14 dpi. Serum cytokine analyses revealed a mixed Th1/Th2 response, with marked elevations of MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3 and IL-10 at 9 dpi, followed by increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, G-CSF, RANTES/CCL5, KC/CCL11, IL-1α/β, IL-2, TNF-α, GM-CSF), as well as modulatory cytokines (IL-9, IL-13). Cytokine levels in lungs had similar elevation patterns, except for a marked reduction of IL-9. The <italic>Orientia</italic> 47-kDa gene and infectious bacteria were detected in several organs for up to 84 dpi, indicating persistent infection. This is the first comprehensive report of acute scrub typhus and persistent infection in i.d.-inoculated C57BL/6 mice. This is a significant improvement over current murine models for <italic>Orientia</italic> infection and will permit detailed studies of host immune responses and infection control interventions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease that presents as a severe acute febrile illness. It is caused by mite-transmitted <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>, a Gram-negative, obligately intracellular bacterium. Every year, approximately one million people are infected globally; however, there is no vaccine for the control of this infection. Mechanistic studies of host immune responses have been few, partially due to the limited availability of suitable animal models and research facilities. Here, we report our development of an intradermal inoculation mouse model that mimics the natural infection. We also examined the kinetics of immune and inflammatory responses during acute and chronic stages of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> infection. As the first comprehensive report of an intradermal inoculation murine model of scrub typhus, this study improves our understanding of host immune responses following cutaneous exposure to the bacteria and opens new avenues for future vaccine-based investigations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scrub typhus (Tsutsugamushi disease) is a potentially severe acute febrile illness transmitted through the bite of an infected feeding larval mite or chigger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref001">1</xref>]. It is caused by <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Rickettsia tsutsugamushi</italic> before 1995 when it was reassigned to the new genus <italic>Orientia</italic>), a strictly intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium that resides free in the cytoplasm of the microvascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref002">2</xref>]. Phylogenetically, <italic>Orientia</italic> is in the order Rickettsiales, family Rickettsiaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref004">4</xref>]. The vector and reservoir in nature of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> are <italic>Leptotrombidium spp</italic>. mites or chiggers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref007">7</xref>]. However, these parasites in both nymphal and adult stages do not feed on vertebrates and are therefore irrelevant in transmission of human disease. Scrub typhus is prevalent in a large geographic area, comprising approximately 13,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>, stretching from the Russian Far East, China, Japan and Korea in the north, to northern Australia in the south, and to Afghanistan and Pakistan to the west [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref008">8</xref>]. Many islands in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, including Taiwan, The Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka among others, also have reported cases. Accordingly, more than 1 billion people living in those areas are at risk of acquiring the infection, and overall more than 1 million cases are estimated to occur every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref009">9</xref>]. Historically, this disease had a dramatic impact on U.S. troops during World War II and the Vietnam War and is now emerging as an important disease in the Far East [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref011">11</xref>]. Scrub typhus is rated very high on the Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center’s Global Severity Risk Index assessment of risk of naturally acquired infections of U.S. military personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref012">12</xref>]. In 1999, the World Health Organization referred to scrub typhus as “probably one of the most underdiagnosed and underreported febrile illnesses requiring hospitalization in the region.”</p>
<p>Scrub typhus is responsible for a large proportion of severe undifferentiated fevers, as well as up to 23% of all febrile episodes in rural endemic areas and has relatively high mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref013">13</xref>]. The average case-fatality rate is ~10%, but has been reported to be as high as 35% in some series, mostly due to delays in initiating effective antimicrobial treatment. In the pre-antibiotic era, case-fatality ratios could be as high as 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref014">14</xref>]. However, the disease spectrum is extremely broad, and it is likely that disease severity in humans might depend, in part, on the strain of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> involved in human cases. In fact, more than 70 strains of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> are currently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref015">15</xref>]. Reinfection with the same genotype is possible in highly endemic areas. Some individuals can progress to persistent infection even after antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref016">16</xref>], and there are no effective vaccines for scrub typhus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref017">17</xref>]. Adaptive immunity or cross-protection following <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> infection in humans appears strain-related and short-lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref020">20</xref>], but the underlying mechanisms of waning immunity are largely unclear.</p>
<p>Non-human primates, especially <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> (cynomolgus macaques) and <italic>Presbytis cristatus</italic> (silvered leaf monkeys), have been used to study the histopathology and immunological responses to <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref024">24</xref>]. Walsh and colleagues have used cynomolgus macaques to evaluate the clinical manifestations and antibody responses, as well as histological features of eschars, a unique and localized pathological skin lesion often occurring in humans following inoculation of the organism at a cutaneous mite feeding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref022">22</xref>]. More recently, Paris and colleagues have developed a cynomolgus macaque intradermal (i.d.) challenge model that closely mimics natural infection and eschars in humans and have used it to evaluate protective immune responses induced by p47-DNA vaccination against infection with <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> Karp strain (OtK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref025">25</xref>]. They have provided the first phenotypic correlations of immune protection in scrub typhus. While non-human primates are the best models for human scrub typhus, they are not widely used in laboratories due to the high expense and other logistical issues. Thus, there is a great need to develop murine models that mimic the natural entry route of organism inoculation and manifest certain immunological and pathogenic features of human scrub typhus.</p>
<p>Elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms or protective immunity to OtK has been hampered by the lack of availability of well-standardized rodent animal models that mimic the pathological features of the human disease. Most publications report murine models that were initiated via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation route in outbred mouse strains, which resulted in diffuse peritonitis and severe mesothelial infection of the peritoneum, rather than disseminated, systemic infections following an incubation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref030">30</xref>]. The newly developed model of intravenous (i.v.) inoculation in C57BL/6 mice leads to disseminated infection of endothelial cells, and lesions resembling the human pathology in cases of fatal scrub typhus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref032">32</xref>]. However, this model bypasses the natural route of infection since infections transmitted in nature follow i.d. entry of the organisms. Several groups have explored other routes of infection via subcutaneous (s.c.) or i.d. needle inoculation or mite-based transmission; however, most of these reports have focused on the early phases of infection in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref033">33</xref>], or in outbred mice which cannot be utilized for reproducible mechanistic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we report a sub-lethal murine model for acute scrub typhus and persistent infection following i.d. inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with OtK. This represents an advance that complements our recent development of a lethal scrub typhus model that used i.v. inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref032">32</xref>]. Validation of this i.d. inoculation model should permit in-depth mechanistic studies related to the pathogenesis and specific immunological investigations of the host immune response following route-specific exposure to the bacteria, and it will open new avenues for future vaccine- or immune-based investigations for disease control.</p>

<title>Bacterial cultures and stock propagation</title>
<p>The identity of OtK bacterium was confirmed by sequencing of the <italic>Orientia</italic> 47-kDa gene (accession #L31934), prior to growth in Vero cells; oriential stock was prepared from heavily (80–100%) infected Vero cell cultures, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref037">37</xref>]. To produce high-titer bacterial stocks and to avoid loss of virulence through laboratory passage adaptation, we prepared mouse lung-derived bacterial stocks by passages through B6 mice, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>]. Briefly, B6 mice were inoculated i.v. with Vero cell-propagated OtK and were euthanized when they were at the peak of illness. Lung tissues were homogenized; bacteria were isolated, aliquoted for titer/quality analyses, stored at -80°C in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate (SPG, 218 mM sucrose, 3.76 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, 7.1 mM potassium phosphate dibasic, 4.9 mM potassium glutamate) buffer, or utilized to inoculate a naïve group of animals for further amplification.

<title>Inoculation of animals</title>
<p>B6 mice were purchased at 7–9 weeks of age and allowed to acclimatize for 7 days prior to experimental use. To select the experimental dose, mice were inoculated with OtK or PBS (a sham control) in the dermis of the lateral ear with a range of doses [6 x 10<sup>5</sup> to 6 x 10<sup>1</sup> viable organisms in 10–12 μl delivered via a 30G-needle and 25-μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV)]. Mice were monitored twice daily for 28 days for signs of illness. Clinical signs of illness were consistently observed between 10–13 dpi with 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> viable organisms, whereas animals that received lower doses (&lt;10<sup>3</sup> total organisms) had delayed, sporadic onset of clinical signs of illness that occurred between 14–16 dpi.

<p>To determine if bacterial DNA detected in tissues represented viable organisms, we collected tissues at 81–84 dpi from 4 mice (with IgG titers of 1:65,536) in the first experiment, and from 3 mice (with IgG titers of 1:32,768) in the second. Lung, kidney, and spleen/liver/lymph node samples were placed in DMEM, homogenized by using a 7-ml glass Dounce homogenizer in cold SPG buffer, and centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were saved, while pellets were subjected to another round of homogenization and centrifugation. Bacteria in supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 22,000 x g for 45 min at 4°C. Enriched bacterial pellets were re-suspended and pooled in a total of 10 ml of SPG. Each naïve mouse was inoculated via the i.p. route with a 250-μl aliquot (3–4 mice per tissue group).

A liver inflammatory index was calculated as: number of lesions per 10 medium-power fields multiplied by the mean diameter of mononuclear infiltrative clusters (μm). For pulmonary pathology scores, all lung sections were examined sequentially (according to dpi) to obtain a general assessment of the histopathology and establish grading parameters; grades 1–4 were scored based on lesion spectra throughout the entire course of infection. Grade 1+: widening of alveolar septa with scattered inflammatory cells in focal areas of pulmonary parenchyma, and focal inflammatory cells around bronchovascular bundles. Grade 2+: grade 1 criteria plus multifocal clusters of inflammatory infiltrates around bronchovascular bundles. Grade 3+: widening of alveolar septa with diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrates present in the pulmonary parenchyma, bronchovascular bundles, and focal areas of atelectasis.

<title>Clinical manifestations during acute and chronic stages of the infection</title>
<p>Following i.d. inoculation in the ear, we observed no eschar formation at the inoculation site and no clinical signs of illness during the first 7 dpi, a finding similar to those in reported studies for i.d. inoculation in Swiss CD-1 outbred mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref035">35</xref>] and s.c. inoculation in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref033">33</xref>]. Infected B6 mice had elevated body temperatures at 11 and 12 dpi (38.2–38.7°C), followed by hypothermia from 14 to 21 dpi (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>), and recovered to normal body temperature by 28 dpi. Infected mice showed an up to 13% difference in weight change compared to that in sham-inoculated controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Weight loss was most evident at 14–16 dpi, followed by gradual recovery starting at 17 dpi. By 20 dpi, the body weight of infected mice had reached the pre-infection level, but it remained much lower than that of sham-inoculated controls. To assess infection outcomes, we examined circulating OtK-specific IgG titers by IFA, as well as blood and tissue bacterial loads via PCR-based quantification of the OtK 47-kDa gene, from 1 until 84 dpi. Seroconversion was observed as early as 5 dpi (1:128 in 25% of mice), reached the peak reciprocal endpoint titer of 1:65,536 by 13 dpi, and sustained high-titers (1:65,536) even at 84 dpi (or 12 weeks) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004884.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).

<p>Daily analyses of blood and tissue bacterial loads during the first 28 days of infection, as well as weekly analyses until 84 dpi, revealed the following consistent features. The earliest peak of bacterial burden occurred in the ear, the site of inoculation, at day 9 pi. At 1–7 dpi, bacterial loads were low or undetectable in the blood, lungs, liver, spleen (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>), and brain (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004884.s002">S2 Fig</xref>)</bold>. In blood, bacteria were consistently detected at 9 dpi, followed by a peak mean bacteremia at 15 dpi (98.4 copies/μl blood). In the lungs, bacterial loads peaked at 13 dpi (143.2 copies/10<sup>5</sup> GAPDH copies) and remained detectable at 35 dpi. The liver, spleen, and brain bacterial loads were lower, but were sustained longer. In the liver, bacterial loads peaked at 13 dpi (7.8 copies/10<sup>5</sup> GAPDH copies) and remained detectable at 63 dpi. In the spleen and brain, bacterial loads peaked at 13 dpi and remained detectable at 70 dpi.

<p>The prolonged presence of OtK DNA in the ear, dLN, blood, liver, spleen, and brain (63–84 dpi), as well as in the kidneys (70–84 dpi, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004884.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>), led us to investigate whether viable infectious organisms were present. At 81–84 dpi, we prepared homogenates from the kidney, lung, and spleen/liver/lymph nodes and used them respectively to inoculate naïve B6 mice via the i.p. route (3–4 mice per group), the most sensitive method to detect low quantities of <italic>Orientia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>]. Our data from two independent experiments revealed that mice that were inoculated i.p. with kidney homogenates had the highest mortality rates and tissue bacterial loads; 57.1% (4 out of 7) mice died between 12–15 dpi, with 2x10<sup>4</sup>, 3.81x10<sup>6</sup>, 4.54x10<sup>6</sup>, and 1.25x10<sup>7</sup> <italic>Orientia</italic> 47-kDa copies per mg of kidney of the inoculated mice, respectively. The remaining 3 mice inoculated with kidney homogenates all showed clinical signs of illness on 11 to 15 dpi, but recovered. Mice inoculated with lung homogenates had a lower mortality rate and tissue bacterial loads, as 1 out of 3 tested mice (33%) died at 14 dpi, with 7.07x10<sup>5</sup> <italic>Orientia</italic> 47-kDa copies per mg of lung of the inoculated mice. Mice inoculated with spleen/liver/lymph node homogenates recovered from mild illness and were sacrificed around 21 dpi. Together, we concluded that even though i.d.-inoculated mice had high titers of OtK-specific IgG (1:32,768 or 1:65,536), they had infectious bacteria that persisted in the kidneys and other tissues, and, accordingly, these mice represent a model of observations of persistent infection in human scrub typhus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<title>Hematological and histopathological analyses</title>
<p>To better understand the clinical features of this i.d. model, we performed hematological and histopathological analyses. While white blood cell counts remained relatively normal between 1–13 dpi, infected mice had transient, but consistent, alterations in the platelet and red blood cell counts and cell morphology. The thrombocytopenia was transient, but most severe at 13 dpi during the peak of endothelial infection, likely reflecting deposition of platelets in foci of endothelial injury (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004884.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). The transient increases in mean platelet volume (at 13 dpi) corresponded to the period of the bone marrow response for the release of immature platelets. Similarly, the increased red cell distribution width on 21 dpi, and from then to the end of the study, may reflect the release of newly formed erythrocytes from the bone marrow in response to the development of anemia on 9 dpi.</p>
<p>Examination of the liver in infected animals showed foci of mononuclear inflammatory cells at 7 dpi, and a higher inflammatory index was statistically significant starting on 9 dpi (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>).

After day 13, the number of lesions in the liver decreased and then plateaued, but the inflammatory index remained elevated until 56 dpi, during which time the pathologic foci increased in size and then evolved from discrete clusters to confluent patches of mononuclear cellular infiltrates as the disease progressed. Lesions in the spleen progressed similarly, as characterized by marked expansion of the marginal zone and lymphoid expansion in peri-arteriolar lymphoid sheaths, which were present even at 84 dpi.

<p>Lungs are the most important and severely affected organ in OtK infection following i.v. inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref032">32</xref>]. Because i.d.-inoculated mice had the highest bacterial loads in the lungs, other than the inoculation site (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>), we examined the location of oriential antigens in the lungs by OtK-specific IHC. At 12 dpi, the lungs contained oriential antigens in endothelial cells lining septal capillaries (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). Analysis of lung histopathology revealed substantial inter-animal variations in pathology scores during the course of infection, with most animals scoring between grades 2 and 3. The most severe pathology (grade 4) occurred at the late stage of disease (at 21 dpi) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref></bold>). Histological lesions in the lungs did not show resolution even at 84 dpi (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Serum and lung cytokine and chemokine production during acute infection</title>
<p>We have previously reported that following i.v. inoculation of a lethal dose of OtK in B6 mice, the development of strong type 1 immune responses, with no IL-4/IL-13 production, contributes to mouse mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref032">32</xref>]. To define the immune responses in i.d.-inoculated mice, we measured cytokine profiles in the sera and lung homogenates by a BioPlex assay. Serum cytokine analyses revealed two distinct patterns (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>). The early (9 dpi) production of a set of cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3, and IL-10) during the incubation period was followed by the production of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN-γ, G-CSF, RANTES/CCL5, and KC/CXCL11) at 11–13 dpi, correlating with the onset of fever. The production of other cytokines (IL-1α/β, IL-2, TNF-α, GM-CSF, MIP-1β/CCL4, eotaxin/CCL11, IL-9, and IL-13) around 15–19 dpi, correlated with disease progression. At 21–28 dpi, serum markers had returned to basal levels, except for IL-12p40 and RANTES/CCL5. At several time points between 35–77 dpi, relatively low, but statistically significant, elevations of MIP-1α/CCL3, IL-1α/β, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-12p40, and IL-13 were detected, implying sustained immune responses.</p>

<p>Lung homogenates had similar cytokine and chemokine profiles as the sera (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>). The transient elevations of MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1β/CCL4, IFN-γ, TNF-α, G-CSF, and KC/CXCL11 at 13 and/or 21 dpi were followed by increased concentrations of IL-1α/β, IL-2, IL-12p40, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1α/CCL3, IL-13, and GM-CSF at 21 and/or 28 dpi. Of note, IL-9 levels in lung samples were significantly reduced compared with those from sham controls, which was in sharp contrast to the IL-9 production pattern in sera.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Scrub typhus, an endemic disease in the Asia-Pacific region, is an important acute febrile illness in the tropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref042">42</xref>]. Development of an animal model that mimics the human histopathology and bacterial distribution is an important step toward understanding disease pathogenesis and immunity, as well as developing preclinical evaluation and interventions to prevent the infection and ameliorate its severity. Mouse models available to study scrub typhus have employed mostly the i.p. inoculation route, which results in infection that does not resemble the human disease clinically, target organs and cells, and histopathology. Our group recently developed an i.v. inoculation model of OtK infection, resulting in hematogenously disseminated endothelial infection mimicking human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>]. This new model has permitted us to examine how endothelial stress and dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref032">32</xref>], or alarmin molecules such as IL-33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref043">43</xref>], contribute to oriential pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Since natural infections are initiated via mite feeding on the dermis of the skin, we sought to develop an i.d. inoculation model of scrub typhus using OtK. In this report, we have shown that following a 10-day incubation period, i.d.-inoculated mice developed a systemic infection with body temperature changes, weight loss, and bacterial dissemination via the blood to other major organs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g002">2</xref>). While the clinical features of OtK-infected mice closely mimic the course of infection observed in human scrub typhus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref045">45</xref>], the duration of fever and hematological abnormality appeared to be much shorter or milder in these mice as compared to human cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref046">46</xref>]. Interestingly, these mice developed a persistent infection with histologic lesions and infectious bacteria up to 84 dpi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a murine i.d. model for acute and persistent infection, which will be of great value for future immunologically or vaccine-based studies.</p>
<p>Our bacteriologic and histopathological analyses have revealed several important features of the i.d. infection model of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g005">5</xref>). First, this inoculation route led to the establishment of infection with similar target cell tropism as scrub typhus, namely endothelial cells lining the microvasculature and macrophages, as in our previous report of the i.v. inoculation route and our study of human scrub typhus cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref031">31</xref>]. Secondly, while the lungs were the major target organ for the infection, containing 10-fold more <italic>Orientia</italic> 47-kDa gene copies than the liver, spleen, and brain samples, we observed considerable differences in lesion distribution and magnitude of inflammatory infiltrates. Bacteremia was sustained through 15 dpi, after the peak of parenchymal bacteria at 13 dpi, leading us to hypothesize that the delayed peak observed in the blood may be due to the release of <italic>Orientia</italic> from infected tissues. This is suggested by the observation that by 15 dpi parenchymal tissue bacterial loads decreased, which coincided with a bacterial load increase in the circulating blood. However, given that bacteremia kinetics mirror parenchymal tissue bacterial loads at the acute stage of the disease, further analysis with perfused organs would be informative. Thirdly, the histologic pattern of lung lesions was that of acute interstitial pneumonitis, which resembles the histopathology in human scrub typhus patients and in experimentally infected, non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref047">47</xref>]. Histological lesions in the mouse lungs had not resolved completely even at 77–84 dpi, by which time most cytokines and chemokines had returned to their basal levels. Finally, the liver inflammatory index is a reliable scoring system for comparative studies, especially during the acute stages of infection. Detection of <italic>Orientia</italic> DNA in the liver, spleen and brain at 63–70 dpi poses the question as to the cell type(s) persistently infected in these organs and the long-term impact of persistent infection. Such information will be important to understand the potential complications of persistent <italic>Orientia</italic> infection in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>We detected a panel of Th1- and Th2-promoting, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in serum samples and lung homogenates (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004884.g007">7</xref>). Classical type 1 cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3, and RANTES/CCL5) were predominantly induced around the peak of bacterial infection, and then decreased as bacterial replication was controlled at 28 dpi. Type 1 immune responses regulate migration of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and T cells from the bloodstream across the vascular endothelium, as well as their effector function for bacterial control. These cytokine/chemokine patterns resemble the observations in infected humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref051">51</xref>] and in i.d.-inoculated non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>In this i.d. model, three immune modulatory cytokines were of particular interest to us. First, IL-10 was one of the earliest cytokines, detected as early as 9 dpi in the blood, and one of the few cytokines with sustained and significant production for 8 days. While IL-10 may contribute to minimizing host tissue damage, it will be important to further examine whether IL-10 also contributed to bacterial persistence in multiple organs in our model. Additional studies with mice deficient in IL-10 or its receptor will provide new insight into the roles of IL-10 and its relevance to <italic>Orientia</italic> persistency. Secondly, IL-13 was detected in both blood and lungs, implying the development of Th1/Th2-balanced immune responses in the i.d.-inoculated mice. This finding is particularly exciting because IL-13 and IL-4 proteins or transcripts were undetectable, or were lower than the sham controls, in our previous studies with i.v.-inoculated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref032">32</xref>]. Given that only two reports mentioned low IL-4 levels in serum samples of scrub typhus patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref050">50</xref>], our data presented here provide new insights into Th2 cytokines in inflamed tissues. Finally, the marked reduction of IL-9 in the lung at 9 dpi, but elevation of IL-9 in the blood at 15–17 dpi, is intriguing. IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has documented effects on lymphocytes, mast cells, and resident lung cells. IL-9 is mostly produced by a special subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, known as Th9 cells, that can modulate host immune responses by producing IL-9 and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref052">52</xref>]. In T cells, the most efficient priming of IL-9 production occurs in response to a combination of TGF-β and IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref052">52</xref>]. Other IL-9-promoting factors include IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 (which were detected in the blood and lung samples), type 1 IFN, and IL-21. Although IL-9 is involved in inflammatory responses due to allergy or classical Th2 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref054">54</xref>], its role in bacterial infections remains unclear. Regardless of the source or the role of IL-9, our data indicate that i.d. inoculation triggers Th1/Th2-balanced immune responses in the early stage of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> infection.</p>
<p>In summary, we have presented the first report of an inbred murine i.d. inoculation model that leads to systemic <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> infection. The clinical signs during the acute stage as well as the histopathologic and immunologic changes resemble most features of human scrub typhus. The significance of this study is the establishment of a model employing the natural route of infection and the occurrence of bacterial persistence. A chronic or persistent infection model for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic> infection on the B6 background will be of great value for mechanistic studies for immune regulation because of the availability of knockout mouse strains on this genetic background. Using this model, we anticipate that future research efforts may be directed at examining early events in infected skin and skin-draining lymph nodes as this model mimics transmission by mite bite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004884.ref035">35</xref>]. The focus of future studies by our laboratory utilizing this model includes examining homologous and/or heterologous protection via the cutaneous challenge and exploring vaccines to prevent acute and persistent infections. This study offers a greatly improved i.d. murine model for <italic>Orientia</italic> infection and will allow detailed studies of immune regulation and infection control.</p>
