<title>Background</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> causes severe disease. Age appears to be critical in determining the clinical outcome of VL and at present there is no effective vaccine available against VL for any age group. Previously, we showed that genetically modified live attenuated <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> parasites (<italic>LdCen-/-</italic>) induced a strong protective innate and adaptive immune response in young mice. In this study we analyzed <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasite mediated modulation of innate and adaptive immune response in aged mice (18 months) and compared to young (2 months) mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Analysis of innate immune response in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from both young and aged mice upon infection with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites, showed significant enhancement of innate effector responses, which consequently augmented CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell effector function compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected BMDCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similarly, parasitized splenic dendritic cells from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged mice also revealed induction of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF) and subsequent down regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) genes compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice. We also evaluated <italic>in vivo</italic> protection of the <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized young and aged mice against virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge. Immunization with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced higher IgG2a antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses and stimulated splenocytes for heightened leishmanicidal activity associated with nitric oxide production in young and aged mice. Furthermore, upon virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized mice from both age groups displayed multifunctional Th1-type CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells correlating to a significantly reduced parasite burden in the spleen and liver compared to naïve mice. It is interesting to note that even though there was no difference in the <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced innate response in dendritic cells between aged and young mice; the adaptive response specifically in terms of T cell and B cell activation in aged animals was reduced compared to young mice which correlated with less protection in old mice compared to young mice.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. There is no effective vaccine available against VL for any age group and importantly, there are no previous studies regarding immune responses against experimental <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccines tested in aged animals. We have reported earlier that immunization with a live attenuated <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> parasites (<italic>LdCen-/-</italic>) induced protective immune response in young animals viz, mice, hamsters and dogs. In this study we analyzed <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> mediated modulation of innate and adaptive responses in aged mice and compared to young mice. We observed that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected dendritic cells from young and aged mice resulted in enhanced innate effector functions compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> parasites both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, upon virulent challenge, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized young and aged mice displayed protective Th1 immune response which correlated with a significantly reduced parasite burden in the visceral organs compared with naïve challenged mice. Although there was no difference in the <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced dendritic cell response between aged and young mice; adaptive response in aged was reduced, compared to young which correlated with less protection in aged compared to young mice. This study supports the potential use of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> as vaccine candidate across all age groups against VL.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite, <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, is fatal when left untreated. Epidemiological studies show that more than 90% of VL infections are concentrated in five countries viz, India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref001">1</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization report, Leishmaniasis accounts for roughly 1 out of every 1000 deaths due to infectious disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref002">2</xref>] and the mortality rates are similar for both young and old adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref002">2</xref>]. However, other reports suggest that 85% of cases of VL occur in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref003">3</xref>] thereby presenting a higher prevalence of VL in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref005">5</xref>]. In addition, there are contradictory reports on the outcome of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) infection caused by <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>) parasites in aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref007">7</xref>]. This disparity in the outcome of Leishmaniasis indicates a need to better understand the modulation of immune response in aged host during <italic>Leishmania</italic> pathogenesis.</p>
<p>With increased age, the immune system declines slowly in its efficiency to fight off infectious agents which in turn results in severity of symptoms and prolonged duration of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, reactivation of chronic infections occurs at a higher frequency in aged population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref007">7</xref>]. The dysfunctions in the immune system in the aged population are mainly caused by alterations in the components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, in the context of the innate immune system, there are substantial evidences suggesting that innate cells, specifically APCs (macrophage, dendritic cells), maintain unaltered immune response with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref013">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, with regard to the adaptive immune system, there is evidence for broad-ranging, age-associated deficiencies in the development and function of B and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref014">14</xref>]. Specifically, aging is associated with diminished and/or altered cytokine patterns, expression of delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to antigens encountered earlier in life, and reduction in clonal expansion of Ag-specific T and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref015">15</xref>]. Importantly, the impaired ability to mount adaptive immune responses to new pathogens may result in a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases and can cause an insufficient vaccine response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref016">16</xref>]. Indeed, reduced immune responses to vaccination have been observed for variety of vaccines including Streptococcus <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, influenza, hepatitis, and tetanus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref020">20</xref>]. However, Tdap vaccine (‘tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis’) was found to be immunogenic in subjects ≥65 years, and resulted in a satisfactory but diminished protective antibody response in the elderly compared to young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref021">21</xref>]. Additionally, it was demonstrated that live attenuated VZV vaccine (“zoster vaccine”) can elicit a significant increase in cell-mediated immunity to VZV in immunocompetent older adults which eventually prevents reactivation of herpes zoster partially or attenuates the severity of post-herpetic neuralgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref026">26</xref>]. The non-uniformity in host response against different vaccines suggests that the immunological mechanisms induced by vaccines in distinct age groups are not fully understood.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, chemotherapeutic treatment of VL with different type of drugs has shown only moderate success due to serious side effects and widespread emergence of drug resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref027">27</xref>]. Given the insufficiencies associated with current treatments, vaccination could to be a practical alternative for an effective preventative control for the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref028">28</xref>]. Previous attempts at vaccination based on killed <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites or defined parasite antigens resulted in a limited protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref030">30</xref>]. It is known that a cure from disease either due to a natural cutaneous infection, cutaneous leishmanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref031">31</xref>] or visceral leishmaniasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref034">34</xref>] protects the individual from reinfection. The notion that persistence of a few parasites in the body can sustain a life-long protection against leishmaniasis implies that adequately attenuated live <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites can likewise yield protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref037">37</xref>]. Live-attenuated vaccines allow the host immune system to interact with a wide repertoire of antigens considered to be crucial in the development of protective immunity and more importantly cause no pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref038">38</xref>]. However, a significant barrier to development and evaluation of vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis is to define the immunological correlates associated with protection both in young and old individuals. Therefore studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of live attenuated vaccine candidates in all aged populations.</p>
<p>To address these questions, our laboratory has developed a <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> strain deleted for the centrin1 gene (<italic>LdCen-/-)</italic> that is essential for parasite virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref040">40</xref>]. <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites have been shown to persist a maximum of 5–8 weeks in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref040">40</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated safety, immunogenicity of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> and protection against infection with virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> as indicated by control of parasitemia and the induction of a protective adaptive immune response in various animal models (mice, hamster and dog) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref043">43</xref>]. Of particular note, all these studies were performed in young animals. It is yet to be ascertained whether <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization can similarly be protective in aged animals. In the present study, we report the immunogenicity profile of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites in aged mice (18 months old) and compared it with that in young mice (2 months old) in terms of both innate and adaptive immune response. We investigated the innate response in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) isolated from young and aged mice after <italic>in vitro</italic> infection with <italic>LdCen</italic>-/-. We found that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection significantly enhanced production of pro-inflammatory response in both age groups compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> parasite infection. Further, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs derived from both young and old mice were able to promote the proliferation of OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells and induced strong Th1 type immune responses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similarly, parasitized splenic dendritic cells isolated from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged BALB/c mice after 4 days of infection displayed up-regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes along with generation of enhanced CD4<sup>+</sup>Th1 response compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies further showed that immunization with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> protected both young and aged mice from a challenge with virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> parasites via generating enhanced Th1 predominant immune response along with generation of NO from restimulated splenocytes. Comparison of both innate and adaptive immune response showed that aged animals induced lower adaptive response with no change in the innate response. The reduced adaptive immune response correlated with satisfactory but reduced protection in aged mice compared to young mice upon virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge.</p>

<title>1. <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection of dendritic cell from young and aged mice exhibits comparable protective innate immune responses both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Our previous studies have shown that BMDCs from young mice manifest heightened effector function in response to <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref046">46</xref>]. Hence, in this study we compared the ability of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites to modulate DC responses in BMDCs <italic>in vitro</italic> from both young and aged mice. <italic>LdWT</italic> and <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites showed similar rates of infection along with identical parasite loads at 6h post-infection in both young and aged BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). These BMDCs cultures were then subsequently examined at 24, 48 and 72h post-infection, and the percentage of infected DCs and parasite loads were calculated. Interestingly, BMDCs from both young and aged mice infected with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> displayed significantly lower percentage of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and a lower number of parasites per infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), compared to those infected with <italic>LdWT</italic> at all the time points post-infection. This indicates that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites infect both young and aged BMDCs similarly but are unable to persist for prolonged periods compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> parasites. DCs play a crucial role in coordinating immune response in leishmaniasis by providing the IL-12 necessary for the induction of protective Th1 immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref048">48</xref>]. <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasite infected young and aged BMDCs produced significantly more IL-12 than did those infected with <italic>LdWT</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Next, we analyzed the level of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO), the key components in <italic>Leishmania</italic> control, in BMDCs cell supernatants 24h post infection. Interestingly, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs from both age groups secreted significantly more TNF, IL-6 and NO compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1D, 1E and 1F</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggest that BMDCs from both young and aged mice undergo a more pronounced effector response following infection with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected BMDCs. Importantly, BMDCs from aged mice showed similar innate response like that of BMDCs of young mice in response to <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Analysis of young and aged mice derived dendritic cell function upon <italic>LdWT</italic> and <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title>
<p>BMDCs isolated from young and aged groups of mice were infected with <italic>LdWT</italic> or <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> stationary-phase promastigotes (5:1, parasite to DCs ratio) and intracellular parasite numbers were visualized by Giemsa staining and estimated microscopically at 6, 24, 48 and 72h post-infection. (A) Infection efficiency (% of infected cells) and (B) intracellular growth (parasites per infected cell) were recorded. To measure parasite load in these cultures, a minimum of 300 BMDCs were counted. In a separate experiment BMDCs were infected with parasites and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24h. Culture supernatants were collected to analyze IL-12 (C), TNF (D) IL-6 (E) production by ELISA and NO (F) production by the Griess assay. The data presented are representative of two independent experiments. T cell proliferation and cytokine production upon coculture of parasite-infected BMDCs with OVA-specific transgenic T cells. BMDCs obtained from young and aged BALB/c mice were pulsed with OVA peptide and were either left uninfected or infected with <italic>LdWT</italic> or <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> for 24h. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified from age matched young and aged DO11.10 transgenic mice, stained with CFSE and co-cultured with parasite infected BMDCs for 5 days. (G) T cell proliferation was estimated by flow cytometry by studying CFSE dilution of gated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and represented by the histogram. The staggered histogram overlay displays CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation pattern as visualized by CFSE dilution by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was done in triplicates and histograms representative of mean values were overlaid for figure.

<p>Next, we compared the antigen presentation capability of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs by measuring their ability to present <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> antigens and activate CFSE-labeled naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as measured by IFN-γ and IL-10 production. BMDCs from young and aged mice were pulsed with OVA peptide followed by infection with <italic>LdWT</italic> or <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> and then co-cultured with OVA specific (DO11.10) CFSE labeled CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation was evaluated after 5 days by flow cytometry. <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection induced the proliferation of T cells in both young and aged BMDCs and was significantly higher compared to those co-cultured with <italic>LdWT</italic> infected BMDCs as demonstrated by the histogram overlay depicting the individual % proliferated CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from different sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1G</xref>) and the subsequent quantitative bar diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> mediated induction of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation was similar in young and aged BMDCs thereby highlighting the similar dendritic cell activation. Cytokine production resulting from CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell response was measured in culture supernatants after 5 days of co-culture. IFNγ levels from <italic>LdWT</italic> and <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs–T cell co-cultures did not differ significantly between the two age groups and were comparatively higher in <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>LdWT</italic> infected BMDCs–T cell co-cultures significantly induced IL-10 production compared to <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs-T cell co-cultures in both age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). The IFN-γ: IL-10 ratio was significantly higher in <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs-T cell cultures compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected BMDCs-T cells co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1K</xref>). Thus <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs from both age groups are capable of inducing the proliferation of Th1 type of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in <italic>vitro</italic> that may lead to enhanced adaptive immune response and also there is no diminution of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced innate response between two age groups.</p>
<p>Further, we analyzed <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> mediated modulation of the dendritic cell (DCs) response in spleen using an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model. We infected young and aged mice intravenously with red fluorescent <italic>LdWT</italic> RFP, or <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> m-Cherry parasites. After 4 days we enriched DCs from spleen and sort selected uninfected DCs (UI DC) by gating live single cells for Cd11c+Ly6G-Cd11b-RFP/m-Cherry<sup>-</sup> whereas parasitized DCs (Inf DC) were sorted by gating live single cells for Cd11c+Ly6G-Cd11b-RFP/m-Cherry<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1L</xref>). We observed, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged mice had comparatively lower although not statistically significant level of splenic parasite burden compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1M</xref>) which is in agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> observation. We also assessed the expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected DC population and compared them with <italic>LdWT</italic> parasitized DCs. RT-PCR analysis showed that 4 major proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1N</xref>), IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1O</xref>), IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1P</xref>) and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1Q</xref>) were significantly elevated in parasitized splenic DCs isolated from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged mice compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1R</xref>) expression was significantly reduced in parasitized DCs isolated from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged mice compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice. We did not see any significant difference in the behavior between infected DCs (Inf DC) and bystander DCs (UI DC) from <italic>LdWT</italic> infected young and aged mice. However, we observed that bystander DCs from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected mice resulted in comparatively lower production of proinflammatory cytokines and higher production of anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to infected DCs from both age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1N–1R</xref>). Moreover, un-infected splenic DCs (UI DC) from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected mice showed slightly higher but not statistically significant level of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF) along with down regulation of IL-10, compared to uninfected DCs from <italic>LdWT</italic> infected young and aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g001">Fig 1N–1R</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we have investigated the antigen presentation capability of dendritic cells sort selected from young and aged mice which were infected with <italic>LdWT</italic> or <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites for 4 days. We pulsed these DCs with OVA peptide followed by co-culture with OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from both age groups for 5 days to analyze OVA-specific proliferation of T cells. Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> study, the percentage of proliferating CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells after 5 days were comparatively higher upon co-culture with OVA-pulsed DCs from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged mice compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Cytokine production resulting from such proliferated CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell response was measured by flow cytometry. The results showed that DCs from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasite infected young and aged mice stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to produce significantly higher levels of IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells cocultured with DCs from <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s001">S1C Fig</xref>), thereby indicating a similar Th1 response predominance in both age groups of mice. Thus, from the <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression profile and antigen presentation assay, it is also evident that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection results in similar and significant enhancement of innate effector responses in young and aged mice.</p>

<title>3. <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization induces a mixed pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response in young and aged mice upon virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge</title>
<p>Effective clearance of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites requires a proinflammatory response which is mainly mediated by IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref053">53</xref>]. In order to evaluate the protective immunity induced after <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization in both young and aged mice, we analyzed Ag-specific cytokine secretion by splenocytes from naive, immunized (5-wk), non-immunized challenged (naïve challenged) and immunized challenged mice (5-wk immunization + 4-wk of challenge) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Comparative cytokine profiles demonstrated a significant induction of <italic>Leishmania</italic> Ag–specific IFN-γ, IL-12, and TNF secretion in the culture supernatants of 5-wk post-immunized young and aged mice compared to naïve mice at protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). Additionally, the steady state cytokine gene expression pattern at mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>) was similar with Ag stimulated cytokine secretion at protein level. Interestingly, following challenge with virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> parasites, the immunized young mice showed significantly enhanced IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF secretion at both protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>) and mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>), while in aged mice significantly enhanced secretion of IL-12, TNF but not IFN-γ was observed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">3A–3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s002">S2A–S2C</xref>). Importantly, overall induction of all the proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF) was significantly lower in aged mice compared to young mice from all the groups at both protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>) and mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>). Additionally, in immunized young and aged mice, compared with naive mice, significant induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and IL-4 was observed at protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>) whereas at mRNA level comparatively higher although statistically non-significant levels of IL-10 and IL-4 were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s002">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). However, young and aged immunized-challenged mice showed slightly higher although not statistically significant levels of IL-10 and IL-4, compared to naïve challenged groups at both the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>) and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004963.s002">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). Importantly, the IFN-γ: IL-10 or IFN-γ: IL-4 ratios were higher in immunized as well as immunized challenged young and aged mice compared to naïve and non-immunized challenged groups respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>). Interestingly IFN-γ: IL-10 or IFN-γ: IL-4 ratios in immunized challenged aged mice were significantly less compared to young mice. Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization initiates mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response against virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge in both young and aged mice albeit lower proinflammatory response in aged mice.</p>

<title>4. Immunization with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced robust NO production and a strong anti-leishmania antibody response in young and aged mice</title>
<p>Since the preferential production of proinflammatory cytokines specifically IFN-γ results in increased synthesis of host protective nitric oxide (NO) by activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref055">55</xref>], we determined the level of NO produced by <italic>Leishmania</italic> Ag restimulated splenocytes derived from the <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized young and aged mice before and after challenge. It is important to note that NO product observed in the splenocytes is mainly from the macrophages present in such cultures.

Specifically, we demonstrated cytokine production from the antigen experienced effector memory T cells (CD44<sup>Hi</sup>/CCR7<sup>Low</sup>) in 8-wk post-immunized young and aged animals. Spleen cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> in presence of <italic>Leishmania</italic> FTAg followed by multicolor staining were gated according to their surface expression of CD44 and CCR7.

Since the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines predicts the outcome of protective immune response, we measured IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio. In Ag-stimulated CD4 T cells, the IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio was significantly higher in the immunized mice both before challenge and after challenge compared with either naive or naive-challenged controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004963.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).

<p>Immune dysfunction is a hallmark of aging leading to an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref060">60</xref>]. In an older adult, the benefits of vaccination to prevent infectious disease are limited, mainly because of the adaptive immune system’s inability to generate protective immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref016">16</xref>]. This has been observed for a variety of vaccines including <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, influenza, hepatitis, and tetanus and is thought to be the result of a compromised immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref020">20</xref>]. However, on the other hand Tdap vaccine (‘tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis’) gives a satisfactory but diminished protective response in the elderly (≥65 years of age) compared with that in young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref021">21</xref>]. Additionally, live attenuated zoster vaccine renders effective but partial protection against herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent persons 60 years of age and older via boosting cell-mediated immunity to varicella–zoster virus (VZV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref022">22</xref>]. These differences in the efficacy of vaccines in elderly population suggest that there is a need to validate the efficacy of each vaccine in aged population. As a first step, it is important to analyze the essential components of both innate and adaptive immunity in aged and compare with the young to find out the essential differences between the two, which can be exploited to enhance the immunity of vaccines for aged against various infectious diseases including Leishmaniasis.</p>
<p>Till date no licensed <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccines exist for any age groups. Our laboratory has shown, using genetically modified <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites, the induction of host protective innate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref061">61</xref>], adaptive immune response and long-term protection against virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> infection in younger animals (mice, hamsters and dogs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref043">43</xref>]. Since, there are no reports regarding the immuno-protective role of experimental <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccines including live attenuated parasites in aged animals, in this report we have performed a comprehensive study to systematically analyze the preclinical efficacy of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> through induction of innate and adaptive immune response in aged mice and to compare with young mice against virulent <italic>LdWT</italic> infection.</p>
<p>The dendritic cell (DC) mediated activation of innate immune response plays a critical role in initiating and shaping Th1-protective responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref062">62</xref>]. Activation of DCs converts them into fully functional APCs capable of priming T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref063">63</xref>]. Substantial evidence suggests that DCs preserve immune responses with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref065">65</xref>]. Notably, DCs obtained from elderly persons is reported to be able to present antigen as well as DCs from young donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref065">65</xref>]. Moreover, peripheral blood dendritic cells re-induce proliferation or clonal expansion in <italic>in vitro</italic> aged T cell populations thereby postponing the clonal elimination of antigen-specific T cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref066">66</xref>]. These studies suggest that at least a subset of APC in the elderly retain optimal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref067">67</xref>]. Previously we had shown that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> modulates immune responses in young mice by acting on dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref046">46</xref>]. We therefore assessed whether BMDCs phagocytic function, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> mediated APC function and DC-T cell interaction is impacted in aged mice <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites were phagocytized at similar rate to <italic>LdWT</italic> parasites and did not persist for longer time in both young and aged BMDCs. Further, we observed both young and aged mice derived BMDCs infected with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites produced significantly more IL-12, necessary for the induction of protective Th1 response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref047">47</xref>], compared with those infected with <italic>LdWT</italic> parasite-infected BMDCs which may likely induce heightened Th1 response in both age groups of mice. In addition, enhanced secretion of TNF and NO, directly involved in the killing of intracellular parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref068">68</xref>], in <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected BMDCs compared with <italic>LdWT</italic> infection clearly indicated that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites not only have impaired growth inside DCs, but they also induce a proinflammatory response in both age groups, suggesting that <italic>LdCen</italic>-/- parasites are safe and immunogenic in both age groups. Additionally, OVA-pulsed BMDCs from young and aged mice infected with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> manifest similar level of enhanced antigen presenting function as indicated by OVA specific proliferation of T cells compared to those infected with <italic>LdWT</italic>. Further such an interaction between BMDCs and T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> also resulted in enhanced CD4<sup>+</sup>Th1 cell activation as evident by higher IFN-γ and reduced IL-10 release by the responding T cells compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected BMDCs. Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection in DCs substantially boost the CD4<sup>+</sup>Th1 cell effector functioning <italic>in vitro</italic> in both age groups. Additionally, the <italic>in vitro</italic> observations were further confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. We observed, the parasitized splenic DCs from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infected young and aged mice at 4 days post-infection exhibited similar and significant up regulation of proinflammatory cytokine genes such as IL-12, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF whereas down regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine gene IL-10 compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice. Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> observation, dendritic cells sort selected from <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasitized young and aged mice 4 days post infection, resulted in the generation of similar level of enhanced CD4<sup>+</sup>Th1 response in young and aged mice as indicated by the higher IFN-γ/IL10 ratio compared to <italic>LdWT</italic> infected mice. Thus, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> observation suggest that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> infection induced innate effector response in young and aged mice and interestingly, there is no diminution of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced innate response in aged mice. Further, these findings are in agreement with studies done with TLR agonists showing myeloid DCs manifest preserved TLR-mediated immune responses with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref010">10</xref>]. Additionally, it was also shown that TLR ligand-treated DCs can enhance the otherwise defective response of aged naive CD4 T cells via the induction of inflammatory cytokine specifically IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref069">69</xref>]. Likewise, we found <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> substantially induces the innate effector function of aged BMDCs via production of proinflammatory molecules such as TNF, IL-6 which could likely improve residual functions of ‘‘defective” aged naive CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells thereby generating good adaptive response against virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge.</p>
<p>With regards to adaptive immunity, there have been conflicting reports about the tendency of senescent mice to mount either a Th1 or a Th2-like cytokine response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref070">70</xref>]. Some studies report a bias for a Th2 response in aging mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref071">71</xref>], while others demonstrate a predominance of murine T cells releasing IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref073">73</xref>]. A recent study has also shown a, unique reversal to a Th1 response along with attenuation of Th2 cell response in senescent mice during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection leading to the development of resistance against cutaneous leishmaniasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref006">6</xref>]. Effective clearance of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites requires Th1 cells to secrete a substantial amount of IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref053">53</xref>], whereas susceptibility to <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites is mainly mediated by Th2 cytokines, such as IL-10. Consistent with that finding, in our current study we observed <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization induced significantly enhanced secretion of proinflammatory cytokine like IFN-γ over IL-10 or IL-4 in the spleen cells of immunized as well as immunized-challenged young and aged mice compared to naïve controls thereby suggesting a protective role of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> in mediating the shift from Th2 to Th1 response in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenged mice, along with possible activation of IFN-γ producing cells. Thus similar like our <italic>in vitro</italic> observation, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization in aged mice also induces a predominant proinflammatory microenvironment <italic>in vivo</italic> in terms of higher production of IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF at both protein and mRNA level that may improve the residual functions of aged naive CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells. These observations are consistent with a study where introducing a combination of the inflammatory cytokines markedly enhanced the effector responses of the aged CD4 T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref074">74</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization induced heightened proinflammatory response in aged mice further corroborates with protection in this group.</p>
<p>Proinflammatory (Th1) cytokine induced NO production is the main leishmanicidal mechanism of murine macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref055">55</xref>] and in this context, we also observed augmented NO generation in <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized young and aged mice before and after challenge compared to naïve control. Additionally, we also detected a robust Th1-specific serum Ab (IgG2a) response in the immune-challenged young and aged mice, further highlighting <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> induced a generalized Th1 type response in both age groups and might also contribute to pathogen clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref057">57</xref>]. Strikingly, remarkable increase in the level of NO and IgG2a titers related to <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized aged mice when compared to naïve group would indicate heightened proinflammatory response and further reinforce the protection induced by immunization with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic>. Of note, when compared to young mice, the induction of nitrite concentration and IgG2a titer level was significantly lower in aged mice from all the groups which is in agreement with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref075">75</xref>] and corroborate with the diminished protection in aged mice. Indeed, it has been shown that the attenuated response to immunization in elderly individuals vaccinated against tetanus, is associated with decreased numbers of specific Ab- secreting B cells and usually decreased potency of those B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref020">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, it has been reported that age-related reductions in humoral responses are mainly due to defects in the cognate helper function of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref015">15</xref>]. This was further substantiated with hepatitis B vaccination, where it was shown that the defect in antibody production for the majority of non-responding old people results from a T-cell dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>T cell responses are also critical in determining the outcome of infections with <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref049">49</xref>]. Notably, T cell proliferation in response to <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigens is an important biomarker of immunogenicity of a vaccine in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref076">76</xref>]. Consistent with these reports, our results showed that vaccination with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites induces a higher T cell proliferation (both CD4 and CD8) upon stimulation with <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen in both young and aged mice which corroborates with protection in both groups. The increase in <italic>Leishmania</italic> specific T cell proliferation in the immunocompromised aged mice after immunization with live attenuated parasite, is in agreement with earlier studies in human that found live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine enhanced frequency of VZV-specific proliferating T cells in PBMC of elderly vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref024">24</xref>]. Of particular note, we observed significant decrease in the proliferative capacity of CD8 T cell but not CD4 T cells in immunized and immunized challenged aged mice compared to young mice. Notably, since CD8 T cells contribute to the reduction in parasite burden during <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> infection through cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref077">77</xref>] suggesting that the lower proliferation of CD8 T cells might be the underlining cause of diminished protection observed in aged mice. Indeed, several studies have shown age-related decline in overall T cell functions and its impact on vaccine efficacy and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref078">78</xref>]. For example, immunization of young adults with live vaccine against influenza virus provides 65–80% protection compared to 30–50% protection in the elderly. The poor responsiveness to influenza vaccination has been shown to be specifically associated with the presence of high proportions of a population of inactive CD8<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes that lack expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref078">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref079">79</xref>]. Additionally, in order to compare further the correlates of immune protection for <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites between young and aged mice, we analyzed Ag-experienced effector memory T cells. We observed, the level of Ag-specific T cell recall response was significant, as indicated by T cell proliferation even after 8-wk post-immunization in the absence of parasite persistence, suggesting the generation of Ag-specific memory cells in both age groups and further corroborates with protection in both groups against virulent challenge. Nevertheless, compared to young mice the effector memory T cell mediated immune response is lower in aged mice. Overall, our results are in accordance with other studies showing that decline in T cell proliferation is associated with cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref058">58</xref>] but that response is significant enough to provide protection against <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection in aged albeit lower than in young mice.</p>
<p>In order to determine the effector function of proliferated T cells, we further assessed the production of intracytoplasmic cytokines after immunization in young and aged mice. Apart from CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells play a critical role in the control of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> infection by contributing to the formation of granulomas in the liver of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref077">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref080">80</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed both CD4 and CD8 T cells that are CD44<sup>Hi</sup>/CCR7<sup>Low</sup> populations and represent Ag-experienced effector memory response to determine correlates of immune protection for <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites in young and aged mice. Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis showed that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunized young and aged mice had an increased percent of <italic>Leishmania</italic> specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2) either singly or in multiple combinations. It is worth mentioning here that the development of cell mediated immune responses capable of controlling <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> infection and resolving disease are critically dependent upon IFN-γ and TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref049">49</xref>]. Additionally, multifunctional cytokine-producing cells are found to be associated with vaccine induced protection as reported by several other studies including ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref081">81</xref>]. Of note, the percent of Th1 cytokine secreting CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population increases after immunizations in both young and old mice, although the percent increase in aged mice is significantly lower than in young thereby further underscoring the reduced protection in the aged mice. Indeed, in the context of T cells, it is well documented that age-related changes in T cells, specifically CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells adversely impact the outcome of a humoral response contributing to reduced vaccine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref082">82</xref>]. Naive CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from aged animals produce about half the IL-2 as young cells and resulting in reduced differentiation of effector populations that produce reduced amounts of effector cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref074">74</xref>]. Additionally, age-related decline in CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell helper activity results in the generation of defective CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell responses in terms of memory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref011">11</xref>]. Interestingly, we found a significantly increased IFNγ/IL-10 ratio in CD4T cells in immunized-challenged mice compared with non-immunized challenged mice, suggesting that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> altered the Th1/Th2 balance towards a protective Th1 type response which correlated with protection in both age groups of mice. However, comparatively lower IFNγ/IL-10 ratio in immunized challenged aged mice compared to young mice further corroborate with lower protection in the aged group. It is worth mentioning here that apart from the CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 and Th2 cells, age-associated CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cell accumulation is likely to play a major role in the increased severity during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection in old mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref007">7</xref>]. Additionally, it has also been hypothesized further that manipulation of Treg activity may enhance immune responses in the aged population and may therefore be envisioned to improve the vaccine efficiency in aged population. Future studies are needed to elucidate the specific role of Treg cell population in <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> vaccine induced immunity in aged mice.</p>
<p>Overall the outcome of the above described mechanism of immune responses induced by live attenuated <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites resulted in significantly reduced parasite burden in the visceral organs of aged mice compared to naive challenged controls. Thus, <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites are capable of inducing protective immune response in senescent mice in spite of the various deficiencies which have been reported to take place in the general immune response during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref015">15</xref>]. Finally, to our knowledge this is the first report on evaluation of a genetically modified live attenuated <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine in aged mice. It is worth mentioning here, the main reason for using intravenous immunization in the current study with aged animals was to be consistent with our previous studies where all the end points of vaccine induced immunity were derived by intravenous route of immunization in young mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref040">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, in more recent studies using dogs and hamster models, we have shown <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites injected either by subcutaneous (dogs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref042">42</xref>] or intradermal (hamsters) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref041">41</xref>] routes also induced a strong protective immunity against <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> infection. We are currently performing a comparative analysis of optimal immune responses of <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> parasites inoculated through different routes of immunization in a mouse model.</p>
<p>In summary, our results thus indicate that <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> immunization induces substantial protection in aged host against virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> challenge via induction of heightened innate effector function and subsequent predominant Th1 response. However, due to immunosenescence the adaptive immune responses are lower in aged mice compared to young and attempts could be made in future in improving this vaccine efficacy in aged host via administration of either higher vaccine dose, changing the vaccination route (intradermal) or addition of adjuvants such as sand fly salivary gland proteins. In that regard, a recent study from our group has shown induction of a long-lasting protective immune response in young hamsters immunized intradermally with salivary protein LJM19 with <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> against challenge from virulent parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004963.ref041">41</xref>]. Whether such strategy will work in aged animals remains to be seen and is part of future studies. Taken together, our studies suggest that live attenuated <italic>LdCen-/-</italic> vaccine candidate has the potential to be used across all age groups against VL.</p>
