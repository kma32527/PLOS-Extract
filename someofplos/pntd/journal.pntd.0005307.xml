<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection is associated with severe T cell unresponsiveness to antigens and mitogens and is characterized by decreased IL-2 synthesis. In addition, the acquisition of the anergic phenotype is correlated with upregulation of “gene related to anergy in lymphocytes” (GRAIL) protein in CD4 T cells. We therefore sought to examine the role of GRAIL in CD4 T cell proliferation during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Balb/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with 500 blood-derived trypomastigotes of Tulahuen strain, and spleen cells from control non-infected or infected animals were obtained. CD4 T cell proliferation was assessed by CFSE staining, and the expression of GRAIL in splenic T cells was measured by real-time PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot. We found increased GRAIL expression at the early stages of infection, coinciding with the peak of parasitemia, with these findings correlating with impaired proliferation and poor IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion in response to plate-bound antibodies. In addition, we showed that the expression of GRAIL E3-ubiquitin ligase in CD4 T cells during the acute phase of infection was complemented by a high expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. We demonstrated that GRAIL expression during infection was modulated by the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, since addition of IL-2 or CTLA-4 blockade in splenocytes from mice 21 days post infection led to a reduction in GRAIL expression. Furthermore, addition of IL-2 was able to activate the mTOR pathway, inducing Otubain-1 expression, which mediated GRAIL degradation and improved T cell proliferation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We hypothesize that GRAIL expression induced by the parasite may be maintained by the increased expression of inhibitory molecules, which blocked mTOR activation and IL-2 secretion. Consequently, the GRAIL regulator Otubain-1 was not expressed and GRAIL maintained the brake on T cell proliferation. Our findings reveal a novel association between increased GRAIL expression and impaired CD4 T cell proliferation during <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and is endemic in Central and South America, where it affects about 10 million people. In addition, migration has led to the disease being established in non-endemic countries. Infection involves an acute stage that evolves to a chronic stage where infected individuals may or may not show clinical symptoms or suffer progressive heart disease. The relevance of T cells in the control of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection has been demonstrated in human infection and in experimental models. However, the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> parasite employs different strategies to downregulate the T cell function. These mechanisms can act at the initial time of T cell activation, leading to a state of anergy where lymphocytes do not respond. However, the molecular components that regulate this process during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection are not well understood. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that this T cell hyporesponsiveness could be linked to an increased expression of GRAIL. We propose that GRAIL expression induced by the parasite could be maintained by increased expression of inhibitory molecules, which blocked mTOR activation and IL-2 secretion. GRAIL could then play a key role in downregulating T cell functions by allowing the parasites to establish the chronic disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chagas disease, caused by the intracellular protozoa <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, is one of the major human health problems in Latin America. It evolves from an acute to a chronic phase, where subjects may be clinically asymptomatic or show progressive heart disease and leads to an end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy in 20–30% of infected individuals. It is estimated that approximately 4 million chagasic individuals have developed heart disease, making Chagas disease the most frequent cause of infectious cardiomyopathy in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The immune control of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> is complex, requiring the generation of a substantial antibody response and the activation of both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. Even in cases in which these responses are sufficiently stimulated to be able to control the acute infection, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> is not completely eradicated, but instead persists in infected hosts for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> employs a variety of strategies to evade the immune system and remain in the infected host. The main method involves the inhibition of specific T-cell responses, and consequently, can favor the establishment of chronic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref008">8</xref>]. Related to this, a number of both host-dependent and parasite-induced mechanisms have been previously shown to affect immune regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, T cells from infected hosts are largely unresponsive to antigens and mitogens, resulting in reduced IL-2 synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>IL-2 production initiates proliferation, effector functions, and clonal expansion via IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref011">11</xref>]. In the absence of a robust activation initiated by TCR and CD28 signaling, CD4 T cells fail to proliferate or to produce IL-2 and enter a state of unresponsiveness following immunogenic stimulation, referred to as “anergy” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref012">12</xref>]. In the case of CD4 T cells, the development of anergy depends on the alteration of the expression of several genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Post-translational modification of proteins via ubiquitination also plays an essential role in the regulatory mechanism of CD4 T cell anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref015">15</xref>]. GRAIL, also known as ring finger protein-128 (RNF-128), has been identified as a novel E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that induces and maintains anergy in CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref018">18</xref>]. It has been shown that GRAIL expression could be correlated with the inhibition of CD4 T cell proliferation and antigen-induced IL-2 transcription by disrupting the T cell stimulatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref019">19</xref>]. In support of this observation, T cells from GRAIL knock-out mice were shown to be defective in anergy induction both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref020">20</xref>]. In particular, GRAIL (-/-) T cells hyperproliferated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref021">21</xref>] and produced more cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref017">17</xref>] compared with wild type (WT) cells in response to TCR stimulation alone <italic>in vitro</italic> or with concomitant anti-CD28 costimulation. It has also been recently demonstrated that GRAIL, by mediating TCR-CD3 degradation, regulated naive T cell tolerance induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, several investigations have shown how GRAIL interacts with T-cells, antigen presenting cell (APC) receptors and cytoskeletal proteins, thereby promoting their degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>GRAIL expression is regulated by Otubain-1 (Otub-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref026">26</xref>], which is a member of deubiquitinating enzymes with the capability to cleave proteins at the ubiquitin-protein bond by using its cysteine protease domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref027">27</xref>]. It has been shown that Otub-1 is expressed and GRAIL degraded when naive CD4 T cells are productively activated to undergo proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref019">19</xref>]. Moreover, the loss of GRAIL was mechanistically controlled through a pathway involving CD28 co-stimulation, IL-2 production and IL-2R signaling, and ultimately, mTOR-dependent translation of select mRNAs. Blocking the mTOR by using CTLA-4-Ig, anti-IL-2 or rapamycin prevented Otub-1 protein expression and maintained GRAIL expression, which inhibited T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref019">19</xref>]. Although the function of GRAIL in CD4 T cells has been studied extensively for the development of tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref020">20</xref>], with its participation having been demonstrated in the development of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref020">20</xref>], only recently has its role been studied during T cell dysfunction in the course of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref031">31</xref>]. Thus, the aim of this work was to search for a novel link between GRAIL and CD4 T cell unresponsiveness in the context of abnormalities of T cell proliferation observed during <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection. Our results provide evidence demonstrating that CD4 T cells from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infected mice exhibited an increase in GRAIL expression during the acute phase of infection, which was correlated with defects in proliferation and immune responsiveness. In addition, we showed that high expression of CTLA-4 and low levels of IL-2 prevented mTOR activation and Otub-1 protein expression, and maintained GRAIL expression, which inhibited T cell proliferation during the acute phase of the infection. Our results therefore indicate that GRAIL is an important player in CD4 T cell anergy during the acute phase of <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

<p>As CD4 T cells require CD28 costimulation and IL-2R signaling to modulate GRAIL expression, we reasoned that the mTOR pathway might also control Otub-1 and GRAIL expression. On examining mTOR activity, we did not observe phosphorylation of 4EBP1 during the acute phase of infection although it was detected later on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005307.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), thereby allowing Otub-1 expression and GRAIL degradation. This effect could has been related to CTLA-4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005307.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) since it has previously been shown that CTLA4-Ig treatment blocks CD28 costimulation and the resultant IL-2 expression. This in turn inhibits the mTOR-dependent translation of mRNA transcripts, including Otub-1, thus maintaining GRAIL expression and inhibiting CD4 T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref019">19</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments by culturing splenocytes from infected mice at 21 days p.i. with blocking anti-CTLA-4 or control antibody and GRAIL intracellular expression was evaluated 48 h later by FACS. We observed a reduction in GRAIL expression in cells from infected mice cultured with anti-CTLA-4 compared to cells treated with control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005307.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This might indicate that the absence of co-stimulation during the acute phase of infection due to increased expression of inhibitory molecules, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005307.g002">Fig 2</xref>) such as CTLA-4, which may allow GRAIL expression to be maintained via a blockade of mTOR activation.</p>

<title>IL-2 improves CD4 T cell proliferation from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infected mice by downregulating GRAIL</title>
<p>Taking into account that GRAIL expression during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection might be regulated by Otub-1 and that this depends on mTOR and IL-2 signalling, we hypothesized that the addition of exogenous IL-2 to CD4 T cells at 21 days p.i. may compensate for either diminished or delayed IL-2 production. We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments by comparing CD4 T cell proliferation in control and in animals at 21 days p.i. after treatment with rmIL-2. CD4 T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 ligands in the presence or absence of rmIL-2 for 3 days and then cell proliferation was assessed. It was found that CD4 T cells from control as well as 21 days p.i. animals had an increase in proliferation when treated with rmIL-2 together with the TCR stimulatory ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005307.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In addition, we also evaluated GRAIL and Otub-1 expression as well as the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in CD4 T cells with or without rmIL-2. In agreement with the increase in CD4 T cell proliferation from 21 days p.i., we found an increase in 4EBP1 phosphorylation and Otub-1 expression and a reduction in GRAIL expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005307.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>), indicating this E3 ubiquitin ligase to be a new player in T cell hyporesponsiveness during the acute phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several alterations of the immune response have been described in Chagas disease. Early investigations suggested that infection with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> was associated in both humans and mice with a severe T cell unresponsiveness to mitogens and antigens during the acute phase of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref038">38</xref>]. This immunosuppression was thought to facilitate the dissemination and establishment of the parasite in the infected host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref039">39</xref>], which was ascribed to various mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref044">44</xref>]. However, it has been widely demonstrated that the most affected cytokine in acute <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection is IL-2, an important growth factor for T lymphocytes that is suppressed in several lymphoid organs such as thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Many authors have shown that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> glycoproteins induce T cell anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref037">37</xref>], cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref046">46</xref>] or inhibit T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref008">8</xref>] by affecting IL-2 secretion or IL-2 receptor expression. In the present work, we found that CD4 T cells from acute <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infections in mice produced low levels of IL-2 when stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28, and also had less capacity to proliferate, which could be related to the increase in GRAIL expression. In fact, the high expression of this gene alone is enough to convert a naïve CD4 T cell into an anergic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that T cell hyporesponsiveness caused by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> antigens such as mucins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref046">46</xref>], and characterized by decreased IL-2 synthesis, might be mediated by GRAIL since expression of this E3 Ubiquitin Ligase correlates with the peak of the parasitemia. However, this still remains to be tested. Related to this, we have observed that GRAIL expression is induced directly by different <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains.</p>
<p>It has been shown that parasite components such as mucins are able to inhibit early events in T cell activation and induce T cell anergy. These parasite components bind to L-selectin and inhibit different activation pathways that lead to inhibition of IL-2 secretion and T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, another work reported that parasite-derived mucins bind to Siglec-E (CD33) and inhibit mitogenic responses in CD4 T cells by inducing a cell cycle regulator that blocks the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref046">46</xref>]. It has also been shown that mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> can inhibit CD4 T cell activation by downregulating the phosphorylation of key proximal TCR signaling molecules, which facilitates induction of anergy-related genes, and results in long-term CD4 T cell dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref030">30</xref>]. In another study, engaging the TLR7 expressed on CD4 T cells resulted in complete anergy by inducing intracellular calcium flux, with the activation of an anergic gene-expression program being dependent on the transcription factor NFATc2. Then, T cell unresponsiveness was reversed by knockdown of TLR7 and restored the responsiveness of HIV-1+ CD4+ T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref047">47</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that parasite derived factors might contact different receptors/molecules on T cells and induce T cell hiporesponsiveness directly by increasing the expression of anergy factors. We hypothesize that the high levels of parasites occurring during the acute phase of infection may induce GRAIL expression on T cells by a mechanism that we have not yet explored. However, additional studies are needed to understand how <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> directly induces GRAIL expression on CD4 T cells.</p>
<p>Expression of the E3-Ubiquitin Ligase has been linked to CD4 T cell hyporesponsiveness during sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref029">29</xref>] and chronic murine schistosomiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref031">31</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported to be induced by tegumental antigens from <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref028">28</xref>] LAM from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref030">30</xref>]. In fact, the T cell anergy observed during these infections is characterized by a lack of cytokine responses and reduced proliferative activity, which can be reversed by the addition of IL-2 and results in a reduction of GRAIL expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref030">30</xref>]. Although it has previously been shown that IL-2 is able to reverse the human T cell anergy induced by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> mucins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref037">37</xref>], this is the first work that links the ability of IL-2 to reverse T cell hyporesponsiveness during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection to GRAIL regulation. During the acute phase of infection, we observed an increased expression of GRAIL with low Otub-1 and mTOR expression and activation in CD4 T cells. As Otub-1 is controlled by the Akt-mTOR pathway and is a negative regulator of the GRAIL function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref025">25</xref>], this suggests that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection may disrupt the Akt-mTOR pathway resulting in Otub-1 downregulation, which in turn may induce GRAIL. In agreement with this, Sande <italic>et al</italic>. observed a downregulation of Otub-1 in LAM-treated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The absence of co-stimulation due to increased expression of inhibitory molecules such as CTLA-4 interferes with Otub-1 translation, with GRAIL expression being maintained via a blockade of the activation of the mTOR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, most studies concerning T cell anergy have established that it results from TCR stimulation in an inhibitory environment, involving increased co-inhibition, decreased co-stimulation, or TCR engagement with a weak agonist peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref048">48</xref>]. However, more recently, the role of mTOR and other related metabolic sensors and regulators has emerged as being of particular importance and has broadened our view of anergy-inducing signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref050">50</xref>]. Here, we observed differences in the expression of the co-inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 between CD4 T cells from acute and chronic phases of infection. An increased expression of CTLA-4 during the acute phase of infection may block mTOR activation, thus preventing protein translation, (including Otub-1) and leading to the maintenance of GRAIL expression with reduced T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Regarding this, we observed that CTLA-4 blockade in splenocytes from infected mice resulted in a reduction in GRAIL expression. Additionally, during several infections the expression of inhibitory molecules and E3 Ubiquitin ligases has been previously shown to be upregulated and to induce T cell hyporesponsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref052">52</xref>], with blocking CTLA-4 or neutralizing TGF-β during lymphatic filariasis restoring the ability to mount Th1/Th2 responses to live parasites and reversing the induction of anergy-inducing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref051">51</xref>]. Furthermore, dendritic cells activated by tegumental antigens from <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> suppress T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> by inducing GRAIL and CTLA-4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref028">28</xref>]. Although the expression of inhibitory molecules has previously been observed during Chagas disease and in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> experimental infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref053">53</xref>], this is the first study that has demonstrated that CD4 T cell hyporesponsiveness may be caused by a combinatory effect of inhibitory molecules and GRAIL expression.</p>
<p>Considering the above results, we speculate that early upon infection parasite derived factors might contact receptors/molecules to induce directly GRAIL expression and T cell anergy. Later on, expression of inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 prevented Otub-1 protein expression and maintained GRAIL expression, which inhibited T cell proliferation. However, we have shown that GRAIL expression is reduced in T cells from acute infected mice cultured in the presence of CTLA-4 blocking antibodies or rm-IL-2. Therefore, these results may indicate that GRAIL expression during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection could be induced directly by the parasite and sustained by expression of inhibitory molecules.</p>
<p>GRAIL is not only expressed in naive T cells, but also in effector T cell subsets and controls their activation. Kriegel <italic>et al</italic>. reported that <italic>GRAIL</italic>-knockout Th1 effector CD4 T cells overproduce IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref017">17</xref>]. Related to this, we observed that CD4 T cells from acute infected mice, where GRAIL expression is increased, produced lower levels of IFN-γ than CD4 T cells from the later stages of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infected mice. This is consistent with a recent report by Nunes <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrating that <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> mucin during murine experimental infection with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> parasites resulted in a lower number of splenic IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref046">46</xref>], with these effects being accompanied by a greater susceptibility to infection, as shown by the higher levels of parasitemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>CD3 is a known target of GRAIL, with the upregulation of GRAIL in T cells leading to degradation of CD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref020">20</xref>]. In the present study, a lower CD3 expression in T cells was observed during the acute phase of infection that correlated with increased GRAIL expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005307.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Although additional experiments are needed to corroborate CD3-GRAIL interaction, it has been reported that immunosuppression during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection is due to defective T-Cell Receptor-CD3 functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005307.ref054">54</xref>] and might be related to a lower expression of the CD3 molecule caused by degradation.</p>
<p>In summary, we have established a novel link between T cell hyporesponsiveness during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection and the expression and regulation of GRAIL in CD4 T cells. It is now important to extend these studies to evaluate additional GRAIL targets in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-anergized T cells. In addition, it is necessary to determine if GRAIL can be detected in T cells from infected patients, and whether its expression can be induced directly in a dose dependent manner by purified antigens of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>. Finally, our data provide novel insights into why, despite the large immune cell activation by a wide variety of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> antigens, CD4 T cells may not respond optimally to their cognate antigens. In addition, T cell immune evasion strategies likely contribute to the host’s inability to eliminate <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> and consequently permit survival and persistence of the parasite in the host.</p>
