<abstract>
<p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a post-translational regulatory pathway for controlling protein stability and activity that underlies many fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle progression. Target proteins are tagged with ubiquitin molecules through the action of an enzymatic cascade composed of E1 ubiquitin activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. One of the E3 ligases known to be responsible for the ubiquitination of cell cycle regulators in eukaryotes is the SKP1-CUL1-F-box complex (SCFC). In this work, we identified and studied the function of homologue proteins of the SCFC in the life cycle of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the causal agent of the African sleeping sickness. Depletion of trypanosomal SCFC components TbRBX1, TbSKP1, and TbCDC34 by RNAi resulted in decreased growth rate and contrasting cell cycle abnormalities for both procyclic (PCF) and bloodstream (BSF) forms. Depletion of TbRBX1 in PCF cells interfered with kinetoplast replication, whilst depletion of TbSKP1 arrested PCF and BSF cells in the G1/S transition. Silencing of TbCDC34 in BSF cells resulted in a block in cytokinesis and caused rapid clearance of parasites from infected mice. We also show that TbCDC34 is able to conjugate ubiquitin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that its activity is necessary for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection progression in mice. This study reveals that different components of a putative SCFC have contrasting phenotypes once depleted from the cells, and that TbCDC34 is essential for trypanosome replication, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>African sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which is transmitted to humans by tsetse flies (<italic>Glossina</italic> genus). Treatment of the disease is complex and relies on limited pharmaceutical options. Understanding how <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> regulates cell cycle progression at a molecular level when alternating between the mammalian host and the insect vector could lead to better therapies. In this study, we examined different <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> proteins with homology to components of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex (SCFC), previously characterized in other eukaryotes as a regulator of cell cycle progression. We found that depletion of the homologues of a putative SCFC cause <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> to develop abnormally, generating different phenotypes of the mammalian and insect stages. Interestingly, depletion of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme TbCDC34 arrest cells in a pre-cytokinesis stage, indicating that this protein is essential for cytokinesis. In addition to improving our fundamental understanding of the molecular regulation underlying the sophisticated life cycle of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, this work pinpoints a potential target for drug development against trypanosomiasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transition from one cell cycle stage to the next is achieved in eukaryotes through mechanisms that provide an all-or-none cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) activation. The activity of these enzymes is regulated by several mechanisms, including association with regulatory subunits (cyclins), phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and interaction with CDK inhibitors (CKIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref002">2</xref>]. Levels of cyclins (CYC), CKIs and many other cell cycle regulators oscillate during the cell cycle as a result of periodic proteolysis, generating a unidirectional control. These proteins are targeted for degradation by polyubiquitination, i.e. the attachment of multiple copies of ubiquitin. This process is initiated by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which then transfers ubiquitin to an active cysteine residue of an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) as a thioester linkage. Although E2s can attach ubiquitin directly to a lysine residue in a substrate, most physiological ubiquitination reactions require an ubiquitin ligase, or E3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref003">3</xref>]. Once the substrate is polyubiquitinated by an E3, it is then recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. The specificity of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis derives from the many hundreds of E3 ubiquitin ligases that recognize particular substrates through interaction domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Two E3 enzymes that comprise multiprotein components are of particular importance for cell cycle progression: the SKP1-CULLIN1-F-box complex (SCFC) and the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref005">5</xref>]. The SCFC consists of three invariant components including SKP1, CULLIN1, RBX1/ROC1/HRT1, the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme CDC34 and various F-box proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref006">6</xref>]. SKP1 and CULLIN1 are required for the structural organization of the SCFC, whereas RBX1 is a RING (Really Interesting New Gene)-finger protein that interacts with E2-ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. F-box proteins play a unique role in SCFC function, as they interact with SKP1 via their F-box motif and simultaneously bind specific substrates to the SCFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref007">7</xref>]. Each F-box is responsible for recruiting individual hyperphosphorylated substrates to various SCFCs that differ in their F-box adapter protein. Once the substrate is recruited, CDC34 transfers ubiquitin molecules onto lysine residues in the substrate, building polyubiquitin chains. Polyubiquitinated proteins are recognised and degraded by the 26<italic>S</italic> proteasome.</p>
<p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is the etiological agent of African trypanosomiasis in humans (sleeping sickness) and cattle (nagana). This parasite has a complex life cycle that alternates between the mammalian hosts and the insect vectors of the <italic>Glossina</italic> genus (Tsetse flies). The dividing procyclic form (PCF) in insects and the long slender bloodstream form (BSF) in mammals follow sequential G1, S, G2, and M phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref008">8</xref>]. A single mitochondrion in each cell contains a DNA complex termed the kinetoplast, which divides co-ordinately with the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous work on the 26S proteasome of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> suggested a role for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of trypanosomatid proteins in the control of cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref012">12</xref>] and the major effect that can be achieved by targeting this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref013">13</xref>]. In order to investigate the role of the ubiquitination machinery in the cell cycle control of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, we studied the function of trypanosomal homologous genes of the SCFC. Our results reveal that the identified proteins are necessary for the normal proliferation of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and that knockdown of these genes generate contrasting phenotypes. The apparent differential activities of these proteins may indicate they don´t form a classic SCFC. Besides establishing the importance of these proteins for the growth of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei in vitro</italic>, we also demonstrate that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme TbCDC34 is able to conjugate ubiquitin, being indispensable for the maintenance of infection in a mammalian host.</p>

<title>Identification of SCFC homologues in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic></title>
<p>The core components of the SCFC of humans and yeast, SKP1, CULLIN1/CDC53, RBX1/ROC1 and the E2 enzyme CDC34, were used to screen the GeneDB databases of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> for homologous proteins. The search resulted in the identification of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> candidate TbSKP1, TbCULLIN1, TbRBX1 and TbCDC34 proteins, all of which possess characteristic conserved domains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005626.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>TbRBX1 shares 63% amino acid identity with its human counterpart (e-value 2,8E-38). The RING motif (aa. 41 to 95) is completely conserved in the amino acid sequences deduced for trypanosomatids. This domain is defined by a series of eight Cys, three His, and an Asp that binds zinc ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref018">18</xref>]. The identity of the sequence corresponding to the RING-H2 domain of TbRBX1 is 72% with its human counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005626.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). TbSKP1 shows 33% identity (e-value 3,5E-24) with its human homologue. The highest amino acid conservation (57.8%) is found in the C-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005626.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). TbCULLIN1 shares 23% identity (e-value 2,3E-43) with human CULLIN1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005626.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The N-terminal domain involved in the interaction with SKP1 is the less conserved region of the protein. The cullin-homology (CH) domain, including residues 352 to 583, recruits the E2 enzyme and the RBX1 protein. This domain contains Arg442, which is important for the interaction with CDC34 in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref019">19</xref>]. The C-terminal region is the most conserved part of the protein (40%) and comprises the Lys residue that is modified by NEDD8 in humans (K686 in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>). Neddylation of CULLIN1 increases ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by facilitating the recruitment of E2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref020">20</xref>]. TbCDC34 possesses 20% identity with its human homologue (e-value 7,4E-31). The active site, the ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, contains the catalytic Cys (C84), the Ser involved in the formation of the ubiquitin chain (S86) and an insertion of 11 amino acids that differentiates CDC34 from other E2 enzymes (residues 93–104) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref022">22</xref>].

<title>TbRBX1 depletion influences kDNA replication</title>
<p>Depletion of TbRBX1 resulted in a noticeable slowdown in PCF growth rate four days after induction of RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, no detectable effect was observed on the growth of BSF parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>), although northern blot and RT-qPCR showed a decrease in the <italic>TbRBX1</italic> mRNA upon the induction. Flow cytometry analyses showed a reduction in the percentage of G1 cells (13% decrease) by day five after RNAi induction, with no change in S phase and a slight increase in the G2 population (5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We also analyzed the position of cells in cell cycle by DAPI staining (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Cells that are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle contain one nucleus and one kinetoplast (1N1K) and G2/M cells contain one nucleus and two kinetoplast (1N2K), while postmitotic cell have 2 nuclei and 2 kinetoplasts (2K2N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref026">26</xref>]. By day six after PCF RNAi induction, DAPI analyses showed a reduction in the percentage of 1N1K cells in the TbRBX1 depleted cells compared to the non-induced control cells (88% vs. 71%). By day seven, this difference was further increased (86% vs. 68%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). There were no obvious alterations in the number of either 1N2K or 2N2K cells, but by day six after induction, the number of aberrant cells with 1N0K and 0N1K (zoids) increased (11.8% and 3.4%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic> and 1D). No appreciable changes in cell morphology were observed in the time period studied. These results suggest that TbRBX1 could be involved in the replication of the kinetoplast, given that its depletion produces the appearance of cells with one nucleus and no kinetoplast, and cells with one kinetoplast and no nucleus (zoids).</p>

<title>TbSKP1 promotes progression through the G1/S transition of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> cell cycle</title>
<p>We next analyzed the effect of downregulating TbSKP1 by RNAi in three different clones of both BSF and PCF lines. In PCF cells, induction of TbSKP1 RNAi led to a slower parasite growth rate, which was evident after four days of tetracycline induction. Cessation of BSF growth occurred 24 hours after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). Downregulation of <italic>TbSKP1</italic> mRNA was confirmed by Northern blot (for PCF) and RT-qPCR (for BSF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). When examined by flow cytometry, TbSKP1-depleted PCF cells showed a 12% increase in G1/S cells after six days of RNAi induction, while cells in G2/M and S-phase configuration had an 8% and 9% decrease, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>). Similar results were found in TbSKP1-depleted BSF cells: 14.3% increase in G1/S cells, 6.8% decrease in S-phase cells and 2.4% decrease in G2/M cells compared to the non-induced controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). Differences in DAPI-stained cells were subtler (this could be due to the fact that G1 and S-phase <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> cells are difficult to distinguish by nuclear and kinetoplast configuration analysis); nonetheless, the majority of the tetracycline-induced cells were in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and as an example, some are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g002">Fig 2D</xref>. The enrichment of G1/S cells in both forms of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> when TbSKP1 is depleted suggests that this protein could have a similar function to its homologues in yeast and humans, namely the ubiquitination of cell cycle regulators at the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>TbCDC34 is necessary for cytokinesis</title>
<p>Downregulation of TbCDC34 was only analyzed in BSF parasites; no stable cell lines were obtained for PCF cells after several transfection attempts, suggesting that leakiness of the construct might be deleterious. In BSF, induction of TbCDC34 RNAi resulted in a rapid growth arrest, which was evident after 8 hours of tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, left panel), and correlated with the decrease in TbCDC34 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, right panel). Flow cytometry analysis showed an increase in cells with 4C DNA content and the appearance of tetraploid cells (8C) after 8 h of RNAi induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, left panel). A significant increase in post-mitotic (2N2K) cells was observed over time by DAPI staining (n &gt; 300 cells), with these cells comprising 50% of the cells at 8 h after tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right panel). We observed cells that remained joined at their posterior ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These cells went on to re-duplicate their nuclear and kinetoplast DNA, resulting in the appearance of abnormal cell types over time, with 30% of the cells having abnormal nucleus/kinetoplast (XNXK) configurations at 12 h post tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). After this time point, almost no viable cells remained in the culture. These cells seemed to display a partially ingressed cleavage furrow or an incomplete abscission of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Non-induced cells, although growing at slower rate compared to the wild-type cells, did not show these abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, -TET). Further examination of tetracycline-treated cells revealed that 75% of the 2N2K cells were in the final stages of cytokinesis (abscission), 17% had not yet commenced cytokinesis furrowing and around 15% were in the process of furrowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). These results suggest that one or more substrates of TbCDC34 have a major role on cell abscission in BSF T. brucei cells.</p>

When mice exhibited a noticeable parasitemia (~5x10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml), doxycycline (1 mg/ml) was added to the drinking water of five mice. In mice not provided with doxycycline, a humane end point was reached within 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>).

<p>Besides the protein corresponding to the tagged version of TbCDC34, a second higher molecular mass protein was observed only in the extracts of the induced parasites transformed with the wild-type version of the protein, but not in the extracts with the double mutant. This higher molecular mass protein was no longer detected in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Since the formation of E2~ubiquitin thioester can be monitored as an 8 kDa SDS–PAGE mobility shift under non-reducing conditions, we concluded that this DTT-sensitive band corresponds to TbCDC34 charged with ubiquitin. To confirm this further, we performed immunoprecipitation assays against the HA epitope in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> extracts overexpressing TbCDC34-6HA and TbCDC34<sup>MUT</sup>-6HA using a matrix that isolates both mono- and poly-ubiquitinated proteins. TbCDC34 proteins were then analyzed by western blot with anti-HA antibody. Flow through analysis showed that the majority of the higher molecular mass species in the wild-type TbCDC34-expressing sample were retained on the matrix (compare upper and lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), while the unmodified wild type and double mutant proteins were not retained. TbCDC34-6HA but not the TbCDC34<sup>MUT</sup>-6HA version eluted from the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), although the DTT-sensitive conjugate was not detected, likely due to the release of the thioester during elution procedure.</p>
<p>To ensure that TbCDC34 can indeed conjugate ubiquitin molecules, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> gel-based ubiquitination assay. This assay employed purified recombinant wild-type His6-TbCDC34, His6-TbCDC34<sup>MUT</sup> or human His6-HsCDC34 as a positive control, together with human ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (Ube1) (human ubiquitin has only three amino acid differences to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> ubiquitin and can be used as a substrate). Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody revealed that the wild-type TbCDC34, but not the mutant TbCDC34 conjugated human ubiquitin molecules and autoubiquitinated in an ATP-dependent manner. We detected an ubiquitination ‘ladder’ of higher molecular weight protein species corresponding to the ubiquitinated TbCDC34 or free poly-ubiquitin chains in a similar manner than for HsCDC34, although with a weaker signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), likely reflecting a lower enzyme specificity to the human ubiquitin and the human E1 enzyme. Moreover, like the human CDC34 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref031">31</xref>], TbCDC34 was able to produce di-, tri- and tetra-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated if the levels of the TbCDC34 protein changed during the cell cycle of the parasites. For this purpose, we synchronized with hydroxyurea PCF cells expressing TbCDC34-6HA from the endogenous locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref032">32</xref>]. Parasites were cultured for 12 hours in the presence of 0.2 mM hydroxyurea, washed, and the culture was allowed to resume growth in the absence of hydroxyurea. Cell samples were collected once every 2 hours and subjected to flow cytometry analysis and western blot. At the moment when hydroxyurea was removed, most of the cells were synchronized at S phase of the cell cycle; by 2 h they shifted to the G2/M phase. From 4 to 6 h after hydroxyurea removal, there was a constant shift from the G2/M phase to the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Synchronized samples were analyzed by western blot using the anti-HA antibody for quantification of TbCDC34-6HA, in the absence of DTT to analyze the levels of the tagged protein and possible changes in the posttranslational modification of TbCDC34. The TbCDC34 protein levels remained constant throughout the cell cycle, although a slight increase of the modified version of the protein could be observed at 2 h after hydroxyurea removal (G2/M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>TbCDC34 activity is affected by compound CC0651</title>
<p>So far, the small-molecule termed CC0651 is the only known selective inhibitor of the human CDC34 and one of very few described E2 enzyme inhibitors. CC0651 inserts into a cryptic binding pocket on hCDC34, causing a displacement of E2 secondary structural elements of CDC34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref033">33</xref>]. In order to determine if CC0651 has an effect on TbCDC34 and if it could be used to inhibit <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> growth, we performed growth-inhibition assays with different concentrations of the compound. CC0651 inhibited cell growth with an IC50 of 21.38 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), which is similar to the reported IC50 for PC-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref033">33</xref>]. However, in our assay, we measured the growth inhibition at 48 hours, as compared to 5 days for the human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref033">33</xref>]. Next, we analyzed the effect of the compound on the cell cycle of the parasites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, there was a decrease of cells in the G1 phase (77.9% to 46.3%), an increase of cells in G2/M phases (8.6% to 24.8%) and an increase in aberrant cells XNXK (0.4% to 17%), with no apparent changes in S phase. These results are similar to the effect observed in the TbCDC34 RNAi experiments, indicating that the compound may act through inhibition of the trypanosomal enzyme. To corroborate that the compound is acting upon TbCDC34, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> gel-based ubiquitination assay in the presence or absence of CC0651. As a control, the reaction was also performed with the human CDC34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, left panel). The addition of CC0651 to the reaction had modest, but detectable effect on TbCDC34 activity: production of free tri-ubiquitin was significantly decreased at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), while the production of di-ubiquitin increased slightly, but not significantly, and no significant effect was observed on the formation of the thioester adduct (TbCDC34~Ub) and of the assembly of polyubiquitin chains. These results resemble the mild effects of the compound CC0651 on the human CDC34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref033">33</xref>] and indicate that TbCDC34 activity is modulated by compound CC0651 <italic>in vitro</italic> and potentially <italic>in culture</italic>, as a similar phenotype is observed when treating cells with the compound and the RNAi against TbCDC34.</p>

<p>In this study, we have selectively down-regulated the expression of the core SCFC subunit homologs and the E2 enzyme CDC34 by RNAi in both the procyclic and bloodstream forms of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>.

In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, SKP1 mutants arrest in G1 with a 1C DNA content or in G2, indicating that SKP1 is required for S phase entry and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref027">27</xref>]. It was reported that downregulation of TbSKP1 resulted in a G2/M blockade in the bloodstream form trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref036">36</xref>]. The different phenotypes observed in our and Benz and Clayton’s work could be attributed to the different RNAi plasmids employed and unavailability of information on remaining protein levels. Our results show a similar RNAi-induced phenotype in both life cycle stages of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that TbSKP1 could have functions in both G1 and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints, as it has been previously shown in other eukaryotic cells. The SKP1 acts at different cell cycle checkpoints by binding to different F-box proteins and recognizing different phosphorylated substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The lack of a detectable phenotype for TbCULLIN1 could be attributable to expression of proteins with redundant function. Indeed, there are several coding genes for the cullin family in the parasite’s genome. We identified at least seven genes with cullin-homology domains in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> (Tb927.8.5970, Tb927.11.11430: similar to HsCULLIN1; Tb927.10.7490: similar to HsCULLIN2; Tb927.3.1290: similar to HsCULLIN4b; Tb927.8.5210: similar to CULLIN3; and Tb927.10.6930 and Tb10.v4.0249: with no similarity to any known cullin). Taking these data into account, it is possible that another family member could compensate the depletion of TbCULLIN1. Also we cannot exclude the possibility that Tb927.8.5970 analyzed in this study is not orthologous gene of CULLIN1.</p>
<p>The strongest and clearer phenotype was observed with TbCDC34 knockdown. The decreased number of cells with a 1N1K configuration and the increase in cells with 2N2K and multinucleated/multikinetoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) is consistent with a pre-cytokinesis cell cycle arrest. Parasites depleted of TbCDC34 could not complete cytokinesis, but resumed kDNA and nuclear DNA replication, and accumulated as nearly divided 2N2K cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g001">Fig 1C–1E</xref>). Therefore, TbCDC34 activity seems to affect the final stages of daughter cell separation.</p>
<p>The endogenous tagged version of TbCDC34 localized near the kinetoplast in cells that had the configuration 1N1K and, when the kinetoplast started to segregate, TbCDC34 was found in different parts of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In mammalian cells, it was demonstrated that CDC34/UBE2R1 localizes to punctate structures in interphase cells, predominantly in the nucleus, and in mitotic cells it is recruited to the mitotic spindle at the beginning of anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005626.ref037">37</xref>]. The different localization of TbCDC34 may reflect differences in function with its human counterpart.</p>
<p>TbCDC34 is able to form a thioester bond with ubiquitin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and interestingly can accept the activated form of human ubiquitin from the human E1 enzyme, showing the evolutionary conservation of this reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Mutation of Cys84 (C84S) and Ser86 (S86D) of TbCDC34 disrupted the thioester formation, confirming the active site of the enzyme. Addition of the small inhibitor CC0651 to the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination reaction had modest, but detectable effect on TbCDC34 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>), and in culture cells was able to inhibit proliferation of parasites, resulting in a similar cytokinesis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>The depletion of various subunits of the putative SCFC and CDC34 unexpectedly led to different phenotypes, suggesting that they are either involved in the ubiquitination of a number of different proteins regulating the cell cycle or that they associate into different complexes. A search for the exact composition of these putative complexes using tandem affinity protein tag affinity chromatography, may explain the discrepancies encounter in this work. Importantly, our results revealed the essential function of TbCDC34 for the replication of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>. Effective clearing from infection observed upon knockdown of TbCDC34, the activity inhibition with the small molecule CC0651 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005626.g008">Fig 8</xref>) and structural differences between the human and trypanosomal CDC34 which should facilitate development toward specificity, indicate that TbCDC34 could be considered as a potential novel drug target in the African sleeping sickness.</p>
