<title>Background</title>
<p>Thermotolerance is an essential attribute for pathogenesis of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> as exemplified by the fact that only two species in the genus, which can grow at 37°C, are human pathogens. Species which have other virulence factors including capsule formation and melanisation, but lack the ability to propagate at 37°C are not pathogenic. In another related fungal pathogen, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, heat shock protein 90 has been implicated to be a central player in commanding pathogenicity by governing yeast to hyphal transition and drug resistance. Exploring Hsp90 biology in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> in context of thermotolerance may thus highlight important regulatory principles of virulence and open new therapeutic avenues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
<p>Hsp90 is involved in regulating thermotolerance in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> as indicated by growth hypersensitivity at 37°C upon mild compromise of Hsp90 function relative to 25°C. Biochemical studies revealed a more potent inhibition of ATPase activity by pharmacological inhibitor 17-AAG at 37°C as compared to 25°C. Catalytic efficiency of the protein at 37°C was found to be 6.39×10<sup>−5</sup>μM<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence analysis using a specific antibody revealed cell surface localization of Hsp90 via ER Golgi classical secretory pathway. Hsp90 was found to be induced under capsule inducing conditions and Hsp90 inhibition led to decrease in capsular volume. Finally compromising Hsp90 function improved anidulafungin tolerance in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>.</p>

<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Our findings highlight that Hsp90 regulates pathogenicity of the fungus by myriad ways. Firstly, it is involved in mediating thermotolerance which implies targeting Hsp90 can abrogate thermotolerance and hence growth of the fungus. Secondly, this study provides the first report of biochemical properties of Hsp90 of a pathogenic fungus. Finally, since Hsp90 is localised at the cell wall, targeting cell surface Hsp90 can represent a novel strategy to combat this lethal infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Thermotolerance is a pre-requisite for microbes to propagate successfully as human pathogens. In this study, we have investigated the role of Heat shock protein 90 in the pathogenesis and thermotolerance of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, an environmental fungus that causes meningoencephalitis in humans. We show that thermotolerance of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> critically depends on Hsp90 function as modest inhibition of Hsp90 function, robustly compromised growth of the fungus at 37°C with little effect at 25°C. This observation correlated with the fact that pharmacological inhibitor, 17-AAG also showed a more potent inhibition of ATPase activity of the protein at 37°C as indicated by a lower IC<sub>50</sub> as compared to 25°C. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody specific to CnHsp90 revealed cell surface localization of Hsp90. BFA sensitivity of such surface localization indicated involvement of ER-Golgi classical secretory pathway for this localization. Furthermore, inhibition of Hsp90 function not only abrogated the natural resistance of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to cell wall targeting inhibitors echinocandins but also led to decrease in capsular assembly which is one of the classical virulence determinants of the pathogen. In all, this study provides the first detailed biochemical as well as functional insights into the role of Hsp90 in governing thermotolerance and augmenting virulence factors in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All living cells are endowed with a heat shock response machinery which plays a protective role against stress. This machinery is inducible under heat shock and it provides cells the capacity to effectively withstand sub lethal temperatures and tolerance to many other stresses. This phenomenon has been shown to be exploited by pathogens wherein quick adaptation to divergent host environment is essential to establish a successful infection. Various classes of heat shock proteins such as Hsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90 have been implicated to be involved in propagation of parasitic virulence. For instance, Hsp90 acts as a thermosensor in the malaria parasite wherein temperature stress is perceived as a cue for transition from one development stage to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref001">1</xref>]. In <italic>Entamoeba</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic>, Hsp90 regulates the process of encystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Numerous observations have linked heat shock response with the pathogenic potential of fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref004">4</xref>]. Hsp90, an essential molecular chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref006">6</xref>], has been shown to govern various aspects of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> pathogenicity determinants including morphological yeast to hyphal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref007">7</xref>], emergence of drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref010">10</xref>] and biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref011">11</xref>]. Using genetic screens, it was shown that Hsp90 regulates thermal adaptation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> by downregulating Hsf1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref012">12</xref>]. Interestingly, in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, a 47kDa C terminal fragment of Hsp90 was shown to be present on the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref014">14</xref>] and antibodies targeting the exposed Hsp90 were shown to inhibit infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref015">15</xref>]. In <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, the role of Hsp90 in drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref016">16</xref>], conidiation and maintenance of cell wall integrity has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref017">17</xref>]. In <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, Hsp90 has been recently shown to be crucial for growth of the fungi and Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol has synergistic action with azoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The fungal kingdom comprises over 1.5 million known species present ubiquitously in the environment, most of which are either free living saprobes or commensals. In contrast to the large number of protozoa and viruses capable of infecting humans, there are only a few fungi which are human pathogens. Common leading systemic fungal pathogens include <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, <italic>Mucor</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus</italic> and <italic>Coccidioidomyces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref020">20</xref>].</italic> This is intriguing owing to the enormous diversity and the ubiquitous nature of the fungal kingdom. It is also noteworthy to highlight that most of the fungal infections are either restricted to the immunocompromised state of the host or may result from an accidental breach of the anatomical barriers. Furthermore, the advent of antibiotic therapies in the 1960s have also paved the way for fungal infections. Nonetheless upon summarizing the lessons learned from pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, we arrive at the conclusion that high body temperature in mammals and birds provide an innate physical barrier to the vast inoculum of ubiquitous fungal spores. Therefore, the ability to successfully survive at the physiological temperature of 37°C seems to be the utmost requirement in order to be pathogenic to humans.</p>
<p>The best example which underpins the importance of thermotolerance for virulence is seen in the genus <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> which comprises over 37 species, most of which are environmental and non-pathogenic to humans. Only two are human pathogens by virtue of their abilities to grow at 37°C implicating the importance of thermotolerance for pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref022">22</xref>]. Non-pathogenic species of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> such as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>podzolicus</italic> are equipped with the other critical pathogenicity armours including capsule formation and melanisation, however they lack the ability to propagate at 37°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref023">23</xref>], indicating thermotolerance is the fundamental requirement for pathogenicity. However, the mechanism of growth at elevated temperature with respect to heat shock response has long been enigmatic.</p>
<p>In this study, we have tried to investigate the role of Hsp90 in thermotolerance of the fungus <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. We find that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> critically depends on Hsp90 machinery for survival at 37°C as indicated by hypersensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition at 37°C (human body temperature) as compared to 25°C (environmental temperature). Also, we have investigated Hsp90 mediated thermotolerance at the biochemical level by characterization of ATPase activity and its inhibition by pharmacological inhibitor. Hsp90 was found to be upregulated under capsule inducing conditions, and immunofluorescence analysis showed that Hsp90 is localized on the fungal cell surface. We also find that Hsp90 governs critical aspects of capsule regulation including capsule formation and maintenance around the cell wall. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibition compromises intrinsic resistance of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> to echinocandins–the only class of antifungals which targets the fungal cell wall. In all, our study establishes the involvement of Hsp90 in thermotolerance, cell wall integrity and capsulation processes in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> which are the most essential virulence determinants of the pathogenic fungus.</p>

<title>Minimum inhibitory concentration assays</title>
<p>Susceptibility to drugs was determined in flat bottom, 96-well microtiter plates using broth microdilution protocol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests were set up in a total volume of 0.2 ml/well with 2-fold dilutions of radicicol (RAD) and anidulafungin (AF). RAD gradients were typically from 5nM to 50μM with the following concentration steps in nM: 5, 50, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 30000 and 50000. AF gradients were used in the following concentration steps in μg/ml were: 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25. Cell densities of overnight cultures were determined by haemocytometer and dilutions were prepared such that ∼10<sup>3</sup> cells were inoculated into each well. Plates were inoculated at the indicated temperatures. MIC<sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of drug reducing growth by 50% relative to the wells containing no drug. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was the vehicle control for radicicol (RAD) and Anidulafungin (AF). Absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm and was corrected for background from the corresponding medium. All drugs were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. To determine nature of interaction between Hsp90 inhibitor RAD and AF, we calculated the fractional inhibitory concentration by the following formula: ∑FICs = (MIC<sub>50</sub> of AF in combination/ MIC<sub>50</sub> of AF alone) + (MIC<sub>50</sub> of RAD in combination/ MIC<sub>50</sub> of RAD alone). ∑FIC values &lt;0.5 indicates substantial synergism and 0.5–1.25 indicates an additive interaction.</p>

<title>Hsp90 is critical for thermotolerance of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic></title>
<p>The first and foremost criterion for a pathogen to establish infection in any host is its ability to survive and propagate successfully at the physiological temperature of the host. To probe the role of Hsp90 in regulating growth at different temperatures, we tested the effect of Hsp90 inhibitor Radicicol (RAD) on the growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> at both 25°C and 37°C. MIC<sub>50</sub> (minimum inhibitory concentration) for RAD treatment was observed to be 15.67 μM when cells were grown at 25°C. However, at 37°C, there was almost a tenfold reduction in MIC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). At 37°C, MIC<sub>50</sub> was found to be 1.78 μM. This indicates that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> critically depends on Hsp90 for survival at 37°C as the dose which causes no inhibition at 25°C is more potent at 37°C. To test whether compromise of Hsp90 function can exert a fungistatic or fungicidal effect at 37°C, RAD susceptibility testing was followed by spotting on agar plates without any inhibitor. Cells grown at 37°C for 72 hours in presence of RAD were spotted and incubated both at 25°C and 37°C. We found that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> grown at 37°C for 72 hr in the presence of RAD were inviable after transferring to 37°C as well as 25°C indicating that the Hsp90 inhibition is fungicidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To rule out enhanced drug uptake at higher temperature, we determined the effect of Amphotericin B (AmB) on growth at 25°C and 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). MIC<sub>50</sub> values for AmB was 0.27μg/ml and 0.52 μg/ml at 25°C and 37°C respectively indicating that hypersensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitor observed at 37°C is not a general phenomenon.</p>

We did the same growth inhibition assay in presence of RAD with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> as an organismal control wherein we found that MIC values remain the same at both temperatures tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). We speculate that the chaperone machinery which includes cochaperones and clients may be different in thermotolerant and non-thermotolerant <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species. Thus, the increased sensitivity of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to Hsp90 inhibition at physiological temperature clearly suggests that it is critically dependent on the Hsp90 machinery for thermotolerance in its host which is the first step for infection.</p>

<title>CnHsp90 is a functional ATPase</title>
<p>To further delineate the role of Hsp90 in governing thermotolerance, we investigated whether temperature can enhance the function of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> Hsp90 (CnHsp90) at the biochemical level. Hsp90 function depends on its ATPase activity and N-terminus has a unique Bergerat-type ATP-binding fold that is involved in ATP binding. A critical arginine residue positioned in the middle domain of the protein occupies the centre stage in catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref028">28</xref>].

However, it is a well-established fact that Hsp90s from different organisms differ in their biochemical activities. Furthermore, it has been previously shown that protozoan parasites have higher ATPase activity than their human counterpart. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref029">29</xref>].

<p>Intrinsic fluorescence quenching was employed to analyse CnHsp90 binding to its ligand ATP. Briefly, increasing concentration of ATP was incubated with a constant amount of protein and the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of protein upon binding to ligand was monitored as described under “experimental procedures”. Difference in intrinsic fluorescence was plotted against molar concentration of the ligand and the saturation curve thus obtained was further analysed by Graphpad Prism 5 software using non-linear regression analysis. CnHsp90 was found to display measurable differences in fluorescence intensity induced by varying concentrations of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for ATP binding was determined to be 497.05 μM.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to determine the ATPase activity of CnHsp90 at 25°C and 37°C.

<title>17-AAG inhibits ATPase activity of CnHsp90 more potently at 37°C</title>
<p>Inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity compromises Hsp90 function and hence cell growth.

First, we characterized the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> Hsp90 to 17-<italic>N</italic>-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) which is a derivative of Geldanamycin. 17-AAG and geldanamycin both binds to the nucleotide binding pocket and competitively inhibit the ATPase activity.

We took the approach of intrinsic fluorescence quenching as described above to determine the binding strength of 17-AAG to Hsp90 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Significant quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of CnHsp90 was seen upon increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. The saturation curve of CnHsp90-17-AAG binding was used to calculate the dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, for 17-AAG binding, which was found to be 12.92 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>(a) Binding affinity of competitive inhibitor 17-AAG to CnHsp90 using tryptophan fluorescence was determined. Change in intrinsic fluorescence intensity upon ligand binding was plotted against ligand concentration. Dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, for 17-AAG binding was calculated to be 12.92 μM.

The percent activity remaining was plotted against concentration of 17-AAG in logarithmic scale to obtain the inhibition curve. 17-AAG mediates inhibition of CnHsp90 activity at both temperatures tested. (c) IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained at 25°C and 37°C for CnHsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG was found to be 26.89 μM and 117.15 μM respectively.

<p>Further we determined the effect of 17-AAG on the ATPase activity of CnHsp90. Pure protein was incubated at both temperatures with fixed saturating concentrations of ATP, and 17-AAG concentration was varied, ranging from 5 μM to 300 μM. Percent remaining activity for each 17-AAG concentration was calculated and was plotted against log<sub>10</sub> 17-AAG concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). IC<sub>50</sub> for 17-AAG-mediated inhibition of CnHsp90 ATPase activity was observed to be 117.15 μM and 26.89 μM at 25°C and 37°C respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Thus at 37°C, 17-AAG inhibits CnHsp90 protein more potently. However, since <italic>in vivo</italic> ATPase activity of Hsp90 is known to be regulated by many cochaperones which either stimulate or bring down Hsp90 ATPase activity, the difference in ATPase IC<sub>50</sub> observed <italic>in vitro</italic> is not sufficient alone to explain the observation at the cellular level. For example, Sba1p is a cochaperone which stabilizes the ATP bound conformation of Hsp90 by interfering with ATP hydrolysis, thereby prolonging the association of clients with Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref030">30</xref>].

<title>Hsp90 is localised to the surface of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic></title>
<p>Presence of a melanised cell wall and polysaccharide capsule are the other two well established pathogenicity armours of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref032">32</xref>]. Armoured intricately around the cell wall, capsule defends phagocytic action of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref035">35</xref>]. While Hsp90 is primarily a cytosolic chaperone, in many pathogenic organisms, it has been shown to be present on the cell surface as well. Most notable among these examples and closely related to our system is <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> wherein a 47kDa, C terminal fragment of Hsp90 was detected on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, the surface exposed Hsp90 could also be targeted by a monoclonal antibody called Mycograb which was shown to neutralize <italic>Candida</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref015">15</xref>]. Also, cell surface Hsp90 has been detected in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref036">36</xref>]. With this background, we therefore examined whether Hsp90 is localised at the cell surface. <italic>Cryptococcal</italic> cells grown at 25°C and 37°C were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence analysis without permeabilization and the association of Hsp90 at the cell surface was probed using specific antibody against CnHsp90, anti CnHsp90 Ab. Hsp90 was observed to be localised on the fungal cell surface at both 25°C and 37°C. Also, a high degree of co-localization between Hsp90 and calcofluor staining was observed implicating that Hsp90 is also enriched in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In order to rule out nonspecific binding of antibody to the fungal cell surface and as a negative control to rule out accidental permeabilization during the experimental steps, we used antibody to a cytosolic protein phosphoglycerate kinase. Immunofluorescence using Anti-PGK Ab was performed as above and signal corresponding to cell surface was not observed in this case. Signal at the cell wall was also not seen in case of cells probed with pre-immune serum thereby ruling out nonspecific antibody binding.</p>

<p>(a) Exponential phase cells were grown at 25°C and 37°C and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence without permeabilization using specific antibody raised against CnHsp90. Hsp90 was found to be localized at the cell surface. Colocalization of CFW (chitin staining) and FITC signal (Hsp90 staining) is also observed indicating cell wall localization of CnHsp90. Antibody to cytosolic protein PGK and pre-immune sera served as negative controls for the experiments. b) Association of Hsp90 at the cell surface was also probed by whole cell based ELISA wherein plates were incubated with intact yeast cells. Significant binding of CnHsp90 Ab to cell surface Hsp90 was seen at both 25°C and 37°C. Anti PGK Ab was used as a negative control. c) Immunoblot analysis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> βME cell surface extract also detected a band corresponding to Hsp90 further confirming the presence of Hsp90 in the cell wall fraction.</p>

<p>To further reconfirm our results, we examined the surface distribution of Hsp90 by whole cell based ELISA. In brief, polystyrene plates were incubated with intact yeast cells and the cell surface association of Hsp90 was probed with different dilutions of Anti CnHsp90 Ab. As a control to rule out nonspecific binding due to cell lysis, we used an antibody to PGK as above. We saw significant binding of cell surface Hsp90 to the specific antibody as can be seen in the ELISA curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Binding was not observed in control fungal cells using polyclonal antiserum against PGK.</p>
<p>To further probe into the nature of this association, we resorted to previously described method of fungal cell “shaving”. β-mercaptoethanol extraction of cell surface associated proteins were performed as described in the experimental procedures. Briefly log phase cells were incubated in 1% βME- PBS for 60 mins and the extract thus obtained (culture supernatant) was subjected to immunoblot analysis using Anti CnHsp90 Ab. A band at the correct molecular size of Hsp90 was detected in the βME extract at both temperatures, further strengthening our observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell surface association of Hsp90 depends on ER Golgi secretory pathway</title>
<p>Capsule and cell wall are intricately linked and assembly of capsule involves the trafficking of a large number of polysaccharides along with the proteins necessary for assembly onto the cell surface. Role of classical secretion pathway has been implicated in capsular monomer assembly by using conditionally defective secretory mutants wherein cargo from accumulated vesicles was found to react with anti GXM mAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref037">37</xref>]. Interestingly, it was also shown that colloidal gold labelled mAbs against GXM binds with linear fibres present both on cell surface and cytosolic secretory vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to address how Hsp90 is trafficked to the cell surface, we tried to interfere with the process of capsular assembly by using Brefeldin A (BFA), a well-studied vesicle trafficking inhibitor. BFA interferes with the action of ARF and blocks the anterograde transport of proteins between the ER and Golgi apparatus. Cells were grown in presence of BFA at 25°C and 37°C and then immunofluorescence was carried out as described above. Signal for Hsp90 at cell surface was completely abolished in BFA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) indicating ER to Golgi transport is important for Hsp90 localization to the cell surface. We also used N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) which is a cysteine alkylating agent that interferes with disulphide bond formation. A faint and diffused signal is seen in case of NEM treated cells which indicates NEM is also able to abolish the cell surface trafficking process of Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This result clearly establishes that cell surface association of Hsp90 depends on the classical secretory pathway.</p>

(a) Indirect Immunofluorescence using specific antibody show surface localization of Hsp90 at both temperatures.

<p>We hypothesized that Hsp90 may be chaperoning client proteins which are important in this process and hence gets piggybacked along with its client to the surface. This means Hsp90 inhibition will abrogate its association with these client proteins and hence would interfere with the process of its trafficking to the cell wall. To test this possibility, we also grew the cells in the presence of 0.5 μMRAD for 48 hours and probed Hsp90 surface localisation as above. We examined the cell viability by Trypan blue dye exclusion method and found 90–95% viability thus ruling out cell death during RAD treatment. Signal at the cell surface for Hsp90 was not observed at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This indicates that pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 also leads to derailment of the pathways necessary for its localization on the cell wall.</p>

<title>Hsp90 regulates capsule induction and maintenance in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic></title>
<p>Cells respond to stress by regulating the abundance of proteins in myriad ways. Therefore, to get a cellular picture of Hsp90 under thermal stress, we first quantified the protein level expression of Hsp90 at different temperatures. Cells were grown at 25°C and 37°C till exponential phase and the lysate was probed with Anti CnHsp90 antibody. Upon checking the expression of CnHsp90 under steady state, we found similar protein levels under conditions of prolonged growth in YPD at 25°C and 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). When cells were grown at 25°C and then shifted to 37°C, we found transient increase in Hsp90 levels after 20 mins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005836.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). However, since <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions are drastically different than the host environment, we tried to mimic the host environment by growing cells in the presence of 10% serum, which also is known to induce the process of capsulation. We probed protein levels under capsule inducing conditions and found a marked upregulation of Hsp90 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We also observed significant upregulation of Hsp90 under another well-established capsule inducing condition i.e. 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> which mimics lung environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005836.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Capsule regulation is dynamic, it’s size changes in context of infection and polysaccharide shedding is also reported. Since Hsp90 is cell surfaced localised and is also upregulated under capsule inducing conditions, therefore we hypothesized that compromise in Hsp90 function may affect capsular assembly. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on capsule formation. First cells were incubated in capsule inducing medium in presence of RAD and capsule formation was observed microscopically with respect to no drug control. Significant reduction in capsule size was observed when RAD was added in the capsule inducing media as compared to no drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This indicates that Hsp90 function is important for induction of capsule formation as treatment with RAD during capsule induction led to approximately 60% reduction in capsular volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Next, we asked if Hsp90 is also required for maintenance of capsule around the cell. Cells were first grown in capsule inducing medium and RAD treatment was done post capsulation. Similar reduction was seen in capsular volume in case of post capsulation treatment also indicating that Hsp90 is required for maintenance of capsules around the cell wall. Taken together, these observations clearly suggest that Hsp90 trafficking to the cell wall and capsular assembly are related processes and hence it assigns an important role of regulating capsule dynamics to Hsp90 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>.</p>

<title>Hsp90 governs echinocandin resistance at 37°C but not at 25°C</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus</italic> has been shown to be intrinsically resistant to echinocandins which target the fungal cell wall. In <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, role of Hsp90 in echinocandin resistance has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref010">10</xref>]. Previous studies in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> have shown synergy of Hsp90 inhibitors Mycograb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref015">15</xref>] and RAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref018">18</xref>] with azoles. Given that Hsp90 is present at the surface of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, we set out to examine if Hsp90 has a role in potentiating echinocandin resistance in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>. To address this, first we evaluated the susceptibility of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to the widely used echinocandin–anidulafungin(AF) by performing antifungal broth microdilution assays as described previously. This assay was done both at 25°C and 37°C to examine whether temperature influences AF tolerance. We observed robust resistance to AF as indicated by normal growth of cells even at high doses of AF (16μg/ml). Also, higher temperature had no impact on AF tolerance as resistance was seen at both temperatures tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Therefore, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is resistant to AF and the resistance profile is similar at 25°C and 37°C.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we wanted to evaluate the impact of pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 on AF resistance in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>. A similar approach was followed wherein cells were grown in presence of AF and RAD at the concentrations indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Compromising Hsp90 function with RAD (0.25μM and 0.5 μM) in presence of AF (4μg/ml)) had no impact on growth of the isolate as compared to the drug free controls at 25°C. Notably, at 37°C there was approximately a 42% decrease in growth at a lower dose of AF (4μg/ml) upon RAD treatment at a concentration of 0.25μM. At 0.5μM RAD, AF had enhanced sensitivity with almost 47% lower growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005836.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Surprisingly this effect was not seen at 25°C at the same concentrations tested as mentioned above. To determine the nature of drug interaction, we further analyzed the fractional inhibitory concentrations of the two drugs at 37°C by calculating ∑FIC for the combination treatment as described in the methods section. ∑FIC value for RAD and AF combination was calculated to be 0.56 thus indicating an additive effect. This strengthens the fact that Hsp90 mediated thermotolerance regulates pathogenicity of the fungus in myriad ways. Our study therefore also reinforces the potential of Hsp90 inhibitors as a promising and powerful antifungal combination therapy along with echinocandins against <italic>Cryptococcal</italic> infections.</p>

<sec id="sec025" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fungal pathogens first need to cross the formidable barrier of high physiological temperature in order to live and colonize within mammals. One such example of thermotolerance manoeuvring fungal pathogenesis has been seen in the genus <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> wherein only species capable of growth at 37°C are human pathogens. <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species which lack this ability despite having other virulence factors, for example, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>podzolicus</italic> are non-pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref039">39</xref>]. Temperature is known to act as a cue for dimorphism in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> wherein it undergoes yeast to hyphal transition at 37°C which is implicated in its virulence. Interestingly Hsp90 has been shown to be the regulator of this switch by repressing the Ras1-PKA signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref007">7</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, serial analysis of gene expression and microarray studies have revealed the upregulation of Hsp90 at 37°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref040">40</xref>], under reduced iron conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref041">41</xref>] and under fluconazole stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref042">42</xref>]. However detailed understanding about the role of Hsp90 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is lacking. In this context, we have investigated the role of Hsp90 in governing thermotolerance in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. We find that growth at physiological temperature critically depends on Hsp90 function as mild compromise in function at 37°C but not at 25°C is lethal for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. We further investigated biochemical profile of the protein by characterization of its ATPase activity and inhibition by 17-AAG. This is the first report of the kinetic parameters of Hsp90 of a pathogenic fungus. We found that CnHsp90 binds to its ligand with an affinity constant 497.05 μM. ATPase activity was found to be higher at 37°C. This strengthens the fact that being a pathogen which experiences stressful and highly demanding environment, higher rate of client cycling through the chaperone cycle is a must as reflected by higher catalytic efficiency. Interestingly we observe that ATPase activity is 4.5-fold more sensitive to inhibition by 17-AAG at 37°C which indicates different conformational dynamics of the protein at higher temperature. Nonetheless, this agrees with higher cellular growth inhibition indicating at 37°C, ATPase activity of Hsp90 is more crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Alterations in ambient temperature may lead to a change in concentration of free Hsp90 as global burden of protein folding increases and hence may influence the interaction of Hsp90 with those clients which are required for growth at high temperature. This prompted us to investigate the localization of Hsp90. Hsp90 was found to be cell surface associated and this association was perturbed by interfering with the ER Golgi classical secretory pathway. Since cell wall is also intricately associated with capsule, another important and unique virulence attribute of the pathogen, we probed Hsp90 levels under capsule inducing conditions and found it to be upregulated. Capsular assembly is a complicated process as it involves synthesis of nucleotide sugar donors in the cytoplasm, however, assembly takes place near the cell wall. Active transport of capsular polymers takes place and it has been shown that inhibitors of vesicular transport or secretory pathway mutants lead to decreased capsule. Additionally, the cell wall is the interface of capsule attachment and it provides a scaffold for proteins that mediate the process. Upon compromise of Hsp90 function during the process of capsulation as well as post capsulation, significant reduction in capsule size was seen thereby confirming that Hsp90 is involved both in assembly and maintenance of capsule. In this light, presence of Hsp90 on the cell wall indicates that it chaperones important clients which are involved in the above processes, hence, compromising Hsp90 function compromises cell wall organisation which in turn affects capsule assembly. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 may titrate it away from the client which gets degraded and hence we see a decrease in capsule formation. Signalling pathways mediated by kinases like Hog1, PKC and protein kinase A have been shown to be involved in capsule regulation in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>. These kinases are well established clients of Hsp90 in other organisms such as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. We speculate that under capsule inducing conditions, Hsp90 chaperones the dephosphorylated form of Hog1 and keeps it poised for signal transduction to regulate capsule size. In yeast, a dedicated cochaperone called Cdc37 which presents kinase clients to Hsp90 was found to be upregulated at the transcript level in capsular mutants under capsule inducing conditions. It would be interesting to experimentally validate the interaction of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with these kinases in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>. Transcript data analysis (available in FungiDB) also revealed upregulation of another co-chaperone Aha1. Nonetheless, different line of evidences such as cell surface localisation of Hsp90, upregulation of Hsp90 and cochaperones under different capsule inducing conditions, reduction in capsule volume upon Hsp90 inhibition and transcript data analysis suggests a crucial role of Hsp90 machinery in governing critical aspects of cell wall and capsule regulation in the pathogen.</p>
<p>Echinocandins are the only class of antifungals whose target is located on the fungal cell wall and coincidentally we found Hsp90 to be also localised on the cell wall. Echinocandins are the most recent class of antifungals with a broad inhibitory spectrum against most pathogenic fungi such as <italic>Candida</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref044">44</xref>]. However, it seems that <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is intrinsically resistant to Echinocandins. Surprisingly, studies have pointed out that the target of the drug, (1,3) beta-glucan synthase is essential for the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref045">45</xref>] and also the enzyme is inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> by echinocandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref046">46</xref>]. Mutations in the target genes FKS1 and FKS2 are also not responsible for the resistant phenotype. Our work reveals Hsp90 inhibitor RAD and anidulafungin are effective in combination against <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> thereby extending the current antifungal armoury. Interestingly this effect is also seen at 37°C and not at 25°C, thus again reconfirming the fact that virulence and thermotolerance are linked in this fungus. This implies that either Hsp90 directly regulates cell wall stress response exerted by echinocandins such that impairing Hsp90 function abrogates intrinsic resistance to echinocandins or Hsp90 is essential for cell wall integrity and inhibition of Hsp90 makes anidulafungin more accessible to its target.</p>
<p>We postulate Hsp90 commands the thermotolerant ability by chaperoning crucial clients directly involved in the process. For example, calcineurin, a bona fide client of Hsp90, has been implicated in growth at high temperature as well as virulence of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref049">49</xref>]. As such, compromising Hsp90 function may cause destabilization of proteins involved in growth at high temperature, which in turn leads to derailment of the pathways enabling thermotolerance. Kinases like Hog1, Mkc1 and Cek1, which are crucial for cell wall integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref050">50</xref>], are also well- established clients of Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005836.ref051">51</xref>]. Taken together, our study establishes a critical role of Hsp90 in mediating three essential virulence determinants in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> i.e. thermotolerance, capsule formation and echinocandin resistance. Compromising Hsp90 function may lead to rewiring of fundamental pathways implicated in virulence and hence our study corroborates with numerous other studies highlighting the potential of targeting Hsp90 in fungal pathogens. Understanding the basis of thermotolerance and virulence will thus not only highlight acquisition of pathogenicity determinants, but may also open new therapeutic avenues to cripple a lethal infection.</p>
