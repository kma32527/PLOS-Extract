<abstract>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis is an insidious neglected disease with worldwide distribution. It is caused by parasites from the <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> complex, which are able to be transmitted by different species of phlebotomine sand flies and to infect numerous mammal hosts. Despite the high number of people infected or at risk, and the remarkable quantity of studies focusing on this disease, a proper experimental model to efficiently decipher the infectious process of visceral leishmaniasis taking into account the nuances of parasite’s virulence and the duration of the infection is still lacking. Therefore, using golden Syrian hamsters and BALB/c mice, state-of-the-art genetic manipulation applied on a fully virulent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> strain and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging approaches, we describe herein three benefits for experimental visceral leishmaniasis: (i) the development of a double transfected bioluminescent (firefly luciferase) and fluorescent (E2-crimson) virulent strain of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> (Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson), favoring a wide range of both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations, (ii) the establishment of a non-invasive mouse model to evaluate the infectious process during visceral leishmaniasis and the parasite’s virulence in real time, allowing longitudinal studies with the same animals, and (iii) the elaboration of a suitable method to reinstate (and verify anew) the virulence in a population of attenuated parasites, by recovering persistent parasites from chronic infected mice. Consequently, these results open up new perspectives on the study of visceral leishmaniasis, especially in the fields of therapeutics and vaccinology, since the model described herein renders now possible long-lasting follow up studies, with easy and accurate day-by-day verifications of the infection status along with a reduced number of laboratory animals.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic disease caused by the life-threatening parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. This chronicity character is a major concern in experimental models of visceral leishmaniasis, since infected animals do not develop any visible sign or symptom before one/two months after infection. Consequently, there is an urge to develop a model that allow the early identification of the parasite in the host’s tissues and an easy follow up of the infection. Therefore, we generated genetically-modified virulent parasites that are concomitantly fluorescent and bioluminescent, and using highly performant imaging approaches, we could detect these parasites in tissues of infected hamsters and mice within a week post-infection. With these parasites, we established, then, a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis that allows prolonged longitudinal studies and enables the investigation of parasite’s survival, using non-invasive <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques. These features are of extreme importance, particularly for the development of new therapies and vaccines and open up new perspectives on the study of this disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic> are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, a neglected disease with worldwide distribution. With 350 million people at risk and 300 000 estimated cases, the visceral form of leishmaniasis (VL) can be fatal if not treated. The symptoms could vary from fever, weight loss and anorexia to cachexia, hepato/splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, renal injuries, hemorrhages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The perpetuation of these parasite populations relies on the subversion of their two hosts: blood-feeding insects and mammals. The establishment of parasites in tissues, including blood, liver, bone marrow, spleen, skin, depends on their capacity to weaken their hosts by parasite-specific and non-specific mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref003">3</xref>]. The thorough study of the events occurring in the mammalian hosts that are relevant for infectivity and persistence may contribute to a better understanding of parasite dissemination mechanisms and pathogenesis, leading to novel therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Few <italic>in vivo</italic> models have been proposed to study VL, with dogs and hamsters being the most reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref006">6</xref>], since the experimentally infected animals exhibit similar clinicopathological aspects as VL in humans. However, restrictions regarding the number of animals, the prolonged time of infection needed to observe clinical signs and to obtain high parasite loads, the high costs, besides ethical issues, make necessary the search for other suitable alternatives. Regarding the experimental models of VL in mice, the studies depict a premature control of the parasite load in the liver and a delayed parasite burden in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref009">9</xref>], rendering difficult a global long-term evaluation of parasite persistence. All these data indicate a critical need to set up an efficient and functional experimental animal model for VL using virulent parasites. Such model should allow the real-time evaluation of the parasite load and the infectious process in living animals, which must be sensitive enough to assess their pathogenesis and persistence in mammals.</p>
<p>We and others have previously demonstrated that the use of imaging is exceptionally helpful for visualizing the dynamic processes that take place in tissues and examining host’s cell-parasite interaction events. So far, different species of bioluminescent or red-fluorescent <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites have been constructed and used for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref019">19</xref>]. Recently, imaging VL in real time with the golden hamster model has been proposed using bioluminescent and virulent <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref021">21</xref>], however, few imaging studies have been proposed to analyze the dynamic of the VL infectious process and parasite virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, to overcome the limits of the mouse models of VL, with low number of parasites and low persistence, we used a bioluminescent and fluorescent virulent strain of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic>, that would easily allow their follow up both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and which should be able to induce a persistent infection in BALB/c mice. We took advantage of highly performant imaging approaches to follow the parasite load in the liver and in the spleen of infected mice together with the evaluation of cytokine gene expression in these organs. The ability of attenuated bioluminescent/fluorescent <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic>, generated after serial long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing, for implantation and persistence in the target organs and whether the persistent parasites are still able to promote infection was also assessed. Our study provides a basis for determining the parasite implantation and dissemination during the disease progression <italic>in vivo</italic> in a very useful functional model, allowing to assess the role of candidate targets in parasites viability and virulence in order to evaluate their potential putative druggability.</p>

<p>A fully virulent <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> strain (Ld1S/MHOM/SD/00-strain 1S) obtained from infected hamster spleen was used in this study. The culture medium used was the M199 supplemented with 25 mM of HEPES pH6.9; 2mM of glutamine; 0.1 of mM adenosine; 100 μg/mL of penicillin/streptomycin; 10 μg/mL of folic acid; 5 μg/mL of hemin; 1 μg/mL of biopterin; 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (29-101-54, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA); 7.5% of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 1x RPMI 1640 vitamin mix.</p>

<title>Amastigote collection</title>
<p>Infected hamsters and mice were euthanized, the spleens were collected in gentleMACS M Tubes (130-096-335, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) containing 5 mL of supplemented M199 medium and homogenized using the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). After centrifugation (800 rpm for 5 min at 20°C), 25 mg of saponin (S2149, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) was added to the supernatant, re-centrifuged (3500 rpm for 10 min at 20°C), and washed with M199 medium. The solution was passed several times through a 27G needle connected to a syringe to improve amastigotes release. The number of amastigotes was determined and they were kept at 26°C in supplemented M199 medium (starting from 1x10<sup>5</sup> amastigotes/mL) to promote differentiation into promastigotes and expansion.</p>

<p>Short-term cultures of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> promastigotes were obtained from splenic amastigotes.

Parasites were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 20°C, and less dense parasites, morphologically similar to metacyclic forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref023">23</xref>] were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Mice were infected with a standardized dose of 5x10<sup>7</sup> enriched ‘metacyclic’ promastigotes in 150 μL of PBS by intraperitoneal route, and hamsters were infected with a standardized dose of 1x10<sup>8</sup> enriched ‘metacyclic’ promastigotes in 200 μL of PBS by intracardiac route.</p>

A total amount of 5x10<sup>7</sup> log-phase wild-type promastigotes was mixed with 100 ng of the linearized plasmid and to 99 μL of transfection mix (human T-cell nucleofector, VPA-1002, Lonza, Basel Switzerland). The mix was added to the AMAXA Nucleofector 2b Device (Lonza) and the transfection was performed using the pre-defined X-014 program according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The solution was then plated on a M199 solid medium supplemented with 150 μg/mL of hygromycin and cultivated at 26°C up to 14 days. Once the colonies were identified, they were collected into flasks containing M199 medium and kept at 26°C to promote promastigote expansion until infectious metacyclic promastigotes from stationary phase cultures. One hamster was infected with 1x10<sup>8</sup> parasites and we followed the infection using <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging. The weight gain of the hamster was followed up weekly. Three months after infection, the splenic amastigotes (Ld1S_luci) were collected and transformed in promastigotes for a novel transfection.</p>
<p>The second transfection was performed as described above, but using the <italic>Leishmania</italic> expression vector pF4X1.SAT (Jenabioscience) containing the E2-crimson coding region, and 50 μg/mL of nourseothricin as selection drug. After transfections, the luciferase and E2-crimson genes were integrated into 18 s rRNA locus of the nuclear DNA of the parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref011">11</xref>]. One hamster was infected with the transfected parasites, splenic amastigotes were then collected, transformed in promastigotes and expanded as the first passage (P1) of the parasite “Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson”.</p>

<p>To quantify the parasite load in each organ, serial 10-fold dilutions of parasites (from 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup>) were added either to livers or spleens recovered from naïve mice, in order to mimicry possible errors and interferences during parasites RNA extraction from the infected organs. Total RNAs were then extracted and processed for RT-qPCR as described above. A linear regression for each standard curve was determined (quantification of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites against the relative expression of <italic>ssrRNA</italic> values). To visualize the parasites in the tissues, liver and spleen were collected and embedded in paraffin.

<title>Double transfection do not change Ld1S parasites performance</title>
<p>The double transfection approach generated bioluminescent and fluorescent Ld1S parasites as virulent as Ld1S wild-type ones. Indeed, the virulence of the transfected parasites was verified at each stage of the process. Hamsters infected with Ld1S_luci presented the same characteristics than hamsters infected with Ld1S wild-type parasites, such as a regular weight gain until 30 days post-infection, with a subsequent progressive weight loss. By measuring the bioluminescent signals in the liver and the spleen of the infected hamster, we noticed a gradual increase of the parasite load in both organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>With the second transfection, we inserted the E2-crimson gene aiming to generate fluorescent parasites. Even though bioluminescence is more adapted to <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, due to its high sensitivity and low background signals, fluorescence is helpful during <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref028">28</xref>]. Since the fluorescent protein is constitutively expressed by the parasites, we could see positive results as soon as the colonies of parasites were identified in the solid medium during the cloning stage after the transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The kinetics of bioluminescence of infected hamsters with Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson remained identical to those infected with Ld1S_luci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005924.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), corroborating the maintenance of the parasites’ infectivity. At day 90 p.i., the time point of amastigotes collection, successive <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging of the liver and spleen showed concomitant positive bioluminescent and fluorescent signals in these organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson amastigotes were visualized in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and they were collected, purified and differentiated into promastigotes during the first passage in culture, and called P1.</p>
<p>The behavior of the P1 Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson promastigotes was similar to the wild-type promastigotes, with a doubling time of 22 hours and a stationary phase concentration of approximately 1x10<sup>8</sup> parasites/mL at day 7. The bioluminescence and fluorescence features of the parasites evidenced stage-specific changes throughout the period in culture (nine days). Bioluminescence values rose sharply during the exponential phase of the growth curve, with a peak at day 4, and then they decreased sharply as well, with ‘metacyclic’ promastigotes (day 9) presenting the smallest values. On the other hand, variations in fluorescence intensity were less pronounced, with a slight peak at day 3, and constant values after day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>In both liver and spleen, the first bioluminescent signals were detected as soon as 7 days p.i., then rose slightly to reach a peak at day 30 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). After this, the bioluminescence signal declined slightly up to 90 days pi. To determine the absolute number of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in the whole organs, parasite transcripts were quantified by RT-qPCR. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> transcript abundance and bioluminescence kinetics recorded from the liver and the spleen had a similar profile, indicating a good correspondence between RT-qPCR and bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>These versatile parasites were sensitive enough to be detected as soon as 7 days p.i. also by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g002">Fig 2D–2G</xref>). In infected mice livers, a median value of 0.96% of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells containing E2-crimson fluorescence (parasitized cells) was observed, significantly higher (P&gt;0.0001) than the uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).

<p>Finally, in order to attest Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson virulence, we evaluate the immune response in infected mice by determining the gene expression of selected pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the liver and in the spleen, compared to uninfected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). IFN-γ was up-regulated in both organs, throughout the study, from 7 to 90 days p.i. The response in the liver seemed to be more intense than in the spleen, with up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-2 and TNF-α, along with high levels of IL-10. The spleen, on the other hand, presented a delayed and discreet overexpression of IL-1β and TNF-α. The weight of both organs considerably increased during the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), and at histology at 90 days p.i., the liver presented typical granulomas and parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) whereas the spleen presented remarkable alterations in its architecture, with important amounts of mononuclear cells infiltration and parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

Regarding their growth, whereas P1 and P5 presented a rather stable doubling time of around 22 hours, the speed of growth increased sharply over the passages, with a doubling time as low as 9.8 hours for P41 promastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Along with the speed of parasite growth measured on 1x10<sup>5</sup> log-phase promastigotes, both bioluminescence and fluorescence values remarkably increased over the passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Additionally, the expression of luciferase and E2-crimson by the parasites was permanent throughout the successive <italic>in vitro</italic> passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>To address the persistence of the parasite in the infected organs, we measured the bioluminescence signals in the liver and in the spleen at days 30 and 90 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005924.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). At day 30, the liver of mice infected with P21 and P41 presented lower bioluminescence values compared to P1 (P&lt;0.0001). In the spleen, mice infected with P11, P21 and P41 presented lower bioluminescence values compared to P1 (P&lt;0.0001). At day 90, all mice infected with P11, P21 and P41 presented a reduction in the bioluminescence in both liver (P = 0.0002) and spleen (P = 0.0005), with values close to the background signals. P5, even if not statistically different from P1, presented lower and quite heterogeneous values, especially in the spleen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>New virulent <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> Ld1S parasites expressing two reporter genes have been generated and validated to be used <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging analysis. These parasites permanently express bioluminescence (firefly luciferase) and fluorescence (E2-crimson) genes, herein named Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson, and they are as virulent as wild-type parasites, as demonstrated in hamsters.</p>
<p>These novel parasites were key to the establishment of an innovative non-invasive experimental model of VL, which allows the real-time evaluation of the infectious process and the parasite virulence in living animals, aiming the development of longitudinal studies using the same animals. Indeed, the monitoring of the parasite load in hamsters, considered the most accepted animal model for VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref006">6</xref>], when infected with Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson, can be easily performed by bioluminescence, with the animals exhibiting a gradual but simultaneous increasing in the liver and in the spleen, accompanied by the occurrence of clinical signs such as apathy, weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly. The success of the infection can be verified in real time as soon as 15 days p.i., long before the onset of clinical signs, in a more efficient and less time-consuming manner. By contrast, when employing wild-type parasites, the effectiveness of the infection in living animals is only visible after approximately two months of infection, when the hamsters start to lose weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> do not get sick, nevertheless the proposed BALB/c mouse method proved to be a reliable model to the study of VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref033">33</xref>]. The strength of this experimental model was to present an early and intense parasite implantation in the liver and in the spleen, as soon as three days post-infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref034">34</xref>], followed by a longstanding parasite persistence up to at least three months post-infection. All these <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence data, validated by RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref025">25</xref>], show that this infectious process is clearly different from other previous models using mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref035">35</xref>], where liver and spleen usually present distinct infection kinetics and a relative short duration of the infection, with a control of parasite load in the liver between 1 and 2 months p.i. and a delayed and low parasite burden in the spleen.</p>
<p>Moreover, mice actually do respond to the infection against Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson, with liver and spleen presenting a typical inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref033">33</xref>], with mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine production, as previously described in experimentally-infected hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref033">33</xref>], and in a similar way as the natural infection in humans and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref039">39</xref>]. Altogether, these features render our model exceptional, making possible global studies on parasite virulence and the quick analysis of the early infectious process.</p>
<p>By using Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson we are providing a new method to determine the degrees of parasite virulence. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref040">40</xref>], long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing affects the virulence of <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp, which imposes permanent passages in animals to maintain virulent strains in the lab. Taking advantage of this characteristic, we intentionally produced attenuated <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> promastigotes by successive <italic>in vitro</italic> passages. A previous study conducted by one of us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref029">29</xref>] ((Barja et al; in press) clearly established that virulence attenuation of parasites correlated with passage number; only promastigotes of <italic>in vitro</italic> passage 5 (P5) maintained virulence in hamster similar to host-derived amastigotes. Herein, we demonstrate the loss of virulence both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, by analyzing the ability of promastigotes to differentiate into amastigotes, to survive and to persist in the host’s tissues in mice determined at days 7, 30 and 90 p.i., respectively. Firstly, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures clearly indicated that differences in their metabolism were observed over time, along with the increasing of the <italic>in vitro</italic> passage number, which included faster doubling time, in accordance with previous studies (Barja et al.; in press) and higher intensity of bioluminescence and fluorescence for the same number of parasites. Secondly, as previously shown in a hamster model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref029">29</xref>], parasite implantation in the liver and spleen of mice was dependent on the number of <italic>in vitro</italic> passages. Actually, only P1 and P5 Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson promastigotes caused high implantation and long persistent infections in mice. P11 and P21 promastigotes showed a significant decrease of parasitic load in both spleen and liver at day 30 p.i., suggesting a reduction in the parasite’s capacity to persist in the organs. Interestingly, attenuated parasites (P41) were still able to implant at day 7 p.i. in host tissues, although at low intensity. Altogether, our data seem to indicate that promastigote virulence attenuation, which correlates with passage number is not due just to a deficit in implantation and differentiation into amastigotes, but also to a decrease of their capacity to persist in tissues (replication defect in amastigotes and/or control by the host immune response).</p>
<p>One hallmark of this study is the development of a suitable method to reinstate the virulence in a population of attenuated parasites. Despite the virulence deficit after long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing, small numbers of parasites are still found in the organs of mice infected with these attenuated parasites. Therefore, amastigotes do not totally lose their virulence, since these parasites (herein named mP21) were still able to infect new animals and to persist in their tissues. The control of the parasite load in mice is then probably due to the progressive decrease in the number of fully virulent parasites after several passages in culture (at the promastigote level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref041">41</xref>], supporting the hypothesis that long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures could contain a “mixture” of virulent and attenuated parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref040">40</xref>], i.e., a population with an unchanged number of individuals, but with an overall reduced capacity to infect and/or persist in the tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, we described herein the generation of innovative virulent <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> parasites that are concomitantly bioluminescent and fluorescent (Ld1S_luci_E2-crimson). These parasites are versatile enough to be used in a broad range of <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic> techniques, allowing the immediate visualization of parasites or parasitized cells, such as in flow cytometry, fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), bioluminescence assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005924.ref044">44</xref>]. Further, the benefits of using mice as a model of VL also include lower costs, easier handling, greater availability of reagents (such as PCR primers and antibodies). Finally, the proposed model using these novel parasites and BALB/c mice allows the non-invasive longitudinal evaluation of the infectious process in real time, as well as the parasite’s virulence and the host’s immune response. Accordingly, the results reported herein open up new perspectives on the study of new therapies and vaccines, since precise and long-lasting follow up studies are then possible, employing day-by-day verifications in a more ethical manner, without the need of frequent and numerous sample collections or euthanasia.</p>
