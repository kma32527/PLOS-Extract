<abstract>
<p>In the mosquito, the midgut epithelium is the initial tissue to become infected with an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that has been acquired from a vertebrate host along with a viremic bloodmeal. Following its replication in midgut epithelial cells, the virus needs to exit the midgut and infect secondary tissues including the salivary glands before it can be transmitted to another vertebrate host. The viral exit mechanism from the midgut, the midgut escape barrier (MEB), is poorly understood although it is an important determinant of mosquito vector competence for arboviruses. Using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a model in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, we demonstrate that the basal lamina (BL) of the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the midgut constitutes a potential barrier for the virus. The BL, predominantly consisting of collagen IV and laminin, becomes permissive during bloodmeal digestion in the midgut lumen. Bloodmeal digestion, BL permissiveness, and CHIKV dissemination are coincident with increased collagenase activity, diminished collagen IV abundance, and BL shredding in the midgut between 24â€“32 h post-bloodmeal. This indicates that there may be a window-of-opportunity during which the MEB in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> becomes permissive for CHIKV. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the principal extracellular endopeptidases responsible for the degradation/remodeling of the ECM including the BL. We focused on <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (Ae)MMP1, which is expressed in midgut epithelial cells, is inducible upon bloodfeeding, and shows collagenase (gelatinase) activity. However, attempts to inhibit AeMMP activity in general or specifically that of AeMMP1 did not seem to affect its function nor produce an altered midgut escape phenotype. As an alternative, we silenced and overexpressed the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> <underline>t</underline>issue <underline>i</underline>nhibitor of <underline>m</underline>etallo<underline>p</underline>roteinases (AeTIMP) in the mosquito midgut. AeTIMP was highly upregulated in the midgut during bloodmeal digestion and was able to inhibit MMP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Bloodmeal-inducible, midgut-specific overexpression of AeTIMP or its expression via a recombinant CHIKV significantly increased midgut dissemination rates of the virus. Possibly, AeTIMP overexpression affected BL degradation and/or restoration thereby increasing the midgut dissemination efficiency of the virus.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The biological nature of the midgut escape barrier in insects for arthropod-borne viruses has been a mystery for decades. Here we show that the basal lamina (BL) surrounding the mosquito midgut acts as a barrier for chikungunya virus, an alphavirus, which has emerged in the New World hemisphere around three years ago. The barrier became permissive for the virus during digestion of a viremic bloodmeal inside the midgut lumen. Concurrent with BL permissiveness, we observed that collagen IV, a major component of the BL became temporally degraded while the BL was visibly damaged. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinases such as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (Ae)MMP1 may be involved in BL degradation. We confirmed that recombinant AeMMP1 exhibited strong gelatinase activity, which was profoundly reduced when recombinant AeMMP1 interacted <italic>in vitro</italic> with the recombinant <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (AeTIMP). When transgenically overexpressing AeTIMP in an attempt to temporally inhibit general MMP activity in the mosquito midgut, we observed that the dissemination efficiency of chikungunya virus became significantly increased, while its midgut infection was not affected. It is possible that AeTIMP overexpression affected BL degradation/restoration permitting increased quantities of virus to escape from the midgut.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the primary vector for important human pathogenic arboviruses such as dengue virus (<italic>Flaviviridae</italic>; <italic>Flavivirus</italic>; DENV1-4), chikungunya virus (<italic>Togaviridae</italic>; <italic>Alphavirus</italic>; CHIKV), and Zika virus (<italic>Flaviviridae</italic>; <italic>Flavivirus</italic>; ZIKV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref002">2</xref>]. Following acquisition of a viremic bloodmeal from a human, viruses such as CHIKV enter the midgut lumen of the female mosquito along with the bloodmeal (reviewed in: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref003">3</xref>]). In contrast, a sugarmeal is deposited into the crop and therefore does not enter the midgut. Within a few hours, before formation of the peritrophic matrix and at the onset of bloodmeal digestion, virus needs to enter and infect the midgut epithelial cells where it starts replicating. In the epithelium, <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized virions accumulate at the basal lamina (BL) surrounding the midgut to disseminate to secondary tissues such as hemocytes, fat body, nerve tissue, and eventually the salivary glands. The latter need to be infected before virus can be released along with saliva during probing to infect another host. The pore size exclusion limit of the BL (9â€“12 nm) is too small for arbovirus virions (50â€“80 nm in diameter) to pass through [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref004">4</xref>]. Thus, it has been postulated that the midgut BL structure needs to be temporally modified to enable virions to disseminate from the midgut. Based on current knowledge, viruses cannot actively penetrate the midgut BL in order to disseminate, which suggests that traversing the BL by a virus requires the activation of an endogenous mechanism of the host/vector that causes BL modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref006">6</xref>]. Acquisition of a bloodmeal is a natural process in mosquitoes causing the midgut tissue along with its BL to expand multi-fold of its typical size in a sugarfed mosquito. We observed that in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, viruses such as CHIKV disseminate from the midgut during the time window during which bloodmeal digestion takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref007">7</xref>]. In insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the BL is a sheet-like network of extracellular matrix (ECM) components predominantly composed of (non-fibril) collagen IV and laminin and synthesized during early development by hemocytes and the fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref008">8</xref>]. In mammals, the formation of the BL is initiated by a self-assembling laminin network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref009">9</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref011">11</xref>]. A second network is then formed by collagen IV to provide mechanical strength. Finally, the laminin and collagen IV networks are linked together by nidogen and perlecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref013">13</xref>]. Experimental evidence suggests that collagen IV is fundamental for the maintenance of integrity and function of basement membranes under conditions of increasing mechanical demands, but dispensable for deposition and initial assembly of components for which laminin seems to be sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref014">14</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, BL associated collagen IV is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of two conserved subunits, Î±1-like and Î±2-like encoded by the genes <italic>Cg25C</italic> and <italic>Vkg</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref015">15</xref>]. Human collagen IV is composed of three (heterotrimeric) Î±1-like and Î±2-like subunits, which are encoded by six different genes, <italic>alpha 1</italic>-<italic>alpha 6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref016">16</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known as the principal metalloproteases that cleave components of the ECM during tissue remodeling/wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref018">18</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref020">20</xref>]. In humans, the BL components collagen IV and laminin are degraded by gelatinases such as HuMMP2 and HuMMP9, and by stromelysins such as HuMMP3 and HuMMP10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref020">20</xref>]. Mammalian MMPs can also produce specific substrate-cleavage fragments with independent biological activities, for example the release of ECM-bound growth factors (insulin growth factor, fibroblast growth factor). Further, MMPs can act as important regulators of extracellular tissue signaling networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref022">22</xref>]. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> possesses two MMPs, Dm1-MMP and Dm2-MMP, which are both involved in tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref023">23</xref>]. Typically, Dm1-MMP mediates BL degradation; however, when under the control of the JNK signaling pathway during wound healing, Dm1-MMP is required for assembly and repair of the BL, which likely is achieved by cleaving existing BL fragments in order to insert new molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref024">24</xref>]. MMPs are typically present in the extracellular matrix as zymogens with a typical domain structure consisting of N-terminal propeptide, (central) catalytic, and C-terminal hemopexin domains. MMP activity is tightly regulated at several levels: gene expression, protein activation via cleavage of the ~10â€“13 kDa N-terminal propeptide domain, inhibition via binding to a <underline>t</underline>issue <underline>i</underline>nhibitor of <underline>m</underline>etallo<underline>p</underline>roteinases (TIMP), and finally protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref026">26</xref>]. Recently, we described the MMPs in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> as a family of proteases that could be potentially involved in BL modification/remodeling during virus dissemination from the midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>]. In particular, two of the nine AeMMPs, AeMMP1 and AeMMP2, were found to be associated with midgut tissue and they also responded to the presence of a bloodmeal containing or not containing CHIKV. AeMMP1 contains the propeptide, catalytic, and hemopexin domains and appears to be membrane-bound. AeMMP2 lacks a canonical propeptide domain but contains catalytic and hemopexin domain structures.</p>
<p>Originally, the four mammalian TIMPs (TIMP1-4) have been described as specific inhibitors of MMPs, but subsequent studies showed that human TIMP3 (HuTIMP3) can also bind to the disintegrin-metalloproteinases (ADAM) and ADAMTS (ADAM with thrombospondin motifs) to block their activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref028">28</xref>]. TIMP-mediated inhibition of an MMP occurs via binding of the N-terminal structure of TIMP to the catalytic cofactor of the target MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref030">30</xref>]. In mammals, TIMPs also have biological activities that are independent of metalloproteinase interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref031">31</xref>]. These include effects on cell growth and differentiation, cell migration, antiangiogenesis, anti- and pro-apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity. HuTIMPs can interact directly with specific cell surface receptors to induce cellular responses. HuTIMP1, for example, can activate the MAPK pathway via receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref032">32</xref>]. Based on comparative genomic analyses, it has been assumed that insect genomes generally encode only a single TIMP, which is most similar to HuTIMP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref033">33</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref035">35</xref>]. Studies with <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> (Dm)TIMP showed that it can inhibit the two endogenous DmMMPs, particularly Dm1-MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref035">35</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, DmTIMP was also able to inhibit the activities of HuMMP1-3, human ADAM17, and to a lesser extent human ADAM10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we show that in sugarfed mosquitoes, the non-expanded midgut BL constitutes a barrier for CHIKV. The BL became permissive for the virus during bloodmeal ingestion causing expansion of the midgut tissue. Tissue expansion in bloodmeal-containing midguts coincided with temporal collagen IV degradation/dimishment and significantly increased collagenase activities. Transgene or virus-mediated overexpression of AeTIMP, which had the capacity to inhibit AeMMP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulted in an increased viral midgut dissemination phenotype.</p>

<title>In sugarfed mosquitoes, the midgut BL is not permissive for CHIKV although in bloodfed mosquitoes, the BL becomes permissive for the virus</title>
<p>CHIKV (strain: 37997; 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml) was intrathoracically injected into bloodfed and sugarfed HWE females. Immunofluorescence assays using a CHIKV-specific monoclonal antibody showed that following intrathoracic injection, the virus did not enter and infect the midgut epithelium of those females that had received a sugarmeal instead of a bloodmeal the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, G1). Instead, the virus predominantly infected the tracheal cells surrounding the midgut tissue. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrated that in sugarfed mosquitoes, intrathoracically injected CHIKV was tethered to the BL at 4 days post-injection; however, virions were not observed within the epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, G1). In contrast, intrathoracically injected CHIKV infected midgut epithelial cells and replicated within the cells in those females that had received a virus-free bloodmeal the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>, G2). Ultrastructural analysis of several midgut samples showed virus in the basal labyrinth of the midgut epithelium in close proximity to the ER at 1 day post-(virus-free) bloodmeal (pbm) (see red arrows), indicative of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, G2). Acting as a positive control, orally acquired CHIKV (via artificial bloodmeal) readily infected midgut epithelial cells and was detectable in those at 4 days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>, G3). Accordingly, median CHIKV titers were significantly higher in midguts of those mosquitoes that had acquired the virus orally (G3) or via injection followed by acquisition of a bloodmeal (G2) than in midguts of sugarfed mosquitoes, which had received the virus via injection (G1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the midgut surface structure revealed that in midguts of bloodfed females at 24 h pbm, the BL appeared to be thinly stretched with outer BL layer(s) in close proximity to the latitudinal and longitudinal muscles being shredded and substantially degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In contrast, the midgut surface of sugarfed mosquitoes looked relaxed and 'wrinkled', with no BL damage being visible.</p>

<p>All these observations allow the conclusion that the BL is a barrier for CHIKV infection and that the presence of a bloodmeal in the midgut causes the BL to become permissive for virus to infect secondary tissues. As injected virus could not efficiently enter the midgut epithelium of sugarfed mosquitoes, virus infection became restricted to the tracheal cells surrounding the midgut.</p>

<title>BL-associated collagen IV is diminished during bloodmeal digestion</title>
<p>We investigated whether the change in midgut BL permissiveness during bloodmeal acquisition/digestion was reflected by a change in the abundance of collagen IV, which is a core com<italic>p</italic>onent of the BL. Midgut collagen IVÎ± (~160â€“180 kDa) was clearly less abundant in midguts of females at 12â€“36 h pbm as shown by Western blots using polyclonal antibodies generated against human collagen IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). At 48 h pbm and later time points, collagen IV abundance recovered to levels observed in midguts of sugarfed mosquitoes. Incubation of human placenta collagen I with lysates prepared from midguts at different time points post-bloodmeal showed a similar time window during which collagen I was diminished, indicating that the midgut lysates possessed collagenase activity between 12 and 36 h pbm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Accordingly, similarly prepared midgut lysates showed significantly increased collagenase IV activity <italic>in vitro</italic> between 12 and 36 h pbm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The observed period of collagenase activity in the mosquito midgut concurred with the period of bloodmeal digestion during which CHIKV dissemination took place (see also: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref007">7</xref>]). However, the presence of CHIKV had no obvious effect on collagen IV degradation at 24 or 48 h post-infection via oral acquisition (pi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Interestingly, diminished detection of midgut collagen IV was also observed at 24 h pbm in those mosquitoes which were not fed to repletion but had ingested only a partial bloodmeal instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).

<title>AeMMP1, possessing collagenase (gelatinase) activity, is highly expressed during bloodmeal digestion and can be inhibited by AeTIMP</title>
<p>Recently, we showed that two of the nine MMPs of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, AeMMP1 and AeMMP2, were active in midgut tissue and responded to the presence of a bloodmeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>]. AeMMP2 was associated with tracheal cells surrounding the midgut, whereas AeMMP1 was highly expressed in epithelial cells, the site at which CHIKV infection occurs. This prompted us to focus our functional studies on AeMMP1. The zymogen (50 kDa) and the active form of AeMMP1 (37 kDa) lacking its propeptide domain were highly expressed between 3 and 24 h pbm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) concurring with the time period during which collagen IV was less detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similar to what we had recently observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>], the catalytically active form of AeMMP1 was barely detectable in midguts between 36 and 72 h pbm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Typically, most of the bloodmeal has been digested by 48 h post-acquisition allowing the midgut tissue to contract and the BL to rebuild. It is possible that diminished AeMMP1 activity or presence during this period benefits subsequent BL rebuilding.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic>, we confirmed the catalytic activity of recombinant (r)AeMMP1 produced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Following expression in S2 cells, rAeMMP1 (lacking the signal peptide) generated two major band signals with molecular masses of ~40 and 25 kDa, which were recognized by pAb (polyclonal antibodies)- Aemmp1-2 (antigenic region in the hemopexin domain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) but not by pAbAemmp1-1 (antigenic region near C-terminus outside the hemopexin domain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s003">S2 Fig</xref>), or by an antibody specific to the recombinant, C-terminal V5 tag. The ~40 kDa band signal likely represented the active form of rAeMMP1 lacking the propeptide domain as treatment with proMMP activator 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (AMPA) had no effect on rAeMMP1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This was further confirmed by gelatin zymography in which the 40 kDa band signal represented the rAeMMP1 protein with catalytic activity, whereas the band signal corresponding to a mass of 25 kDa, possibly representing the cleaved hemopexin domain (minus its C-terminus), showed no catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In generic MMP activity assays using the FS-6 substrate, the S2 cell generated rAeMMP1 showed strong MMP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001, metal chelator EDTA, or recombinant human TIMP3 (HuTIMP3) strongly reduced recombinant rAeMMP1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our experiments indicate that AeMMP1 has collagenase (gelatinase) activity and therefore could be involved in the midgut BL remodeling process. To support this hypothesis, we attempted to modulate the expression of AeMMP1 in the mosquito. Transient silencing of <italic>Aemmp1</italic> reduced its transcript abundance in whole-body mosquitoes by ~70% at 48 h post-injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s004">S3A Fig</xref>) but unexpectedly, AeMMP1 protein levels in midguts and CHIKV infections of carcasses (whole mosquito bodies from which the midguts had been removed) were not affected at 1 day pbm (= 3 days post-injection) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s004">S3B Fig</xref>). Consequently, collagen IV degradation levels at 1 day pbm in midguts and titers of orally acquired CHIKV at 2 dpi in carcasses of <italic>Aemmp1</italic> dsRNA injected females were not different from those of the <italic>Luc</italic> dsRNA injected control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s004">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>). We then decided to inhibit MMP activity in the mosquito via overexpression of the MMP antagonist TIMP as an alternative approach to reveal any effects of MMP impairment on CHIKV dissemination.</p>

The resulting 144 G<sub>0</sub> survivors were outcrossed to HWE mosquitoes in 39 pools, seven of which produced transgenic G<sub>1</sub> offspring based on EGFP eye marker expression originating from the TE. Curiously, four of the seven transgenic lines (P58, P107, P124, P131) were founded by single individuals, which died or were unable to produce any transgenic offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).

<title>Transgenic overexpression of AeTIMP in midguts of mosquitoes increases the midgut dissemination efficiency of CHIKV and enhances infection with DENV4</title>
<p>Following oral challenge of (G<sub>4</sub>) P4 mosquitoes with CHIKV (titer in the bloodmeal: 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/ml), virus titers at 1 and 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and virus infection rates at 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) were significantly increased in the carcasses of P4 females compared to carcasses of the similarly challenged HWE control.

Importantly, midgut infection rates and titers for CHIKV were similar in HWE and P4 mosquitoes over a seven-day time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s007">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>) suggesting that AeTIMP<sub>V5</sub> overexpression did increase CHIKV dissemination from the midgut but not the viral infection/replication efficiency in the midgut.

<p>Our data from repeated experiments show that overexpression of AeTIMP in midgut tissue of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> led to significantly increased CHIKV dissemination rates and also to significantly increased whole-body mosquito infection rates with DENV4. Thus, AeTIMP overexpression in the mosquito midgut promoted the infection of two unrelated arboviruses even though collagenase IV activity in midguts of line P4 was similar to that of the non-transgenic HWE strain during the four-day observation period. Furthermore, we did not observe any difference between HWE and line P4 regarding their level of BL degradation as shown by SEM imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005976.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). BL degradation in close proximity to muscle tissue was clearly visible in midguts of bloodfed HWE or P4 mosquitoes at 24 h pbm but not in the sugarfed control (see also: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005976.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Although virus dissemination was significantly enhanced in P4 mosquitoes, the overall tissue modifications in the transgenic line leading to the increased virus dissemination phenotype may have been rather subtle and not easily distinguishable from those of the HWE control among the limited number of EM specimens that were examined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe novel processes involved in CHIKV dissemination from the midgut of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> in an attempt to shed light on the molecular principles that define the mosquito MEB for arboviruses. We demonstrated that in sugarfed females, the midgut BL was not permissible for CHIK virions which associated with the BL but did not cross it during four days post-intrathoracic injection of the virus. This changed when there was a bloodmeal present in the midgut at 24 h post-intrathoracic CHIKV injection as under this condition, <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of virus was observed 24 h later within the epithelial cells indicating that injected virions had crossed the BL. In parallel, midgut-associated tissue damage was clearly visible in midguts of bloodfed mosquitoes in which the outer layer(s) of the BL in close proximity to the muscles were shredded. This was never observed in the relaxed midgut tissue of sugarfed mosquitoes. It may well be possible that CHIK virions require binding proteins or structures such as cyto-skeleton associated actin to move virions towards the BL within the infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref042">42</xref>]. However, even when assuming that those required proteins were absent in our injected virus preparations, it would still not explain why the virus was impeded at the BL and could not cross it, unless the BL in sugarfed mosquitoes does constitute a barrier for the virus. Similarly, Smith and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref043">43</xref>] reported that in sugarfed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>taeniorhynchus</italic>, intrathoracically injected VEEV infected numerous secondary tissues such as gut-associated muscles, nerve tissue, hemocytes, fat body, salivary glands, and the intussuscepted foregut but not the midgut epithelium. This suggests that our observation might not be restricted to <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and CHIKV but may apply to other mosquito-arbovirus interactions as well.</p>
<p>This study together with our recent work indicates that CHIKV disseminates from the midgut through the BL during bloodmeal digestion but not via tracheal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref007">7</xref>]. This contrasts with earlier investigations suggesting that arboviruses might use the tracheal cell/tracheole route to disseminate from the midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref044">44</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref046">46</xref>]. In our previous experiments, orally acquired CHIKV infected midgut tracheal cells at a time point when the virus was already detectable in tissues outside the midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref007">7</xref>]. In sugarfed mosquitoes, however, intrathoracically injected CHIKV became increasingly concentrated in midgut-associated tracheal cells over time as the virus seemed to be unable to enter the midgut epithelium through the BL.</p>
<p>One reason for the overall phenomenon could be that the BL surrounding the midgut epithelial tissue of mosquitoes acts as a molecular sieve to regulate the passage of molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref047">47</xref>]. Due to its small pore size exclusion limit, the BL constitutes a principal barrier for virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref004">4</xref>]. For virions to pass through the BL, its pore size exclusion limit needs to be enlarged, at least temporarily. Increased BL permissiveness could be achieved via hydrolysis of BL collagen IV (and laminin) due to the activities of specific proteinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref048">48</xref>]. The proteinase activity affecting collagen IV structure and abundance could be triggered by midgut tissue overstretching as a result of meal ingestion, where stretch receptors may act as sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref049">49</xref>]. In another study performed by our group, we showed that CHIKV orally acquired along with a saline meal (consisting of PBS) or a protein meal (consisting of BSA) instead of a bloodmeal productively infected the mosquito midgut and efficiently disseminated from the organ to secondary tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref050">50</xref>]. Thus, bloodmeal-specific ingredients do not seem to be required for the virus to disseminate from the midgut and neither do mosquitoes need to be fed to repletion to trigger midgut BL collagen IV diminishment/degradation (as shown in this study). This supports the hypothesis that sensors associated with the midgut detect the presence of variable meal volumes in the midgut lumen thereby inducing enzymatic degradation rather than purely mechanical tearing of the collagen network. Previous observations (including a parallel study which is not part of this work) also suggest that CHIKV dissemination from the midgut occurred during a relatively narrow "window-of-opportunity", which lasted from ~24 h to 32 h post-oral acquisition of the infectious bloodmeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref007">7</xref>]. Thus, we did not extend the experiment to 7 days post-injection/post-bloodmeal, because we believe that by 7 days post-oral acquisition, the vast majority of CHIK virions has already disseminated from the midgut.</p>
<p>Our studies so far have not revealed whether or not the virus plays an active role in the dissemination process. Nevertheless, the window-of-opportunity for CHIKV dissemination was coincident with diminished BL collagen IV, which in turn correlated with significantly increased collagenase IV activity.</p>
<p>Although we have repeatedly made these concurrent observations an obvious limitation of our study is our inability to prove cause and effect by demonstrating that BL collagen IV degradation was a prerequisite for CHIKV dissemination. We tried to inhibit collagen IV degradation using different chemical inhibitors, but none of them showed any effect. As a consequence, these inhibitors did not dramatically affect CHIKV dissemination. To our knowledge, there are no reports showing successful inhibition of collagenase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> in any insect species. Thus, although we repeatedly observed virus dissemination coincident with BL degradation after bloodmeal ingestion, diminished collagen IV detection, and increased collagenase activities, it cannot be excluded that collagen modification may not be necessary for the viral dissemination from the midgut. Solving this problem will require additional, extensive studies.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, MMPs and ADAMTSs are the most important enzymes responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref051">51</xref>]. Similar to MMP1 of vertebrates, Dm1-MMP1 which is orthologous to AeMMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>], can degrade mammalian fibronectin and type IV collagen and the enzyme's degrading activity can be completely blocked by generic MMP inhibitors such as EDTA and BB-94 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref052">52</xref>]. Importantly, Stevens and Page-McCaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref024">24</xref>] discovered that after tissue injury, secreted Dm1-MMP facilitated restoration of continuous tissue by remodeling the BL, promoting cell elongation and actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. The authors suggested that Dm1-MMP promoted assembly of collagen IV into the BL by cleaving the existing basement membrane in order to insert new molecules, a step that may be also required for temporal matrix expansion such as during bloodmeal ingestion by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Our activity assays showed that rAeMMP1 was able to degrade gelatin and cleave an MMP substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. This substrate cleavage activity could be inhibited by EDTA, the general MMP inhibitor GM6001, or rAeTIMP. Together, these observations are a strong indication that AeMMP1 possesses metalloproteinase activity. It was not possible to block AeMMP1 activity chemically or via gene silencing <italic>in vivo</italic> in order to reveal what effects diminished activity of the proteinase could have on BL degradation and/or CHIKV dissemination. In contrast, transient silencing of the MMP1 homologue in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> caused a profound reduction in protein abundance resulting in an impaired phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref033">33</xref>]. Possibly, the putatively membrane-bound AeMMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>] is a relatively stable protein that is maintained as a zymogen for extended periods of time despite protein production being temporarily cut off at the transcriptional and translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref053">53</xref>]. As a consequence, our observations so far do not allow us to conclude whether AeMMP1 is responsible for collagen IV degradation/diminishment during bloodmeal digestion or for collagen IV remodeling/restoration. Based on our data, both scenarios seem possible. Since AeMMP1 peak activity in midgut tissue concurred with collagen IV degradation/diminishment during bloodmeal digestion, it is possible that AeMMP1 could be involved in BL degradation during midgut tissue expansion as a consequence of bloodmeal ingestion. During the late phase of the bloodmeal digestion process (36â€“48 h pbm), active AeMMP1 is diminished (see also: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>]), which may stop any further collagen IV degradation and instead enable BL restoration. Assuming that AeMMP1 is responsible for BL restoration at the end of the bloodmeal digestion phase (rather than BL degradation at the beginning of bloodmeal ingestion/digestion), this could explain why AeTIMP overexpression leads to an increased dissemination efficiency of CHIKV. Enhanced AeTIMP expression would result in an increased inhibition of MMPs including AeMMP1 thereby preventing efficient BL restoration. Delayed or inefficient BL restoration would then leave the tissue in a 'leaky' state for the virus. However, we were unable to reveal any obvious differences in midgut collagen degradation levels between mosquitoes in which AeTIMP was overexpressed and control mosquitoes. Therefore, any effects on midgut collagen structure may have been rather subtle.</p>
<p>In mammals, TIMPs were reported to inhibit the activities of MMPs and ADAMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref031">31</xref>]. Recombinant DmTIMP showed inhibitory activities against MMP1 and MMP2 from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and MMP1-3, ADAM17, and ADAM10 from humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref036">36</xref>]. Although DmTIMP overexpression did not result in a visible phenotype, DmTIMP knockout resulted in a dysfunctional phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref054">54</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, rAeTIMP inhibited the activities of several HuMMPs and less efficiently that of AeMMP1 (or AeMMP2), whereas purified HuTIMP3 was able to inhibit the activity of rAeMMP1. Thus, rAeTIMP appeared to be functional but may exhibit a weaker affinity for rAeMMP1 than for the HuMMPs. As the number of MMPs can vary from two in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to nine in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref027">27</xref>], the single AeTIMP may have a variable binding affinity for each MMP. However, when comparing these binding affinities, it needs to be kept in mind that these observations were primarily based on <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to see whether there was any level of interaction detectable between the two protein types. Under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, actual affinity levels may look different than those observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. At any rate, similar to a previous study by Page-McCaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref023">23</xref>] we showed that rAeTIMP was able to cross-inhibit MMPs from different animal kingdoms, demonstrating that there is a structural conservation between HuTIMP3 and AeTIMP on the one hand and HuMMPs and AeMMP1 on the other. Thus, it seems likely that AeMMP1 is regulated, at least in part, by AeTIMP though the interaction may be relatively weak by comparison. Considering that vertebrate TIMPs are multifunctional proteins predominantly involved in ECM modification, it cannot be excluded that the effect of AeTIMP causing enhanced virus dissemination may be independent of its interaction with midgut associated AeMMPs. Under this scenario, the AeTIMP overexpression phenotype may have been caused by a direct interaction between AeTIMP and ECM surface molecules affecting permissiveness of the midgut BL. Previously, direct binding of HuTIMPs to ECM receptors has been described, which is independent of any interaction between the inhibitors and metalloproteinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005976.ref055">55</xref>]. However, in insects similar direct interactions between ECM and TIMP have not been reported to date.</p>
<p>In summary, our observations suggest that the MEB for arboviruses in mosquitoes is associated with structural changes of the BL. Bloodmeal ingestion associated with midgut tissue expansion leads to structural changes of the BL as exemplified by a temporary reduction in collagen IV abundance and visible shredding of the BL while arboviruses efficiently disseminate from the midgut. Assuming that collagen IV modification involves enzymatic processes, we show that AeMMP1, which is upregulated during bloodmeal digestion possesses collagenase (gelatinase) activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and can be inhibited by AeTIMP. Overexpression of AeTIMP in the mosquito midgut significantly enhances the midgut dissemination efficiency of CHIKV. Our study brought repeatedly and concurrently observed events into context. However, due to the complexity of the system, we have not yet been able to unambiguously establish a functional interrelationship. This work provides the foundation for further, detailed investigations to delineate the mechanism underlying MEB, which may involve numerous additional proteins with proteolytic and/or signaling functions.</p>

Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test (<italic>p</italic> â‰¤ 0.05). <bold>(B)</bold> CHIKV titers in carcasses of mosquitoes at 2 dpi, which had been injected with <italic>Aetimp</italic> dsRNA, <italic>egfp</italic> dsRNA, or PBS 2 days before virus infection. Each data point represents the CHIKV titer of an individual carcass. <italic>P</italic>-values were determined by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Black bars indicate medians.</p>
