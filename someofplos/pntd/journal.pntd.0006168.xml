<title>Background</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a deadly vector-borne disease. Approximately 90% of Indian VL cases occur in Bihar, where the sand fly, <italic>Phlebotomus argentipes</italic>, is the principal vector. Sand fly control in Bihar consists of indoor residual spraying (IRS), the practice of spraying the inner walls of village dwellings with insecticides. Prior researchers have evaluated success of IRS-control by estimating vector abundance in village houses, but the number of sampling periods (<italic>n</italic> = 2–3) were minimal, and outdoor-resting <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> were neglected. We describe a large-scale field study, performed in 24 villages within two Bihari districts, during which <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> were collected biweekly over 47-weeks, in cattle enclosures, houses, and outdoors in peri-domestic vegetation. The objectives of this study were to provide updated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> ecological field data, and determine if program-initiated IRS-treatment had led to noticeable differences in vector abundance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Principal findings</title>
<p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 126,901) relative abundance was greatest during the summer months (June-August) when minimum temperatures were highest. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> were most frequently collected from cattle enclosures (~46% total; ~56% blood fed). Many sand flies were found to have taken blood from multiple sources, with ~81% having blood fed on humans and ~60% blood feeding on bovines. Nonparametric statistical tests were determined most appropriate for evaluating IRS-treatment. Differences in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance in houses, cattle enclosures and vegetation were detected between IRS-treated and untreated villages in only ~9% of evaluation periods occurring during the peak period of human-vector exposure (June-August) and in ~8% of the total observations. No significant differences were detected between the numbers of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> collected in vegetation close to the experimental villages.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study provide updated data regarding <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> seasonal abundance, spatial distribution, and host preferances, and suggest vector abundance has not significantly declined in IRS-treated villages. We suggest that IRS be supplemented with vector control strategies targeting exophagic, exophilic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic>, and that disease surveillance be accompanied by rigorous vector population monitoring.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a deadly vector-borne parasite (<italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>) transmitted to man by phlebotomine sand flies. Indoor residual spraying (IRS), performed within village dwellings, is the primary means of sand fly control performed in Bihar, India and more explicit methods of evaluating the success of control are warranted. A field-based study was conducted to collect ecological sand fly data for use in evaluating the effectiveness of IRS in reducing relative sand fly abundance. Results indicate that sand flies blood feed primarily on humans and cattle and are most frequently found within cattle enclosures. Results further suggest IRS-treatment has a limited impact on vector density. Our approach incorporates detailed evaluation of sand fly spatial distribution (cattle enclosures, houses, vegetation), seasonal fluctuations in abundance, host blood meal preferences within Bihari villages, and dates of IRS performed within treated villages. Hence, this study provides an explicit means of monitoring vector populations and evaluating control measures in Bihar.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a parasitic disease transmitted by infected female phlebotomine sand flies. VL is fatal if left untreated, and annually there are an estimated 500,000 human VL cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide, making it the second deadliest parasitic disease surpassed only by malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref002">2</xref>]. The Indian subcontinent accounts for approximately 67% of the reported human cases of VL, the majority of which occur in areas of extreme poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref003">3</xref>]. Approximately 90% of cases in India occur in Bihar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref004">4</xref>]. The known vector of VL in the Indian subcontinent is the sand fly species <italic>Phlebotomus argentipes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref006">6</xref>] which transmits the pathogen (<italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>) anthroponotically with no known animal reservoir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref007">7</xref>]. In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) helped the governments of Bangladesh, India, and Nepal to launch a regional elimination initiative to reduce VL cases in the Indian subcontinent to less than one case per 10,000 people in endemic districts by 2015, two of the main strategies being: integrated vector management and effective disease and vector surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref008">8</xref>]. Although attempts have been made to control phlebotomine sand fly populations, organization and implementation of effective vector control programs have been hindered largely because of uncertainties surrounding phlebotomine sand fly ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Vector ecology</title>
<p>On the Indian subcontinent, researchers have made attempts to answer questions regarding aspects of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> field ecology, including: seasonality, spatial distribution, and host preference. Researchers have suggested that the abundance of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> is associated with ecological parameters such as temperature and precipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref010">10</xref>]. Results of a more recent 12-month study conducted in three Bihari villages in the Saran district, during which 52,653 sand flies were trapped using light traps, suggest <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> numbers are typically highest during the months when evening temperatures are warmest and precipitation is increased (June, July, August) and lowest during the coolest months (January, February, December) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>]. These results further suggested spatial distribution of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> was not limited to the inside of village dwellings, but also included outlying village vegetation. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> females are regarded as anautogenous, needing a blood meal to produce each batch of eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref012">12</xref>], and results of several studies suggest they blood feed almost exclusively on bovines (cattle and domestic buffalo) and humans within rural villages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Vector control</title>
<p>Because <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> is believed to be endophilic and endophagic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref018">18</xref>], the vector control approach utilized for decades in Bihar has been indoor residual spraying (IRS), a method of applying insecticide to the inner walls of village houses and cattle dwellings. Explicit data addressing the impact of IRS on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref021">21</xref>] and, therefore, the impact of IRS on field populations is largely unknown.</p>
<p>A cluster randomized trial was conducted by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref022">22</xref>] in which IRS was performed in village dwellings in India (DDT), Nepal (alpha-cypermethrin), and Bangladesh (deltamethrin), during which pre-treatment light trap collections, performed over two consecutive nights in November, were compared with post-treatment light trap collections performed over two consecutive nights in April of the following year. One issue with this study design is the lengthy period (~5-months) between IRS treatment and sample collection, during which multiple factors could influence sand fly abundance. The authors mention other caveats as being small sample sizes within sites, limiting the reliability of site-specific analysis, and the fact that the study was conducted under controlled conditions not easily applicable in a national vector control program.</p>
<p>Given the latter limitation, other researchers have collected <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> from treated and untreated households during program-initiated DDT spraying in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref026">26</xref>]. While the results of these IRS-evaluation studies are interesting and useful, we would argue that they all share two limitations 1) a minimal number of post-IRS <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> collection periods and 2) a universal neglect of outdoor sand fly population sampling. Post-treatment <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> collections during the previously mentioned studies were typically conducted at ~1-month and ~5-6-months post-treatment. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> have been collected in large numbers from peri-domestic vegetation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>], and villagers sleep outdoors during warmer months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref008">8</xref>] when vector abundance and biting rates are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref027">27</xref>].

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>In this paper, we describe a large-scale, 11-month field study, conducted in 24 villages in two VL-endemic districts in Bihar, India, in which sand flies were collected using United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps (Bioquip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA; John W. Hock Company, Gainesville, FL, USA) during 24 collection periods conducted over 47-weeks. The objectives of this study were to 1) provide updated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> ecological data within villages in two Bihari districts; and 2) determine if relative <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance in IRS-treated villages was reduced when compared with untreated villages. By utilizing methods previously described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref017">17</xref>], but using a much larger sample size, field-collected <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> were used to estimate: spatial distribution (cattle enclosures, houses, vegetation), temporal fluctuations in relative abundance, and host preferences of blood fed females. Additionally, we used IRS data for the study villages to compare relative <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance in IRS-treated and untreated villages during the 2016 season. The results of this study will provide 1) useful, current ecological information regarding <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> seasonal abundance, spatial distribution, and host preference in two VL-endemic districts; and 2) an alternative means of evaluating IRS-treatment through biweekly vector monitoring, helping to determine whether integrated methods of vector management should be recommended in Bihar.</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>The study was conducted in the Saran and Muzaffarpur districts of Bihar, India. Saran and Muzaffarpur are adjacent districts located ~30 km northwest (25.8560° N, 84.8568° E) ~60 km north (26.121736° N, 85.373700° E) of Patna, respectively. Summers are warm with maximum temperatures often ranging from 35–40°C. The winter months (December-February) are typically much cooler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>]. The rainy season typically occurs from July-September and April is generally the driest month.</p>
<p>All villages were part of a large-scale VL-incidence survey performed in 60 villages within each district (<italic>n</italic> = 120) in 2015. At the beginning of 2016, 12 villages in each district were selected for sand fly collection (<italic>n</italic> = 24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with the aim of collecting sand flies from February-December. Prior to study initiation, it was discovered that two rounds of IRS application had been performed within several villages in both districts in 2015 and that application would be repeated in 2016. To evaluate the impact of IRS on vector abundance, we selected 8 IRS-treated villages and 4 untreated villages within each district (<italic>n</italic> = 16; <italic>n</italic> = 8) for CDC light trap collection. The main criteria for village selection were a population of &gt;1,000 villagers, confirmed cases of VL spanning 2013–2015, and IRS-status (treated or untreated). All villages shared similar bioclimatic and agricultural characteristics. Livestock ownership was common with cows (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>, <italic>Bos indicus</italic>), domestic buffalo (<italic>Bubalus bubalus</italic>), and domestic goats (<italic>Capra aegagrus hircus</italic>) prevalent in each village. Dwellings were constructed primarily of thatch, mud, brick, and/or concrete, consisting mainly of human houses and cattle enclosures (cattle sheds, houses cohabitated by humans and bovine). At night, livestock were typically tethered to stakes, and were kept in rooms within cattle enclosures or outdoors adjacent to human dwellings and/or cattle enclosures.</p>

<title>Sand fly collection</title>
<p>CDC light traps were used to collect sand flies in study villages. Twelve (12) CDC light traps were set, in fixed locations, within each of the 24 study villages (<italic>n</italic> = 288 trap-nights per collection week) biweekly from February 10-December 29, 2016 (24 collection periods). During each collection period, CDC light trapping was performed over two consecutive nights with 12 villages being sampled on night-1 and the remainder on night-2. Collection was not conducted in January because adult sand flies are typically not active during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>]. CDC traps were set in randomly selected homes (<italic>n</italic> = 4), cattle enclosures (cattle sheds or dwellings cohabitated by bovines and humans) (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and outdoors in peri-domestic village vegetation (<italic>n</italic> = 4) to better estimate <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> spatial distribution. Traps were identified by a unique code and waypoints taken with a handheld GPS (Garmin Etrex 30, Olathe, KS, USA). Traps were positioned with the fan ~1 m above the ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>]. In peri-domestic vegetation, CDC traps were fitted with protective lids to shield the mechanical components from falling debris or rain. Traps were set at ~18:00 and removed at ~06:00 the following morning. Trap catches were individually numbered, transported to the laboratory in Patna, and frozen at -20°C until further processing. Because dry-ice was not available within the state of Bihar, we were unable to compare the efficiency CDC light traps with CO<sub>2</sub> traps. Permission was received from village residents prior to conducting light trapping.</p>

<title>Sand fly counts and identification</title>
<p>Individual CDC light trap catches were uniquely numbered and identified by trap location and date of capture. Captured sand flies were separated from other arthropods, counted, identified morphologically by species, sexed, and females confirmed as unfed, blood fed, or gravid. If sand fly species was uncertain, specimens were placed under a dissecting microscope and identified morphologically by observing the male genitalia and the female spermatheca, the latter which required dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Molecular species confirmation of sand flies was performed routinely on a random sample of specimens from each village. Whole sand fly DNA was extracted individually according to manufacturing instructions using the DNAzol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Individual sand fly DNA was amplified using forward primer 5’ -TCG AAT CTA TGG GTG GT-3’ and reverse primer 5’- CAC AAT CCC AAC CAC GAA G-3’ for the 18S rRNA target gene. Restriction endonuclease digestion was performed on the PCR product of 18S r RNA using HAE II and HAE III enzymes.

<p>After completing counts and identification, blood fed female <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> were separated and placed into dry 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at -20°C. Sand fly heads were removed from the bodies prior to analysis. DNA was then extracted from the abdomen and thorax of blood fed sand flies. The cytochrome <italic>b</italic> gene region (344 bp conserved mitochondria gene) was amplified using bio-tinilated universal primers designed earlier by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref033">33</xref>].

<title>Comparing IRS-treated with untreated villages</title>
<p>The specific 2016 IRS spray dates for each village were provided by CARE India (Patna, Bihar) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006168.s001">S1 Table</xref>), written on the walls of the village dwellings by the applicators, and were also confirmed by the home owners. The inner walls of houses and cattle enclosures in IRS-treated villages had been sprayed with two rounds of alpha-cypermethrin (5%) wettable powder (WP) at a rate of 25mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and the dates of application varied on a village-to-village basis. The first round of IRS application ranged from April 1–May 30 in Muzaffarpur and April 6-June 2 in Saran (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006168.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The second round of IRS application ranged from August 20-November 14 and September 15-November 28 in Muzzaffarpur and Saran, respectively. All IRS-treated study villages received two rounds of IRS application in 2015. None of the untreated study villages had received IRS-treatment in over three years. In response to insecticide resistance, alpha-cypermethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) has replaced DDT in 15 Bihari districts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Because CDC light trap collections were performed during on-going program-initiated IRS-treatment, we were unable to collect pre-treatment (baseline) data. We first compared the mean <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> per trap-night per collection period (±SE) in IRS-treated and untreated villages within each district. We were specifically interested in differences occurring during the months with the highest relative vector abundance (June-August) and, hence, whether the first round of IRS application may have influenced <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance during this period of peak human-vector exposure. Nonparametric methods deemed sufficient for most skewed analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref035">35</xref>], were considered most appropriate to analyze differences between IRS-treated and untreated villages. Hence, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to estimate differences in relative abundance of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> in IRS-treated and untreated villages (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05) by district. One of the villages in Saran (CI-210), initially untreated during the first round in 2016, received IRS application during the second round (September 21), due to newly reported cases within the village, and therefore was excluded from the statistical analysis after September. We additionally excluded February and December from statistical analysis due to low vector abundance.</p>

The largest peaks in the mean <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> per trap-night occurred in June in houses and vegetation in Muzaffarpur (57.4, 30.9) and Saran (22.4, 29.3). <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> numbers were lowest in February and December for all trap location types in both districts.

<title>Biweekly</title>
<p>Results suggested that fluctuations in biweekly <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> relative abundance were less comparable. In both districts, the first peak occurred during collection period-4 in March and the largest peak occurred during collection period-11 in June (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Numbers declined noticeably during collection period-6 in April. However, villages in Muzaffarpur on average experienced a greater number of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> peaks (collection periods-4,8,11,15) than villages in Saran (collection periods-4,11). General trends in biweekly relative abundance within Muzaffarpur and Saran were determined to be significantly different (Sign test; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0066).</p>
<p>The seasonal abundance observed in cattle sheds appeared to be noticeably different from that of houses and vegetation. The largest peaks in mean <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> per trap-night by trap placement by trapping period were recorded during collection period-11 (June) in houses (110.4) and cattle enclosures (93.2) in Muzaffarpur and Saran, respectively (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g005">5B</xref>).

<p>In Muzaffarpur, the relative <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance per trapping period in IRS-treated and untreated villages were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The most notable difference occurred during collection period-11 (June) in houses where the mean <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> per trap-night in IRS-treated villages was markedly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However, the mean was comparable to the untreated villages during collection period-12.</p>
<p>In Saran, the mean number of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> in cattle enclosures suggested differences in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance occurred in June (collection periods-9, 10, 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) but standard error was sizable because of outliers in one village (CI-210), particularly during collection period-11, and differences were less evident from collection period-12 onwards.

<p>Nonparametric means of statistical analysis were used to estimate differences in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance in IRS-treated and untreated villages because of the large standard errors reported.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study 1) provide ecological data regarding <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> monthly relative abundance, spatial distribution, and host preferance comparable to previous research; and 2) suggest relative <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance within IRS-treated and untreated villages do not differ significantly. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive entomology-based study, with insights into IRS-performance, conducted in Bihar, India.</p>
<p>Monthly <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> relative abundance was comparable to results presented by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>], being highest in June, July and August and lowest in winter. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> spatial distribution was similar in that specimens were more frequently collected in cattle enclosures than other areas. Additionally, blood meal analysis suggested <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> fed primarly on bovines and humans as reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref017">17</xref>], but suggested a slight increase in the proportion taking full or partial blood meals from bovines (~60%: current; ~50%: previous).</p>
<p>The results of this study do not indicate that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance in IRS-treated villages significantly differs from untreated villages in Muzaffarpur or Saran. Additionally, the application of IRS did not appear to prevent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> from increasing June-August. The lack of difference between IRS-treated and untreated villages is noteworthy, considering a recent mathematical, epidemiological model predicted a &gt;67% reduction in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance would be necessary to remove VL from a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref036">36</xref>]. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref022">22</xref>] reported a 72% reduction in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance resulting from IRS. However, these results are limited temporally, given that post-treatment collections were performed only twice in April, during which results of the current study and those of previous researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref037">37</xref>] suggest sand fly abundance in Bihar declines naturally.</p>
<p>The efficacy of IRS is largely dependent on sand flies being endophilic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref038">38</xref>] which should help explain why little difference was observed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance in vegetation. The presence of sand flies outdoors during this study and past studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref029">29</xref>] suggests a high percentage of the sand fly population may not come into contact with IRS-treated surfaces. One hundred and seventy three (173) <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> collected in vegetation during the current study were confirmed to have taken a full or partial blood meal from humans. Considering the vaste majority of village households have members who sleep outdoors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref039">39</xref>], particularly during the warmer summer months, a proportion of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> may be able to feed and potentially transmit VL without ever entering a village dwelling. The increased likelihood of sleeping outdoors June-August, in conjunction with the greater vector density observed during this period in the current study, suggests villagers are placed at high risk of exposure to exophagic and exophilic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic>.</p>
<p>For evaluation of IRS against exophilic, endophagic sand flies, the mortality rates of the insects entering sprayed households would be of interest. Researchers conducting a recent study in the Judean Desert of Jerusalem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref040">40</xref>] observed that the number of sand flies captured in CO<sub>2</sub> traps entering an experimental home (EH) with treated and untreated surfaces didn’t differ significantly, but noted that the mortality rate on deltamethrin-treated surfaces was higher when compared with untreated control (~69%, ~23%). While this would be useful information to obtain for the current study, the vaste number of insect species within CDC light traps, the process of collecting the large quantity of traps set per collection night (<italic>n</italic> = 144), and hot Indian temperatures made estimating sand fly mortality infeasible. However, the mean number of blood fed <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> collected in CDC light traps positioned in homes in IRS-treated villages (<italic>n</italic> = 14.1) was comparable to untreated (<italic>n</italic> = 12), suggesting limited effect of IRS.</p>
<p>Although nonparametric statistical methods were used to account for outliers, the importance of these outliers and their potential implications in medical entomology and vector ecology should not be ignored. For this reason, we report the arithmetic means as well. A single house in one IRS-treated village (CI-58) in Muzaffarpur yielded 2,308 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> in a single trap (May 19), 33 days after being sprayed with alpha-cypermethrin. Another home located within the same village yielded 2,941 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> on June 30. In total, of six individual trap-nights which each yielded &gt;1,000 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic>, all were positioned within dwellings, and five were located in IRS-treated villages in Muzaffarpur. The sixth trap, which yielded 3,248 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic>, was located in an untreated cattle enclosure in Saran (CI-210). It is unusual that dwellings in the latter village were not sprayed, given it was &lt;1 km from an IRS-treated village (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006168.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and interesting in that new cases were reported in 2016, leading to the village being sprayed on September 21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006168.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The ability of some <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> spp. to fly distances &gt;1–2 km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref042">42</xref>], in addition to potential movement of VL-infected persons between villages, suggests that villages in close proximity to those with current VL cases should also be treated.</p>
<p>If vector density in Bihar has not decreased significantly in villages treated with IRS, it would suggest that the decline in reported VL cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref043">43</xref>] in Bihar could be related to other factors. Results of several studies indicate a repeating periodicity of VL in which peaks in cases occur every 10–20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref044">44</xref>]. In the Goalpara District, Assam, five historical epidemic peaks were described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref045">45</xref>] occuring in 1885, 1897, 1913, 1925, and 1944. The three previous VL peaks in India have occured in 1978, 1992, and 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref046">46</xref>], a trend seen also in Bihar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref047">47</xref>]. Researchers have suggested uncertainty as to whether the recent reduction in VL cases is a result of limited IRS efficacy or the natural VL cycle in south Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref026">26</xref>], but given the abundance of <italic>P</italic>.<italic>argentipes</italic> in Bihar, the redundant periodicity of VL incidence, and the time since the most recent VL peak in Bihar, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the latter hypothesis may be correct. Other issues such as underreporting could be a factor, as many researchers believe the reported cases to be a gross underestimation of the true number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref050">50</xref>]. Reported cases have been estimated to represent as low as 5–8% the total cases occuring in Bihar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref051">51</xref>]. House to house surveys conducted in 14 villages in Bihar suggested only 12.3% of VL cases were officially reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the current vector control strategy in Bihar may benefit from the integration of another vector control strategy aimed at targeting outdoor <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic>. One such vector control strategy to consider would be the treating of village vegetation with toxic sugar baits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref053">53</xref>] an approach that exploits male and female <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> spp. sand flies tendency to feed on sugar from plants. Although this approach has not been pursued in Bihar, previous studies report a possible association between <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> and Palmyra palm trees (<italic>Borassus flabellifer</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref029">29</xref>] and banana plants (<italic>Musa acuminata</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref054">54</xref>], suggesting these plant species may be candidates for sugar bait application.</p>
<p>The association of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> with cattle enclosures and bovine blood meals observed during this study suggests treating bovines systemically with approved drugs may also be a promising approach. Laboratory studies performed in Bihar confirm that endectocides administered systemically to lesser-bandicoot rats (<italic>Bandicota bengalensis</italic>) and roof rats (<italic>Rattus rattus</italic>) were highly efficacious against adult and larval <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref055">55</xref>]. A pen study during which fipronil was orally administered to cattle indicated near 100% mortality of adult female <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> blood feeding on cattle 21 days after a single oral dose and 100% mortality of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> larvae feeding on feces collected from the same animals 21 days post-exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref056">56</xref>]. The oviposition sites of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> are largely unknown, but when eggs, larvae, and/or pupae are found in Bihari villages, they are often found in proximity to cattle sheds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref059">59</xref>], perhaps because the feces provide nutrition for developing larvae, which if confirmed would validate fipronil as a potential larvacide. We recommend the oviposition behavior of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> be explored at great length in future studies, as knowledge regarding larval habitat would greatly improve vector control schemes.</p>
<sec id="sec025">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have collected abundant, contemporary ecological data from similar geographical locations in Bihar, which are suggested to produce more precise epidemiological models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref060">60</xref>]. Our study is primarily an entomological field evaluation and in future studies the methods we implemented should be modified to include a baseline collection period and should be coupled with explicit epidemiological surveillance. Ecologically, our results suggest <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> to 1) feed opportunistically on humans and bovines, 2) show a preference for cattle enclosures, and 3) be present outdoors in village vegetation. Because the majority of Bihari villagers sleep outdoors during periods when vector abundance is high, it is likely that many <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> feed exophagically. This theory is supported by the lack of difference in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> abundance within IRS-treated and untreated villages, by previous field observations and blood meal analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref017">17</xref>], and through observing <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> infesting cattle during peak biting periods. Logically, IRS can only be efficacious in reducing endophagic vectors, which reinforces a need for supplemental vector control practices to reduce outdoor feeding populations. Because <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> feeds heavily on bovines, endectocide-treated cattle may provide an appropriate means of reducing vectors unexposed to IRS-treated dwellings. By considering a complimentary form of vector control to better target exophagic, exophilic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> and by conducting explicit, frequent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>argentipes</italic> collection in combination with active and passive case detection, we could expand upon both integrated vector management and disease-vector surveilance, two of the main VL-reduction strategies discussed by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006168.ref008">8</xref>]. As a result, we should be able to better protect outdoor-sleeping villagers and better estimate the sustainability of VL-reduction through program-initiated vector control.</p>
