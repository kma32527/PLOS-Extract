<abstract>
<p>The endosymbiont <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is known to block replication of several important arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), in the mosquito vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. So far, the exact mechanism of this viral inhibition is not fully understood. A recent study in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has demonstrated an interaction between the <italic>pelo</italic> gene and Drosophila C virus. In this study, we explored the possible involvement of the pelo protein, that is involved in protein translation, in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral response and mosquito-DENV interaction. We found that pelo is upregulated during DENV replication and its silencing leads to reduced DENV virion production suggesting that it facilities DENV replication. However, in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, specifically in female mosquitoes, the pelo protein is downregulated and its subcellular localization is altered, which could contribute to reduction in DENV replication in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. In addition, we show that the microRNA aae-miR-2940-5p, whose abundance is highly enriched in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes, might mediate regulation of pelo. Our data reveals identification of pelo as a host factor that is positively involved in DENV replication, and its suppression in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may contribute to virus blocking exhibited by the endosymbiont.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Dengue infection along with its related disease conditions poses a significant threat to human populations. The pathogen responsible for this infection is dengue virus (DENV), which is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Unavailability of vaccines has recently sparked research endeavours aimed at vector control. To date, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as an endosymbiotic bacterium, has shown promises as a novel biocontrol agent to restrict DENV replication in mosquitoes through a mechanism that is still elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of pelo in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mosquito-DENV interactions. We found that the pelo protein is upregulated upon DENV infection facilitating its replication, but <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection leads to the suppression of the protein that may contribute to inhibition of DENV replication. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of the pelo protein in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral effect against DENV in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the major medically important arboviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref002">2</xref>]. It belongs to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family that comprises lipid-enveloped, positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref003">3</xref>]. DENV is classified into four antigenically distinct but closely related serotypes, designated as DENV-1 to DENV-4. The bite of an infected female of either <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is the common mode of DENV transmission to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref004">4</xref>]. Infected humans may suffer from dengue fever (DF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), leading to fatality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref006">6</xref>]. Currently, there is no specific therapy or effective vaccine available and the treatments available are palliative in nature. Despite substantial efforts to control DENV through vector control, it is still geographically expanding and alternative vector control strategies and therapeutic options are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref007">7</xref>]. One such strategy involves the use of a bacterial endosymbiont <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in transinfected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes which limits DENV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is an endosymbiotic, vertically transmitted bacterium that appears to have infected more than 40% of insect species in addition to other terrestrial arthropods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref010">10</xref>]. However, it is not a natural symbiont of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, which is the primary vector of DENV. Recently, several different types of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains have been successfully introduced into <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, among which <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Mel-Pop-CLA (Pop) and <italic>w</italic>Mel strains are the most promising ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref012">12</xref>]. Both strains produce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which facilitates replacement of the wild populations through this reproductive manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, introduction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> has induced viral resistance in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes to a variety of arboviruses including dengue, Zika, West Nile and chikungunya viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref017">17</xref>]. However, the exact mechanism which causes this antiviral effect is not fully understood. Despite a small number of studies that have elucidated the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref019">19</xref>], reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref021">21</xref>], and competition for resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref022">22</xref>] in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral response, the fundamental molecular mechanism(s) underlying virus blocking are yet to be explored. One of the possible strategies to discover molecular interactions between DENV-<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-<italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is to find host factors that facilitate replication of arboviruses and examine their relative abundance in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. A recent study in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has identified the protein pelo as an important host factor facilitating efficient replication of Drosophila C virus (DCV) by improving access of the viral genome to ribosomes leading to increased synthesis of viral structural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Pelo is an evolutionary conserved protein which plays an important role in the regulation of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> germ cell meiosis. In the pelo mutant males of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, cell cycle in spermatogenesis is arrested at the late prophase stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref025">25</xref>]. In contrast, in mutant female flies, mitotic division during oogenesis is affected along with impaired development of the eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref026">26</xref>]. Deletion of pelo’s homolog, (Dom34, <underline>D</underline>uplication <underline>O</underline>f <underline>M</underline>ultilocus <underline>R</underline>egion) in yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> led to the build-up of free ribosomes and decline in the number of polysomes suggesting its involvement in translational regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to characterize the expression of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti’</italic>s pelo protein in response to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and DENV infection. We found that the pelo protein facilitates DENV maturation/secretion and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> suppresses the protein which may contribute to the inhibition of DENV in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells. In addition, we explored the subcellular localization of the pelo protein in response to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and DENV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate an indirect involvement of the miRNA aae-miR-2940-5p in regulating pelo in response to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection.</p>

<p>All mosquitoes used in this study for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> comparisons were previously produced by McMeniman et al. (2008) by infecting <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes with <italic>w</italic>MelPop-CLA strain of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Pop).

<p>Total RNA was extracted from either cell lines, mosquitoes or flies using Qiazol (Qiagen) and subsequently treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Total RNA (1000ng or 200 ng for tissues with less RNA) was used to make cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) using either oligo(dT) primer for cellular genes or DENV-qR primer to amplify the DENV genomic RNA. The <italic>pelo</italic> transcript sequence (XM_001658653.1) was retrieved from NCBI in order to design primers. The full-length <italic>pelo</italic> gene was amplified by Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using 1μl of cDNA in 25μl reaction together with <italic>pelo</italic>-specific primers (all primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006405.s006">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The cDNA reaction was diluted in 1:5 ratio with water, from which 2μl was used for qPCR reactions in which gene-specific primers were utilized to amplify the target genes, using QuantiFast SYBR Green (Qiagen) in a Rotorgene thermocycler (Qiagen). For mosquito samples, ribosomal protein S17 (<italic>RPS17</italic>; AY927787.2) transcripts were used for normalization of RNA templates, while ribosomal protein L32 (<italic>RPL32</italic>; NM_079843) was used for normalization in the case of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. Each qPCR reaction was performed in two technical replicates each with at least three biological replicates. All qPCR data were normalized with Qiagen analysis templates and were further analysed by Prism 6.0. The qPCR cycling profile included 95°C for 5 min for the initial denaturation and hot start Taq activation, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 15 sec and 72°C for 20 sec. Melt curve analysis was carried out on default settings of the Rotorgene machine to check the specificity of the qPCR products. Unpaired t-test was used to compare differences between two individual groups while One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s PostHoc test was performed to find differences between more than two groups of data.</p>

After settlement of cells, they were double transfected with dsRNA against the target gene or the control. After 6 h post-secondary transfection, they were infected with DENV-2 (New Guinea strain) at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) indicated in the text. Media were collected 72 h after infection for plaque assay and the cells were subjected to RNA extraction to check the DENV genomic RNA levels by RT-qPCR.</p>
<p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, 48 h after injection of mosquitoes with dsRNAs, mosquitoes were offered the opportunity to feed on a mixture of DENV-2 (QML16) strain virus supernatant in defibrinated sheep blood at a titre of 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/ml using an artificial membrane feeding apparatus with dried bovine caecum lining as the membrane. A second group of the dsRNA injected mosquitoes was intra-thoracically microinjected with 50 nL of the DENV-2 stock (10<sup>7</sup> pfu/ml) using the Nanoject III microinjector at a flow rate of 25 nL/sec while maintained on ice. Following DENV injection, mosquitoes were returned to the 750 ml plastic container for maintenance in the environmental growth chamber and collected 7 days post virus injection. Mosquito lysates were subsequently prepared by homogenizing the body of each mosquito in 500 μl of OptiMEM medium (Sigma) containing 2.5% FBS followed by centrifugation at 5900 ×g for 5 min, at 4°C.

<p>Pelo has been reported to be localized to the cytoplasm in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref032">32</xref>]. Although the pelo protein does have a conserved nuclear localization signal (PRKRK), there is a lack of experimental evidence of its presence inside the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref024">24</xref>]; therefore, we explored its subcellular localization in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> cells and whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> affects the localization of pelo. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of both Aag2 and Pop cells were separated. Lysates were run on a 5–15% Bis/Tris polyacrylamide gel, total proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and then probed with an anti-pelo antiserum along with other control antisera, including anti-histone H3 (to confirm the nuclear fraction), anti-GAPDH (to confirm the cytoplasmic fraction), and anti-WSP (to confirm <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection). Here it is important to note that we detected the WSP protein in the nuclear fraction of Pop cells as well, although in smaller amount as compared to the cytoplasmic fraction, which is consistent with the earlier report demonstrating the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<italic>w</italic>MelPop) in the nuclei of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> cells with the help of electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref014">14</xref>].

After confirming silencing of the Agos with dsRNA specific to the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), we employed RT-qPCR followed by the statistical analysis with One-way ANOVA (<italic>F</italic>(2, 6) = 25.1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0012). Tukey post hoc test results showed that after <italic>Ago2</italic> knockdown there was a significant increase in the expression of <italic>pelo</italic> as compared to both mock (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0014) and <italic>Ago1</italic> knock down (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0035) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g005">Fig 5C</xref>;), which suggested that miRNAs might be involved in regulating pelo levels. Interestingly, we found that when <italic>Ago1</italic> was silenced, <italic>Ago2</italic> levels increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and conversely when <italic>Ago2</italic> was knocked down, <italic>Ago1</italic> transcript levels increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>As <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated pelo suppression was found to be specific to female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, we aimed to determine if a mosquito-specific miRNA that was previously shown to be significantly up-regulated in <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>MelPop-CLA infected female mosquitoes, as compared to uninfected ones, could be involved in regulation of pelo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref018">18</xref>]. Although three targets of this miRNA have already been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref037">37</xref>], we tried to determine if it has any interaction with the transcripts of the <italic>pelo</italic> gene. RNAhybrid analysis showed potential aae-miR-2940-5p target sequences in the ORF of the <italic>pelo</italic> gene at positions 561–582 with significant seed region complementarity and high minimum free energy of -25.8 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006405.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In order for a miRNA to regulate a target mRNA, it is important that the mature miRNA and its target transcript co-localize in the same tissue. As we found that <italic>pelo</italic> was expressed in all the mosquito tissues that we examined and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> supresses its expression in all the tested tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g003">Fig 3A–3E</xref>), we were interested to find out the tissue-specific expression of aae-miR-2940-5p in mosquito tissues in the presence and absence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from various tissues (muscle was not included) of Pop and Tet <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes confirmed induction of aae-miR-2940-5p due to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in all tissues, with substantial induction in the midgut and fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The trend in these inductions was of an inverse association with reductions of the <italic>pelo</italic> transcript levels in the corresponding tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>).</p>

<p>To verify the interaction between aae-miR2940-5p and <italic>pelo</italic>, Aag2 cells were transfected with a synthetic aae-miR2940-5p mimic, control mimic with random sequences, and without a mimic (mock transfection) as a second control. RT-qPCR results subjected to One-way ANOVA (<italic>F</italic>(2, 6) = 33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006) followed by Tukey post hoc test showed that there were significant reductions in the transcript levels of <italic>pelo</italic> in Aag2 cells transfected with aae-miR2940-5p mimic as compared to mock (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0022), and control mimic transfected cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of synthetic mimic and inhibitor of aae-miR-2940-5p on Pelo protein expression was analysed 72 h post-transfection. Western blot results suggested down-regulation of the pelo protein in the presence of the aae-miR-2940-5p mimic, while application of the inhibitor did not affect pelo levels as compared to the negative control inhibitor; it showed an increase when compared to the mock transfection or negative control mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to examine if there is direct interaction between aae-miR-2940-5p and the predicted target sequences in <italic>pelo</italic>, we cloned the target sequences downstream of <italic>GFP</italic> in the pIZ/V5-His vector. The <italic>GFP</italic>-<italic>pelo</italic> target sequence clone was co-transfected with the control random sequence mimic and aae-miR-2940-5p mimic into Aag2 cells. RNA was collected after 72 h, and RT-qPCR was carried out to check the level of <italic>GFP</italic> transcripts. The results showed that there was no change in the levels of <italic>GFP</italic> in response to aae-miR-2940-5p mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g006">Fig 6D</xref>; <italic>F</italic>(2, 6) = 0.9271, <italic>p</italic> = 0.4458), which suggests that likely there is no direct interaction between <italic>pelo</italic> and aae-miR-2940-5p. This result is not surprising as most miRNAs are reported to target transcription factors or other proteins that in return fine tune the abundance of different transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref038">38</xref>]. To rule out the possibility of another target site for the miRNA in the <italic>pelo</italic> transcript undetected by the prediction program, the full-length <italic>pelo</italic>, including its 3’UTR, was cloned into the pIZ/V5-His vector and co-transfected with aae-miR-2940-5p mimic in Sf9 cells. There was no downregulation of <italic>pelo</italic> in the presence of aae-miR-2940-5p mimic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006405.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), which confirmed our aforementioned observation.</p>

<title>Pelo plays a role in DENV virion production</title>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that <italic>pelo</italic> is required for efficient replication of Drosophila C virus (DCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref023">23</xref>]. In order to examine if the pelo protein has a similar effect on DENV replication, we infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> Aa20 cells with DENV-2 (NGC strain) at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI; pfu/cell). Cells were collected at 3 and 5 days post-infection (dpi) from which RNA and proteins were extracted. RT-qPCR results showed no significant change in the <italic>pelo</italic> transcript levels during DENV infection at both 3 (t = 1.12, df = 4, p = 0.3254) and 5 dpi (t = 1.447, df = 4, p = 0.2214) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). However, western blot analysis of the cells using an antiserum against <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> pelo clearly showed an increase in the levels of the protein upon infection at both 3 and 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The same blot was re-probed with an anti-DENV-Envelope antiserum to confirm infection. This suggests that pelo could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. To check the localization of the pelo protein during DENV infection, we fractionated mock and 5 dpi Aa20 cells (1 MOI) into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates were run on a 5–15% Bis/Tris polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the blot was probed with the pelo antiserum. Results showed that unlike <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, DENV infection has no effect on the subcellular localization of pelo, which remains in the cytoplasm in both uninfected and DENV-2 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>The above results suggest that DENV might increase levels of the host pelo protein in order to facilitate its replication, similar to DCV in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. In order to further confirm this link, the transcript levels of the <italic>pelo</italic> gene was knocked down in Aa20 cells using <italic>pelo</italic> specific dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006405.g008">Fig 8A</xref>; about 70% silencing) and subsequently infected with DENV-2 (NGC strain) at 1 MOI.

At 3 dpi, cells were harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR using DENV-2 specific primers to the <italic>NS1</italic> gene.

These results demonstrated that when <italic>pelo</italic> was knocked down the number of DENV infectious particles produced and secreted outside the cells significantly declined, but there was no effect on the total genomic RNA of DENV, implicating that pelo might play an important role in the translation of the viral genomic RNA and/or assembly and release of DENV-2 virions.</p>

<p>To show the effect of <italic>pelo</italic> silencing <italic>in vivo</italic>, we initially injected 4-day-old mosquitoes with dsPelo, dsGFP and PBS, and after two days fed them with sheep blood containing 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/ml DENV-2. Seven days following virus inoculation, mosquitoes were collected and tested for DENV genomic RNA levels in the treatments using RT-qPCR. This time point was selected to allow sufficient time for the virus to replicate for comparison between the treatments. However, we detected very little viral RNA in the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006405.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), and further testing of individual mosquitoes determined that only about 13% of the mosquitoes were infected with DENV.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite numerous efforts to unveil the mechanism by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> manipulates its host environment to restrict virus replication, the exact mechanism(s) that govern this antiviral property are largely unknown. In this study, we have found that the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> supresses the pelo protein which in turn may contribute towards restricting DENV virion production in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a facultative endosymbiont in many insect species and other invertebrates, however, the <italic>w</italic>MelPop-CLA strain, which most effectively suppresses DENV replication, has no natural association with the primary DENV vector <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and has been artificially transinfected into <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref013">13</xref>]. Several reports have shown that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated activation of immune genes in the Imd and Toll pathways could be involved in host protection from various viruses in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref041">41</xref>]. Other reports, however, have shown that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> does not elicit the host immune response, in particular in hosts that are naturally infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref044">44</xref>]. A recent study investigating the role of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced restriction of Semliki Forest virus within <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> cells (JW18) suggested that interference occurs at a very early stage of infection and at the level of viral RNA translation or host RNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref045">45</xref>]. However, in some <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-host-virus associations viral replication is not inhibited but rather a tolerance to viral infection is conferred by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, findings of Wu et al. (2014) and Lapidopt et al. (2015) have shed light on the role of the pelo protein as an important host factor for effective viral replication in the case of Drosophila C virus (DCV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref048">48</xref>]. However, the potential role of pelo has not been characterized yet in the case of the medically important DENV and its controlling agent <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the mosquito vector. RT-qPCR analyses revealed that the <italic>pelo</italic> gene is expressed ubiquitously throughout all the main tissues of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> with higher transcript levels in the salivary glands, which is consistent with the studies conducted on tissue localization of pelo in the case of human and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref031">31</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that <italic>pelo</italic> is supressed in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in cell lines, whole mosquitoes and a number of tissues such as the salivary gland, muscle, and ovary. However, this suppression is specific to female mosquitoes; it was not seen in the male mosquitoes or in either male or females of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> infected with <italic>w</italic>MelPop. The difference in pelo regulation in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> versus <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> could be due to the length of association between the bacteria and host; <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a natural infection in the fly whereas its infection of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes was only recently established through transinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>DENV titre in Pop cells was below the detection limit of our plaque assay, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref012">12</xref>] have also shown that barely any virion is produced in <italic>w</italic>MelPop-infected cells or mosquitoes that is detectable by plaque assay. While in the Aa20 cell line treated with dspelo, inhibition of DENV was not as dramatic as seen in <italic>w</italic>MelPop-infected mosquitoes or the cell line, silencing the gene in mosquitoes had very similar effects on DENV replication to <italic>w</italic>MelPop-infected mosquitoes, which could be due to higher efficiency of gene silencing. Nevertheless, as indicated above, downregulation of pelo in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> does not seem to be the only mechanism of virus blocking.</p>
<p>Pelo is a highly conserved protein in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref024">24</xref>], and using multiple sequence alignments for pelo sequences from different insect species we found that the protein is also highly conserved among insect species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006405.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). It has a distinct nuclear localization signal (PRKRK), and shows structural similarities with human pelo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006405.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, it has been demonstrated that pelo mostly resides in the cytoplasm and there is a lack of evidence for the presence of pelo in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref032">32</xref>]. This led us to investigate the localization of the pelo protein in mosquito cells and in particular in the instance of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. Western blot results showed that the pelo protein is mainly found in the cytoplasm of mosquito cells when uninfected, however, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection leads to a change in the subcellular localization of pelo, which was found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This change in the subcellular localization of pelo during <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection may restrict availability of the protein in the cytoplasm, which is required for rapid translation of specific viral proteins. This would be in agreement with a previous study in which it was shown that pelo is required for the synthesis of the capsid protein of DCV, which they described as a quickly translated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref023">23</xref>]. Alternatively, the translocation of pelo into the nucleus may have an inhibitory effect on a host gene(s) that normally facilitates viral replication.</p>
<p>miRNAs are important regulators of different cellular processes including cell division, timing, differentiation, death, control of metabolism, transposon silencing and antiviral defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref052">52</xref>]. Recently, our group has shed light on the modulation of different cellular miRNAs in the case of infection with <italic>w</italic>MelPop strain of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in female mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref018">18</xref>]. Along similar lines, in this study we have investigated whether pelo has an interaction with any miRNA by silencing both <italic>Argonaute 1</italic> (<italic>Ago1</italic>) and <italic>Argonaute 2</italic> (<italic>Ago2</italic>) genes, which are important components of the RISC complex and involved in miRNA function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref053">53</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that silencing of one Ago led to the upregulation of the other Ago. One possible reason might be class switching between the Agos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref036">36</xref>]. Increase in <italic>pelo</italic> levels in <italic>Ago2</italic> silenced cells suggested that <italic>pelo</italic> downregulation in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells could possibly be mediated by miRNA. Hussain et al (2011) provided evidence that in <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>MelPop-CLA infected mosquitoes the mosquito-specific aae-miR-2940-5p was significantly upregulated as compared to uninfected mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref018">18</xref>]. While three targets of this miRNA have already been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref037">37</xref>], we explored whether it has any interaction with the transcripts of the <italic>pelo</italic> gene. The co-localization of both <italic>pelo</italic> transcripts and mature aae-miR-2940-5p highlights the possibility that in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells aae-miR-2940-5p might be utilized to downregulate <italic>pelo</italic> transcripts. These results also further confirmed differential expression of this miRNA in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes at the tissue level. Further investigation showed that <italic>pelo</italic> transcript levels were downregulated in the presence of the artificially synthesized mimic of aae-miR-2940-5p both at the transcript and the protein levels, while there was an increase in the pelo protein in the case of addition of an artificially synthesized inhibitor of aae-miR-2940-5p. However, target validation results using <italic>GFP</italic> as a reporter suggested that <italic>pelo</italic> may not be a direct target of aae-miR-2940. The action of aae-miR-2940-5p could be through regulation of a transcription factor(s) or other protein(s) by the miRNA that fine-tunes the abundance of the <italic>pelo</italic> transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Viruses are well known to modulate transcripts of host cells for their own benefit. Recently, a research group examined <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> mutants that resist DCV replication through a forward genetic screen and demonstrated a DCV-resistant mutant to be deficient of the <italic>pelo</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref023">23</xref>]. Pelo protein has also been implicated in TYLCV resistance in tomato TY172 cultivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref048">48</xref>]. However, its potential role in the case of DENV has not yet been explored. Our results suggest an increase in the levels of pelo in DENV-infected cells at the protein level without a change in its subcellular localization, which was mostly cytoplasmic. Furthermore, <italic>pelo</italic> knockdown studies suggest it plays a role in DENV virion production/secretion. The outcome of this study is in agreement with the previous findings that showed pelo is vital for the translation of the capsid protein of DCV thus positively affecting replication of DCV. A similar role of pelo was found in other viruses including Cricket Paralysis virus, Double Drosophila X virus, and invertebrate iridescent virus 6 and TYLCV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006405.ref048">48</xref>], suggesting that pelo might be an important host factor that is recruited by viruses to facilitate the translation of viral genome.</p>
<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that the pelo protein facilitates DENV production/secretion, and in female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> suppresses the pelo protein, which may consequently contribute to restriction of DENV in the mosquitoes. This effect could be due to relocalization of the pelo protein to the nucleus in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells as compared to non-infected cells. In addition, regulation of pelo in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquito cells appears to be mediated by aae-miR-2940-5p. However, the regulation of pelo was found to be female mosquito specific and not observed in male mosquitoes or in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> males or females. Therefore, while suppression of pelo in female mosquitoes may contribute to virus inhibition, this does not seem to be the universal mechanism of virus inhibition seen across different host-virus interactions. However, identification of an association between pelo, the miRNA aae-miR-2940-5p and virus inhibition in <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> provides new insights into the mechanism of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> induced virus inhibition, which is a central feature of a major new strategy against arboviral diseases.</p>
