<title>Background</title>
<p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress generated unfolded stress response (UPR) is a basic survival mechanism which protects cell under unfavourable conditions. Leishmania parasite modulates host macrophages in various ways to ensure its survival. Modulation of PI3K-Akt pathway in delayed apoptotic induction of host; enables parasite to stabilize the infection for further propagation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Infected RAW macrophages were exposed to campothecin or thagsigargin and phosphorylation status of PERK, Akt, BAD and Cyt-C was determined through western blotting using phospho specific antibody. Expression at transcriptional level for cIAP1 &amp;2, ATF4, CHOP, ATF3, HO-1 and sXBP1 was determined using real time PCR. For inhibition studies, RAW macrophages were pre-treated with PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 before infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Our studies in RAW macrophages showed that induction of host UPR against <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection activates Akt mediated pathway which delays apoptotic induction of the host. Moreover, Leishmania infection results in phosphorylation and activation of host PERK enzyme and increased transcription of genes of inhibitor of apoptosis gene family (cIAP) mRNA. In our inhibition studies, we found that inhibition of infection induced PERK phosphorylation under apoptotic inducers reduces the Akt phosphorylation and fails to activate further downstream molecules involved in protection against apoptosis. Also, inhibition of PERK phosphorylation under oxidative exposure leads to increased Nitric Oxide production. Simultaneously, decreased transcription of cIAP mRNA upon PERK phosphorylation fates the host cell towards apoptosis hence decreased infection rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall the findings from the study suggests that Leishmania modulated host UPR and PERK phosphorylation delays apoptotic induction in host macrophage, hence supports parasite invasion at early stages of infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Visceral Leishmaniasis or Kala-azar is one of the severe tropical neglected parasitic diseases caused by <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> in Indian subcontinent. Modulation of host in terms of delayed apoptotic induction is one of the aspects which favours disease establishment; however the mechanism is not clearly understood yet. In the present study, we tried to explore the connection between <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection induced UPR in host with delayed onset of apoptosis. We found that <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection phosphorylates the PERK and Akt molecule in host along with delayed apoptosis. Simultaneously, the levels of cellular IAP (cIAP1 &amp; 2) genes were also up-regulated in infected macrophages. To assess the involvement of PERK in delayed apoptosis of host, we inhibited the phosphorylation of PERK under the exposure to apoptotic inducers. We found that PERK inhibition decreased the Akt phosphorylation and fails to activate other associated downstream molecules involved in delayed apoptosis of host. Also, a significant reduction in cIAP levels was observed. Under oxidative exposure, inhibition of PERK phosphorylation debilitates infected RAW cell’s ability to maintain redox homeostasis leading to higher nitric oxide production. Altogether, <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection modulates host apoptosis in a PERK dependent manner and favours infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> ability to defy the host immune response is a major cause for persistence of Leishmaniasis. Parasite modulates host in various aspects and hampers the activation of adaptive immune responses against infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref001">1</xref>]. Expression of LPG on parasite surface and TLR 2 modulates the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref003">3</xref>] by providing resistance to complement, attachment and entry into macrophages, protection against proteolytic damage within acidic vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref004">4</xref>] or inhibition of phagosomal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite has to counter the oxidative and nitrosative pressure generated in host macrophage against invasion. Parasite modulates host NO and IL-12 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref009">9</xref>] and induces host HO-1which suppress the production of superoxide and increases parasitic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that restores cellular homeostasis and ensures cell survival during Endoplasmic Reticulum stress. UPR consists of 3 signalling pathways: activation of transcription factor (ATF)-6, inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE)-1, and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref011">11</xref>]. As a downstream consequence, activated IRE1 increases cytosolic concentration of spliced XBP1 (sXBP1); an active transcription factor which in turn activates an array of genes to counter ER stress for cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref014">14</xref>]. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> induces the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway to escape cellular defence; particularly oxidative stress by sXBP1 induced expression of antioxidant molecules such as SOD-1 and catalase, and increases expression of IFN1-β, an important cytokine that favour’s <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In another aspect of modulation, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite induces a mild ER stress in host macrophages and activates the PI3K-Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref016">16</xref>]. However, a very few studies has been conducted in correlation with induced UPR and leishmaniasis, but the PI3K-Akt phosphorylation is of great importance in parasite biology. As a part of host modulation, <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigote activates host PI3K-Akt pathway, phosphorylates BAD, checks cytochrome-C leakage from mitochondria, inhibits caspase activation; hence delays apoptotic induction in host macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>PERK being an important component of integrated endoplasmic reticulum stress response (IERSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref018">18</xref>]; its activation influences cellular adaptation through multiple mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref020">20</xref>]. Induction of mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP proteins) is one of the PERK-dependent survival mechanisms which protects cell from ER stress- induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref022">22</xref>]. Also, activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway by ER stress is dependent on PERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref023">23</xref>]. Also, PERK phosphorylation under oxidative stress is crucial for protection against oxidative stress and maintaining redox balance for cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>So, in this study we first confirms the previous findings that <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection delays host cell apoptosis under exposure to apoptotic inducers by phosphorylating Akt, BAD protein which inhibits the caspase-3 activity, resulting delayed apoptosis. Further we investigated the effect of <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection in imparting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in host and activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we first time reported that <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection induced host UPR relays on PERK activation. Our findings suggest that inhibition of PERK phosphorylation render RAW cells more prone to apoptosis ultimately leading to decreased infection rate. Moreover, activation of IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) class of proteins which protects cell from various apoptotic stimulus; depends upon PERK phosphorylation. Overall we conclude that UPR activated against <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection is a PERK dependent process and have an important role in delayed onset of apoptosis in host macrophages; hence contributes to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infectivity.</p>

<title>Leishmania cell culture</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> promastigotes used in all experiments were of clones AG83 (MHOM/IN/ 1983/AG83). The promastigotes were grown in fresh M199 media (Gibco) in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (Nunc) at 25°C supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). Cultures were allowed to reach stationary phase (5–6 days post inoculation), as determined by growth curve analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006646.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), prior to inoculation into fresh medium.

<title>Cell line maintenance</title>
<p>The RAW 267.4 cell line (obtained from NCCS, Pune) was maintained in a 25-cm2 flask in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin) in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (Sanyo, Japan) at 37°C. The growth and condition of cultures were routinely checked under an inverted microscope (Nikon, USA). The cells were sub cultured in every 72 hrs.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Real-time PCR</title>
<p>RAW267.4 macrophages were allowed to infect with <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> promastigotes for 4 h, washed to remove unattached promastigotes and further infection was carried out for mentioned time periods (4 h /12 h/ 36 h) before campothecin (2mM/ 6 h) or thapsigargin (1μM/ 1hr) treatment. For inhibition studies, RAW267.4 macrophages were pre-treated with GSK2606414 for 2 hours before allowing infection. Reverse transcription was performed using 0.2 mg total RNA using an anchored oligo (dT) (H-dT11M, where M represents A, C, or G; Gen- Hunter). Real-time PCR, was performed in the Light Cycler 480 (Roche) using SYBR green (Roche) chemistry. The cycling conditions were; 1 cycle at 95°C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15s (denaturation), 58°C for 30s (annealing), and 72°C for 30s (extension). The fluorescence signal was captured at the end of each cycle using the SYBR channel (excitation wavelength 490-nm and emission wavelength 525-nm). Results expressed as target/reference ratios of each sample, normalized by the target/reference ratio of the calibrator. Here, the target/reference value of untreated/normal RAW macrophages was used as the calibrator and the GAPDH gene was used internal control/ reference to normalize the qRT-PCR in the experiments. The primers used for RT-PCR are mentioned in tabular form. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006646.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

At later stage of infection (36hr), a general decrease in all ER stress marker genes was observed however the value was higher compared to uninfected RAW cells.

The selected ER stress marker genes were found to be significantly upregulated with higher magnitude of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

<p>Phosphorylation of Akt may activate cascade of downstream molecules of the apoptotic pathway.

BAD protein is a member of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family which serves as an important regulator of apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref043">43</xref>].

<p>One of the important identification features of apoptosis in mammalian cells is the fragmentation of cell DNA in multiples of 180–200 bp.

<p>PERK mediated integrated endoplasmic reticulum stress response (IERSR) has a crucial role in redox homeostasis of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref045">45</xref>]. To investigate the effect of oxidative stress on PERK of RAW macrophages in co-relation with <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection, phosphorylation status of PERK was determined. Western blot analysis using phospho-PERK antibody against protein lysates of RAW macrophages exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> either untreated (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or pre-treated with GSK2606414 (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+GSK) or incubated with NAC (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+NAC) revealed that the PERK enzyme was phosphorylated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposed RAW cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g008">Fig 8A</xref>); however the level of phosphorylation found to be significantly decreased in GSK pre-treatment or NAC incubation as represented in densitometric analysis of western blot bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<list-item><p><bold>PERK phosphorylation regulates HO-1 expression and protects <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani-</italic>infected macrophages from oxidative stress</bold>.</p>
<p>PERK phosphorylation plays a critical role in protection against oxidative stress by promoting expression of HO-1, a fundamental anti-oxidative enzyme of eukaryotic system. During Leishmania infection, host PERK-ATF4-NRF2 mediated pathway regulates HO-1 expression to maintain redox balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref028">28</xref>]. To determine the effect PERK inhibition on <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infected host cells during oxidative exposure, GSK2606414 pre-treated or untreated infected RAW 267.4 macrophages (4hr) were exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and nitrite production as an indirect measure of nitric oxide (NO) levels was determined in cell supernatants. It was observed that NO level in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposed uninfected RAW cell (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> +RAW) was ~ 5 folds higher compared to infected RAW macrophages (UNS) but was ~2 folds higher in case of <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infected RAW (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> +LD+RAW) macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). However, the level of NO was maximum ~ 7.0 times higher in infected RAW cells pre-treated with GSK2606414 (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+LD+RAW+GSK). Uninfected RAW macrophages without any treatment were taken as control (UNS). Leishmania infection promotes expression of heme oxygenase (HO-1), a key antioxidant enzyme of host which facilitates parasite survival during oxidative burst to maintain redox homeostasis of host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref028">28</xref>]. We further determined the expression of HO-1in infected RAW267.4 under oxidative environment.

It was observed that the level of HO-1 was ~ 3.2 folds higher compared in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposed RAW (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+RAW) macrophages than normal untreated RAW cells (UNS). However in infected RAW macrophages (H2O2+LD+RAW) the level of was ~ 5.4 folds higher which results in lower NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). In GSK2606414 pre-treated infected RAW macrophages, a significant decreased level of HO-1 was observed; also reflected in higher NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).These data demonstrate that PERK phosphorylation mediated signaling pathway has an important role in the anti-oxidative cell response <italic>during L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection.</p></list-item>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Various intracellular parasites deploy different strategies for their survival inside host; however one thing common among them is delayed/resistance against induced apoptosis via wide range of agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref047">47</xref>]. Leishmaniasis disease is mainly contributed to the parasite ability to modulate host machinery to thrive the harsh phagolysosomal environment. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite deploy different strategies like; increases expression of host redox homeostasis enzymes like HO-1, SOD-1or catalase to sustain oxidative burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref015">15</xref>], delays host cell apoptosis via PI3K-Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref017">17</xref>], induces ER stress to escape cellular defence, increases expression of IFN1-b etc.</p>
<p>In accordance with previous findings, we observed that <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection induces ER stress in RAW macrophages and consecutively activates UPR of the host as the level of marker genes like ATF3, ATF4, sXBP1and CHOP were found upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). A similar trend of gene expression was observed in thapsigargin treated RAW macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), which further validated the observation. The magnitude of UPR induction during infection was comparatively lower than thapsigargin treatment which gradually decreases at later time points; might be a requirement for spread and progression of infection after successful establishment. Moreover, a general down regulation of gene expression at later stages of infection has been reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Akt mediated signalling pathway has its unique importance in apoptosis induction. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite, as a survival strategy delays the apoptotic induction in host macrophages via phosphorylation and activation of Akt molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref017">17</xref>]. ER stress also is capable of inducing Akt phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref023">23</xref>] which establishes a connection between UPR and PI3K-Akt pathway. In our studies, we observed Akt phosphorylation under apoptotic inducers exposure and <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Simultaneously, with Akt phosphorylation, PERK was also found phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) in infected macrophages. So the result bridges a connection between <italic>Leishmania</italic> infections, PERK mediated UPR activation and Akt pathway activation.</p>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> infection confers host cell resistance to apoptosis by modulating PI3K/Akt signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref017">17</xref>] which we also confirmed in our studies using campothecin as apoptotic inducer. As compared to uninfected RAW macrophages, <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection brings about phosphorylation of host Akt with low caspase-3 activity in infected RAW cells. The level of caspase-3 activity was found higher in uninfected RAW cells which indicates early onset of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The mRNA level of cIAP1 and cIAP2 during <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection was comparatively higher than under apoptotic inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g004">Fig 4</xref>) however; the induction was transient which decreases at later stages of infection. It has also been reported that at translational level both cIAP1 and cIAP2 protein continues to accumulate even at later stages and have key role in delayed apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>To further investigate the importance of PERK mediated UPR in <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infected macrophages in connection with delayed apoptosis of host macrophages; inhibition studies using GSK2606414 was performed. RAW macrophages pre-treated with GSK2606414 were infected with <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> promastigotes. After 4 hours post infection, infected RAW macrophages were exposed to campothecin or thapsigargin for apoptotic induction and the molecular mechanism involved in apoptosis was investigated.</p>
<p>The level of Akt phosphorylation was found to be decreased in case of GSK treated macrophages compared to untreated one under thapsigargin exposure signifies that UPR-dependent Akt activation requires PERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Similar results were obtained in case of campothecin exposure; hence it can be concluded that induction of Akt phosphorylation under apoptotic stimulus is mediated via PERK phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Akt activation is implicated in the regulation of IAP gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref034">34</xref>] and PERK regulates IAP expression in an Akt-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref023">23</xref>]. Similarly in GSK treated RAW macrophages, the level of cIAP1 and cIAP2 mRNAs was relatively in lower amount signifies that inhibition of host PERK hampers cIAP1 and cIAP2 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Following the consequence, Akt phosphorylation brings about deactivation of downstream BAD protein. BAD being a proapoptotic molecule forwards the apoptosis process. Akt phosphorylation further phosphorylates BAD protein which checks its activity by facilitating its binding with 14.3.3 protein. In our findings, we observed decreased phosphorylation of BAD in GSK2606414 pre-treated infected macrophages than infected RAW macrophages without GSK2606414 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Hence, PERK inhibition decreases infection induced BAD phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of BAD render it inactive whereas, unphosphorylated BAD alters mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to cytochrome C leakage from inner mitochondrial space to cytosol which in turn activates proteases i.e. caspase like protein. Campothecin being an apoptotic activator enhances the release of cytochrome C in RAW macrophages. In <italic>Leishmania</italic> infected RAW macrophages, a low level of released cytochrome C suggests that infected macrophages are more tolerant to apoptotic inducers however, PERK inhibition leads to increased cytochrome C release even in infected RAW cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>
<p>For further determination of apoptotic progression, caspase-3 activity in lysates of infected RAW macrophages was accessed after campothecin or thapsigargin treatment. In our studies, we confirm the delayed onset of apoptosis in <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infected RAW macrophages by interfering caspase-3 activity. However GSK2606414 treatment abolishes the effect of infection as higher caspase-3 activity was observed. In GSK pre-treated RAW macrophages, PERK inhibition alters the Akt mediated anti-apoptotic mechanism resulting higher caspase-3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Increased caspase-3 activity finally damage cell DNA to ensure apoptotic death of cell. DNA fragmentation analysis following campothecin treatment suggests that PERK inhibition leads to increased DNA damage even in infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from activation of caspase cascade, UPR induced Akt phosphorylation also regulates the level of cIAP mRNA in PERK dependent manner. In infected RAW cells, inhibition of PERK phosphorylation interferes with mRNA accumulation. A decreased cIAP1 and cIAP2 mRNA level due to initial inhibition of PERK; reflects the same controlling mechanism. Contrary to this, in <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infected RAW cells, an upregulated level of cIAP1 and cIAP2 mRNA was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Hence it can be extracted that parasite induces expression of IAP to delay apoptotic induction of host macrophages.</p>
<p>Increased level of released Cyt-C from mitochondria as a result of altered mitochondrial membrane potential; propagates the apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref050">50</xref>]. ROS is one of the important reasons which alter mitochondrial membrane potential and leads to increased leakage of Cyt-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref051">51</xref>] responsible for apoptotic induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006646.ref053">53</xref>]. Since PERK mediated signaling pathway has a distinct protective role against ROS; inhibition of the same resulted in increased NO level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Also, inhibition of oxidative stress induced PERK phosphorylation leads to higher apoptotic cell percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g009">Fig 9A</xref>) with less chances of survival of infected cells; hence decreased infection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p>
<p>So overall it can be concluded that inhibition of host PERK during <italic>L</italic>.<italic>donovani</italic> infection, hampers the parasite ability to induce ER stress mediated host Akt phosphorylation and consecutively the phosphorylation of host BAD protein; which in turn alters mitochondrial membrane, increases cytochrome C release and finally DNA fragmentation. Simultaneously, decrease in IAP production in RAW macrophages due to PERK inhibition leads to an early onset of apoptotic process which ultimately results in decreased the parasitic burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006646.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Leishmania infection induced UPR delays host macrophage apoptotic induction.</title>
<p>During infection and entry of parasite inside host macrophages; parasite induces UPR in host which is mediated via phosphorylation of host PERK. PERK phosphorylation in turn activates the Akt pathway by inducing phosphorylation of Akt molecule, BAD protein phosphorylation and checks the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-C. Low level of released cytochrome-C fails to activate the caspase-3 enzymes as a result decreased DNA fragmentation, hence no/delayed apoptotic induction of host. Simultaneously, PERK phosphorylation also induces the transcription of anti-apoptotic class of proteins (cIAP1 &amp; 2) which resist against apoptotic induction. However, inhibition of infection induced host PERK phosphorylation fails to activate this pathway and fates the host macrophage towards apoptosis. Also, PERK phosphorylation mediated UPR have a significant role in maintaining oxidative balance so parasite induced UPR might have a role in neutralizing host generated oxidative burst hence contributing to survival of Leishmania.</p>

<p>Hence, findings from this study will help in better understanding of host-parasite interaction in relation with UPR activated PERK mediated mechanism in providing host cell resistance against apoptosis. It will open a new therapeutic option for drug target.</p>

<title>Infection index at 4 hours.</title>
<p>RAW macrophages either thapsigargin exposed (LD+RAW+Thg) or GSK2606414 pre-treated or normal/ untreated RAW macrophages (LD+RAW) were infected with L. donovani in 10:1 MOI. After 4 h of infection, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa, and the infection index was calculated (percent L. donovani infected cells X number of amastigotes per cell). Uninfected RAW macrophages (RAW) were taken as control. (Significant difference * (P &lt; 0.05).</p>
