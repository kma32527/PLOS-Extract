<abstract>
<p>Chandipura Virus (CHPV), a negative-stranded RNA virus belonging to the <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> family, has been previously reported to bring neuronal apoptosis by activating several factors leading to neurodegeneration. Following virus infection of the central nervous system, microglia, the ontogenetic and functional equivalents of macrophages in somatic tissues gets activated and starts secreting chemokines, thereby recruiting peripheral leukocytes into the brain parenchyma. In the present study, we have systemically examined the effect of CHPV on microglia and the activation of cellular signalling pathways leading to chemokine expression upon CHPV infection. Protein and mRNA expression profiles of chemokine genes revealed that CHPV infection strongly induces the expression of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) in microglia. CHPV infection triggered the activation of signalling pathways mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including p38, JNK 1 and 2, and nuclear factor κB (NF-kappaB). CHPV-induced expression of CXCL10 and CCL5 was achieved by the activation of p38 and NF-kappaB pathways. Considering the important role of inflammation in neurodegeneration, we have targeted NF-kappaB using a newly synthesised natural product nitrosporeusine analogue and showed incapability of microglial supernatant of inducing apoptosis in neurons after treatment.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chandipura virus is a negatively stranded single RNA virus, which has claimed many lives in several outbreaks in India and Indian subcontinent. Our previous study shows CNS inflammation plays a vital role in inducing neurodegeneration post infection. In continuation to that our present study systematically examined the mechanism of microglial activation and function of NF-kappaB in CNS inflammation. We have shown that though CHPV infection is not productive in microglia, it leads to NF-kappaB activation that regulates secretion of cytokines and chemokines. The uncontrolled expression of inflammatory molecule disturbs the brain homeostasis leading to alteration of tight junction proteins that are an essential component in Blood-Brain Barrier. The expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 initiates peripheral leukocytes recruitment at the site of infection leading to aggravated inflammatory response, which has the deleterious effect on neurons. Our result shows nitrosporeusine targets microglial activation, and inhibits inflammation in in vitro as well as in vivo. The inhibition of inflammation has a protective effect on brain leading to enhance survival in mouse model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microglia, the developmental and functional equivalents of macrophages in somatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref001">1</xref>], exert a central role in a host defence and immune surveillance against infectious agents in the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref002">2</xref>]. Microglia being multitasking act as scavengers and antigen-presenting cells in the CNS, control the proliferation of astrocytes and produce soluble factors associated with an immunologic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref003">3</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref004">4</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, microglia exist in a quiescent state lacking many of the effector functions and receptor expression patterns observed in macrophages within other tissues. However, in response to pathogen infection in the brain, microglia readily transform into an activated state, acquiring numerous if not all of the macrophage properties required to launch effective immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref005">5</xref>]. During viral infection activated microglia respond through a highly regulated network of cytokines and chemokines, which subsequently recruits the peripheral leukocytes into the CNS and orchestrate a multicellular immune response against the infectious agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Leukocytes are recruited into the CNS involves a sequence of process that can be mediated by chemokines. Chemokines are low molecular- weight and structurally related signalling molecules that are divided into four subfamilies, designated C, CC, CXC, and CX3C chemokine ligands based on the positions of their cysteine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref006">6</xref>]. These molecules orchestrate efficient trafficking and recirculation of the leukocyte population within the blood vessels, lymph, lymphoid organs, and tissues, a necessary process during host immune surveillance and in acute and chronic inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref007">7</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref008">8</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that CNS-resident cells secrete various kinds of signalling chemokines upon injury or infection and that attracts peripheral leukocytes, such as lymphocytes, monocytes, transmigrate toward the chemokine gradient, breaching the blood-brain barrier, and gain access to the brain parenchyma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref009">9</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Most of the chemokines expression is regulated primarily at the level of transcription through activation of a definite set of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-kappaB) and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref010">10</xref>]. It has also been reported that signal transduction pathways mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, contribute to the activation of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref011">11</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref012">12</xref>]. Environmental stresses, such as bacterial endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines, osmotic shock, UV irradiation, and virus infections are reported to activate p38 and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref013">13</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>CHPV belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family has been a severe threat to the population in the Indian subcontinent, and several outbreak has claimed many lives for more than a decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref015">15</xref>]. It mainly infects children below 15 years and characterises influenza-like symptoms. It is a neurotropic virus that is transmitted majorly through sand flies, mosquito and ticks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref016">16</xref>]. There is no specific treatment available to date; symptomatic treatment involves the use of mannitol to reduce brain edema. Previous studies, as well as data available from our lab, shows the role of microglia secreted inflammatory molecules in neurodegeneration in CHPV infected mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref017">17</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref018">18</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we have systemically examined the effect of a Nitrosporeusine derivative (-)-25b, an anti-inflammatory molecule against CHPV infection. Compound (-)-25b is one of the optimised compounds from the library of analogues synthesised based on a natural product Nitrosporeusine alkaloid of marine origin and has found to be effective against LPS induced inflammation in the mouse. Here, we have used Nitrosporeusine analogue (-)-25b, which was found to show the best activity against CHPV infection. Previously, we have demonstrated the capability of virus-induced microglial supernatant in inducing neuronal death in HT22 cells as well as primary neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref017">17</xref>]. In this work we have targeted inflammation using nitrosporeusine analogue and showed the delayed survivability and disease progression post-CHPV infection. We also show that CHPV infection of microglia actively induces the gene expression and protein production of two chemokines, CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5). The activation of NF-kappaB and chemokines upregulation leads to infiltration of peripheral leukocytes and monocytes further deteriorating the condition. Furthermore, our data indicate that the CHPV-induced production of CXCL10 and CCL5 is positively and negatively regulated by the activation of cellular signalling pathways mediated by and NF-kappaB. Nitrosporeusine analogue (-)-25b directly or indirectly targets NF-kappaB activation, further inhibiting sequence of disease leading to the improved disease condition.</p>

<title>Virus and cell</title>
<p>CHPV (strain no. 1653514 isolated from the human patient in Nagpur, 2003) was propagated in Vero cell line. The virus was propagated in the Vero cell line, and viral titer was measured using plaque assay, which was found to be 3×10<sup>9</sup> pfu/ml. HT22 (immortalised mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line was gifted by Dr Shiv Kumar Sharma, National Brain Research Centre) cells were used for our experiment with prior permission from Dr Dave Schubert of Salk Institute from whom these cells were initially obtained. HT22 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 3.7%, Sodium bicarbonate (Sigma, USA), 10% FBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin(Sigma, USA).</p>

<title>Nitrosporeusine treatment</title>
<p>Nitrosporeusines A and B are two recently isolated marine natural products with a novel skeleton and exceptional biological profile. Our previous data suggest it as a potential candidate possessing anti-inflammatory property [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref020">20</xref>], so we planned and screened racemic as well as enantiopure forms. Preparation of several analogues followed the natural product synthesis, and all the synthesised compounds were evaluated for in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory potential. After extensive screening, an enantiomer (-)-25b was found to be most effective in CHPV induced inflammation. Animals were injected with 20mg/Kg body weight intraperitoneally.</p>

<title>Infection and treatment of cells</title>
<p>N9 microglial cells were used for experimental purpose. N9 cells were cultured in 10% serum containing media and were seeded in 60 mm plate at the density of 5×10<sup>5</sup>. After 12 hours the media was replaced by serum-free media to limit the growth rate of the cells so that a particular number of cells can be monitored for infection. Post 2 hours incubation N9 cells were infected with CHPV at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1 for 1 hours, and then cells were washed twice with 1X PBS to remove non-internalised virus present in media and then, nitrosporeusine (-)-25b was added at the concentration of 100μM.

<title>CHPV induced MAPKs activation regulates chemokine expression</title>
<p>A definite set of transcription factor governs chemokine expression.

Considering the importance of MAPKs in gene regulation and NF-kappaB in disease and pathogenesis we examined activation level of NF-kappaB, p38, and JNK. In order to assess the activation of MAPK signalling pathways in microglia during the course of CHPV infection, cells were mock infected or infected with CHPV, and Western blotting examined the degrees of phosphorylation. We found CHPV infection in microglia leads to activation of NF-kappaB, p38, JNK, and IKKα/β in N9 cells.

<p>We then moved to further validate the expression in brain samples. Mouse brain was processed for western blot, to check expression level of same genes as was in N9 cells. During early time of infection, brain protein shows increased expression of NF-kappaB, p38, IKKα/β and JNK in CHPV infected brain samples. Here also we found effectivity of (-)-25b and can significantly downregulate expression level of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<title>NF-kappaB inhibitor is effective against CHPV mediated inflammation</title>
<p>Analysis of the CHPV-induced expression of cytokines and chemokines in the presence of MAPK inhibitors have revealed that the p38 and JNK pathways are not dominant in the production of these chemokines, but NF-kappaB inhibitor severely reduces cytokines level. We used the specific inhibitor of p38 (SB239063), JNK (SP600125) and NF-kappaB at a concentration of 10μM to check chemokines and cytokines production. Our data suggest dexamethasone; a known NF-kappaB inhibitor is potent in blocking cytokines and chemokines level as compared to other two inhibitors. The p38 inhibitor was found to be effective against the production of CCL-2 only whereas JNK inhibitor was not impressive against cytokines and chemokines generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly, chemokine level was also found to decrease significantly in the dexamethasone-treated sample as compared to other inhibitors. This data suggest a critical role of NF-kappaB in CHPV mediated inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g006">Fig 6A &amp; 6B</xref>). Now we wanted to explore if viral infection is required for the microglial based inflammatory response or just virus interaction is sufficient to induce activation. We used UV inactivated virus and infected N9 cells, and followed by analysis of cytokines level using CBA. Our data reveal inactivated viruses are incapable of inducing cytokine level. We didn’t find any significant change in the level of TNF-a, CCL-2 and IL-6 in inactivated virus treated sample as compared to mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This data suggest active virus is required for microglial activation.</p>

<p>A). p38 (SB239063), JNK (SP600125), Dexamethasone (Dexa) an inhibitor of NF-kappaB was used at concentration of 10μm to check their effect on CHPV induced cytokines and chemokines production. CBA analysis of cytokines expression shows decrease in expression level in Dexa treated inhibitors whereas other inhibitors were not very effective. Though SB239063 showed significance decrease in CCL2, but was not effective in downregulating TNF-α and IL-6. B). Chemokine expression level was checked in presence of inhibitors. Dexa was found to be most effective in inhibiting chemokine expression. C) CBA was performed in presence of inactivated virus to asses if live virus is required for virus dependent inflammation. CBA data shows incapability of inactivated virus in inducing cytokine expression. D). Western blot experiment shows role of Akt phosphorylation in activation of NF-kappaB. The data shows treatment of PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) at 10μM inhibited p-Akt level and thus NF-kappaB was inhibited.</p>

<p>The next question asked was the pathway through which NF-kappaB gets activated. Several reports, shows the importance of Akt in NF-kappaB activation and Akt as a downstream molecule in NF-kappaB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref022">22</xref>]. Additionally it is also reported that PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in NF-kappaB dependent CCL5 secretion. We have demonstrated the role of p-Akt in activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in N9 cells. Using PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) at 10μM, which further inhibits Akt phosphorylation shows a decrease in NF-kappaB level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). This data shows inhibition PI3k/Akt signalling inhibits NF-kappaB activation, suggesting role of Akt pathway in CHPV induced NF-kappaB activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Microglia are resident immune effector cells within the CNS and are hence likely to get activated for encounter against infectious agents at very early stages of infection, as well as at later stages, when infiltration of peripheral leukocytes, such as lymphocytes and monocytes, are recruited into the brain parenchyma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref023">23</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref024">24</xref>]. Recruitment of leukocytes into the CNS is usually preceded by chemokine production from microglia and other CNS-resident cells, which is the first line of defence against infectious pathogens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref025">25</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref009">9</xref>]. CHPV replication is mainly limited to the neurons, and active replication has not been observed in any other resident cells of CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref026">26</xref>]. However, in vitro studies provide evidence for the onset of viral gene expression in glial cells, implying that although CHPV virions were taken up by glial cells, in which virus gene expression occurs, the production of virus progenies is impaired at the later stage of the viral replicative cycle.</p>
<p>In response to enhanced survivability and delayed disease progression post-CHPV infection, we have systemically examined the cellular response of microglia to CHPV infection, and the activation of cellular signalling pathways leading to an aggravated inflammatory response in these cell types. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by the microglial activation process bind to specific receptors of neurons that initiate the apoptotic mechanism in the cells. In order to validate the effect of nitrosporeusine through inhibition of inflammation, we analysed the cytokine and chemokine levels from the N9 cells as well as brain samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Following CHPV infection expression levels of TNF-a, CCL2 and IL-6 were found to increase that was previously implicated in playing decisive roles in encephalitis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref027">27</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref028">28</xref>] has decreased significantly after (-)-25b treatment. Regarding the cellular response of microglia to CHPV infection, we have observed expression of two chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL5, is notably induced in CHPV-infected microglia in N9 cells as well as in brain samples. Furthermore, the data obtained here exhibit that CHPV infection initiates activation of multiple signalling pathways mediated by NF-kappaB, p38, and JNK, in microglia and that viral gene expression is required for the activation of these signal-transducing molecules. Our data demonstrate NF-kappaB-dependent signal transduction is a critical process leading to the strong induction of CXCL10 and CCL5 expression in CHPV-infected microglia, and this signalling is indirectly augmented via the activation of the p38-mediated pathway. Our data also indicate that JNK, doesn’t contribute to the induction of CXCL10 expression and CCL5 expression as the inhibitor of JNK doesn’t reduce the expression level of chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The previous report demonstrated that the gene expression levels of chemokines, including CXCL10 and CCL5, in the CNS infected by Rabies virus are induced in the mononuclear cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref029">29</xref>]. Considering the strong chemotactic effects of CXCL10 and CCL5 on leukocytes, such as T cells and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref030">30</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref031">31</xref>], it is likely that the production of these chemokines is associated with the BBB breaching and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the CHPV-infected CNS. Though inflammation occurs, little information is available concerning the signalling of microglial activation and cascade of event occurs after CHPV infection in CNS. Our findings in the current study demonstrate the possibility that CNS-resident cells can produce CXCL10 and CCL5 via the recognition of CHPV infection. The data obtained here provide evidence for the CHPV-induced activation of intracellular signalling pathways in microglia. Recent extensive studies have indicated that microglia intrinsically produce CXCL10 and CCL5 upon infection with a variety of neurotropic viruses, including cytomegalovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref032">32</xref>], human immunodeficiency virus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref033">33</xref>], herpes simplex virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref034">34</xref>] Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref035">35</xref>], and Japanese encephalitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref036">36</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref037">37</xref>]. However, the precise role of cell signalling molecules, especially that of MAPK subfamilies, in the CHPV-induced expression of these chemokines in microglia has not been studied before. As for NF-kappaB signalling being responsible for CXCL10 expression, a recent report suggests that the induction of CXCL10 production adenovirus infection is mediated by the Akt activation pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref038">38</xref>]. The results obtained in the present study indicate that Akt phosphorylation is required for activation of NF-kappaB activation for CXCL10 expression in CHPV-infected microglia. Our findings are unique in that the activation of these MAPK pathways leading to CXCL10 and CCL5 expression is triggered at the step after virus entry because UV-inactivated CHPV virions failed to induce MAPK phosphorylation. It has been reported that p38, as well as PI3K/Akt is required for CCL5 production in astrocytes following infection with HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref039">39</xref>]. Our data suggest inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to inhibition of CCL5 expression and Akt phosphorylation is required for NF-kappaB activation suggesting the role of this axis in CCL5 and CXCL10 expression.</p>
<p>Leukocyte infiltration is preceded by chemokines expression. Leukocyte influx into the brain is a defining feature of viral encephalitis. It has long been assumed that leukocyte infiltration into the CNS is critical for virus clearance and recovery[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref040">40</xref>]. Alternatively, infiltrating leukocytes may paradoxically contribute to a more severe outcome that results from the destruction of neuronal cells. Chemokines are pivotal regulators of leukocyte trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref041">41</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref006">6</xref>]. In the context of CHPV infection, it is not clear the mechanism for induction of inflammation and chemokines are essential for the attraction of leukocytes into the CNS and what role they play during viral infection of the brain, or indeed what impact this has on encephalitis-associated morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>Our data shows CNS leukocyte recruitment, and aggravated inflammatory response modulate host immune responses, which in excess may otherwise contribute to virus-induced damage and mortality. Nitrosporeusine is newly synthesised drug acts as an anti-inflammatory agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref020">20</xref>]. In our case, we have found that nitrosporeusine treatment in animal significantly increases animal survivability and decreases disease progression in BALB/c mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006648.g001">Fig 1A &amp; 1B</xref>). The decrease in viral load, as well as caspase level, intrigued us to investigate the mechanism of action of this drug. Inflammatory mediators are known to induce neurodegeneration if produce uncontrollably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref019">19</xref>]. NF-kappaB is known to play a very crucial role in inflammation and also reported to get activated during viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref042">42</xref>],.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006648.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work defines the mechanism of CHPV induced microglia-mediated death in CNS. We have shown the activation of NF-kappaB in microglial cells post CHPV infection. This activation is required for secretion of deleterious chemokines and cytokine that plays a pivotal role in recruiting peripheral immune cells at the CNS, thus further aggravating the condition. We have shown the therapeutic role of nitrosporeusine analogues, in particular, enantiomer (-)-25b in CHPV infection. Our data suggest compound (-)-25b inhibits microglial NF-kappaB activation and hence inhibits chronic inflammation in the brain.</p>
