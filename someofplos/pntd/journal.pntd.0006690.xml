<abstract>
<p>African trypanosomiasis is caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, transmitted between mammals by the bite of a tsetse. It has been recently shown that parasites accumulate in large numbers in various organs and tissues, including the mouse testis. Whether parasites are protected from the immune system in the male reproductive organ or can be transmitted through sexual route remains unknown. Here we show that parasites can be detected by fine needle aspiration cytology of the male reproductive system in mice, and histopathological analysis revealed that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> accumulates in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue and fibrous tunics of the testis. No parasites were found in the lumen of intact epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis, indicating that the large majority of the parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites. In fact, these parasites are associated with marked inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and severe tissue damage and rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related with reduced fertility. Overall, we show that just like in the bloodstream and most other tissues, in the male reproductive organs, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> are exposed to a strong immune response. The detection of a very high number of parasites in this organ and its accessibility opens the possibility of using fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool in Animal African Trypanosomiasis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis in humans (sleeping sickness) and animals (nagana). In male animals, natural infection is commonly associated with decreased fertility but the causes for this condition remain poorly understood. Interestingly, in mouse experimental infections, parasites accumulate in the male reproductive organs. Here we show that these parasites are not protected by the tissues’ specialized barriers. As a result, parasites elicit a severe immune response that leads to parasite elimination, but also causes damage to the host tissues. This damage may be associated with reduced fertility in naturally infected animals and may also hinder treatment. Moreover, the presence of large numbers of parasites in an organ that is easily accessible by aspiration cytology could provide for a novel diagnostic tool in Animal African Trypanosomiasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref001">1</xref>]. HAT evolves through different clinical stages and often leads to death if left untreated. It is broadly characterized by an early/hemolymphatic stage and a late/encephalic stage. There are two sub-species that infect humans: <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> causes a chronic form of sleeping sickness and is endemic in West and Central parts of sub-Saharian Africa, accounting for approximately 97% of the cases; <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>rhodesiense</italic> causes a fulminant, acute disease and is mainly found in east Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref002">2</xref>]. Cattle are also affected by Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT, commonly known as nagana), which generally involves fever, emaciation and anemia, and which can be fatal if left untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref003">3</xref>]. In cattle, AAT is mainly caused by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>evansi</italic> also causes significant pathology, while <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> subspecies probably play a minor role. AAT is one of the most important infectious diseases that limit livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated cost in Eastern Africa of US$2.5 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> are mainly cyclically transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina species) in sub-Saharan Africa. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>evansi</italic> is transmitted mechanically by hematophagous biting flies of the genera <italic>Tabanus</italic> and <italic>Stomoxys</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref005">5</xref>], while <italic>T</italic>. <italic>equiperdum</italic> (which infects mainly horses and donkeys) is sexually transmitted. The evidence of sexual transmission among other trypanosome species remains scarce. A single case report of possible sexual transmission of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> in humans has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref006">6</xref>]. This type of transmission has been also observed in mice infected with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies in animal models of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection show that these parasites circulate in blood, lymph, and are present in the interstitial space of several organs and tissues, including adipose tissue, skin and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref012">12</xref>]; in these animal models, like in humans, eventually <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> parasites invade the central nervous system (CNS) and circulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref001">1</xref>]. Presence of replicating <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> parasites in the male reproductive organs has also been described in other animals (rats, guinea pigs and rabbits) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref013">13</xref>]. Recently, it was proposed that the accumulation of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> in the male reproductive organs could protect parasites from the immune system and from drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In the male reproductive system, spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules, in the testis, and their maturation is completed in the epididymis, where they are stored. In these two main organs of the male reproductive system, specialized tissue barriers maintain the sperm inaccessible to the immune system. The blood-testis barrier and the blood-epididymis barrier consist of tight-junctions between the cells that line the seminiferous tubules and epididymal ducts, blocking the migration of inflammatory cells into the lumen of the tubules and ducts and the migration of sperm and germ cells in the opposite sense, into the stroma of these tissues. This prevents meiotic and post-meiotic haploid cells from being recognized by the immune system as non-self, which is essential to avoid phagocytosis and elimination of spermatozoa and germ cells. A disruption of these barriers generates a foreign body reaction/granuloma and commonly leads to infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Reproductive organs are often affected during trypanosomiasis in both male and female animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref016">16</xref>]. In male animals infected with the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, testis show multiple lesions, including scrotal dermatitis, orchitis and periorchitis. Parasites invade several compartments of the genitalia, inducing a granulomatous inflammation, which results in poor quality semen. Animal infections by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>congolense</italic> are also associated with infertility but probably by a different mechanism, since in these infections inflammation of the genital organs is mild or absent, but there is progressive testicular degeneration that can result in atrophy and azoospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref017">17</xref>]. Reproductive health in men infected with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> or <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>rhodesiense</italic> is not so well documented.

<p>In this work we investigated the topographical distribution of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> in the male reproductive system of the mouse. Through morphological and molecular techniques, we found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> accumulates outside seminiferous tubules and epididymal ducts, in niches that are not protected by the blood-testis, nor blood-epididymis barriers. These niches showed severe inflammation that, at later stages of infection, was associated with disruption of both barriers. A possible consequence of this disruption could be the passage of parasites into the luminal compartments, with shedding of parasites in the semen, allowing for occasional transmission through sexual route.</p>

<title>Parasites can be detected by fine needle aspiration cytology</title>
<p>Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has long been used to diagnose reproductive pathology in man and animals. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into the external male reproductive organs and, upon gentle aspiration, cells are retrieved from all tissue compartments, smeared and visualized under a microscope. If <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> parasites accumulate in the reproductive organs of a mouse in high amounts, FNAC should allow us to detect parasites. To test this hypothesis, we performed FNAC of the testis in the well-established C57BL/6J mouse model infected with the pleomorphic clone AnTaT 1.1<sup>E</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref008">8</xref>] for 6, 9 and 17 days (parasitemia ranged from 1.13x10<sup>6</sup> to 9.3x10<sup>7</sup> parasites/mL). The procedure was repeated for each one of the paired organs. All smears showed parasites admixed with germ cells, spermatozoa, epithelial and inflammatory cells, at all time-points and for all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The total number of parasites per field was already very high at day 6, with an average of 20 trypanosomes per high-power field throughout infection.</p>

<p>Male reproductive organs consist of different compartments.

<p>On day 6 post-infection we detected numerous parasites in the epididymal adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), which is in fact an extension of the gonadal adipose tissue where trypanosomes were already seen to accumulate, corroborating that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infiltrates this tissue since very early in the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref008">8</xref>]. Many parasites were also found in the epididymis, and this accumulation increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Here, parasites were detected in the stroma (corresponding to the orange region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), but not inside the epididymal ducts (yellow region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g002">Fig 2B</xref>); and few parasites were also observed to infiltrate the tunica albuginea (the fibrous capsule that encloses the testis). Unlike a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref011">11</xref>], but consistent with observations in rats infected by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref022">22</xref>], we did not find parasites in the testis (neither inside nor outside the seminiferous tubules) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). On days 13, 20, 25 and 27 post-infection, the topography of parasite distribution was maintained, including the lack of infiltration of the testis. The only parasites occasionally observed in the testis were located inside blood vessels and solely at day 6 post-infection, corresponding to the highest peak of parasitemia.</p>
<p>It has been previously proposed that the blood-testis and the blood-epididymis barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref015">15</xref>] could protect trypanosomes residing in the male reproductive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref011">11</xref>]. If this was the case, we would have expected to find many parasites inside seminiferous tubules (in the testis) or epididymal ducts (epididymis). Given that we did not find trypanosomes in any of these compartments, our observations indicate that, in the male reproductive organs, most parasites reside outside the tissue’s specialized barriers and are therefore visible to the immune system.</p>
<p>To quantify parasite density at early and late stages of the infection we used trypanosome genomic DNA as a proxy of the number of parasites. Parasite density was quantified at days 6 and 27 post-infection in the epididymis and in the testis (comprising seminiferous tubules and supporting stroma, enclosed by the fibrous tunica) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In the testis, parasite density was very close to background level, supporting the histological observations. Epididymis had higher parasite density than testis, for both the early and late stages of infection (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05). As previously observed through histological and immunohistochemical analyses (IHC), in the epididymis parasite density increased 100-fold over time from 1.000 parasites/mg to 100.000 parasites/mg (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.001).</p>

<p>Overall, we conclude that the male reproductive system is an important site for accumulation of trypanosomes but, in our experimental setting, the testis had virtually no parasites. The great majority of parasites was located in the stroma of the epididymis and in the surrounding epididymal adipose tissue, hence not protected by the tissue’s specialized barriers.</p>

<title>Infection is associated with marked local inflammatory response and tissue damage</title>
<p>If parasites are not protected by blood-testis or blood-epididymis barriers, they should be targeted by an immune response. Indeed, in the histological analysis performed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) we observed a significant increase in cell density in the stromal compartment of the epididymis and of the epididymal adipose tissue mainly due to the infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells. To determine the nature of these inflammatory cells we performed immunohistochemistry for CD3 (T lymphocytes) and F4/80 (macrophages); and parasites were detected with two antibodies that recognize either the surface coat (anti-VSG serum) or a nuclear protein (anti-H2A serum).</p>
<p>Inflammatory cell infiltration in the epididymis was minimal at day 6 post-infection but increased as infection progressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006690.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), and at day 27 post-infection the stromal compartment was diffusely expanded by parasites associated with numerous macrophages and moderate numbers of T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Macrophages were also detected in the lumen of epididymal ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), indicating that the blood-epididymis barrier is disrupted late upon infection. This diffuse epididymitis was sometimes accompanied by multifocal rupture of the epididymal ducts, with release of spermatozoa into the stroma and formation of sperm granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This tissue damage consists on an auto-immune response that results from a lesion in the wall of the ducts, characterized by a central area containing degenerate spermatozoa rimmed by numerous inflammatory cells.</p>

<p>Although no parasites or significant histological changes had been observed in the testis, the stroma supporting the seminiferous tubules showed minimal to moderate infiltration by macrophages and T lymphocytes. This infiltration, especially the macrophages, increased as infection progressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006690.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). and at later stages of infection these cells could also be found in the lumen of the tubules, indicating that the blood-testis barrier has been disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>These data show that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection is associated with moderate to marked inflammation of the reproductive organs in male mice, both in tissues highly infiltrated by parasites, such as the epididymis and epididymal adipose tissue, but also in the testis, where no parasites were detected. Furthermore, we show that this inflammatory cell infiltration is associated with disruption of the blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers, at later stages of the infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Host inflammatory response is associated with damage to the parasite</title>
<p>While assessing parasite distribution and inflammatory cell infiltration, we observed that the staining pattern for VSG was initially (day 6) very sharp on the parasite, highlighting exclusively its elongated body, while on day 27 staining was diffuse in the epididymis stroma, with a granular to patchy pattern and without clear distinction of the parasite’s contour. H2A nuclear staining pattern was on the other hand maintained throughout the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). While this could be explained by an accumulation of shed VSG overtime, given that we observed a strong inflammatory response in the same compartments occupied by parasites, we hypothesized that the diffuse VSG staining could be due to parasites having lost their integrity as a result of the action of inflammatory cells. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed that parasites infiltrating the epididymis 27 days post-infection showed severe ultrastructural changes consistent with cell death, including loss of cytoplasmic content and microtubules, free nuclei, numerous cell debris and fragments of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref>). Also, in agreement with what we described above, the only parasites found in the testis were located inside blood vessels of the stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Altogether these results suggest that the inflammatory response that follows parasite infiltration of the epididymal stroma is somewhat effective in killing the parasites.</p>

<p><italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> parasites circulate in the blood and infiltrate the interstitial space of several tissues, including brain, adipose tissue, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref012">12</xref>]. Parasites have also been found in male reproductive organs, not only in mice, but also in goats and rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref020">20</xref>]. In this work we showed that parasites massively infiltrate the mouse male reproductive organs very early upon infection, that they are not located in immune privileged niches and that they are targeted by a strong inflammatory response. This immune response kills many parasites and causes damage of these tissues. The potential consequences in terms of fertility impairment, relapse after treatment and sexual transmission are discussed below.</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Parasites elicit an immune response</title>
<p>We show that, in the mouse, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection is associated with the accumulation of parasites in the male reproductive organs since at least day 6 post-infection. Epididymal adipose tissue and the stroma of the epididymis are the most parasitized, with the epididymis showing a temporal increase in parasite density that attain 10<sup>5</sup> parasites per mg of organ at late stages of the disease. This is very similar to what we previously found for the gonadal adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref008">8</xref>]. Few parasites also infiltrate the fibrous tunics that encloses the testis, but no trypanosomes were seen to infiltrate the testis <italic>per se</italic> (inside the seminiferous tubules or in their supporting stroma), opposed to what others have reported in a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection also in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref011">11</xref>]. The immunofluorescent assay might have misled the authors in the identification of testis, instead of epididymis, which are anyway very close compartments.</p>
<p>More importantly, in our experimental setting we did not find any <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> parasites in niches that are protected by the blood-testis barrier (lumen of seminiferous tubules) or the blood-epididymis barrier (lumen of epididymal ducts). We do not know whether a heavier parasite inoculum or a different parasite strain would influence parasite distribution in these organs, nor whether the use of more sensitive methods would be able to recover parasites from the luminal compartments of these organs.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that parasites in the male reproductive system could be protected from the hosts’ immune system by specialized tissue barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref010">10</xref>]. Our data do not support this hypothesis, since we observe not only massive parasite accumulation outside these niches, but also a very strong local immune response. This marked inflammation is associated with parasite death and significant local tissue damage. This inflammatory response may also hinder access of trypanocidal drugs to parasites and could contribute to disease relapse after treatment. These questions need to be further studied in the future.</p>

<title>Consequences for pathology: Infertility and sexual transmission</title>
<p>The presence of pathogens in the male reproductive organs is a major cause of male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref023">23</xref>], and trypanosome infection is not an exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref025">25</xref>]. Infertility is well documented in Animal African Trypanosomiasis, but less so in humans. Its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Both endocrine dysfunction (pituitary lesions, altered hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis) and local inflammation have been observed in a variety of infected hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref027">27</xref>]. Orchitis and epididymitis have been described in natural disease, both in man and animals (cattle, horses, sheep, goats and dogs), at late stages of the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we observed that, in a mouse infected by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, parasite infiltration of the male reproductive organs is associated with a diffuse and marked local inflammatory response, macrophage-rich (granulomatous epididymitis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4B</xref><bold>–</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">4D</xref>). Interestingly, inflammation was detected not only in sites highly infiltrated by parasites, such as the epididymal adipose tissue and epididymis stroma (i.e. epididymitis), but also, to a lesser extent, in sites where no parasites were detected, like the stroma of the testis, surrounding the seminiferous tubules (i.e. orchitis). It was also clear that this host response is somewhat effective in killing many parasites, since late upon infection inflammatory cells are associated with numerous parasite debris and trypanosomes with aberrant morphology (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g005">5</xref>). Diffuse, severe and bilateral lesions, like the ones observed here, usually have a clinical impact on fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref015">15</xref>]. Hence, although we cannot disprove other hypothesis, it is very likely that the mild orchitis and severe epididymitis described in this work could result in reduced fertility.</p>
<p>Chronic, degenerative and/or inflammatory processes that cause loss of epithelial and basement membrane integrity in the male reproductive tubular/ductal system will invariably expose sperm antigens to immune cells, resulting in sperm granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref026">26</xref>]. Granulomatous inflammatory reactions had been previously described in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection of sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref028">28</xref>]. Here, we not only observed these granulomas in the epididymis of infected mice, but also identified macrophages inside the lumen of seminiferous tubules and epididymal ducts, late upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006690.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). This entails a disruption of the blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers. Hence, although we did not find parasites in any of the normally immune-privileged compartments from days 6 to 27 post-infection, this barrier disruption in the epididymis could favor the passage of a few living trypanosomes into the tubules/ducts and, in theory, allow sexual transmission.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on sexual transmission of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> in animals. However, such route of transmission is common in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>equiperdum</italic>, and this has been described as a possibility for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> in one clinical case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref006">6</xref>] and in one study in laboratory mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref007">7</xref>]. It is intriguing how genetically-related Trypanosoma parasites can adopt strikingly distinct transmission modes. One could speculate whether devising alternative routes of transmission is an evolutionary trait of trypanosome species that show low parasitemia, like <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref007">7</xref>] or species that preferably invade the host’s tissues, like <italic>T</italic>. <italic>equiperdum</italic>. Direct transmission between mammalian hosts, without the need of an insect, would allow persistence of the infection in the population.</p>

<title>AAT diagnosis</title>
<p>Currently, AAT diagnosis can be performed by direct and indirect parasite detection. The gold standard for direct parasite detection in AAT is the microhematocrit centrifugation technique (mHCT), which consists on the microscopic observation of parasites in blood, concentrated by centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref030">30</xref>]. This test is easy to perform, but it has poor sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref031">31</xref>]. Indirect parasite detection methods include ELISA (which require sophisticated expensive equipment rarely available in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref032">32</xref>]) and rapid diagnostic tests (currently in test in Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref033">33</xref>]). One disadvantage of these immunodiagnostic tests is that they cannot distinguish between past an ongoing infections.</p>
<p>A direct test, easy to perform and with increased sensitivity could improve AAT diagnosis. In this study, we showed that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> accumulates in very high numbers in the mouse external reproductive organs, and we were able to successfully detect numerous parasites by fine needle aspiration cytology. We reasoned that, if this disease feature finds translation to livestock, as it does for goats and rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006690.ref020">20</xref>], fine needle aspiration cytology of the male reproductive organs could be added as a direct diagnostic tool in AAT.</p>
<p>In sum, we show that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> parasites accumulate in the male reproductive system but they are localized outside the tissues’ specialized barriers; as a result, parasites elicit a marked local inflammatory response, which leads to severe tissue damage. This effect could contribute to the clinically observed infertility, and to relapse after drug treatment. Although these barriers are disrupted at late stages of the infection, due to the severity of clinical disease at this stage, sexual transmission should be a rare event in a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection in mice. The presence of large numbers of parasites in a readily accessible anatomical location could potentially be used as a novel diagnostic tool in AAT, particularly in livestock. External reproductive organs of male cattle would be subject to FNAC, and the withdrawal fluid smeared, stained and observed under an optical microscope. Parasites can be identified by their unique morphology. Visualization of one or more parasites would be diagnostic for AAT.</p>
