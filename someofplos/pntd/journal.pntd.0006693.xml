<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus capable of causing long term debilitating joint and muscle pain at a great economic expense. Currently there are no licensed vaccines or treatment for CHIKV infection. We generated a modified version of the virus, termed CHIKV 37997-mCherry, stably expressing a fluorescent tag on the surface of the virus. To achieve this, a red fluorescent protein, mCherry, was fused to the virus envelope protein E2. Structural studies demonstrated the presence of mCherry on the virus surface. Infection of mice with CHIKV 37997-mCherry caused less severe disease in the animals compared to wild-type virus. Infection with CHIKV 37997-mCherry induced immune responses against both the mCherry protein and the virus. Furthermore, CHIKV 37997-mCherry is as attenuated as the vaccine strain CHIKV 181/clone 25 in different mouse models, causing less joint swelling and reduced persistence of viral genomes in tissue. Our work suggests that chimeric alphaviruses carrying foreign antigen on virus particles may serve as vaccines against both aphaviruses and other pathogens and diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted, enveloped positive stranded RNA virus that belongs to the <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. CHIKV infection causes an acute febrile illness typically accompanied by severe arthralgia, with relapses for weeks to months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref001">1</xref>]. In the past decade, CHIKV has spread from endemic areas of Africa and Asia to new populations in Europe and the Americas, making CHIKV a global threat and the most common alphavirus infecting humans. Millions of individuals were infected during the 2000s, resulting in thousands of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The CHIKV RNA genome encodes four nonstructural (nsP1 to nsP4) and five structural (C, E3, E2, 6K and E1) proteins. All five structural proteins are translated as a single polyprotein from which the capsid (C) protein is released via self-cleavage. The envelope polyprotein precursor (E3-E2-6K-E1) is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and processed by host signalase into E1, 6K and E3E2 polyprotein (p62). In the ER, E1 and p62 assemble into heterodimers and subsequently trimerize to form viral spikes. p62 is cleaved by host furin or furin-like proteases into E3 and E2 during trafficking through the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN). The mature CHIKV particles bud at the plasma membrane and have T = 4 quasi-icosahedral symmetry with 240 copies of the E1E2 heterodimer, assembled into 80 spikes on the viral surface; 240 copies of C form an icosahedral nucleocapsid core enclosing viral genomic RNA within the lipid membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref003">3</xref>]. E1 is a type II membrane fusion protein and sits at the base of the trimeric spike with E2 positioned on top of E1. The ectodomain of E1 consists of three domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref004">4</xref>]. Domain I links distal domain II and membrane proximal domain III. A fusion loop is situated at the distal end of E1 domain II, and is protected by domain B of E2, located at the distal end of E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref005">5</xref>]. After viral entry into target cells, the acidic environment of endosomes triggers conformational rearrangements within E2, leading to domain B dissociating from the fusion loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref006">6</xref>]. E1 then forms a homotrimer, further exposing the fusion loops of each monomer at the end of the trimeric complex for insertion into the host membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref007">7</xref>]. E3 limits the movement of E2 domain B until it is cleaved from E2 by furin or furin-like proteases to prevent accidental activation of the fusion peptide before the assembly and budding of mature virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref008">8</xref>]. Studies show alphaviruses can tolerate insertion of foreign antigens to N-terminal of E2 generating chimeric virus presenting foreign antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref011">11</xref>]. There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for CHIKV infection. We hypothesize that an attenuated CHIKV carrying foreign antigens may induce immune responses against both CHIKV and the foreign antigen.</p>
<p>In the current study, we report a replication-competent CHIKV with mCherry fused to the N-terminus of E2. The resulting chimeric virus presents mCherry on the virion surface in a repetitive pattern and induces strong antibody responses against both CHIKV and mCherry. The virus is attenuated <italic>in vivo</italic> and provides a safe research tool to study CHIKV virology, as well as demonstrating a useful vaccine platform.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Cell culture, viruses and proteins</title>
<p>Vero and BHK21 cells (ATCC CRL-1586 and CCL-10) were maintained at 37°C in a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, non-essential amino acids, and 10% FBS (Hyclone). The CHIKV 37997 and La Reunion (LR) strain virus clone was gift of S. Higgs (Kansas State University) and the CHIKV vaccine strain 181/clone 25 was gift of S. Weaver (University of Texas Medical Branch). Viruses were produced from infectious cDNA clones as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref013">13</xref>]. The mCherry gene was inserted between E3 and E2 after the furin cleavage site in CHIKV 37997 genome to make CHIKV 37993-mCherry cDNA clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref014">14</xref>]. mCherry protein fused with 6xHis-tag at the N-terminus was expressed in bacterial cells and affinity purified through Cobalt resins (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Vero cells were infected with CHIKV 37993-mCherry at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. At 8 h post infection, the cells were fixed and imaged with a Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-22 spinning disk confocal with a 561 nm laser.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Gel analysis of purified viruses</title>
<p>Purified viruses were subjected to electrophoresis with 4–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by Coomassie staining with SimpleBlue SafeStain (ThermoFisher Scientific) or Western blot analysis with rabbit polyclonal anti-CHIKV 181/25 (IBT Bioservices) and mouse monoclonal anti-mCherry (Sigma).</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Mouse studies</title>
<p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento, CA). <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref015">15</xref>], on a C57BL/6J background, were a gift from Dr. Michael Diamond (Washington University) and bred in house under specific-pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages (Innovive Inc., San Diego, CA). To study viral pathogenesis in wild type mice, three week-old C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with CHIKV subcutaneously in the left footpad with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of CHIKV in PBS supplemented with 1% heat inactivated FBS. Joint swelling was monitored via left and right foot measurements at the peritarsal region (width x height) using digital calipers. Sera were collected at day 3 after infection and rear ankles were collected at day 7 after infection. To study viral pathogenesis in a lethal mouse model, 6–8 week-old <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were inoculated with CHIKV subcutaneously in the left footpad with 10, 100 or 1,000 PFU of CHIKV in PBS supplemented with 1% heat inactivated FBS. Joint swelling was monitored via left and right foot measurements at the peritarsal region (width x height) using digital calipers, and mouse survival was monitored for at least 3 weeks. Immunization and challenge with CHIKV were performed by injection of virus subcutaneously in the left footpad. To immunize mice with mCherry, 8 week-old C57BL/6J mice were administered with purified mCherry protein via intraperitoneal injection. Mice were prime immunized with 100 μg of mCherry protein mixed with complete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by boosting with 50 μg of mCherry proteins mixed with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) 2 weeks later.</p>

<title>Generation of a replication-competent CHIKV with fluorescently labeled envelope glycoprotein</title>
<p>To make a fluorescently tagged CHIKV, we inserted DNA encoding mCherry into a cDNA clone immediately downstream of the furin cleavage site between E3 and E2 in CHIKV 37997 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). The resulting chimeric CHIKV 37997-mCherry virus was then produced as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref016">16</xref>]. In CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected cells, mCherry-E2 displayed a typical glycoprotein expression pattern: from Golgi apparatus to endosomes to the plasma membrane, and alphavirus-induced Env positive membrane extensions were observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Next, we compared viral growth curves of CHIKV 37997-mCherry with the parental CHIKV 37997 virus <italic>in vitro</italic>. Viruses released in the culture supernatants were quantified by viral RNA level measured by qRT-PCR and infectious particle number measured by plaque assay. In BHK21 cells, CHIKV 37997-mCherry demonstrated slightly slower growth kinetics compared to parental wild-type virus at early time points (before 12 hours post-infection), however no differences were seen at later time points (after 18 hours post-infection) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). CHIKV 37997-mCherry formed plaques similar to parental viral plaques (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>) and had a similar viral genome copy to PFU ratio (2.49 x 10<sup>3</sup>) as the parental CHIKV 37997 (2.75 x 10<sup>3</sup>). In gradient purified CHIKV 37997-mCherry virus E1 and capsid proteins were present at the expected size (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). The double bands that react with both anti-mCherry monoclonal antibody and anti-CHIKV polyclonal antibody are probably E3-mCherry-E2 precursor and mCherry-E2 fusion proteins. Insertion of mCherry between E3 and E2 might slow down the furin cleavage of E3 because the parental CHIKV 37997 virus contains very little uncleaved E3-E2 (p62) precursor. The smaller sizes of E3-mCherry-E2 and mCherry-E2 than expected may due to some glycosylation difference with mCherry insertion rather than truncation within the fusion protein as the viral RNA genome was intact in gradient purified CHIKV 37997-mCherry (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006693.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>At 28 days post-infection, in the chronic phase of CHIKV infection, persistent viral RNA in ankle tissues was compared (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). As we, and other researchers, have reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref020">20</xref>], CHIKV persists in both the ipsilateral and contralateral ankles after CHIKV 37997 infection. In contrast, viral RNA in the ankles on the contralateral side of CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice were not significantly higher than the assay limit of detection, and viral loads in ankles on the ipsilateral side were significantly lower than those in parental CHIKV 37997 infected mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). In vaccine strain CHIKV 181/25 infected mice viral loads varied extensively between individual mice in ankles of both sides (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>), consistent with the large variation of plasma viral load in CHIKV 181/25 infected mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g008">Fig 8B</xref></bold>). In some CHIKV 181/25 infected mice, virus replicated and persisted at high loads relative to those in CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice, although no statistical significant difference could be demonstrated between the two groups. Similar attenuation of CHIKV 37997-mCherry at a dose as high as 10<sup>6</sup> PFU was observed in 3-weeks old mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g009">Fig 9</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Infection with CHIKV 37997-mCherry induced a strong antibody response against mCherry</title>
<p>We observed presentation of mCherry on the surface of chimeric CHIKV 37997-mCherry in a repeating pattern with 240 copies of mCherry on each virion. Strong anti-CHIKV responses were induced by infection of CHIKV 37997-mCherry, so we next tested if strong antibody responses against mCherry could be induced by CHIKV 37997-mCherry. In adult mice, infection with 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of CHIKV 37997-mCherry induced high antibody responses against mCherry when assessed at day 14 post-infection and the high levels of antibody lasted for at least 34 days (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g010">Fig 10A</xref></bold>). Immunization with 100 μg of purified mCherry protein in complete Freud’s adjuvant induced antibodies against mCherry at more than 20 fold lower level than induced by CHIKV 37997-mCherry infection at day 14 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g010">Fig 10A</xref></bold>). Boosting with 50 μg of mCherry enhanced antibody responses to the level induced by CHIKV 37997-mCherry infection in only 2 of 7 mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g010">Fig 10A</xref></bold>). Interestingly, serum from mCherry immunized mice could neutralize CHIKV 37997-mCherry virus entry, although at a lower efficiency than the serum from CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g010">Fig 10B</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the results that the serum from CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected IFNαR-/- mice neutralized CHIKV 37997-mCherry at about a ~30-fold higher efficiency than the serum from CHIKV 181/25 infected IFNαR-/- mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g007">Fig 7C &amp; 7D</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CHIKV is the most common alphavirus infecting humans–with millions of individuals infected during the 2000s, resulting in thousands of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref002">2</xref>]. Currently there are no licensed vaccines or treatments for CHIKV infection. An attenuated live vaccine strain (CHIKV 181/25) was developed and reported to be safe, highly immunogenic and produced well-tolerated side effects in a phase II clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref023">23</xref>]. Two point mutations at I12 and R82 in the E2 glycoprotein of CHIKV 181/25 are responsible for its attenuation of acute disease in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref025">25</xref>]. Acquisition of R82 in E2 enhances the affinity of CHIKV 181/25 particles for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref026">26</xref>], which may limit the capacity of CHIKV to disseminate from early sites of primary replication <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref027">27</xref>]. A recent study reported that R82 in E2 also renders CHIKV 181/25 vulnerable to neutralization by antibodies targeting E2 domain B and therefore more likely to be cleared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref028">28</xref>]. In our study, CHIKV 37997-mCherry was more efficiently neutralized by serum from CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice than from CHIKV 181/25 infected mice <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g007">Fig 7</xref>)</bold>. This may explain the quick clearance of CHIKV 37997-mCherry in blood and ankle tissues <bold>(Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g008">8</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g009">9</xref>)</bold> and therefore the attenuation of CHIKV 37997-mCherry <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, we found antiserum against mCherry neutralized virus entry of CHIKV 37997-mCherry although at a lower efficiency than the antiserum raised in CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g010">Fig 10</xref>)</bold>. mCherry proteins displayed on the surface of CHIKV 37997-mCherry particle was not expected to mediate either the virus-receptor interaction or membrane fusion during virus entry. How anti-mCherry antibodies neutralize CHIKV 37997-mCherry warrants further studies. We can speculate that binding of antibodies to mCherry may limit the flexibility of E2 domain B and therefore prevent the activation of the fusion loop for virus entry. This additional neutralizing epitope and the presence of anti-mCherry antibodies provides the likely explanation for the ~30-fold more efficient neutralization of CHIKV 37997-mCherry by the antiserum raised in CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice compared to antiserum raised in CHIKV 181/25 infected mice, and therefore the attenuation of CHIKV 37997-mCherry <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g007">Fig 7</xref>)</bold>. Whether or not chimeric CHIKV virus carrying other foreign antigens is attenuated depends on whether the foreign antigens are presented as neutralizing epitopes.</p>
<p>Reversion of attenuating mutations was reported in CHIKV 181/25 infected wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref025">25</xref>]. The insertion of mCherry between E3 and E2 in CHIKV 37997 genome may not be so easy to revert compared to reversion of single amino acid mutation. This could explain the large variation of virus titers in blood and ankle tissues in mice infected with CHIKV 181/25 compared to consistent low virus titers in mice infected with CHIKV 37997-mCherry <bold>(Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g008">8</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g009">9</xref>)</bold>. Future studies on virus stability <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> tropism of CHIKV 37997-mCherry are needed to understand the dynamics of the virus populations.</p>
<p>On each chimeric CHIKV 37997-mCherry virion, 240 copies of mCherry are presented in a repetitive pattern between viral spikes <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g002">Fig 2</xref>)</bold>. The high density of mCherry can be easily recognized by B cells and, therefore, activate B cells efficiently. Consistently, a single infection of CHIKV 37997-mCherry induced long-lasting and high titer antibody responses against mCherry that can only be reached after boosting in mice conventionally immunized with mCherry proteins <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006693.g010">Fig 10</xref>)</bold>. Our results suggest that fusions to E2 may be a promising vaccine platform. Fusion of foreign antigens to E2 generates replication-competent chimeric virus able to present these antigens in a repetitive array on virion surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref010">10</xref>]. Live attenuated chimeric aphaviruses are able to induce strong antibody responses against the foreign antigen as well as anti-alphavirus response. Recently, a study was reported using CHIKV virus-like particles as a vaccine platform to present NANP repeats from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref011">11</xref>]. Similarly the dense array of NANP repeats on VLPs induced strong antibody responses that protected mice from malaria infection. In that study NANP repeats of 58 amino acid were inserted on E3 and E2 separately. In our study, a much larger antigen, mCherry (236 amino acid) was fused to E2 with little effect on E3 cleavage efficiency, which permits infectivity of the chimeric virus. Virus replication generates viral RNA replication intermediates and viral RNA that strongly activate host innate immune responses, which may explain the strong immunogenicity of our replication-competent chimeric virus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006693.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we report an attenuated mCherry tagged replication-competent CHIKV that may suggest an additional risk mitigation should an individual be accidentally infected. In addition our work suggests similar chimeric replication-competent alphaviruses can serve as vaccines against other pathogens and diseases, in addition to the chimeric VLP-based vaccines.</p>
