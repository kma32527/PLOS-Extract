<abstract>
<p>Snakebites are a major Collective Health problem worldwide. In Brazil, <italic>Bothrops jararaca</italic> snake venom (BjV) evokes hemostatic disturbances, bleeding manifestations, and redox status imbalance. Specific antivenom therapy, although efficacious to revert most snakebite-induced manifestations, is incapable of treating secondary manifestations, such as oxidative/nitrosative stress. Searching for new complementary therapies that could attenuate physiological derangements triggered by envenomation, we elected to test quercetin-3-rutinoside (rutin) by its potential as both a potent antioxidant and a hemostasis modulatory compound. The activity of rutin was evaluated both on the biological activities of crude BjV <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> by the ability of rutin (14.4 mg/kg b.w.) to modulate hematological, hemostatic and redox status markers altered by BjV injection (1.6 mg/kg b.w., s.c.) in mice. <italic>In vitro</italic>, rutin failed to inhibit BjV-induced platelet aggregation and biological activities of major BjV enzymes (metalloproteinases, phospholipases A<sub>2</sub>, serine proteases, and L-amino acid oxidases). On the other hand, rutin attenuated local hemorrhage, and the increase in reactive species, prevented the fall in RBC counts and fibrinogen levels, diminished tail bleeding and shortened prothrombin time (PT) evoked by envenomation. Furthermore, rutin reduced tissue factor (TF) activity and altered the protein expression of TF in liver, lungs, heart and skin. In conclusion, the disturbances in redox status and hemostatic system induced by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation were modulated by rutin, suggesting it has a great potential to be used as an ancillary therapeutic agent for snakebites.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Snakebite is a neglected disease and a major health issue in tropical countries. Bites by <italic>Bothrops</italic> snakes (jararacas) are frequent throughout South and Central Americas and usually lead to inflammatory and bleeding manifestations in patients, which may be highly severe in some cases. Antivenom therapy is highly effective and the only officially recommended treatment for snakebites, but it is well known that it is not quite effective in blocking various secondary complications. We reasoned that rutin–an easily available and inexpensive plant-based compound–would have the ability to favorably minimize venom-induced low circulating fibrinogen levels, low blood platelet counts, local hemorrhage, bleedings, and raised production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during jararaca envenomation. We observed that rutin had remarkably beneficial effects, much higher than we originally expected, in most of the evaluated tests, and such effect was apparently not due to inhibition of the snake venom. Therefore, our results indicate that rutin has a great potential as an ancillary drug in concert with antivenom therapy to treat snakebites, particularly in countries where antivenom availability is scarce. Although we studied the effects of rutin on an experimental model, and further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are necessary, our results are extraordinarily encouraging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, snakebites are considered a major public health issue, and, acknowledging that, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared snakebite envenomation as a neglected tropical disease. In Brazil, <italic>Bothrops</italic> snakes (lance-headed vipers) are responsible for approximately 20000 snakebites/year, and <italic>Bothrops jararaca</italic> is considered by WHO as a species of high medical importance since it causes numerous snakebites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Bothrops jararaca</italic> venom (BjV) is composed by a complex mixture of proteins, and most of them are grouped into the following families: snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMP), snake venom serine proteinases (SVSP), type-C lectins, phospholipases A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) and L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref003">3</xref>]. These proteins are responsible for the toxic activity of BjV, and evoke clinical disturbances in snakebite victims, such as intense inflammatory reactions (edema, local bleeding, and necrosis) at the site of the bite, and systemic bleeding (gingival bleeding, ecchymosis, petechiae, hematuria, epistaxis, and hemoptysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref004">4</xref>]. Furthermore, envenomation induces thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, consumptive coagulopathy, secondary fibrinolysis, a late mild fall in red blood cells (RBC) counts, and neutrophilic leukocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>A recent study of our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>] showed that rats injected with BjV displayed increased tissue factor (TF, NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001984.1) activity in plasma and tissues, and altered the protein expression of TF at the site of venom injection. TF is a 47-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that initiates the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, and is present in platelets, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and microparticles of these cells. In normal physiological conditions, TF is found on its encrypted (inactive) form. However, under pro-inflammatory circumstances and/or injury, TF is decrypted and rapidly initiates blood coagulation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref007">7</xref>]. Several mechanisms have been attributed to modulate TF function, and among them, the controversial regulatory activity of PDI, which is a thiol-isomerase and oxi-reductase chaperone that is required for thrombus formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and that has been reported to form an allosteric Cys<sub>186</sub>–Cys<sub>209</sub> disulfide bond in TF, which is essential to its coagulating activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Envenomation by different genera of snakes–e.g., <italic>Bothrops</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref010">10</xref>], <italic>Daboia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref011">11</xref>], <italic>Echis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref012">12</xref>], and <italic>Crotalus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref013">13</xref>]–have also been shown to evoke oxidative/nitrosative stress (ONS), characterized by an imbalance between the pro- and antioxidant systems. ONS may lead to extremely deleterious effects to living organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref010">10</xref>] and it has been associated with several pathophysiological conditions, including hematological disturbances and inflammatory reactions resulting in leukocyte activation. In fact, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) may induce apoptotic signaling in RBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref014">14</xref>] and platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref015">15</xref>], shortening their life span. During envenomation, the increase in reactive species has been attributed to both the ischemia-reperfusion tissue injury and the inflammatory reaction that occur following venom injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, snake venom PLA<sub>2</sub> and LAAO evoke lipid peroxidation and L-amino acid deamination, respectively, generating reactive species. Patients bitten by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> manifest ONS even one month after antivenom administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref010">10</xref>]. Although antivenom therapy is the recommended treatment for snakebites, it cannot directly block the secondary complications, such as reactive species generation, triggered directly or indirectly by venom toxins.</p>
<p>On that account, plant-based compounds are widely used in the treatment of several diseases, including those associated with ONS. Glycosides from quercetin group are remarkably abundant dietary flavonoids and display antioxidant action, such as metal ion chelation and reactive species scavenging, and block reactions and systems that generate reactive species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref017">17</xref>]. Besides these actions, rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside) binds to PDI, inhibiting its activity and, interestingly, the administration of rutin or isoquercetin has been shown to prevent thrombus formation in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref019">19</xref>]. However, if rutin administration also affects TF function or protein expression has never been evaluated.</p>
<p>Reasoning that the hemostatic disorders evoked by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation are multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref020">20</xref>], and that the concurrent imbalance in the redox status might be an additional mechanism to aggravate them, we hypothesized that ROS/RNS generation and TF encryption/decryption could be involved in the etiopathogenesis of hemostatic disorders during envenomation and might be mitigated by rutin administration. By using rutin, a potent antioxidant that controls thrombus growth and regulates ROS/RNS generation, we could address the link between generation of reactive species, TF decryption/encryption and hemostatic disturbances during <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation; in addition, we investigated whether rutin could be used as a putative ancillary treatment to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation. We show herein that rutin has various beneficial effects during <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation.</p>

<title>Action of rutin on the major venom enzymes and on platelet aggregation <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>To evaluate whether rutin directly inhibits SVMP, SVSP, LAAO and PLA<sub>2</sub> present in BjV, the following substrates were used, respectively: azocoll, DL-BAPNA, L-leucine, and soybean lecithin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref022">22</xref>]. The direct inhibition of the procoagulating activity of BjV by rutin was also tested in human and mouse plasmas, using the values of the minimum coagulant dose (MCD) for comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>]. Fixed concentrations of rutin (0.25 mg/mL for SVMP, SVSP and LAAO, and 1.25 mg/mL for PLA<sub>2</sub>) or two-fold serially diluted solutions (from 0.5625 to 9.0 mg/mL for MCD) of rutin were employed. BjV was two-fold serially diluted (from 0.0156 to 1 mg/mL for SVMP, SVSP, LAAO and MCD, or from 0.078 to 5.0 mg/mL for PLA<sub>2</sub>) and incubated with or without rutin for 30 min at 37°C. As positive controls for the inhibition of SVMP or SVSP, 13 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA or 8 mM AEBSF, respectively, was incubated with BjV for 1 h at 37°C. Results were expressed as the percentage of inhibition of the enzymatic activities by rutin.</p>
<p>To test if BjV-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by rutin, mouse blood (6 vol.) was collected from the caudal vena cava into ACD anticoagulant (1 vol.) (85 mM trisodium citrate, 71.4 mM citric acid, 111 mM dextrose, pH 6.2) and kept at 37°C. Thereafter 1 vol. of anticoagulated blood was gently homogenized with 2 vol. of washing solution [6 vol. of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, pH 7.4) to 1 vol of ACD], laid onto 1 mL of Histopaque 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and centrifuged at 700 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at room temperature.

Supernatants were discarded and the pellet of platelets was resuspended in DMEM/ACD/PGE<sub>1</sub>. Centrifugation and resuspension of platelets were carried out 2 more times and finally platelets were resuspended in DMEM, and platelet count was adjusted to 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> platelets/mL. Washed platelets were stimulated by BjV alone or BjV+rutin (final concentrations: BjV, 24.4 μg/mL and rutin, 220 μg/mL).

<title>Tail bleeding and local hemorrhage assays</title>
<p>Both tail bleeding and local hemorrhage were assessed in the same mice (5–11 mice/group). The tail bleeding assay was used to evaluate hemostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, and was evaluated by determining the volume of blood (hemoglobin) leaked after tail amputation; the hemorrhagic activity of venom was evaluated by measuring the area and color intensity of hemorrhage at the subcutaneous region surrounding the site of injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref031">31</xref>].

<title>Rutin does not inhibit BjV enzymes <italic>in vitro</italic> nor BjV-induced platelet aggregation <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>Rutin minimally interfered in the activity of SVMP, SVSP, PLA<sub>2</sub> and LAAO. Furthermore, the clotting activity of BjV–represented by MCD values in human and mouse plasmas–was similar in the presence or absence of rutin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As positive controls, Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, a SVMP inhibitor, inhibited 86% of the collagenolytic activity of SVMP, completely inhibited the clotting activity of BjV in mouse plasma and diminished the clotting activity of BjV by 3-fold in human plasma; on the other hand, AEBSF, an inhibitor of SVSP, decreased the catalytic activity of SVSP by 98.4%, and also blocked the coagulant capacity of BjV by 2-fold in human and mouse plasma. These data showed that rutin failed to inhibit SVMP, SVSP, PLA<sub>2</sub> and LAAO <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as the coagulant activities of BjV. The inhibitory activity of rutin on BjV-induced platelet aggregation was also tested <italic>ex vivo</italic>, showing that when rutin was incubated with washed platelet suspensions for 15 min and later stimulated with BjV, the same extent of platelet aggregation induced by BjV alone (approximately 60%) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). On the other hand, if BjV was incubated with rutin for 30 min, and both were added simultaneously to the platelet suspensions, platelet shape change was more prolonged, leading to a mild reduction in the extent of platelet aggregation (≈ 50%). These results indicated that rutin possibly bound to components in BjV important to induce platelet activation, however this fragile binding was rapidly broken in contact with platelets, so that platelet activation and aggregation occurred normally.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g003">Fig 3A</xref> for the DCF assay, in comparison with the saline group, a marked increase in ROS/RNS levels was observed following BjV injection from 3 to 24 h, but it was more evident at 3 h (p&lt; 0.05). Rutin tended to limit the rise in ROS/RNS levels in animals treated with BjV, particularly at 6 and 24 h, but the differences among BjV+saline and BjV+rutin groups were not statistically significant (p = 0.178 at 6 h and p = 0.238 at 24 h).

Rutin failed to restore TAC levels in the BjV+rutin group, even though it decreased ROS/RNS levels. Altogether, these data showed that BjV generated reactive species, particularly hydroxyl and peroxynitrite radicals detected by DCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref039">39</xref>], and decreased TAC levels.

<p>Pearson correlation coefficients and ROC curves between DCF or TAC, and hematological and biochemistry data evidenced that only platelet counts showed a statistically significant correlation with TAC (r = 0.429, p = 2.48 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, n = 72) or DCF (r = -0.352, p = 2.59 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, n = 71), implying that thrombocytopenia was mildly associated with ONS. In fact, the values of the area under the curve (AUC) for ROC curves between DCF (0.728 ± 0.063; cutoff 1.3) or TAC (0.618 ± 0.072; cutoff 1.1) and platelet counts were modestly high, and thereby they could not be considered good discriminators for the development of thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p>BjV induced a marked drop in fibrinogen levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), which tended to recover at 24 h (p&lt; 0.05). Interestingly, rutin prevented animals from fibrinogen consumption during envenomation, once no statistically significant differences were noticed between the BjV+rutin and saline groups over time (p = 0.935 at 3 h, p = 0.233 at 6 h, and p = 1.000 at 24 h). Once rutin blocked the drop in fibrinogen levels induced by BjV occurring as soon as 3 h after injection, we explored if rutin could attenuate other major hemostatic disturbances induced by BjV at this time period. No statistically significant correlation was noticed between DCF or TAC levels, and fibrinogen levels.</p>

<title>BjV induces TF activation in the acute phase of envenomation</title>
<p>Considering the hemostatic disturbances evoked by BjV at 3 h after the envenomation, we investigated what was occurring to the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade at this time period. As expected, 3 h after envenomation the BjV+saline group showed a prolongation of prothrombin time (&gt;300 s) (p&lt; 0.05), and despite the difference noticed between the BjV+rutin and saline control groups (p&lt; 0.05), rutin markedly shortened prothrombin time in comparison with BjV+saline group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Furthermore, increased TF activity (p&lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and unaltered TF antigen levels (p = 1.000, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) were noticed in the BjV+saline group, leading to a tendency towards the increase in TF activity/antigen ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006774.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). On the other hand, the BjV+rutin group displayed an increase in both the activity and antigen levels of TF (p&lt; 0.05), showing thereby a lower TF activity/antigen ratio compared with the BjV+saline group. Thus, these results indicate that envenomation triggered the coagulation cascade inducing not only the direct activation of coagulation factors, but also TF decryption, and that both factors possibly contribute to the consumptive coagulopathy. Rutin in turn failed to decrease TF activity in plasma, but, on the contrary, did augment the levels of TF antigen in envenomed animals. These findings demonstrated that rutin did not interfere in TF decryption, and favored the increase in TF levels in plasma. Nonetheless, and most importantly, rutin markedly reduced prothrombin time, suggesting that its beneficial activity was not associated with the modulatory activity of TF encryption/decryption.</p>

<p><italic>Bothrops jararaca</italic> venom displays pro-inflammatory, hemorrhagic and anti-hemostatic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref022">22</xref>] that elicit clinical manifestations in patients bitten by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> snakes. However, the mechanisms of action whereby clinical manifestations develop are not completely understood, as well as why some patients develop complications resulting from severe hemostatic disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref040">40</xref>] and from ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref010">10</xref>]. Herein we scrutinized the complex relationship between ONS and hemostatic disturbances, mainly related to TF, and the potential of a natural antioxidant, rutin, to be used as an ancillary treatment to snakebites.</p>
<p>Firstly, we investigated the effect of rutin on BjV, since both were pre-incubated prior to injection in mice. Rutin failed to directly inhibit the main protein families tested <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that it modulates the very pathophysiological events evoked by snake envenomation. BjV increased the levels of ROS/RNS and decreased the levels of antioxidants, which are features of redox status imbalance, in mice at least for 24 h, which are in agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref042">42</xref>]. Recently, ONS has been considered critical for the pathophysiology of snake envenomation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref045">45</xref>], and in one prospective study in human patients bitten by <italic>Bothrops</italic> snakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref010">10</xref>] the levels of oxidative stress markers were altered for long periods of time. Once the presence of ONS is an incipient observation in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> snake envenomation, the coexistence of the redox status imbalance and the development of hemostatic disturbances led us to wonder whether the former could be interfering or be associated with the latter, as reported elsewhere for other genus of snakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In mice, BjV induced various hemostatic and hematological disturbances. Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic manifestation in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation, and it is not due to the action of SVMP or SVSP, nor evoked by platelet consumption at the sites of hemorrhagic spots; moreover it is not directly associated with fibrinogen consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref023">23</xref>]. Although rutin inhibits platelet aggregation induced by physiological agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref018">18</xref>], our results evidence that rutin failed to directly inhibit BjV-induced platelet aggregation and to protect animals from platelet consumption. Additionally, even when redox status parameters were unaltered during envenomation, thrombocytopenia could be observed, indicating that thrombocytopenia is not directly caused by ONS during envenomation.</p>
<p>On the contrary, BjV-induced coagulopathy–characterized by fibrinogen consumption, secondary fibrinolysis, and moderate falls in levels of factor II and X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref023">23</xref>]–was drastically reduced by the use of rutin. Fibrinogen consumption is considered the primary cause of prolonged coagulation time in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>], and herein rutin prevented BjV-induced coagulopathy. In addition, SVMP-induced intravascular thrombin generation—by factor II and X activators—has a pivotal role in causing fibrinogen consumption during <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results confirmed that BjV induced an increase in TF activity in plasma in the acute phase of envenomation, possibly triggering the coagulation cascade and contributing thereby to the hemostatic disturbances. Interestingly, the alteration in TF in plasma was not due to an increase in TF antigen concentration, but to an increase in TF activity, suggesting TF decryption. Coagulant and non-hemorrhagic SVMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref047">47</xref>] might have a role in increasing TF by stimulating monocytes and endothelial cells, and in fact a coagulant SVMP has been shown to modulate TF activity in mononuclear cells <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref048">48</xref>]. Thus, our data demonstrate that the raise in circulating levels of TF activity is a remarkable response to BjV-induced systemic injury, possibly leading to true disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, even though there are snake venom enzymes that cause direct consumption coagulopathy, the contribution of TF activation has yet to be determined. Nonetheless, TF activation may be important to hemostatic complications resulting from snake envenomation, as recurrent coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia following antivenom therapy do occur, and may be due not exclusively to low doses of antivenom used in the treatment. It is however still unclear which mechanism is responsible for the activation of TF during envenomation and how important it is to consumptive coagulopathy. Considering that <italic>Bothrops</italic> snake venoms and their coagulant SVMP can up-regulate TF activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref048">48</xref>], and that rutin prevented coagulopathy, we investigated whether rutin was controlling TF activity. Our initial rationale by choosing rutin was its properties as an antioxidant, a direct inhibitor of thrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref049">49</xref>], and an antithrombotic drug that prevents thrombus formation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref019">19</xref>] by inhibiting extracellular and membrane-anchored PDI, an enzyme that modulates TF activity. Rutin administration failed to decrease TF activity in plasma, indicating that the amelioration induced by rutin in the coagulopathy of the envenomation is not due to a direct interference in the TF activity in blood stream. Furthermore, it was essential to elucidate whether BjV altered not only blood parameters, but also TF at the site of venom injection and systemically. Since TF is key player in hemostasis, we investigated their protein expression during the late phase of envenomation and how rutin would affect TF. In fact, BjV has been reported to alter TF protein expression in the skin during the acute phase of envenomation (up to 6h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref050">50</xref>], but herein we showed that BjV no longer induced TF alterations at 24 h. This seems a conservative approach by the organism to maintain hemostasis, since TF must be rigidly controlled to avoid systemic activation of coagulation. On the other hand, surprisingly, rutin not only controlled TF activity, particularly in lungs and heart, but also induced marked alterations in protein expression of endogenous and interest proteins.</p>
<p>By Western blotting, rutin itself modified PDI protein expression in liver, lungs, and heart when administered to naive animals (without BjV administration), and thus, we could not evaluate PDI importance during envenomation. However, rutin has various advantageous actions other than in PDI, such as in vascular tonus, endothelium metabolism, and inflammatory reaction, and altogether, independently of the mechanism of action, the current findings support the view that rutin protects animals from the consumptive coagulopathy. Thus, rutin seems a beneficial therapy to be used after <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation, although extrapolation of our findings to human patients deserve additional studies and the design of clinical trials.</p>
<p>It is well established that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation induces an acute inflammatory reaction, leading to neutrophilia. Although mice have a lower neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in blood circulation compared to humans, a mild rise in absolute neutrophil counts in mice, similar to that of human patients, was noticed at 3 h (equivalent to the mean admission time in human patients at the hospital) and at 6 h. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref051">51</xref>]. However, rutin <italic>per se</italic> also induced neutrophilia, which may be explained by its ability to reduce rolling, adhesion and transmigration of WBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref053">53</xref>], justifying the increase in the circulating pool of neutrophils in either the presence or absence of BjV. Therefore, rutin could be considered an anti-inflammatory drug, as it prevents neutrophils of committing themselves into the inflammatory reaction, and could be favorably used to diminish the systemic and local lesions resulting from envenomation. However, even though rutin showed the capacity to augment the circulating pool of neutrophils, they do not seem to be primarily implied in the inflammatory reaction induced by BjV, inasmuch as neutrophil depletion does not remarkably interfere in the natural course of the local inflammatory reaction and local hemorrhage induced by BjV in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref054">54</xref>]. Furthermore, in patients bitten by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> snakes, total and differential leukocyte counts do not differ drastically between mild, moderate and severe cases, whose classification depends on the extent and rate of spreading of local swelling at the site of bite, and the occurrence of bleeding and shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Local injury and bleeding are not exclusively caused by the proteolytic activity of snake venom enzymes, but they also emerge from inflammatory events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref055">55</xref>]. Blood platelets continuously survey vascular integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref059">59</xref>], and the coexistence of thrombocytopenia and increased neutrophil migration into tissues during <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref061">61</xref>] might further contribute to blood leakage induced by hemorrhagic toxins and inflammatory mediators at the site of BjV administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref055">55</xref>]. In fact, platelet depletion increases local bleeding, but not edema formation, induced by BjV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref062">62</xref>]. Once local bleeding and petechiae development occurs early (&lt; 3h), platelet dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref020">20</xref>] and neutrophil transmigration are likely to have an important role to bleeding development after <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation, but further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also observed a mild fall in erythron values induced by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation at 24 h, which was also abrogated by rutin. In humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref005">5</xref>], this fall has been associated with local and systemic bleedings, which in turn is correlated with the hemostatic disturbance. In rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref023">23</xref>], such a fall in RBC was related to aforementioned mechanism and microangiopathic anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref023">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, our results do not support the view that mice also manifested intravascular hemolysis, however, the results confirm the occurrence of bleeding and hemorrhage in the envenomation, which in turn were mitigated by the use of rutin.</p>
<p>Several studies have reported the use of plant-based or natural antioxidants to inhibit snake venoms <italic>in vitro</italic> or to treat snake envenomation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref064">64</xref>]. In fact, the potential of rutin as an ancillary therapy and an anti-hemorrhagic compound was already described in <italic>Bothrops</italic> envenomation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref065">65</xref>], particularly in a pioneering study from Seba in 1949 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref066">66</xref>], which showed that rutin ingestion retarded or abrogated the development of local hemorrhage and inflammatory reactions induced by <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic> venom. Importantly, the administration of rutin to envenomed mice led to a tendency to decrease ROS/RNS levels and increase the antioxidant capacity, which is in accordance with its potent activities of scavenging and neutralizing reactive species, and chelating metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref068">68</xref>]. Other beneficial effects reported for rutin, which could alleviate the inflammatory manifestations provoked by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> bites include its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref070">70</xref>].</p>
<p>A limitation of the current manuscript has been not to investigate the activity of rutin when administered after envenomation or concomitantly with <italic>Bothrops</italic> antivenom. Future studies will certainly focus on its therapeutic use after the venom has initiated the cascade of pathophysiological events, and investigate by which mechanistic action rutin preponderantly inhibits coagulopathy. Using antivenom associated with rutin will be a proof of concept to demonstrate that rutin is really effective in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, important impairments of hemostasis, blood cells and redox status were observed during <italic>B</italic>. <italic>jararaca</italic> envenomation. Rutin successfully prevented the development of consumptive coagulopathy, bleeding and local hemorrhage, but failed to mitigate thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, rutin decreased the levels of reactive species and blocked the fall in RBC counts. In lungs and heart, rutin altered TF protein expression and activity. Our results demonstrated that rutin ameliorated coagulation disorders, as well as secondary complications not treated by the antivenom, thus indicating that rutin has indeed a great potential as an ancillary treatment for snakebites. In fact, clinical trials have already been using quercetin and its derivatives as an ancillary therapy to cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref074">74</xref>] and other illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref075">75</xref>], and high oral doses of quercetin (up to 1 g/ day during 12 weeks) showed no toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006774.ref076">76</xref>]. However, even if quercetin showed no toxicity, further studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms of action and putative side effects of rutin, particularly in humans, prior to evaluating its therapeutic use in snake envenomation.</p>
