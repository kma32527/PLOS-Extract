<abstract>
<p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the causative agent of Chagas disease, causes severe morbidity and mortality in afflicted individuals. About 30% of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected individuals present with cardiac, gastrointestinal tract, and/or neurological disorders. Megacolon, one of the major pathologies of Chagas disease, is accompanied by gastrointestinal motility disorders. The molecular mechanism of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-mediated megacolon in Chagas disease is currently unknown. To decipher the molecular mechanism of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-induced alteration in the colon during the early infection phase, we exposed primary human colonic epithelial cells (HCoEpiC) to invasive <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes at multiple time points to determine changes in the phosphoprotein networks in the cells following infection using proteome profiler Human phospho-kinase arrays. We found significant changes in the phosphorylation pattern that can mediate cellular deregulations in colonic epithelial cells after infection. We detected a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated heat shock protein (p-HSP) 27 and transcription factors that regulate various cellular functions, including c-Jun and CREB. Our study confirmed significant upregulation of phospho (p-) Akt S473, p-JNK, which may directly or indirectly modulate CREB and c-Jun phosphorylation, respectively. We also observed increased levels of phosphorylated CREB and c-Jun in the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that p-c-Jun and p-CREB co-localized in the nucleus at 180 minutes post infection, with a maximum Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76±0.02. Increased p-c-Jun and p-CREB have been linked to inflammatory and profibrotic responses. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of HCoEpiC induces an increased expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), which is fibrogenic at elevated levels. We also found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection modulates the expression of NF-kB and JAK2-STAT1 signaling molecules which can increase pro-inflammatory flux. Bioinformatics analysis of the phosphoprotein networks derived using the phospho-protein data serves as a blueprint for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-mediated cellular transformation of primary human colonic cells during the early phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is a hemoflagellate that is now considered a global health threat in all industrialized regions of the world. Some chagasic patients present with digestive, neurological, and/or cardiac disorders. The mechanisms of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-induced pathology remain to be elucidated. In this study, we challenged primary human colonic epithelial cells with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> and evaluated changes in the phosphorylated kinases and phosphoprotein levels that may induce cellular and molecular alterations leading to cellular transformations during the early phase of infection. The parasite induced significant increases in levels of phosphorylated kinases and phosphoproteins that govern multiple cellular pathways associated with immunological, stress, neuronal, and intercellular interactions as well as fibrogenic responses. The parasite also enhanced the levels of p-AKT, p-HSP27, p-JNK, and downstream transcription factors like p-c-Jun and p-CREB during the early infection phase. Additionally, we observed that the phosphorylated transcription factors are translocated to and colocalized in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. These transcription factors regulate the expression of genes, including genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, which play a role in the onset of colon pathology observed in some chagasic patients. Our study provides novel insights into the interactome that occurs during acute phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of primary human colon cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease which causes severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. Originally endemic in South American countries where it still constitutes a severe socioeconomic burden, Chagas disease has spread around the world and become a global health crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref002">2</xref>]. Currently, the disease is present in all major economically advanced countries due to modern globalization and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref003">3</xref>]. As many as 30% of afflicted individuals eventually present with cardiac, gastrointestinal tract and/or neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref004">4</xref>]. The development of megacolon, as one of the pathologies of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection, is usually accompanied by unwanted changes in gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility which is thought to be due to decrease in the efficiency of the enteric nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref006">6</xref>]. GI motility disorders have been attributed to alterations in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal and enteric nervous system defects. Although it is generally agreed that the enteric neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref008">8</xref>] and interstitial cells of Cajal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref009">9</xref>] decrease in numbers in megacolon, it is unclear what roles they play in the pathophysiology of chagasic megacolon. The presence of more natural killer and cytotoxic T-cells in colon lesions from patients with megacolon suggest that immune responses also play a role in the neuronal loss in chagasic megacolon patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref006">6</xref>]. A study using a murine model of chagasic megacolon showed that megacolon was accompanied by increases in colon wall thickness, hypertrophy, and collagen deposition, which are hallmarks of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref007">7</xref>]. This report correlates with others showing an increase in fibrotic lesions in smooth muscle and myenteric plexus of chagasic megacolon tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref008">8</xref>]. The fibrotic lesions observed in megacolon tissue sections can be caused by increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and matricellular proteins including TSP-1. The interactions between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> and colon cells including colon epithelium cells can deregulate cell signaling pathways leading to increased expression of transcription factors that upregulate the synthesis of ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref011">11</xref>] causing fibrogenesis and cellular transformation reported in megacolon tissue sections. The role played by colon epithelium in the onset of chagasic megacolon remains unknown.</p>
<p>To understand the pathogenesis of chagasic megacolon, researchers will need to study the role of parasite-induced signaling molecules including cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophic factors in mediating signal transfer within and among colon cells. Currently, studies elucidating parasite-induced changes in colon cells involved in the onset and development of chagasic megacolon is lacking. The fact that there have been reports of Chagas disease outbreaks caused by consumption of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> contaminated foods where the infected individuals presented with clinical manifestations comparable to those infected via other types of transmission routes shows that the parasite can infect intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, murine experimental <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infections have been established using oral cavity and gastrointestinal gavage inoculation routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref014">14</xref>]. We hypothesize that the molecular interactions between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> and colon epithelium will deregulate cell signaling cascades, leading to an increase in active transcription factors that can cause increased deposition of matrix proteins, fibrogenesis, loss of colon elasticity and eventually megacolon pathology.</p>
<p>To delineate the molecular mechanisms of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-induced changes in colon epithelium during the early stage of infection, we challenged primary human colonic epithelial cells with invasive <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes. This infection model closely mimics the physiological state and changes in host phospho-proteome profile induced by the parasite are essential in understanding parasite mediated pathology.</p>
<p>A predominance of megacolon pathology was reported in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infected individuals from Chile, which is the origin of the Tulahuen strain, suggesting a colon tropism for the strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref015">15</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> Tulahuen strain has been shown to generate experimental murine Chagas disease infection through the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref014">14</xref>]. In our study, we show that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> Tulahuen trypomastigotes induce significant changes in phosphorylation patterns of a variety of signaling proteins and transcription factors including c-Jun and CREB during the early phase of cellular infection. We also observed that these phosphorylated transcription factors are translocated and colocalized in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner.

<title>Human phospho-kinase antibody array</title>
<p>To analyze the phosphorylation profiles of kinases and their protein substrates in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected primary colon cells, we used a commercially available human phospho-kinase array kit following the manufacturer's protocol (R&amp;D Systems). This is a membrane-based sandwich immunoassay kit where the capture antibodies against 43 kinase phosphorylation sites, two other proteins and control proteins are spotted in duplicates on nitrocellulose membranes to bind specific target proteins present in the cell lysates (Product Datasheet ARY003B, R&amp;D Systems). Briefly, blocked array membranes were incubated with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infected and the same time points uninfected cell protein lysates, and with the same amount of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes protein lysate (~250µg), at 4°C overnight on a platform shaker. Washed membranes were further incubated with biotinylated antibody cocktails for 2h at room temperature on a rocking platform. The membranes were washed, probed with streptavidin-HRP and visualized by chemiluminescence using X-ray films. The films were scanned, and the density of each spot was quantified against the average of the internal controls as recommended by the manufacturers (R&amp;D Systems). Densitometric data analyses were done using the free Image J software available on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p>

The membranes were stained with Ponceau S staining solution (#P7170, Sigma Aldrich) to verify protein transfer. The membranes were washed and blocked with blocking buffer (1X TBS pH 7.4, 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were incubated with the respective phospho-primary antibodies in antibody buffer (1X TBS pH 7.4, 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20) at 4°C overnight. The blots were washed to remove excess antibodies, probed with the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, visualized by chemiluminescence, and scanned.

<title>Mapping of biological pathway interactions</title>
<p>The functional analysis of biological pathways of altered phosphoproteins were elucidated using bioinformatics approach. Protein annotation was done using GENECARDS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.genecards.org</ext-link>) and DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.ncifcrf.gov" xlink:type="simple">david.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>) to find common reference and to achieve de-aliasing. Biological Pathways were constructed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Path Explorer (IPA, QIAGEN). Significantly enriched canonical pathways were determined using Fisher’s Exact test for enrichment. Significantly enriched canonical pathways constructed by IPA were grouped into five meta-level categories: 1) immunological response, 2) fibrotic extracellular signaling, 3) neuronal response, 4) intracellular signaling, and 5) stress associated response. Visualization of proteins to pathway group mapping was done using table2net (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/table2net/" xlink:type="simple">http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/table2net/</ext-link>) for graph file parsing and formatting followed by Gephi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gephi.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://gephi.org/</ext-link>) for visualization.</p>

<title>The unique phosphoproteomic pathway signature during the early phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection</title>
<p>To gain insight into the early regulation of phosphoproteins and their associated signaling cascades mediated by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigote infection in colonic epithelial cells, we utilized the human phospho-kinase array. We challenged HCoEpiC with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> for different lengths of time (0, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes) and analyzed the protein phosphorylation profiles following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006792.s003">S1 Table</xref>). The time intervals selected were adequate to accommodate important downstream phosphorylation patterns. We also analyzed the protein phosphorylation profiles of HCoEpiC in the starved condition in the absence of parasites at the same time points. The phosphorylation profile of the 43 kinase phosphorylation sites was conserved over time in uninfected cells and did not affect the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> induced phosphorylation pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006792.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006792.s004">S2 Table</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed no cross reactivity on the membranes using the same amount of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigote lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

We found that during the early phase of infection, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection significantly altered the phosphorylation pattern of 21 kinase phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006792.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Our interest here is to group and map the altered phosphoproteins based on their functional role; including fibrosis, neurological signaling, and immune signaling among others. We employed bioinformatics analyses to determine the deregulated pathways associated with modulated phosphoproteins. Our analyses uncovered several phosphoproteins that are involved with cellular transformation pathways as well as other functional pathways associated with proinflammatory responses and several disease pathogenesis pathways. Specifically, we found that the parasite activated the JNK and c-Jun signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and CREB associated signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The level of p-c-Jun was significantly increased by 2.4±0.06 fold at the 120-minutes but it is 1.7±0.02 at 180 minutes compared to control. Phosphorylation of JNK2, a known upstream molecule of c-Jun, was also upregulated during infection. The phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB was significantly increased by at least two-fold compared to the control. This was accompanied by a significant increase in the phosphorylated levels of HSP27, as well as kinases Src, Akt S473 and Fyn at different time points. The levels of p-Akt T308 and p-RSK were not significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylated levels of several proteins including ERK1/2, p27, TOR and STAT5A were downregulated at differing time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006792.s003">S1 Table</xref>).

<title>Early <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection increases p-CREB in colonic epithelial cells</title>
<p>The phosphoproteomic array revealed the upregulation of p-CREB in the host cells. The array data also showed that the phosphorylated levels of Akt S473 and HSP27 were significantly upregulated. We found that the level of pHSP27 was increased more than two-fold at 120 and 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Our western blot data showed that the phosphorylated level of Akt T308 was increased to 1.34±0.03 fold at 120 minutes and then decreased to 1.27±0.01 fold at 180 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title><italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> elevates the activation signals of pro-inflammatory responses</title>
<p>The phosphoproteome data analysis and the bioinformatics analysis of network interactions revealed that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. We are particularly interested in JNK signaling, a pathway that is well-known to be activated by external stimuli but has yet to be explored in Chagas disease progression. Phosphorylation of c-Jun, which is downstream of JNK signaling, can mediate cellular transformations implicated in many severe disease states. Our phospho-array data showed significant increases in the level of phosphorylated JNK and c-JunS63 in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected colonic cells. We evaluated the levels of phosphorylated JNK and c-JunS73 (not present in the array) at various time points by western blot analysis using lysates of colonic epithelial cells challenged with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>. Our immunoblot data showed that the level of phosphorylated JNK, an upstream molecule of c-Jun, was upregulated by 1.24±0.02 fold at 180 minutes compared to uninfected control colonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The level of p-c-JunS73 was also upregulated at 90, 120 and 180 minutes compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Hence, the western blot results match with the phospho-array data. To evaluate whether <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection in these cells lead to changes in the expression of c-Jun target genes, we analyzed the level of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) protein in the infected cells at the different time points. We observed that the level of TSP-1 protein increases with the infection of HCoEpiC up to a maximum of 2.78±0.05 fold at 180 minutes compared to uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) indicating that the expression of TSP-1 protein is increased during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of colon epithelial cells. To confirm this, we preincubated the cells with SP600125 (100µM), a pharmacological inhibitor of the JNK-c-Jun pathway and observed a decrease in p-JNK and p-c-Jun (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006792.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The amount of downstream TSP-1 in the cells pretreated with the inhibitor was significantly decreased in the presence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). In order to evaluate the kinetics of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> induced proinflammatory responses in HCoEpiC, we investigated the regulation of NF-kB associated signaling molecules in <italic>T cruzi</italic> infected HCoEpiC. We found that the p-p65 level was increased up to a maximum of 2.48±0.04 at 180 minutes compared to uninfected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). The level of p-IKKα/β was significantly increased to a maximum of 1.91±0.02 at 90 minutes with a corresponding decrease in IKKα levels to a minimum of 0.59±0.05 at 180 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed p-TAK1 and p-IRAK4, upstream regulators of NF- kB pathway. We observed that p-TAK1 was increased to a maximum of 2.30±0.08 at 60 minutes and p-IRAK4 was upregulated by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection to a maximum of 1.43±0.07 at 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). We also evaluated the levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT1, signaling molecules that play roles in the regulation of interferon signaling pathway. We observed that levels of p-JAK2 increased to a maximum of 1.73±0.07 at 180 minutes and that of p-STAT1 increased to a maximum of 2.21±0.11 at 120 minutes in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infected HCoEpiC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Phospho-CREB and p-c-Jun are translocated to the nucleus during the early phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection</title>
<p>Our phospho-array data showed that p-c-Jun and p-CREB were significantly upregulated in colonic cells during the early phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. These increase in the phosphorylation of several key proteins was validated by immunoblot assays. To understand the importance of upregulated p-CREB and p-c-Jun in colonic epithelial cells during early <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection, we performed immunofluorescence assays to evaluate nuclear translocation and colocalization of both transcription factors. To do this, we measured the localization of each phosphoprotein using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Our data showed that p-CREB was translocated to the nucleus. Specifically, the nuclear translocation of p-CREB significantly increased over time to a maximum of 112.6±10.9 MFI at 180 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). We also performed immunofluorescence assays to evaluate the nuclear translocation of p-c-JunS73. Our results show nuclear staining of this phosphoprotein during early phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. We found that the nuclear localization of p-c-JunS73 significantly increased over time to a maximum of 123.2±7.5 MFI at 180 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chagasic megacolon is a major pathology associated with severe morbidity and mortality in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected patients. The molecular mechanisms that cause megacolon in Chagasic patients remains largely undefined. Primary colonic epithelial cells constitute a good model for studying the mechanisms of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of colon cells. We found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> can infect colonic epithelial cells with more than 80% cellular infection after 72h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We hypothesize that during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection, the parasite deregulates host signal transduction and eventually the gene transcription profiles to cause symptoms associated with Chagas disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref019">19</xref>]. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-induced molecular alterations in colon cells, we challenged primary human colonic epithelial cells with invasive <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes for various lengths of time (0, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes) to evaluate the pattern of altered phosphoproteins after infection using phospho-proteomic arrays and the mapping of biological network interactions. Analyzing the phosphorylation profiles of kinases and their protein substrates is essential for understanding how cells recognize and respond to the presence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> in their micro-environment. Normal cellular activities in colon cells are highly susceptible to alterations following exposure to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes. The analysis of phosphorylation profiles of kinases and their respective protein substrates may facilitate our understanding of the cellular response mediated by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes in host colonic cells. In the present study, our goal was to decipher the phospho-signaling pathways that operate during early <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection in human colonic epithelial cells. We investigated the phosphorylation activity of several axes of signaling cascades that may mediate <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-induced colon pathology. Our results showed that the parasite significantly altered the pattern of phosphorylated kinases and phosphoprotein levels during infection. Specifically, we found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> deregulated the phosphorylated levels of 21 kinase phosphorylation sites, in the infected cells at different time points compared to uninfected controls. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that these phosphoproteins can be mapped to a variety of signaling pathways including those involved in neuronal, inflammatory, and fibrotic responses. Currently, it has been proposed that intense degenerative inflammatory changes occur in chagasic megacolon tissues, accompanied by increased collagen deposition and fibrosis. These changes are thought to mediate neuronal damage as well as intramuscular denervation, leading to chagasic megacolon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref007">7</xref>]. The bioinformatics network developed in our study revealed significant alterations in the phosphoproteome associated with the signaling pathways that may cause the colon pathology observed in chagasic patients. The altered phosphoproteins we observed in our study have been reported to play a role in cellular pathways that can cause tissue fibrosis, neuronal damages, and negative immunological responses. The upregulated phosphoproteins involved in neurological and inflammatory pathways can damage colonic myenteric neurons during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref020">20</xref>]. Bioinformatics analysis of array data also showed an overall increase in the proinflammatory response in HCoEpiC during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. Hence, we further analyzed the associated proinflammatory pathways and found that NF-kB and JAK2-STAT1 pathways are activated by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. The increased level of NF-kB (p-NF-kB, p-IKKα/β, p-TAK1 and p-IRAK4) revealed the high probability of activation of Toll like receptors by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of HCoEpiC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref021">21</xref>]. The upregulated level of JAK2-STAT1 pathway in HCoEpiC also correlates with the activation of interferon signaling pathway during <italic>T cruzi</italic> infection. Our observation complements previous studies suggesting the activation of NF-kB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Some of the phosphoproteins modulated in array during the infection, including p-c-Jun, have been correlated with increased expression of TSP-1. Previous reports show that the transcription factor c-Jun enhances TSP-1 promoter activity resulting in increase in TSP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref026">26</xref>]. These findings support our previous reports showing that the parasite increased the level of TSP-1 during cellular infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref027">27</xref>]. Increased TSP-1 can mediate fibrotic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref028">28</xref>] including those seen in megacolon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref029">29</xref>]. The above observations support our findings that the level of TSP-1 increases during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of colonic epithelial cells. This increase in TSP-1 protein is inhibited by a JNK inhibitor SP600125 suggesting that TSP-1 protein increase is regulated by p-c-Jun during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study we focused on transcription factors CREB and c-Jun whose dysregulation have been suggested to be involved in several major pathologies. Deregulated levels of p-CREB have been reported in brain pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref030">30</xref>] and defects in neuronal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref031">31</xref>]. c-Jun has been reported to play a role in sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref032">32</xref>], neuronal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref033">33</xref>], and several other pathologies.</p>
<p>Our array data showed significant upregulation of p-Akt S473 in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected colonic cells compared to uninfected control. Our data also showed a significant increase in upstream p-JNK and downstream p-c-Jun during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. This is important as an increase in JNK phosphorylation has been reported to play a role in endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref034">34</xref>]. The activation of JNK followed by CREB as shown in our study was previously reported to be important in enhancing the transcription of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), which is elevated in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref035">35</xref>]. Studies have also shown that RSK1 may regulate CREB phosphorylation to perform various biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref037">37</xref>]. Our data emphasized the potential role of CREB and JNK in causing the colon pathology observed in some <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected individuals. Our data also showed the upregulation of p-HSP27, an anti-apoptotic protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref038">38</xref>] and HSP60, a molecular chaperone which facilitates cyto-protection through stabilization of mitochondrial proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref039">39</xref>] during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. These proteins collinearly matched the increase in Akt phosphorylation in the infected cells. Our results show upregulation of p-HSP27 during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection, in agreement with other reports, suggesting that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection enhances cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref041">41</xref>]. Additionally, Akt activation in stressed cells results in HSP27 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref042">42</xref>], and the prosurvival effect of this protein occurs through its interaction with Akt.</p>
<p>Interestingly, c-Jun and CREB play a role in the expression of several proteins that are essential in regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref044">44</xref>]. The deregulation of both these phosphorylated proteins during early <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection results in immune modulations and fibrogenic responses. These fibrogenic responses increase fibrosis and muscular hypertrophy reported in the colonic sections from Chagas disease patients suffering from megacolon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref045">45</xref>]. For instance, p-CREB has been reported to transactivate TGF-β1 expression to mediate hepatic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref046">46</xref>]; it also plays a key role in several immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref047">47</xref>]. JNK signaling plays an integral role in several key mechanisms involved in fibrogenic responses via direct phosphorylation of SMAD3, a profibrotic transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref048">48</xref>]. We also previously explained how ECM proteins are involved in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-mediated Chagas pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref049">49</xref>]. CREB promotes an antiapoptotic survival signal in macrophages, leading to enhanced host immune responses during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref051">51</xref>]. Others also showed that CREB phosphorylation can induce TNF-α production during bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref052">52</xref>]. Activated CREB promotes a survival signal response in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref047">47</xref>], leading to immune inflammatory responses during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. Additionally, c-Jun has diverse functions in colon disease as well as in cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Data from our phosphoproteomic assays showed a significant increase in Src phosphorylation. These observations support a previously published conclusion that the remodeling of the ECM occurs through increased focal adhesion kinase and Src signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref055">55</xref>]. Therefore, we postulate in our model that this may be one of the ways that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> causes pathology observed in chagasic individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Our data show that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection of colonic cells significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of c-Jun and CREB in a time-dependent manner during the early phase of infection. Furthermore, nuclear colocalization of both these activated transcription factors increased in the infected cells compared to uninfected controls. Our data complement findings from previous studies showing that CREB binds to consensus cAMP-response element (CRE; TGACGTCA) and the overlapping activator protein-1 (AP-1) motif (TGACTGA, designated CRE2/AP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref056">56</xref>]. The phosphorylation and nuclear colocalization of both CREB and c-Jun during early <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection may promote heterodimer formation between these two transcription factors and/or competitive binding during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. Therefore, these transcription factors may play a novel role in mediating molecular deregulations in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-infected colon cells. However, the detailed mechanisms remain to be deciphered.</p>
<p>Our model suggests that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> increases cellular levels of phosphorylated kinases, thus activating transcription factors including p-c-Jun and p-CREB that are all translocated into the nucleus to regulate inflammatory responses and cellular transformations. The colocalization of p-c-Jun and p-CREB in HCoEpiC challenged with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> is a novel observation in the context of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006792.g009">Fig 9</xref>). It has been previously reported that p-c-Jun and p-CREB cross-talk to cause cellular transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref058">58</xref>]. Furthermore, increased TSP-1 expression induced by increased p-c-Jun can lead to a fibrogenic response which can cause colon pathology that could be implicated in the onset of megacolon. Fibrogenesis, due increased deposition of TSP-1, can lead to a marked thickening of the colon epithelium as observed in tissue sections of specimens from chagasic megacolon patients compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006792.ref059">59</xref>]. Overall, we conclude that the colocalization of upregulated p-c-Jun and p-CREB is a putative key feature in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>-mediated colon pathology, warranting further investigation.</p>
