<title>Background</title>
<p>Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a lethal zoonosis caused by the metacestode larva of the tapeworm <italic>Echinococcus multilocularis</italic>. The infection is characterized by tumour-like growth of the metacestode within the host liver, leading to extensive fibrosis and organ-failure. The molecular mechanisms of parasite organ tropism towards the liver and influences of liver cytokines and hormones on parasite development are little studied to date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
<p>We show that the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> larval stage expresses three members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor family with homology to human FGF receptors. Using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> expression system we demonstrate that all three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors are activated in response to human acidic and basic FGF, which are present in the liver. In all three cases, activation could be prevented by addition of the tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor BIBF 1120, which is used to treat human cancer. At physiological concentrations, acidic and basic FGF significantly stimulated the formation of metacestode vesicles from parasite stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and supported metacestode growth. Furthermore, the parasite’s mitogen activated protein kinase signalling system was stimulated upon addition of human FGF. The survival of metacestode vesicles and parasite stem cells were drastically affected <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of BIBF 1120.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>Our data indicate that mammalian FGF, which is present in the liver and upregulated during fibrosis, supports the establishment of the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> metacestode during AE by acting on an evolutionarily conserved parasite FGF signalling system. These data are valuable for understanding molecular mechanisms of organ tropism and host-parasite interaction in AE. Furthermore, our data indicate that the parasite’s FGF signalling systems are promising targets for the development of novel drugs against AE.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>To ensure proper communication between their different cell populations, animals rely on secreted hormones and cytokines that act on receptors of target cells. Most of the respective cytokines, such as FGFs, evolved over 500 million years ago and are present in similar form in all animals, including parasitic worms. The authors of this study show that the metacestode larva of the tapeworm <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic>, which grows like a malignant tumor within the host liver, expresses molecules with homology to FGF receptors from mammals. The authors show that human FGF, which is abundantly present in the liver, stimulates metacestode development and that all parasite FGF receptors are activated by human FGF, despite 500 million years of evolutionary distance between both systems. This indicates that cells of the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> metacestode can directly communicate with cells of the mammalian host using evolutionarily conserved signaling molecules. This mode of host-pathogen interaction is unique for helminths and does not occur between mammals and single-celled pathogens such as protozoans or bacteria. The authors finally demonstrate that BIBF 1120, a drug used to treat human cancer, targets the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors and leads to parasite death. This opens new ways for the development of anti-parasitic drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The flatworm parasite <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> (fox-tapeworm) is the causative agent of alveolar echinococcosis (AE), one of the most dangerous zoonoses of the Northern hemisphere. Infections of intermediate hosts (rodents, humans) are initiated by oral uptake of infectious eggs which contain the parasite’s oncosphere larval stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref002">2</xref>]. After hatching in the host intestine and penetration of the intestinal wall the oncosphere gains access to the liver, where it undergoes a metamorphotic transition towards the metacestode larval stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref003">3</xref>]. The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> metacestode consists of numerous vesicles which grow infiltratively, like a malignant tumor, into the liver tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref003">3</xref>]. Due to the unrestricted growth of the metacestode, blood vessels and bile ducts of the liver tissue of the intermediate host are obstructed, eventually leading to organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref001">1</xref>]. Another hallmark of AE is extensive liver fibrosis which can lead to a complete disappearance of the liver parenchyma, and which most probably involves the activation of hepatic stellate cells during chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref005">5</xref>]. Surgical removal of the parasite tissue, the only possible cure, is not feasible in the majority of patients leaving benzimidazole-based chemotherapy as the only treatment option. However, benzimidazoles act parasitostatic only and have to be given for prolonged periods of time (often life-long), underscoring the need for novel treatment options against AE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>We previously established that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> development and larval growth is exclusively driven by a population of somatic stem cells, the germinative cells, which are the only mitotically active cells of the parasite and which give rise to all differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>]. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation systems for metacestode vesicles and germinative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref010">10</xref>], we also demonstrated that host insulin fosters parasite development by acting on evolutionarily conserved receptor kinases of the insulin receptor family that are expressed by the metacestode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref011">11</xref>]. Evidence has also been obtained that host epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates <italic>Echinococcus</italic> germinative cell proliferation, most probably by acting on parasite receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) of the EGF receptor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref013">13</xref>]. These studies indicate that the interaction of host-derived hormones and cytokines with corresponding receptors of evolutionarily conserved signalling pathways that are expressed by the parasite may play an important role in AE host-parasite interaction. Although the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome project already indicated that the parasite expresses receptor TK of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor family in addition to insulin- and EGF-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>], no studies concerning the effects of host FGF and their possible interaction with parasite FGF receptors have been carried out to date.</p>
<p>FGFs are an ancient group of polypeptide cytokines that are present in diploblastic animals, in deuterostomes and, among protostomes, only in ecdysozoa (with some distantly related members in lophotrochozoa)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref016">16</xref>]. Humans express 22 different FGFs of which several (FGF11 –FGF14) are not secreted and act independently of FGF receptors in an intracrine modus only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>]. The remaining FGFs act in a paracrine fashion and are typically released via N-terminal signal peptides. Notable exceptions are the prototypic FGF1 (acidic FGF) and FGF2 (basic FGF) which are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, are the most active members of the FGF family, and are released in a signal peptide-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>]. FGFs have a key role in metazoan embryonic development and, in adults, are typically involved in regeneration processes (angiogenesis, wound healing, liver regeneration, regeneration of nervous tissue)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>]. In the liver, particularly FGF1 but also FGF2 are present as proteins in significant amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref017">17</xref>], are crucially involved in tissue regeneration upon damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref019">19</xref>], and are also upregulated and released during fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref020">20</xref>]. Secreted FGFs act through surface receptor TK of the FGF receptor family, of which four isoforms, Fgfr1-Fgfr4, are expressed by humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>]. The mammalian FGF receptors comprise an extracellular ligand-binding domain made up of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a split intracellular kinase domain. FGF binding to the cognate FGF receptors typically results in receptor dimerization, transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream signalling pathways such as the Ras-Raf-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade or the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>FGF signalling pathways have, in part, already been studied in flatworms. In the free-living planarian species <italic>Dugesia japonica</italic>, two members of the FGFR TK are expressed of which DjFGFR1 exhibits three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region whereas DjFGFR2 only contains two such domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref021">21</xref>]. Both receptors are expressed by X-ray sensitive planarian stem cells (neoblasts) and in cephalic ganglia and an important role of these FGFRs in planarian brain formation has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref022">22</xref>]. Furthermore, similar FGF receptors were also detected in stem cells of the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref023">23</xref>]. In the genome of the flatworm parasite species <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, two FGFR-encoding genes were identified of which <italic>fgfr</italic>A codes for a predicted protein with two extracellular immunoglobulin domains and a split TK domain whereas the <italic>fgfr</italic>B gene product only comprises one immunoglobulin domain in the extracellular region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>]. Expression of <italic>fgfr</italic>A and <italic>fgfr</italic>B in neoblast-like somatic stem cells has been shown and evidence was obtained for an important role of both receptors in schistosome stem cell maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref027">27</xref>]. Hahnel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>] also demonstrated that both receptors are enzymatically active, are expressed in the gonads of schistosomes, and are upregulated following pairing, indicating a role in parasite fertility. Interestingly, these authors also showed that treatment of adult schistosomes with FGFR inhibitors leads to a reduction of somatic neoblast-like stem cells in both genders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present work we provide a detailed analysis of three FGFRs in the cestode <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> and show that the expression patterns of these receptors differ from those in planaria and schistosomes. We also demonstrate that all three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGFRs are activated in response to human FGFs and that host FGF stimulates parasite development <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, we also show that inhibition of FGF signalling in <italic>Echinococcus</italic> larvae drastically reduces parasite development and survival.</p>

DNA was isolated by two rounds of phenol/chlorophorm extraction (1 vol of phenol/chlorophorm/isoamylalcohol 25:24:1). DNA was then precipitated with 2 vol of 96% ethanol and 0,1 vol of LiCl (pH 4,5) after overnight incubation at -20°C and centrifugation at 20.000 rcf for 30 min at 4°C and washed with 70% ethanol. The pellet was then air dried for 15 min an resuspended in 1 x TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8,0).</p>
<p>The DNA was then prepared for coating onto a 96-well plate (96 well optical bottom plates, Nunc, Langenselbold, Germany).

<p>By cDNA library screening and mining of the available <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome sequence we identified a total of three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> genes encoding members of the FGFR family of RTK.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the encoded protein, EmFR1, contained an N-terminal export directing signal peptide, followed by one single Ig-like domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular TK domain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s001">S1</xref>). In the recently released <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>], this gene was correctly predicted on the basis of genome and transcriptome data (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> gene designation: EmuJ_000833200). In the upstream genomic regions of <italic>emfr1</italic>, no information encoding potential Ig-like domains was identified which, together with the presence of a signal peptide sequence upstream of the single Ig-like domain, indicated that EmFR1 indeed contained only one single Ig-like domain. Amino acid sequence alignments indicated that the kinase domain of EmFR1 contains all residues critical for enzymatic activity at the corresponding positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and SWISS-PROT database searches revealed highest similarity between the EmFR1 kinase domain and that of human FGFR4 (42% identical aa; 59% similar aa).</p>

<p>A second gene encoding a TK with significant homology to known FGFRs was identified on the available <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>] under the annotation EmuJ_000196200. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein only contained an intracellular TK domain, a transmembrane region, and one extracellular Ig-like domain, but no putative signal peptide. We therefore carried out 5’-RACE analyses on a cDNA preparation deriving from protoscolex RNA and identified the remaining 5’ portion of the cDNA, which contained one additional Ig-like domain and a predicted signal peptide. In the genome annotation, these remaining parts were wrongly annotated as a separate gene under the designation EmuJ_000196300. Hence, the second FGFR encoding gene of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic>, <italic>emfr2</italic>, encoding the protein EmFR2, actually comprises the gene models EmuJ_000196300 and EmuJ_000196200 of the genome sequence. EmFR2 thus comprises a signal peptide, two extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular TKD (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s001">S1</xref>). The TKD contained all residues critical for TK activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and, in SWISS-PROT BLASTP analyses, showed highest similarity to two FGF receptor kinases of the flatworm <italic>Dugesia japonica</italic> (45% identical, 65% similar residues), to the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> receptor FGFRB (55%, 68%) and to human FGFR3 (48%, 62%).</p>
<p>The third FGF receptor encoding gene of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic>, <italic>emfr3</italic>, was identified under the designation EmuJ_000893600 and was originally listed as an ortholog of the tyrosine protein kinase Fes:Fps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>]. However, unlike the Fes:Fps kinase which contains FCH and SH2 domains, the EmuJ_000893600 gene product, EmFR3, comprised an N-terminal signal peptide, two extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular TKD (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s001">S1</xref>), in which 22 of 30 highly conserved residues of TK are present at the corresponding position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Furthermore in SWISS-PROT BLASTP analyses the EmFR3 TKD displayed highest similarity to several vertebrate FGF receptors and to human FGFR2 (32%, 47%). We thus concluded that EmuJ_000893600 actually encoded a third <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptor TK.</p>
<p>Apart from <italic>emfr1</italic>, <italic>emfr2</italic>, and <italic>emfr3</italic>, no further genes were identified in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome which displayed clear homology to known FGFR TKDs and which contained characteristic IG domains in the extracellular portions. In vertebrates, structural homology has been described between the TKDs of the receptor families of FGF receptors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, which also contain varying number of Ig domains in the extracellular parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref037">37</xref>]. Furthermore, VEGF receptor-like molecules have also been described in invertebrates such as <italic>Hydra</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref037">37</xref>]. We therefore carried out additional BLASTP searches on the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome using human VEGF- and PDGF-receptors as queries, but only obtained significant hits with the above mentioned TKDs of EmFR1, EmFR2, and EmFR3. These data indicated that members of the VEGF- and PDGF-receptor families are absent in <italic>Echinococcus</italic>, as has already been described for the closely related schistosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Genes encoding canonical FGF ligands have so far neither been identified in genome projects of free-living flatworms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref038">38</xref>], nor in those of trematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref039">39</xref>] or cestodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>]. In vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>] as well as several invertebrate phyla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref042">42</xref>], however, canonical FGF ligands are clearly expressed. To investigate the situation more closely, we carried out BLASTP and TBLASTN analyses against the predicted proteins and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> contig information, respectively, using FGF ligand sequences of insect, nematode, and cnidarian origin as queries. The product of only one <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> gene, EmuJ_000840500 (annotated as ‘conserved hypothetical protein’) showed certain similarity to these FGF ligands and according to SMART protein domain analyses could contain a FGF-ligand domain between amino acids 166 and 258, although this prediction was clearly below the prediction threshold and of low probability (E-value: 817). No export directing signal peptide was predicted for the EmuJ_000840500 protein, as would be typical for FGF ligands. Furthermore, although EmuJ_000840500 had clear orthologs in the cestodes <italic>Taenia solium</italic> (TsM_000953800) and <italic>Hymenolepis microstoma</italic> (HmN_000558500), none of these gene models had any prediction of an FGF-ligand domain in SMART analyses (nor predicted signal peptides). We thus considered it highly unlikely that EmuJ_000840500 encodes a so far not identified flatworm FGF-ligand.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analyses indicated that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> contains genomic information for three members of the FGFR family of RTK with either one (EmFR1) or two (EmFR2, EmFR3) extracellular Ig-like domains, of which one, EmFR3, showed higher divergence within the TKD as it contained only 22 of otherwise 30 highly conserved amino acid residues of TK. On the other hand, no members of the VEGF- and PDGF-receptor families are encoded by the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome, nor does it contain genes coding for canonical FGF-ligands.</p>

<title>Expression of FGF receptors in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> larval stages</title>
<p>To investigate gene expression patterns of the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors in parasite larvae, we first inspected Illumina transcriptome data for parasite primary cells after 2 and 11 days of culture (PC2d, PC11d, respectively), metacestode vesicles without or with brood capsules (MC-, MC+, respectively), as well as protoscoleces before or after activation by low pH/pepsin treatment (PS-, PS+, respectively), that had be produced during the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>]. According to these data, <italic>emfr1</italic> was moderately expressed in primary cells, metacestode vesicles, and protoscoleces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Likewise, <italic>emfr2</italic> was expressed in all stages, but very lowly in primary cells, somewhat more in metacestode vesicles, and highest in protoscoleces. <italic>emfr3</italic>, on the other hand, was low to moderately expressed in primary cells, low in metacestode vesicles, and highest in protoscoleces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Since primary cell preparations are characterized by a much higher content of germinative (stem) cells than metacestode vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>], these expression patterns could indicate that <italic>emfr3</italic> is stem cell-specifically expressed. We therefore carried out quantitative RT-PCR experiments on cDNA preparations from <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultivated metacestode vesicles (MV) versus metacestode vesicles after treatment with hudroxyurea (MV-HU) or the Polo-like kinase inhibitor BI 2536 (MV-BI), in which the stem cell population had been selectively depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref040">40</xref>]. While <italic>emfr1</italic> expression levels were equal in MV when compared to MV-HU and MV-BI, both <italic>emfr2</italic> and <italic>emfr3</italic> transcripts were significantly reduced in MV-HU and MV-BI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This indicated that <italic>emfr1</italic> does not have a typical stem cell-specific expression pattern whereas <italic>emfr2</italic> and <italic>emfr3</italic> could be expressed in the parasite’s stem cells or their immediate progeny (since HU- and BI 2536-treatment has to be carried out for at least one week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref034">34</xref>]).</p>
<p>To clarify the situation we carried out whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments on metacestode vesicles according to recently established protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref044">44</xref>]. In these experiments, proliferating parasite stem cells were labeled by incorporation of the nucleotide analog EdU, which was combined with detection of gene transcripts by using fluorescently labeled probes. According to these experiments, <italic>emfr1</italic> was expressed at low levels throughout the germinal layer and the signal was somewhat higher during the development of protoscoleces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g002">Fig 2</xref>), maybe due to higher cell density in the protoscolex. The intensity of the signal was heterogenous, but no clear pattern could be discerned and it was too low to clearly determine the percentage of positive cells.</p>

<p><italic>emfr2</italic>, on the other hand, was specifically expressed in a population of small sized cells, which comprised 1.7% to 6.3% of all cells in the germinal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). None of these <italic>emfr2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells were also EdU<sup>+</sup>, indicating that they were post-mitotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>]. During initial protoscolex development, <italic>emfr2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells accumulated in the peripheral-most layer of cells, as well as in the anterior-most region (which will form the rostellum), and in three longitudinal bands of cells in the interior of the protoscolex buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>Host FGF stimulates <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> larval proliferation and development</title>
<p>Since <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> larvae do not express canonical FGF ligands (see above), but usually develop in an environment in which FGF1 and FGF2 are abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref017">17</xref>], we next tested whether host-derived FGF ligands can stimulate parasite development <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we employed two different cultivation systems which we had previously established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref010">10</xref>]. In the axenic metacestode vesicle cultivation system, mature metacestode vesicles of the parasite are cultivated in the absence of host cells under reducing culture conditions (e.g. low oxygen)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref009">9</xref>]. In the primary cell cultivation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref010">10</xref>], axenically cultivated metacestode vesicles are digested to set up cell cultures which are highly enriched in parasite germinative (stem) cells (~ 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>]), but which also contain certain amounts of differentiated cells such as muscle or nerve cells. In the primary cell cultivation system, mature metacestode vesicles are typically formed within 2–3 weeks, which is critically dependent on proliferation and differentiation of the germinative cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>] in a manner highly reminiscent of the oncosphere-metacestode transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, the exogenous addition of 10 nM FGF1 to mature metacestode vesicles already resulted in an elevated incorporation of BrdU, indicating enhanced proliferation of parasite stem cells, which was even more pronounced in the presence of 100 nM FGF1. In the case of FGF2, addition of 100 nM resulted in enhanced BrdU incorporation in a statistically significant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Likewise, metacestode vesicles cultured for 4 weeks in the presence of 10 nM FGF1 or FGF2 displayed a considerably larger volume (about two-fold) when compared to non-FGF-stimulated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> FGF receptors are activated by host-derived FGF ligands</title>
<p>Having shown that host-derived FGF ligands can stimulate parasite proliferation and development <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were interested whether these effects might be mediated by one or all three of the parasite’s FGF receptors which are expressed by the metacestode larval stage. To this end, we first made use of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system in which the activity of heterologously expressed protein kinases can be measured by germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). This system has previously been used to measure the activities of the TKD of schistosome FGF receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>], as well as the host-EGF (epidermal growth factor) dependent activation of a schistosome member of the EGF receptor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref031">31</xref>]. We, thus, expressed <italic>Pleurodeles</italic> FGFR1 (as a positive control), which is highly similar to human FGFR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref032">32</xref>], and all three parasite FGF receptors in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, which were then stimulated by the addition of 10 nM FGF1 or FGF2. As negative controls, we also expressed kinase-dead versions of all <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.</p>
<p>As can be deduced from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006959.t001">Table 1</xref>, control (non-stimulated) oocytes were negative for GVBD, whereas progesterone-stimulated oocytes displayed 100% vesicle breakdown. Expression of FGFR1 did not yield GVBD but, after stimulation with 10 nM FGF1, 100% of oocytes underwent GVBD, indicating stimulation of the <italic>Pleurodeles</italic> receptor by FGF1 (as expected). Upon expression of any of the parasite receptors in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, no GVBD was observed when no ligand was added. The addition of 10 nM FGF1 to these receptors, however, resulted in 100% GVBD for EmFR1 and EmFR2, as well as to 80% GVBD in the case of EmFR3. In the case of human FGF2 (10 nM), 90% GVBD was observed for EmFR1 and EmFR3, and 85% for EmFR2. No GVBD was observed upon addition of 10 nM FGF1 or FGF2 when the kinase-dead versions of the parasite receptors were expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These data clearly indicated that all three parasite receptors were responsive to host derived FGF ligands (albeit to somewhat different extent) and that the kinase activity of the parasite receptors was essential to transmit the signal. We also measured the phosphorylation state of the parasite FGF receptors upon addition of exogenous FGF1 and FGF2 (10 nM each) to <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and obtained significantly induced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in all three cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Inhibition of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> FGF receptors by BIBF 1120</title>
<p>The small molecule compound BIBF 1120 (also known as Nintedanib or Vargatef) is a well-studied and highly selective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of mammalian members of the FGF-, VEGF-, and PDGF-receptor families with very limited affinity to other RTK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref046">46</xref>]. As a possible agent to selectively inhibit FGF RTK activities in the parasite, we measured the effects of BIBF 1120 on EmFR1, EmFR2, and EmFR3 upon expression in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system. As can be deduced from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006959.t001">Table 1</xref>, a concentration of 1 μM of exogenously added BIBF 1120 already diminished the activity (after stimulation with 10 nM FGF1) of FGFR1 to 40%, and led to a complete block of kinase activity upon addition of 10 μM BIBF 1120. In the case of EmFR1 and EmFR2, 1 μM BIBF1120 also led to a marked decrease of receptor kinase activity, although to a somewhat lower extent than in the case of FGFR1. In the presence of 10 μM BIBF 1120, on the other hand, the activities of EmFR1 and EmFR2 were completely blocked. In the case of EmFR3, exogenous addition of 1 μM BIBF 1120 had only slight effects on GVBD, whereas 10 μM BIBF 1120 reduced the activity to less than 50% and 20 μM BIBF 1120 completely blocked TK-dependent GVBD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006959.t001">Table 1</xref>). Upon addition of 20 μM BIBF 1120, TK activity of all receptors tested was completely inhibited.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data indicated that all three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF RTK were affected by BIBF 1120, although in all three cases higher concentrations of the inhibitor were necessary to completely block TK activity when compared to FGFR1. BIBF 1120 treatment had the lowest effects on the activity of EmFR3.</p>

<title>BIBF 1120 inhibits <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> larval development</title>
<p>We next tested the effects of different concentrations of BIBF 1120 on parasite development and survival in the primary cell and metacestode vesicle culture systems. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, the addition of 1–10 μM BIBF 1120 had clear concentration-dependent effects on mature metacestode vesicle survival which, after cultivation for 18 days, led to about 20% surviving vesicles in the presence of 1 μM BIBF 1120, 10% surviving vesicles in the presence of 5 μM BIBF 1120, and no survival when 10 μM BIBF 1120 was applied. To test whether the metacestode vesicles were indeed no longer capable of parasite tissue regeneration, we set up primary cell cultures from microscopically intact vesicles which had been treated with 5 μM BIBF 1120 for 5 days (90% intact vesicles) and let the cultures recover in medium without inhibitor. In these cultures, however, we never observed the formation of mature vesicles, indicating that either the parasite’s stem cell population, and/or other cell types necessary for parasite development in the primary cell culture system, were severely damaged after BIBF 1120 treatment.</p>

<p>We then also tested the effects of BIBF 1120 on fresh primary cell cultures from previously untreated metacestode vesicles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, a concentration of 1 μM BIBF 1120 had no effect on the formation of metacestode vesicles from these cultures, whereas vesicle formation was completely blocked in the presence of 5 μM or 10 μM BIBF 1120.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results clearly indicated detrimental effects of BIBF 1120 on parasite development already at concentrations as low as 5 μM. Since the parasite does not express known alternative targets for BIBF 1120, such as VEGF- or PDGFR-receptors, we deduced that these effects are due to the inhibition of one or more of the parasite’s FGF RTK.</p>

<title>Host FGF ligands stimulate Erk signaling in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multiocularis</italic></title>
<p>One of the major downstream targets of FGF signaling in other organisms is the Erk-like MAPK cascade, a complete module of which we had previously identified in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref048">48</xref>]. In particular, we had previously shown that the phosphorylation status of the parasite’s Erk-like MAP kinase, EmMPK1, can be measured by using antibodies against the phosphorylated form of the human Erk-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref033">33</xref>]. To investigate whether exogenously added host FGF can affect the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> Erk-like MAPK cascade module, we first incubated mature metacestode vesicles for 4 days in serum-free medium (which has no effect on vesicle integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref029">29</xref>]) and then stimulated these vesicles for 30 sec, 60 sec, and 60 min with 10 nM FGF1 and FGF2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, FGF1 treatment had a clear effect of EmMPK1 phosphorylation already after 30 sec of exposure. In the case of FGF2, the effect was still measurable, but clearly less pronounced than in the case of FGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). We then also measured the effects of BIBF 1120 treatment on EmMPK1 phosphorylation. To this end, metacestode vesicles were incubated in hepatocyte-conditioned medium and were then subjected to BIBF 1120 treatment (5 μM, 10 μM) for 30 min. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, this led to diminished phosphorylation of EmMPK1 when 10 μM BIBF 1120 was used.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An important difference between parasitic helminths and all other infectious agents (excluding viruses) is that these organisms are evolutionarily relatively closely related to their vertebrate or invertebrate hosts with which they share an ancestor that has lived around 500 to 600 million years ago. Since all metazoans share evolutionarily conserved signalling systems for cell-cell communication, this opens the possibility for host-parasite cross-communication involving evolutionarily conserved cytokines of one partner (e.g. the host) and cognate receptors of the other (e.g. the parasite), which would be of particular relevance for systemic helminths that infect host organs. Several previous studies indicated that this type of host-pathogen interaction is indeed important in helminth infections. In the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> system, which develops in close association with host liver tissue, we previously demonstrated that host insulin stimulates parasite development and growth via acting on evolutionarily conserved insulin-receptor TK that are expressed by the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref011">11</xref>]. A similar type of cytokine receptor interaction appears to involve epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like cytokines and cognate parasite receptors, of which three (EmER, EmERb, EmERc) are expressed by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref012">12</xref>]. As recently shown by Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref013">13</xref>], host-derived EGF is able to stimulate germinative cell proliferation in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivated parasite larvae and can stimulate at least one of the parasite EGF-receptors, EmER, when heterologously expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Although the parasite itself expresses several EGF-like molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>], which likely act on its EGF receptors, these data indicate that host-EGF could act as an additional stimulus, particularly in response to liver tissue damage as it is inflicted upon entry of the parasite into the host liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref004">4</xref>]. Apart from insulin- and EGF-signalling systems, host-parasite interactions in larval cestode infections might also involve the family of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-family of cytokines since host TGF-β has very recently been shown to stimulate larval growth of the cestode <italic>Taenia crassiceps in vitro</italic> and was found to interact with parasite TGF-β receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref049">49</xref>]. In a similar way, human BMP2 was reported by us to interact with an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> BMP receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref050">50</xref>], although no direct effects of host BMP on parasite development were yet observed. Like in cestodes, the occurrence of insulin- and EGF-receptor TK as well as TGF-β/BMP serine/threonine kinases with the capability of interacting with respective human hormones/cytokines was reported for schistosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref055">55</xref>], and stimulatory effects of host EGF on the development of schistosome snail stages were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref031">31</xref>]. In the present work, we extend the list of respective host-parasite cross-communication systems to the FGF-family of host cytokines and cognate FGF RTK which, to our knowledge, have never before been addressed in this context.</p>
<p>We herein clearly show that mammalian FGF1 and FGF2 stimulate the development of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilcularis</italic> metacestode vesicles from cultivated parasite primary cells, which are highly enriched in germinative (stem) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>]. Furthermore, we show that human FGF also stimulates proliferation and growth of mature metacestode vesicles. Both FGF1 and FGF2 are abundantly present in mammalian liver tissue where they are mostly released upon liver cell damage and during regeneration processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref020">20</xref>]. Although the precise amounts of host FGF in periparasitic lesions of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> infected mice has not been measured to date, it is very likely that the early establishing metacestode is encountering considerable amounts of these cytokines since extensive damage to liver tissue is observed not only in chronically infected mice but also in early stages of the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref004">4</xref>]. The early infectious stage is critical in the establishment of the parasite since the invading oncosophere is not yet producing the laminated layer (LL), an important structure that protects the parasite from direct actions of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref056">56</xref>]. The laminated layer surrounds mature metacestode vesicles (established after 1–2 weeks after invasion) in the chronic phase of the disease. The stimulation of parasite development from stem cells towards mature metacestode vesicles by host FGF, as observed in our cultures, could thus help the parasite to abridge this critical phase and to successfully establish within the liver. Chronic AE is characterized by extensive liver fibrosis, particularly in the peri-parasitic area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref057">57</xref>] and is thought to be mediated by hepatic stellate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref005">5</xref>], which greatly upregulate FGF release during liver regeneration and fibrosis induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref020">20</xref>]. Hence, not only in the initial phase of parasite establishment, but also in the chronic phase of AE, the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> metacestode should be in contact with elevated levels of host FGF that can continuously support parasite growth and proliferation.</p>
<p>Using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> expression system we clearly showed that all three identified FGF receptors of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> are functionally active kinases that are capable of inducing GVBD when properly stimulated. We also demonstrated that all three <italic>Echincoccus</italic> kinases are responsive to human FGF1 and FGF2, albeit to somewhat different extent. While 10 nM FGF1 fully stimulated both EmFR1 and EmFR2, EmFR3 was less activated than the other receptors by both FGFs. This does not necessarily indicate, however, that human FGFs bind less well to EmFR3 than to the other two receptors. Instead, EmFR3 might be activated to a lesser extent since two tyrosine residues, Y653 and Y654, which in human FGFR1 are necessary for full activation of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref058">58</xref>], are conserved in EmFR1 and EmFR2 but absent in EmFR3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In any case, our data clearly show that particularly human FGF1, but also human FGF2, are capable of activating the parasite receptors. Since the parasite apparently does not produce intrinsic FGF ligands, the only canonical FGFs it encounters during liver invasion are host derived. It is, thus, logical to assume that the effects of FGF1 and FGF2 on parasite growth and development are mediated by one, two or all three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors. In line with this assumption is the stimulation of the parasite’s Erk-like MAPK cascade module upon exogenous addition of host FGF to metacestode vesicles. In mammals, the two prominent downstream signalling pathways of FGF receptors are the Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade and the PI3K/Akt pathway, while two others are STAT signalling and the phospholipase γ (PLCγ) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref015">15</xref>]. The STAT signalling pathway is absent in <italic>Echinococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref014">14</xref>] and PLCγ involves binding to human FGF receptors at tyrosine residues that are not conserved in the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> receptors. We had previously demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway exists in <italic>Echinococcus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref011">11</xref>] but we could not measure differential phosphorylation of EmAKT in response to exogenous FGF or after metacestode vesicle treatment with BIBF 1120, indicating that in contrast to human cells, <italic>Echinococcus</italic> mainly involves the MAPK cascade pathway for downstream FGF signalling. In the related planaria, an important role of the Erk-like MAPK cascade in the differentiation of stem cells into multiple cell lineages has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref059">59</xref>]. In this system, inhibition of the Erk-like MAPK cascade resulted in reduced differentiation of neoblasts which retained their ability to proliferate and produced new neoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref059">59</xref>]. In a recent study on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> stem cell dynamics, on the other hand, inhibition of the Erk-like MAPK cascade resulted in strongly diminished cell proliferation whereas activation of Erk signalling by exogenous addition of EGF stimulated stem cell self-renewal and clonal expansion, at least under conditions of low stem cell densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, these authors showed that stimulating EGF signalling can activate quiescent stem cells in the protoscolex to re-enter the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref013">13</xref>]. Unfortunately, in the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> system no markers are known so far to distinguish between self-renewing stem cells from transit amplifying cells. It will thus in future experiments be interesting to study whether host FGF stimulates <italic>Echinococcus</italic> stem cell renewal, including activation of quiescent stem cells, or the differentiation of transit amplifying stem cells towards differentiated cell lineages. Furthermore, since apparently both FGF and EGF signalling in <italic>Echinococcus</italic> converge on the Erk-like MAPK cascade pathway, it will be worthwhile to study differential or additive effects of both stimuli on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> stem cell dynamics.</p>
<p>Concerning cellular expression patterns we detected significant differences between the <italic>Echincoccus</italic> FGF receptors and those of the related schistosomes and planaria. In planaria, the expression of FGF receptors is a hallmark of neoblast stem cells and also occurs in cephalic ganglions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref023">23</xref>]. In schistosomes, one of the two FGF receptors, <italic>fgfr</italic>A, is a marker for a prominent subset of somatic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref027">27</xref>] and, like <italic>fgfr</italic>B, is also expressed in the reproductive organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>]. In <italic>Echinococcus</italic>, we found only one receptor, EmFR3, which is expressed in germinative cells, but only in a very tiny subpopulation. EmFR2 was also only expressed in a few cells which were, however, clearly post-mitotic and most probably represented muscle cells. Likewise, the third <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptor, EmFR1, was expressed throughout the parasite’s metacestode tissue without specific association with the germinative cells. In qRT-PCR analyses on metacestode ´vesicles which were specifically deprived of stem cells after treatment with hydroxyurea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>] or the Polo-like kinase inhibitor BI 2536 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref035">35</xref>] we also never observed diminished levels of <italic>emfr1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006959.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), which further supports that the gene is not exclusively expressed in germinative cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the close association of FGF receptor expression with stem cells as observed in planaria and schistosomes is at least highly modified in the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> system, in which at least EmFR1 and EmFR2 are clearly expressed in post-mitotic cells. This adds to stem cell-specific gene expression differences which we had previously observed between planaria and cestodes e.g. concerning <italic>argonaute</italic> or histone deacetylase-orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>], and also indicates clear differences between stem cell–specific gene expression patterns in the parasitic flatworm lineages of trematodes and cestodes.</p>
<p>We observed clear inhibitory effects of the TK inhibitor BIBF 1120 on the enzymatic activity of all three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors upon heterologous expression in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system and also demonstrated that this compound can profoundly affect parasite survival and development <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system concentrations of 20 μM BIBF 1120 fully inhibited all three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors we cannot clearly state whether the detrimental effects on parasite development were due to the specific inhibition of one of the three <italic>Echinococcus</italic> FGF receptors, or on combined activities against all three enzymes. However, based on the fact that EmFR3 is only expressed in less than 1% of the cells of the metacestode, that <italic>emfr3</italic> expressing cells only accumulate during the formation of protoscoleces, and that EmFR3 showed lowest levels of inhibition upon expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells, we do not consider this receptor as a prominent candidate for mediating the BIBF 1120 effects on primary cells and the metacestode. We also consider it unlikely that the inhibition of EmFR2 had produced these effects since the respective gene is only expressed in a small subset (2–5%) of all metacestode cells. Based on the expression of <italic>emfr2</italic> in muscle cells or muscle cell progenitors, however, we cannot completely rule out that EmFR2 inhibition might have led to the depletion of specific parasite cells that are necessary to form a stem cell niche for the parasite’s germinative cells. At least in planaria it has already been shown that muscle cells provide important positional information on the stem cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref060">60</xref>] and our recent studies on the <italic>wnt</italic> signalling pathway in <italic>Echinococcus</italic> clearly demonstrated that this is also the case for cestodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref044">44</xref>]. However, based on the fact that <italic>emfr1</italic> is expressed throughout the metacestode and that in both primary cells and metacestode vesicles <italic>emfr1</italic> is the highest expressed FGF receptor gene we propose that most of the effects of BIBF 1120 on <italic>Echinococcus</italic> development are mediated by EmFR1 inhibition. On the cellular level, BIBF 1120 could either affect <italic>emfr1</italic>-expressing germinative cells or differentiated cells of the germinal layer or both. Since metacestode vesicles treated with stem cell-specific drugs such as hydroxyurea or BI 2536 still remain intact for 2–3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref035">35</xref>], but BIBF 1120-treated vesicles already loose structural integrity after 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006959.g006">Fig 6</xref>), we consider it highly likely that EmFR1 inhibition largely damages germinal layer cells which form an important niche for the germinative cells to survive and proliferate.</p>
<p>BIBF 1120 has originally been described as a multi-kinase inhibitor with specificity against members of the VEGF-, FGF-, and PDGF-families, but also with activity against members of the Src-family of non-receptor TK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref045">45</xref>]. Our genomic analyses revealed that, similar to schistosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref024">24</xref>], no genes encoding VEGF- or PDGF-receptors are present on the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome. So far, no Src-like kinase has been biochemically characterized in cestodes. In the related trematode <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, however, at least one clear Src family kinase, SmTK3, has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0006959.ref061">61</xref>] and a close ortholog, EmuJ_000598200, is encoded on the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> genome and, at least to a certain level, expressed in primary cells and metacestode vesicles. We thus cannot completely exclude that some of the effects of BIBF 1120 on these cell systems were due to an inhibition of the <italic>Echinococcus</italic> SmTK3 ortholog. On the other hand, we never observed clear effects of Src-kinase specific inhibitors such as PP2 or herbimycin A on <italic>Echinococcus</italic> development <italic>in vitro</italic> which indicates that the observed effects of BIBF 1120 on <italic>Echinococcus</italic> larval development are rather due to the inhibition of other kinases, most probably EmFR1 and/or EmFR2. For the development of novel chemotherapeutics against AE, EmFR1 and EmFR2 would thus be highly interesting target molecules although, of course, BIBF 1120 as originally developed against human FGF receptors showed somewhat higher activities against FGFR1 in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> expression system than against the parasite FGF receptors. Nevertheless, and using the activity assays developed in this work, it should be possible to identify compounds which are related to BIBF 1120 but which show higher affinities against the parasite enzymes than against human FGF receptors.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the present work we provide clear evidence that human FGF ligands are capable of activating evolutionarily conserved TK of the FGF receptor family that are expressed by the larval stage of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> and that the parasite’s Erk-like MAPK cascade is stimulated upon exogenous addition of human FGFs to metacestode vesicles. We also showed that human FGF1 and FGF2 are stimulating the development of metacestode vesicles from parasite primary cell cultures and that they accelerate metacestode vesicle proliferation and growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since FGF1 and FGF2 are expressed in considerable amounts within the host liver, the primary target organ for the establishment of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multilocularis</italic> metacestode, and since FGF ligands are also constantly produced during liver regeneration and fibrosis, which are consequences of parasite growth within the intermediate host, we consider the observed <italic>in vitro</italic> effects on parasite FGF signalling and metacestode development also of high relevance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Liver-specific activities of host FGF could thus support the development of metacestode vesicles from stem cells that are delivered to the liver by the oncosphere larva, and could constantly stimulate asexual proliferation of the metacestode during an infection. We finally showed that at least one compound that inhibits the activities of mammalian FGF receptors, BIBF 1120, also inhibits the parasite orthologs, leads to metacestode inactivation, and prevents parasite development of stem cell-containing primary cell cultures. This opens new ways for the development of anti-<italic>Echinococcus</italic> drugs using the parasite FGF receptors as target molecules.</p>
