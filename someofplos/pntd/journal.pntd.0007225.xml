<title>Background</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease of worldwide importance, though relatively neglected in many African countries including sub Saharan Africa that is among areas with high burden of this disease. The disease is often mistaken for other febrile illnesses such as dengue, malaria, rickettsioses and enteric fever. Leptospirosis is an occupational disease likely to affect people working in environments prone to infestation with rodents which are the primary reservoir hosts of this disease. Some of the populations at risk include: sugarcane plantation workers, wetland farmers, fishermen and abattoir workers. In this study we investigated the prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> among sugarcane plantation and factory workers, fishing communities as well as among rodents and shrews in domestic and peridomestic environments within the study areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted in Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania and it involved sugarcane plantation workers (cutters and weeders), sugar factory workers and the fishing community at Kagera Sugar Company in Missenyi district and Musira island in Lake Victoria, Kagera, respectively. Blood was collected from consenting human adults, and from rodents and shrews (insectivores) captured live using Sherman traps. Serological detection of leptospiral antibodies in blood serum was carried out by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 455 participants were recruited from the sugarcane plantation (n = 401) and fishing community (n = 54) while 31 rodents and shrews were captured. The overall prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> in human was 15.8%. Sugarcane cutters had higher seroprevalence than other sugar factory workers. Prevalent antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars in humans were against serovars Lora (6.8%), Sokoine (5.3%), Pomona (2.4%), Hebdomadis (1.1%) and Kenya (0.2%). Detected leptospiral serovars in reservoir hosts were Sokoine (12.5%) and Grippotyphosa (4.2%). Serovar Sokoine was detected both in humans and small mammals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is a public health threat affecting populations at risk, such as sugarcane plantation workers and fishing communities. Public awareness targeting risk occupational groups is much needed for mitigation of leptospirosis in the study areas and other vulnerable populations in Tanzania and elsewhere.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is caused by a spirochete bacterium of the genus <italic>Leptospira</italic>. The disease is worldwide distributed, although highly neglected in some parts of the developing world. This study investigated the prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> in sugarcane plantation workers, a fishing community and rodents and shrews in the Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania. Seventy two of the 455 (15.8%) screened participants were seropositive to leptospirosis. The seroprevalence was higher among sugarcane cutters (18.4%) than other plantation workers, and 15.4% of hospitalized patients in the plantation hospital were seropositive. Prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> in the fishing community was 14.8%. Antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars detected in humans with their respective proportions, in brackets, were Lora (6.8%), Sokoine (5.3%), Pomona (2.4%), Hebdomadis (1.1%) and Kenya (0.2%). In the small mammals, the most detected antibodies were against <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovar Sokoine (12.5%) and serovar Grippotyphosa (4.2%). These results show that leptospirosis is public health risk requiring attention of the health system as well as the agricultural sector for its management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is a public health concern especially in the tropical and subtropical countries where the environment is optimal for survival of pathogenic leptospires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref001">1</xref>]. The annual morbidity and mortality caused by leptospirosis worldwide is estimated to be 14.7 cases per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref002">2</xref>]. Globally, Oceania region has the highest disease burden (150.6 cases/100,000 population), South east Asia (55.5), Caribbean (50.6) and East Sub Saharan Africa (25.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref003">3</xref>]. In Tanzania the annual incidence is 75–102 cases per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref004">4</xref>]. Rodents are considered major reservoirs of <italic>Leptospira</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref005">5</xref>] and other wild animals and birds found in wetland areas may also carry and spread leptospires into the surroundings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref006">6</xref>]. The disease is associated with certain occupational activities such as rice and sugarcane farming, fishing and fish farming, livestock keeping, handling animal products and water sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref008">8</xref>]. Males are most affected than females contributing to 80% of the total burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref003">3</xref>]. Humans can be infected through contact with urine or other materials from infected animals or contaminated water and soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref009">9</xref>]. In Tanzania, leptospirosis has been reported in patients with non-malaria fevers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref011">11</xref>] and in animals including rodents and domestic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>]. Antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> have been demonstrated also in freshwater fishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref006">6</xref>] in Tanzania suggesting potential risk to fishermen and people undertaking irrigation activities such as, rice farming and sugarcane plantation. Studies on leptospirosis in these at risk populations are lacking, hence the burden of leptospirosis in fishing communities and sugarcane plantations is not known. Sugarcane plantation and rice farming are important agricultural sectors in Tanzania, which engage permanent and seasonal workers from different parts of the country. Understanding the burden of leptospirosis in these occupational groups could provide baseline information needed for informing policy, especially because the disease is neglected and rarely considered for diagnosis in the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref016">16</xref>]. In this study we investigated the serological prevalence of leptospirosis in selected risk populations of sugarcane plantation workers and fishing in northwestern Tanzania Also, we identified potential <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars circulating in the region, which would serve as important antigens for diagnostic purposes.</p>

<title>Study location</title>
<p>This study was conducted in Kagera region northwestern Tanzania at Musira island (S 01° 19.914’, E 031° 49.772’ with elevation of 1120 meter above sea level, and at Kagera sugar company (S 01° 12.807, E 031° 16.510’) with elevation of 1157 meter above sea level. Kagera region receives bi-modal rainfall pattern ranging between 900–2,000 mm per annum, temperatures range between 20°C and 28°C. Kagera region is located along Lake Victoria hence fishing is among major socio-economic activity apart from large scale sugarcane plantation. Kagera Sugar Company is one of the biggest sugarcane plantations in the country. The two study sites (fishing community and Musira and sugarcane plantation community at Kagera sugar company are 76.2 km apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007225.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Human subjects</title>
<p>Human leptospirosis is estimated to be 10% in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>]. Sample size estimation formula used was N = Z<sup>2</sup>XP (1-P)/δ<sup>2</sup>, whereby; N = Estimated sample size, Z = Standard normal variate (1.96) for 95% confidence level, P = Proportion (prevalence), δ = Precision or absolute error (~ 0.05) for 95% confidence level. N = 1.96<sup>2</sup>x0.1 (1–0.1)/0.05<sup>2</sup> = 138 + 15% of 138 = 160</p>
<p>To increase the power of the study to 80%, 455 of the human study population were sampled from sugarcane plantation workers/cutters and fishermen along Lake Victoria in Kagera region. Sugarcane cutters make the largest proportion of the Kagera sugar company staff. Other employees include those engaged with management, sugarcane planting, weeding, fertilizer application, herbicides application, health services and security. There were 924 sugarcane cutters (seasonal employees) eligible for the study whereas 401 (43.4%) agreed to participate in the study following sensitization about leptospirosis disease. Encampment residents including petty traders in the sugarcane plantation community as well as hospitalized patients were also studied.</p>
<p>Other study participants were from the fishing community at Musira island located near Bukoba town, which were predominantly fishermen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for human subjects</title>
<p>The study included adult sugarcane plantation workers/cutters, weeders, and factory workers working in the sugarcane plantation or encampment residents residing in Kagera sugar company compounds; fishermen and other willing individuals living in the Musira island fishing community. Individuals under 18 year old and those who did not agree to sign informed consent were excluded from the study. Participants were informed about the study at gatherings held in residential camps of Kagera Sugar Company while in the fishing community, individuals were informed and at a public gathering called by the village authority/ chairman. Information about leptospirosis disease and how it is transmitted to humans was communicated to villagers at this gathering to sensitize and increase the participation rate in the study. No interviews were conducted with participants to ascertain whether recalled history of clinical illness related with leptospirosis since majority were assumed likely to agree to this because fevers are common in this tropical region.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Hospitalized participants</title>
<p>There were 58 patients hospitalized at Kagera sugar hospital during the sampling period. These were informed about leptospirosis whereby 13 (22.4%) patients with fevers agreed to provide blood for testing antibodies against leptospirosis.</p>
<p>Blood samples (2–4 ml) were aseptically collected by medical personnel using sterile 5 ml vacutainer tubes and kept in a refrigerator overnight to separate serum. Un-separated blood was centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min to obtain the serum for microscopic agglutination test (MAT).</p>

<p>Animal sample size was estimated by using 8% which is the isolation success rate of <italic>Leptospira</italic> from rodents and insectivores reservoir hosts previously reported from Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>] using same formula used for estimating human subjects sample size, i.e. N = Z<sup>2</sup>XP (1-P)/δ<sup>2</sup> where by N = estimated sample size, Z = standard normal variate (1.96) for 95% confidence level, P = isolation success rate (prevalence), δ = Precision or absolute error (~ 0.05) for 95% confidence level (N = 1.96<sup>2</sup>X0.08 (1–0.08)/0.05<sup>2</sup> = 113+ 15% of 113 = 130. Therefore, 130 rodents and insectivores were required for this study.</p>
<p>Rodents and shrews (<italic>Crocidura</italic> spp.) were captured live using Sherman live traps. The rodents and shrews were then anaesthetized using di-ethyl ether. Blood (1 to 2 ml) was aseptically collected from the supraorbital vein and/ or through heart puncture using capillary tubes and sterile syringes and needles, respectively. The blood was immediately transferred into plain 2.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and allowed to clot to obtain serum samples which were then shipped in cool boxes to the Leptospirosis Research Laboratory at Pest Management Centre, Sokoine University of Agriculture where was kept frozen at -20°C until used.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows high prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> in humans involved in sugar production and fishing in the Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania. Leptospirosis in rodents and shrews captured in the areas is also reported.</p>
<p>Findings suggests that sugarcane plantation workers especially sugarcane cutters and fishing communities are potentially at risk. A prevalence of 15.8% was found in sugarcane plantation workers, with cane cutters having the higher prevalence of 18.4%, followed by other plantation workers and hospitalized patients. Prevalence of anti-leptospiral antibodies was also high (14.8%) in fishermen and other individuals living on the Musira island, which is a fishing island. This suggests that fishing communities can get leptospirosis following contact with water contaminated with urine of the reservoir hosts. The prevalence of human leptospirosis in sugarcane plantation workers reported in this study (18.4%) is lower than that reported in sugarcane plantation workers in central America (59%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref019">19</xref>] but higher than the 0.7% prevalence reported from Trinidad and Tobago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> among different occupational groups, populations, gender and age groups showed variations suggesting that individuals belonging to certain groups and occupation groups have different levels of risk of contracting leptospirosis. For example, while there was no significant difference in the prevalence of leptospiral antibodies between male and females despite that the study had more males than females due to the nature of the occupation of the study populations, there was a significant difference in prevalence of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> found in participants in two age groups of 18–37; 38–57 year old versus participants with age above 58 year old. Findings show that participants with over 58 year old have significantly higher proportion of antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> than those with age below 58 year old (i.e. 18–37; 38–57 year old). This could be probably associated with potential prolonged exposure to risk environment such as sugarcane cutting for many years than newer entrants. The fishing community and sugarcane plantations appear to have similar risk levels since the prevalence of antibodies in these two populations was not statistically significant. However, comparison of fishing community and sugarcane cutters considered risk populations with unexposed groups consisting of participants engaged with less risk activities such as office work, security and petty traders show that fishing community does not differ to the unexposed group while sugarcane cutters show more risk than unexposed group. This can be explained with fact that fishing community included the general population of the fishing island including school pupils and other residents likely to have various levels of risk of contracting leptospirosis while sugarcane cutters consisted a uniform group of individuals engaged with same activity of cutting sugar hence likely to have same level of risk higher than the general population.</p>
<p>The prevalent antibodies against <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars found in humans were against <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Lora (6.8%), <italic>L</italic>. <italic>kirschneri</italic> serovar Sokoine (5.3%) and slightly <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Pomona (2.4%). <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Hebdomadis and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>borgpetersenii</italic> serovar Kenya were least found with prevalence of 1.1% and 0.2%, respectively. <italic>Leptospira kirschneri</italic> serovar Sokoine and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>kirschneri</italic> serovar Grippotyphosa were frequently found in both humans and animals as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>] in agro-pastoralists communities living in Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref008">8</xref>] indicating a wider distribution of leptospirosis in Tanzania.</p>
<p>These findings shows that the roof rat (<italic>Rattus</italic> spp.) is an important reservoir of leptospirosis in Kagera region as demonstrated by high positivity rate among the house rats collected in different localities in the study areas. Comparison of positive rates found in the roof rats and an insectivore showed no statistically significant difference due to small sample size of rodents and shrews collected. A larger sample size estimated for this study was not achieved due to seasonal variations in rodent populations hence suggesting further sampling to enhance robust determination of the major reservoir of <italic>Leptospira</italic> in this region. Antibodies against <italic>L</italic>. serovar Kenya, Lora, Pomona and Hebdomadis were not detected in rodents nor insectivores. The rats were seropositive against <italic>L</italic>. <italic>kirschneri</italic> serovars Sokoine and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>kirschneri</italic> serovar Grippotyphosa. Rodents had lower antibody titres (1:20–1:40) than humans in which higher titres up to 1:2560 were determined by MAT which is the gold standard test for leptospirosis diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref024">24</xref>]. High antibody titres against <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars detected in humans suggest the existence of recent infections.</p>
<p>The predominant circulating <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars which antibodies against was detected in humans, namely <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Lora, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>kirschneri</italic> serovar Sokoine, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>interrogans</italic> serovar Pomona, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>interrogans</italic> serovar Hebdomadis and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>borgpetersenii</italic> serovar Kenya have been previously reported in humans, rodents and domestic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>Leptospira kirschneri</italic> serovar Sokoine was mainly found in both humans and animals in Tanzania whereas <italic>L</italic>. <italic>interrogans</italic> serovar Grippotyphosa was mainly detected in the reservoir hosts. <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Lora was not detected in rodents, indicating potential diversity of sources of human infection. It is known that certain <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars demonstrate host-specificity and might be absent in certain rodent species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>]. Further investigations are needed to establish the source or reservoir hosts of serovar Lora in the study areas and to determine whether the plantation workers who also come from outside Kagera had leptospirosis exposure prior to their recruitment at the sugarcane plantation. This could be achieved by including leptospirosis screening during general health examinations performed before recruiting cane cutters.</p>
<p>The observed high prevalence of leptospirosis in the fishing community corroborate previous report of high seropositivity/leptospiral antibodies in freshwater fishes and thus potential risk of leptospirosis in fishing communities and in people working in the fishing industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref023">23</xref>]. It is recommended that leptospirosis control should include rodent management, and public awareness. Furthermore, leptospirosis screening should be introduced in risk occupational groups in Tanzania and elsewhere where the disease is neglected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref016">16</xref>]. Detection of leptospiral antibodies in hospitalized patients during this study indicates further the importance of considering leptospirosis among febrile illnesses that are non-malarial. The prevalence of 15.4% of leptospirosis in hospitalized patients corroborates previous reports from northern Tanzania and Morogoro among hospitalized patients with febrile illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref026">26</xref>]. This further emphasizes the need to include leptospirosis in differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses.</p>
<p>Further surveillance studies are needed to isolate and characterize the disease causative <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars beyond serological surveillance. These should include cross agglutination absorption test, and molecular typing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref025">25</xref>]. The major limitations of this study were failure to isolate the causal agent, which would have enabled its characterization. Similarly, future studies should include larger populations of potential reservoirs.</p>
<p>Leptospirosis is a public health threat in sugarcane plantation workers and the fishing communities. Preventive measures are needed to mitigate risks of leptospirosis. These should include rodent control, public awareness and screening for leptospirosis in individuals with non-malarial fevers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007225.ref016">16</xref>] and vulnerable occupational groups such as sugarcane cutters. <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars Lora, Sokoine, Pomona, Hebdomadis, Kenya and Grippotyphosa should be included as antigens for broader leptospirosis screening in humans and animals from this region.</p>
