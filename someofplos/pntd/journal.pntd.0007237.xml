<abstract>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites lack pathways for <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis. The depletion of purines induces differentiation into virulent metacyclic forms. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the parasites can survive prolonged periods of purine withdrawal changing their morphology to long and slender cells with an extended flagellum, and decreasing their translation rates. Reduced translation leads to the appearance of discrete granules that contain LeishIF4E-3, one of the six eIF4E paralogs encoded by the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome. We hypothesize that each is responsible for a different function during the life cycle. LeishIF4E-3 is a weak cap-binding protein paralog, but its involvement in translation under normal conditions cannot be excluded. However, in response to nutritional stress, LeishIF4E-3 concentrates in specific cytoplasmic granules. LeishIF4E-3 granulation can be induced by the independent elimination of purines, amino acids and glucose. As these granules contain mature mRNAs, we propose that these bodies store inactive transcripts until recovery from stress occurs. In attempt to examine the content of the nutritional stress-induced granules, they were concentrated over sucrose gradients and further pulled-down by targeting <italic>in vivo</italic> tagged LeishIF4E-3. Proteomic analysis highlighted granule enrichment with multiple ribosomal proteins, suggesting that ribosome particles are abundant in these foci, as expected in case of translation inhibition. RNA-binding proteins, RNA helicases and metabolic enzymes were also enriched in the granules, whereas no degradation enzymes or P-body markers were detected. The starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3-containing granules, therefore, appear to store stalled ribosomes and ribosomal subunits, along with their associated mRNAs. Following nutritional stress, LeishIF4E-3 becomes phosphorylated at position S75, located in its less-conserved N-terminal extension. The ability of the S75A mutant to form granules was reduced, indicating that cellular signaling regulates LeishIF4E-3 function.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cells respond to cellular stress by decreasing protein translation, to prevent the formation of partially folded or misfolded new polypeptides whose accumulation can be detrimental to living cells. Under such conditions, the cells benefit from storing inactive mRNAs and stalled ribosomal particles, to maintain their availability once conditions improve; dedicated granules offer a solution for such storage. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites are exposed to a variety of stress conditions as a natural part of their life cycle, including the nutritional stress that the parasites experience within the gut of the sandfly. Thus, <italic>Leishmania</italic> and related trypanosomatids serve as a good model system to investigate RNA fate during different stress conditions. Various granules appear in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and related organisms in response to different stress conditions. Here, we investigated how nutritional stress, in particular elimination of purines, induced the formation of granules that harbor a specific cap-binding protein, LeishIF4E-3. The starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules consist of a variety of ribosomal proteins, along with RNA-binding proteins and mature mRNAs. We thus propose that <italic>Leishmania</italic> modulates the assembly of LeishIF4E-3-containing granules for transient storage of stalled ribosomal particles and inactive mRNAs. Following renewal of nutrient availability, as occurs during the parasite’s life cycle, the granules disappear. Although their fate is yet unclear, they could be recycled in the cell. Unlike other granules described in trypanosomes, the LeishIF4E-3-containing granules did not contain RNA degradation enzymes, suggesting that their function is mainly for storage until conditions improve.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> are heteroxenous pathogenic parasites that live in the alimentary tract of sandflies as extracellular flagellated promastigotes. Upon transmission to the mammalian host, the parasites enter macrophages and become obligatory intracellular and non-motile amastigotes, residing within phagolysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref001">1</xref>]. While cycling between vector and host, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites must overcome extreme physiological changes in their host milieu, experiencing temperature and pH switches, which serve as environmental signals to undergo differentiation from one life form to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref004">4</xref>]. In addition to the environmental changes, the parasites also experience changes in their nutritional supplies, based on the availability of nutrients from the vector or host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref006">6</xref>]. The changes described are known to drive a developmental program of gene expression. Since processes that control gene expression in trypanosomatids are mostly post-transcriptional, translation regulation plays a key role in establishment of the stage-specific expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Trypanosomatids lack enzymes for the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of purines and the parasites are entirely dependent on the host for purine supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref011">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the lack of purines was shown to induce metacyclogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref012">12</xref>]. The parasites are ingested with a blood drop that continues to provide essential nutrients such as purines, until their consumption. Although the sandfly's gut is co-inhabited by a rich repertoire of bacteria, these do not provide the parasites with nutrients, and were even shown to compete for food sources, generating nutrient stress and differentiation into metacyclics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref014">14</xref>]. The pathway for metacyclogenesis in <italic>Leishmania</italic> can be triggered <italic>in vitro</italic> by depletion of purines, using adenosine receptor antagonists that inhibit purine uptake. Accordingly, replenishing the adenosine supply reduces the induction of metacyclogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref012">12</xref>]. Metacyclic promastigotes are growth-arrested, and equipped with a long flagellum.</p>
<p>Nutrient stress requires the swift regulation of gene expression that includes control of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref015">15</xref>]. As a consequence of impaired translation cytosolic mRNAs and stalled ribosomes are often stored in dedicated cytoplasmic RNA-protein granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref016">16</xref>]. These cytoplasmic granules are membrane-less aggregates of RNA and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref017">17</xref>]. Trypanosomatids harbor a wide repertoire of cytoplasmic granules that include P-bodies, stress granules, heat shock granules, nuclear periphery granules and tRNA halves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref021">21</xref>]. In higher eukaryotes, P-bodies contribute to normal cellular physiology and are also claimed to be associated with mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref022">22</xref>]. Accumulation of mRNAs in granules occurs in response to cellular stresses when translation is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref024">24</xref>], and the mRNAs can be dynamically altered between the different granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref025">25</xref>]. Starvation-induced stress granules assemble in <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref020">20</xref>] during the nutritional stress that also occurs within the insect vector. Such granules can store mRNAs and translation complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>], yet can also lead to mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Cap-dependent translation is the default mechanism for protein synthesis under normal conditions. It is based on assembly of a cap-binding complex onto the 5' cap structure through the cap-binding protein eIF4E, along with its binding partner and scaffold protein eIF4G. The latter serves as a hub for the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A and for other subunits of the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans the 5' UTR until the first AUG is reached, where the large ribosomal subunit is recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref028">28</xref>]. A variety of cellular stresses can lead to a global arrest of protein synthesis. In yeast and mammals, this can be achieved by inhibition of cap-dependent translation, although specific proteins may continue to be synthesized via cap-independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref028">28</xref>]. While it is yet unclear whether stress-induced differential regulation of gene expression in <italic>Leishmania</italic> follows a similar pattern, we previously showed that the LeishIF4E-4 cap-binding complex in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is inactivated in axenic amastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref029">29</xref>]. The trypanosomatid genomes encode for a rather large number of cap-binding complexes that include six paralogs of eIF4E (1–6) and five identified paralogs of eIF4G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref032">32</xref>]. The different eIF4E paralogs show different patterns of expression and cap-binding activity throughout the parasite’s life cycle, supporting the possibility that each paralog performs a different role under the changing environmental conditions. It is generally accepted that LeishIF4E-4 and LeishIF4G-3 form a canonical eIF4F complex as part of translation initiation, with LeishIF4E-1 seemingly also playing an additional, as yet unresolved role in axenic amastigotes at elevated temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref029">29</xref>]. In trypanosomes, the ortholog of LeishIF4E-3 is essential for viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref033">33</xref>], and could be involved in translation initiation. However, its role in <italic>Leishmania</italic> remains unclear due to its relatively weak cap-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>]. Whereas LeishIF4E-3 interacts with LeishIF4G-4 under normal conditions, this interaction is impaired during nutritional stress, causing LeishIF4E-3 to concentrate within specific cytoplasmic granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we studied the fate of LeishIF4E-3 during nutritional stress. We show that under such conditions whereby translation slows down, LeishIF4E-3 is phosphorylated and migrates into dedicated granules. We identified the site of its phosphorylation (serine 75) and show that the S75A mutant fails to enter the starvation-induced granules. We further examined the effect of depleting specific nutrients on LeishIF4E-3 phosphorylation and its ability to enter granules in response to the depletion of purines, amino acids and glucose. We found that only purine starvation induced the morphological changes generating cells that resemble the nectomonad stage, prior to metacyclogenesis. To further examine the interactome of the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules induced following nutrient depletion, we collected the heavy fractions enriched for LeishIF4E-3 from sucrose gradients, affinity purified them through tagged LeishIF4E-3 and assessed their content. The LeishIF4E-3 containing granules contain mRNA and a multitude of ribosomal particles, along with other proteins that accompany mRNAs, supporting their suggested function as storage bodies.</p>

<p>Cutaneous infection-causing <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic>, strain MHOM/BR/LTB0016) promastigotes were used in this study. Wild type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> promastigotes were routinely cultured in Medium 199 (pH 7) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, European Grade; Biological Industries), 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM adenine, 5 μg/ml hemin, 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown at 25°C. All nutritional starvation treatments were performed in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; Biological Industries). Purine starvation was performed in DMEM supplemented as above, except for adenine and FCS that were not included in the medium. Amino acid starvation was performed in custom-made DMEM lacking essential amino acids (i.e., Arg, His, Trp, Phe, Ser, Tyr, Thr, Val, Leu, Lys, Pro, Met, Cys and Ile) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref035">35</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref036">36</xref>] and supplemented as described above, except for the absence of FCS. Glucose starvation was performed in DMEM lacking glucose, supplemented as described above, except for the absence of FCS. Control cells used in the starvation assays were also grown in DMEM supplemented as described above. All experiments were performed with logarithmically growing <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> cells at a cell density of 4–6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. For FCS dialysis, 2000 MW cut-off dialysis tubing was used and the FCS was dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4ºC with stirring. All experiments with dialyzed FCS were performed with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.</p>

<p>Wild type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> promastigotes were cultured to a late log phase of growth (4–6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) and starved as described above for different times. The cells were harvested, washed twice in ice cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.4, and once in PRS buffer (35 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) before being resuspended in PRS+ buffer. PRS+ buffer consisted of 2x cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma), 4 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), 25 mM sodium fluoride, 55 mM β-glycerophosphate and 5 mM sodium orthovanadate.

<title>Nutrient deprivation targets LeishIF4E-3 into cytoplasmic granules</title>
<p>Impaired translation often leads to the formation of cytoplasmic RNA granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref020">20</xref>]. We previously examined granules induced by nutritional stress and showed that incubation in PBS caused LeishIF4E-3 to concentrate in specific cytoplasmic foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>]. In view of the role played by purine starvation during metacyclogenesis pathways, we tested the effects of depleting purines, as well as other specific nutrients, on the formation of LeishIF4E-3-containing granules. In addition, the intracellular localization of LeishIF4G-4 was examined in a transgenic cell line expressing GFP-tagged LeishIF4G-4, thus allowing for parallel visualization of both proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s002">S2A Fig</xref> (for the broad field) show that under normal growth conditions, LeishIF4E-3 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, co-localizing with LeishIF4G-4. However, exposing the cells to different types of nutritional depletion caused LeishIF4E-3 to concentrate in specific cytoplasmic foci as early as 4 h after the onset of the stress. LeishIF4G-4 was not detected in the granules formed following purine starvation (see the merge panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We excluded the possibility that granule formation could be affected by the high level of episome-derived expression of SBP-tagged LeishIF4E-3, since starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules were observed when wild type parasites were subjected to nutritional stress but not under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s002">S2B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s002">S2C Fig</xref> (broad field)].</p>

<title>Co-localization of LeishIF4E-3-containing cytoplasmic granules and <italic>HSP83</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>The mechanism that targets LeishIF4E-3 to starvation-induced cytoplasmic granules is poorly understood. One possibility is that LeishIF4E-3 escorts mRNAs for storage in granules, under conditions whereby translation is arrested due to nutrient deficiencies. Alternatively, if stalled ribosomes are targeted to these granules, associated mRNAs would accompany them. We, therefore, examined whether the starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules indeed contain mRNA. Non-starved and starved parasites were examined by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) analysis of mRNA, using DIG-labelled probes derived from <italic>HSP83</italic>. While non-starved parasites showed homogeneous cytoplasmic distribution of the mRNA, following nutritional depletion (12 h), their staining was enriched within the starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s003">S3A Fig</xref> (broad field)].

<p>To verify that the LeishIF4E-3 modification during starvation originated from phosphorylation, protein lysates from starved (4h in PBS and 4 days for purine starvation) and non-starved parasites were treated with λ-phosphatase and further analyzed in western blots. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows that following the phosphatase treatment, the LeishIF4E-3 once again resumed its original fast migrating pattern, reflecting the non-phosphorylated form of the protein.</p>

<title>Identification of the LeishIF4E-3 phosphorylation site and mutational analysis</title>
<p>The phosphorylation site of LeishIF4E-3 following nutritional deprivation was identified using LC-MS/MS, performed with and without enrichment for the phospho-peptides. In both cases, a single phosphorylated peptide was identified in the enriched fraction of phospho-peptides, highlighting that phosphorylation occurred at position S75, which is part of the extended amino terminus of LeishIF4E-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s004">S4D Fig</xref>).

<p>To test the relevance of the serine 75 phosphorylation for the ability of LeishIF4E-3 to form granules, a LeishIF4E-3 (S75A) phospho-mutant was overexpressed in cells via stable transfection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g005">Fig 5A</xref> shows the migration profile of the endogenous and mutant LeishIF4E-3 polypeptides.

However, a faint band above the main interacting protein was still observed, and could be assigned to other modifications of the mutant S75A LeishIF4E-3 (carbamidomethylation and oxidation), which were identified in the mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s014">S1 Table</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g005">Fig 5B</xref> shows that the S75A mutation of the phosphorylation site also reduced the interaction between LeishIF4E-3 and LeishIF4G-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s005">S5B Fig</xref>).

<title>Enrichment of LeishIF4E-3-associated proteins from the dense sucrose fractions.</title>
<p>The proteomic content of the dense sucrose fractions following pull down by LeishIF4E-3 was analyzed. These fractions could represent the newly formed starvation-induced granules. Extracts of exponentially growing cells that expressed the tagged LeishIF4E-3 were fractionated over sucrose gradients and the heavy fractions were pooled. The OD<sub>260</sub> profile is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. The western analysis of the gradient fractions that is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g006">Fig 6B</xref> (middle panel) further highlights that starvation conditions eliminated the polysomes. The western analysis of the different fractions shows that starvation conditions caused LeishIF4E-3 to migrate in the heavy fractions. These were pooled for further treatment. Parallel fractions from non-starved control cells contained only a small amount of LeishIF4E-3, as expected, since under normal growth conditions LeishIF4E-3 is not abundant in the heavy fractions. The pooled heavy fractions from extracts of stressed cells were affinity-purified over streptavidin beads and the presence of LeishIF4E-3 in the eluted fractions was verified by western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g006">Fig 6</xref> bottom panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). A control assay verified that the addition of cycloheximide to the cells prior to granule purification did not prevent the formation of granules during starvation. This was verified by confocal microscopy of starved and non-starved cells that were incubated with cycloheximide [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s006">S6B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s006">S6C Fig</xref> (broad field)]. In accordance, LeishIF4E-3 migrated in the heavy fractions of the gradient in the absence of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s006">S6D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The protein complexes that were eluted from the heavy fractions following pull-down of SBP-tagged LeishIF4E-3 were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. To exclude non-specific pulled-down products, we employed the same protocol with a control <italic>Leishmania</italic> cell line that over-expressed the luciferase reporter gene, to generate a non-related protein that was also SBP-tagged. Extracts of cells expressing SBP-tagged luciferase were separated over sucrose gradients, the heavy fractions were pooled and pulled-down via the SBP tag using streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s006">S6E Fig</xref>). The eluted material was analyzed by LC-MS/MS in parallel to the LeishIF4E-3 pulled-down products. Each pull-down experiment was performed in triplicates and all samples were analyzed in the same run. The peptides that were pulled down from SBP-tagged LeishIF4E-3 and from SBP-tagged luciferase fractions were identified using the MaxQuant software. The Perseus statistical analysis highlights the proteins that were significantly enriched by at least two fold in the LeishIF4E-3 pulled-down assay, as compared to the luciferase control pulled-down experiment, with p&lt;0.05. This comparison was based on average intensities, calculated from three similar but independent experiments. The proteins enriched in the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules were manually categorized into functional groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s015">S2 Table</xref>. The manual classification highlighted the presence of multiple ribosomal proteins, along with RNA binding proteins, chaperones, signaling proteins and metabolic enzymes. The proteins were also analyzed for their GO term enrichment, using TriTrypDB; using a threshold of four fold enrichment as compared to the gene sets encoded in the genome, with a p&lt; 0.01.</p>

The GO term analysis also highlighted the enrichment of a large number of ribosomal proteins, along with ribonucleoproteins, pre-ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in ribosome maturation. Altogether, our observations suggest that the granules could serve for storage of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits that were stalled due to the nutritional stress.</p>
<p>The LeishIF4E-3 pulled-down granules also contained RNA helicases and RNA-binding proteins, in line with the potential role of these granules in RNA storage. The presence of a variety of metabolic enzymes is intriguing, but supported by a recent report indicating their ability to bind RNA, despite the absence of canonical RNA recognition motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref048">48</xref>]. With respect to translation, while most initiation factors were not detected, the granules contained factors related to the elongation process, namely LeishEF1b and LeishIF5a. The latter has been implicated in elongation, rather than in initiation of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref049">49</xref>]. The enriched fractions also contained LeishPABP2, but not LeishPABP1, which is part of the LeishIF4E-4 canonical complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref050">50</xref>]. The trypanosomatid ortholog TbPABP2 is also found in stress granules in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref052">52</xref>]. It is important to note that RNA degradation enzymes were not highlighted in the LeishIF4E-3 pulled-down granules. This distinguishes the LeishIF4E-3 pulled-down granules from the nutritional stress-induced granules of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, which were purified using a different approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>]. Another notable difference is that classical P-body markers, such as DHH1 and Scd6, were not found in the LeishIF4E-3 granule proteome. The absence of LeishIF4G-4 among the significantly enriched granular proteins is in line with our former report that nutritional stress disrupted the interaction between LeishIF4E-3 and LeishIF4G-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>]. As expected, the starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules contained several chaperones, which usually accompany proteins that are over-expressed in cells. The presence of a few signaling proteins is not surprising, as are the few proteins related to the cytoskeleton. However, the presence of a larger repertoire of nuclear proteins is intriguing.</p>
<p>Using confocal microscopy, we further validated the co-localization of two proteins that were identified in the LeishIF4E-3 starvation granule, namely LeishPABP2 and the <italic>Leishmania</italic> ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g008">Fig 8</xref> (I) and (II) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s007">S7 Fig</xref>]. LeishPABP2 was tagged with SBP and its localization was monitored using anti-SBP monoclonal antibodies. LeishIF4E-3 was stained by rabbit-raised specific antibodies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g008">Fig 8</xref> shows that the two proteins co-localize, at least on a partial basis, which is not surprising, since LeishPABP2 could participate in multiple complexes on top of the granules. For testing co-localization of RPS6 and LeishIF4E-3 during a starvation stress, the protein was stained with rabbit antibodies against RPS6, LeishIF4E-3 was monitored using mouse anti-SBP monoclonal antibodies. The results verify the presence of ribosomal proteins in the starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules. Thus, the confocal analysis suggests both RPS6 and PABP2 co-localize, at least partially, with LeishIF4E-3 in the same nutritional stress-induced granules.</p>

<title>Nutritional stress affects parasite growth, viability and motility <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The effects of specific nutrient stresses on parasite growth and viability were monitored following the depletion of purines, essential amino acids or glucose. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s008">S8 Fig</xref> shows that while removal of each nutrient arrested cell proliferation, their effects on cell viability varied. While prolonged deprivation of either glucose or amino acids was lethal to the cells, the absence of purines over the same period did not reduce viability. Furthermore, the deprivation of each nutrient had a different effect on cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007237.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Eliminating purines as well as amino acids induced the appearance of slender-shaped cells with a long flagellum, which are typical of nectomonad cells, a form that precedes differentiation into metacyclic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref053">53</xref>]. Glucose deprivation resulted in the appearance of "fat" cells, which are usually associated with cell lethality.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we report a direct correlation between the availability of nutrients on translation, post translational modifications of LeishIF4E-3 and on morphological changes. We further propose that the parasites may have developed temporary means to store inactive mRNAs and stalled ribosomes in dedicated granules that also contain LeishIF4E-3, possibly allowing their recycling upon renewal of nutrient availability.</p>
<p>In trypanosomes, TbIF4E-3 is an essential protein, which could support its role in active translation. The <italic>Leishmania</italic> ortholog, LeishIF4E-3, could be assigned a similar role, although it binds the mRNA cap structure rather inefficiently as compared to other LeishIF4Es [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref054">54</xref>]. Indeed, one of the three key aromatic residues in its cap-binding pocket is substituted by methionine, possibly accounting for its weak cap-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref030">30</xref>]. We, therefore, searched for additional functions for LeishIF4E-3 that could coincide with being part of storage bodies for RNA, and possibly inactive ribosomes.</p>
<p>Leishmanias and trypanosomes are known to harbor a multitude of RNA granules, which are formed in response to different stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref055">55</xref>]. We previously reported that during nutritional stress, LeishIF4E-3 concentrated in specific granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>], but the content of these granules was not resolved. We verify here the presence of mature mRNAs in these starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules, in line with our hypothesis that these granules serve as storage bodies for mature mRNAs, such as the <italic>HSP83</italic> transcript. However, it is not clear whether the <italic>HSP83</italic> mRNA concentrates in the granules through a direct association with LeishIF4E-3, or through other RNA-binding proteins that were identified in our proteomic analysis. A partial co-localization of LeishIF4G-4 with the starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules was observed, but mostly in cells starved for amino acids and glucose, and not in cells fully starved (PBS) or starved for purines.</p>
<p>We further characterize the nutritional stress that led to the formation of LeishIF4E-3 containing granules. Depleting purines, amino acids or glucose led to a decrease in translation (with variable kinetics), despite previous reports that mRNA abundance is not altered during purine starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref011">11</xref>]. However, removal of each nutrient had a different effect on cell viability and morphology. Depletion of purines generated elongated slender cells with a long flagellum that maintained their viability and motility, whereas depletion of glucose generated "fat cells" that died within 24 h. The effect of depleting glucose for short periods (4 h) could be reversed, while longer incubations were lethal. Unlike glucose depletion, elimination of purines for a relatively long time (4 days) did not lead to cell death and the cells could easily recover. During recovery, the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules disappeared, and the protein resumed its homogenous cytosolic distribution.</p>
<p>In attempt to examine the nature of the LeishIF4E-3 containing foci following a nutritional stress, we separated extracts of cells expression the SBP-tagged LeishIF4E-3 over sucrose gradients and isolated the dense fractions. These could include the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules, since the non-granulated LeishIF4E-3 remained in the top fractions. A subsequent pull-down step over streptavidin beads enriched the fraction of the putative starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules, which was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. Parallel control cultures expressing SBP-tagged luciferase were treated and processed similarly, and analyzed in the same run, to control for non-specific binding to the streptavidin-Sepharose beads. The statistical analysis identified a significant increase of the bait protein, LeishIF4E-3, along with a large group of ribosomal proteins. Co-localization of the ribosomal protein RPS6 in the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules was verified by confocal microscopy. Although a potential contamination of ribosomal proteins could be attributed to residual polysomes in these dense fractions, these were not enriched in the control experiment with the SBP-luciferase expressing cells. Thus, enrichment of ribosomal proteins in these granules can account for the mechanism by which the parasites store stalled ribosomes.</p>
<p>LeishPABP2 was identified in the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules, and further verified by confocal microscopy. The PABP2 ortholog was also found in stress granules of trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref051">51</xref>]. In response to transcription inhibition by the addition of Actinomycin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref018">18</xref>], LeishPABP2 and LeishPABP3 were also shown to migrate to the nucleus. It is interesting to note that the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules did not contain other translation initiation factors, except for two elongation factors, LeishEF1b and LeishIF5a, with the latter having been shown to be involved in elongation rather than in initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref049">49</xref>]. The possibility that stress granules are active in translation elongation but not in initiation was recently proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref015">15</xref>]. Although we have no evidence that translation elongation is performed in these granules, the significant enrichment of an elongation factor in the granules could support the possibility that a limited elongation process occurred within such bodies. Finally, enrichment with ribosomal proteins was not reported in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, excluding the possibility that translation elongation takes place in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The presence of ribosomal proteins in the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules were also identified through the GO term enrichment analysis, along with several RNA helicases and RNA-binding proteins that usually accompany RNA molecules. The <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>] share several RNA-binding proteins, such as DRB2 and the Lupus La protein. La is an RNA chaperone that can promote translation of cellular RNAs through internal ribosome entry sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref056">56</xref>] and also appears in nutritional stress granules in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>]. PUF proteins and UBP2 usually function as important post-transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref059">59</xref>], both are found in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> nutritional stress granules. A few other RNA-binding domain proteins were found exclusively in the LeishIF4E-3 granules, thereby distinguishing them from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>]. The significant enrichment of metabolic enzymes in the LeishIF4E-3 granules is an intriguing observation. However, recent reports have highlighted a non-classical RNA-binding activity of such enzymes, despite the absence of conventional RNA-binding domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref047">47</xref>]. A non-canonical moonlighting RNA-binding activity was also recorded for several metabolic enzymes in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref048">48</xref>], of which enolase (Tb927.10.2890) was shown to be enriched in our analysis. Other granular polypeptides enriched in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> LeishIF4E-3 containing granules were chaperones, along with signaling proteins, and proteins that presently play unknown roles in the granules, such as nuclear proteins.</p>
<p>Unlike the nutritional stress granules in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>], the LeishIF4E-3 granules described in this paper do not contain RNA degradation enzymes as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref060">60</xref>]. We also could not find typical P-body markers, DHH1 or Scd6, in accordance with our previous report that LeishIF4E-3-containing granules did not co-localize with DHH1 containing granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>]. The absence of RNA degradation enzymes and P-body markers strengthens our conclusion that the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules described in this paper are dedicated mainly for storage of inactive mRNAs and stalled ribosomes, unlike the starvation granules described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref026">26</xref>]. Previous studies based on the content of P-bodies suggest that they are involved not only in storage of translationally repressed mRNAs, but possibly in their decay as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref017">17</xref>]. However, these reports were challenged by studies claiming that purified P-bodies are not involved in mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref061">61</xref>]. Altogether, it appears that P bodies could have a dynamic nature that is highly sensitive to the conditions that induce their formation and content. We can envision how different severities of nutritional stress in trypanosomatids could lead to the appearance of different subsets of granules and to dynamic changes between them. It is also possible that the different methodologies used to purify or enrich the granular fraction led to the identification of two granule sub-populations. Although both studies use a similar starvation protocol (incubation in PBS), the purification processes vary. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> granules were obtained by sequential lysis and centrifugations using the cytoskeletal network as a molecular sieve. However, the <italic>Leishmania</italic> granules were enriched over sucrose gradients followed by pull-down of SBP-tagged LeishIF4E-3 over streptavidin beads.</p>
<p>Finally, all eIF4E orthologs are known to be phospho-proteins, whereby phosphorylation affects their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref063">63</xref>]. Trypanosomatid eIF4Es are also phospho-proteins, but their phosphorylation sites follow a variable profiles. For example, LeishIF4E-4 is phosphorylated at several positions in its N-terminal extended region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref064">64</xref>]. TbIF4E-3 is also phosphorylated in several positions in its extended N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref046">46</xref>]. Here we show that LeishIF4E-3 from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> is phosphorylated in its N-terminal extension as well, but unlike the multiple sites in TbIF4E-3, it is phosphorylated only at position S75. This phosphorylation increased during nutritional stress. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> phosphorylation of LeishIF4E-3 varies from that in other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, since different sites were identified in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>, (S84 and S105), as compared to S75 in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic>. S75 is not conserved in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> or <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref003">3</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007237.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). S84 in <italic>L</italic>. infantum is constitutively phosphorylated and S105 is phosphorylated mainly in promastigotes, and not in axenic amastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref003">3</xref>]. These findings further highlight differences between <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, in addition to the variability between leishmanias and trypanosomes.</p>
<p>In addition to the observed phosphorylation of LeishIF4E-3, additional modifications were noted, such as carbamidomethylation and oxidation, possibly explaining the migration pattern of the mutant protein. The S75A substitution of the phosphorylation site of LeishIF4E-3 from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> reduced its ability to concentrate in granules, the mutant protein also reduced its capacity to bind LeishIF4G-4, though not completely.</p>
<p>The N-terminal extension of LeishIF4E-4 was recently shown to be responsible for binding LeishPABP1 and a similar prediction was made for LeishIF4E-3 in that paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref050">50</xref>]. Our analysis highlights that LeishIF4E-3 and LeishPABP2 co-migrate to the same granules. In that paper, the interaction of LeishIF4E-4 with LeishIF4G-3 was shown to be mediated by the conserved core region of LeishIF4E-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref050">50</xref>]. Similar to the assembly mode of this complex, we previously reported that residue W187 of the LeishIF4E-3 core is required for the interaction with LeishIF4G-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref034">34</xref>].It now appears that in addition to the core region of LeishIF4E-3, its phosphorylated N-terminus also influences this interaction. It is conceivable that substitution of the S75 phosphorylation site at the N-terminal region could have an allosteric effect on binding to LeishIF4G-4, possibly through alteration in the net charge of LeishIF4E-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref066">66</xref>]. Additionally, the interaction between the mutated LeishIF4E-3 and LeishIF4G-4 was reduced, but not completely diminished.</p>
<p>The formation of LeishIF4E-3-containing granules is reversible, since recovery of the nutrient supply caused the LeishIF4E-3 containing granules to disappear. It is not yet clear whether components comprising the nutritional granules were recycled back into the cytoplasm, or whether the granules were fully removed from the cells, possibly by secretion. Removal of metabolites from trypanosomatid cells via exosomes has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref069">69</xref>]. RNA secretion was also reported in trypanosomatids, whereby a heat shock stress that led to an inhibition of splicing caused the excess Spliced Leader RNA to concentrate in cytoplasmic vesicles, which are secreted as exosomes in a mechanism that resembles that of microRNA secretion by mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007237.ref070">70</xref>]. Whether a mechanism of similar nature also occurs for the starvation-induced LeishIF4E-3 containing granules and their associated mRNA molecules remains to be seen.</p>
