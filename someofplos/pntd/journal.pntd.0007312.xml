<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Melioidosis is a fatal infectious disease caused by soil saprophytic bacterium, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>. Infection occurs mostly through the inhalation or percutaneous inoculation of the bacteria from contaminated soil or surface water. The disease manifests with diverse clinical presentations ranging from mild localized infection to fulminant sepsis. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> being a soil saprophyte, uses horizontal gene transfers as a mechanism for its persistence both in the environment and the host. It is possible that the virulence attributes of <italic>B</italic>.<italic>pseudomallei</italic> can significantly vary under the influence of regional environmental/ecological conditions, in turn leading to the occurrence of distinct clinical manifestations. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> is a well-known virulence factor that confers serum resistance and helps in evading host immune defenses during the early stages of infection. In this context, LPS is gaining recognition as a potential candidate for vaccine and diagnostic assay development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref002">2</xref>]. Three genotypes of LPS namely A, B and B2 were reported previously with variations in their geographic distribution and ability to induce immune responses in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref003">3</xref>]. Burkholderia intracellular motility (BimA) and filamentous hemagglutinin gene (<italic>fhaB3</italic>) were reported previously as the significant variable virulence factors based on their geographic distribution and associations with clinical presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Amidst the ambiguity of its true incidence, melioidosis is gaining importance as an emerging infection in the Indian subcontinent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref007">7</xref>]. Sporadic cases reported from different parts of the country have shown assorted clinical presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref010">10</xref>]. Distinct/novel sequence types of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> using multi-locus sequence typing(MLST) were previously reported from the south-western coastal part of India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref011">11</xref>].This geographic region might presumably be one of the endemic hotspots of melioidosis in India reporting several cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref010">10</xref>]. Clinical isolates of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> from this region were genetically diverse from the Australian and Southeast Asian isolates and the prevalent sequence type (ST 1368) lacked significant association with any particular clinical presentation of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref011">11</xref>]. With this background, the present study documents the frequencies of variable virulence factors of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> and their association with clinical presentations of melioidosis and the temporal variations and influence of ecological factors on commonly occurring LPS genotypes of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic>. Moreover, the host and pathogen-specific determinants for mortality are elucidated.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Study site and population</title>
<p>The present study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital with 2030 inpatient capacity that caters residents of southwestern coastal parts of Karnataka, India covering nearly 150–200 km radius of geographical area. This part of the country experiences tropical climatic condition with an annual rainfall of &gt;4000 mm during June-October. Microbiological culture confirmed cases of melioidosis over a decade (2006–2016) were included in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of Kasturba Hospital, Manipal. All the isolates were obtained from the archived collection and the identity of the patients was kept confidential.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Study isolates</title>
<p>Isolates from blood culture in 97 bacteremic cases with (n = 50) or without (n = 47) other organ involvement and from other sites in 102 non-bacteremic cases were included in the study. For the extraction of bacterial DNA, QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Before inclusion, all the study isolates were confirmed as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> using a species-specific PCR targeting the TTSS1 gene cluster as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref012">12</xref>].</p>

<title>Bim A detection</title>
<p>Both variants of Bim A, BimA<sub>Bm</sub> and BimA<sub>Bp</sub>, were detected using previously reported PCR primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>]. PCR reaction volumes and cycling conditions for the detection of BimA genes were similar to that of the LPS genotypes, except for a change in the annealing temperature to 56°C for 1 min. Presence of BimA<sub>Bm</sub> and BimA<sub>Bp</sub> were considered when amplicons sized 104 bp and 60 bp respectively were positive on 2.5% Agarose gel stained with 0.5% ethidium bromide.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistical tools were used to determine the frequencies of categorical study variables. Pearson’s Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test was used to check for the presence of any significant association of host and pathogen characteristics with individual clinical presentations. Risk factors for various clinical presentations and outcomes (in hospital mortality &amp; Discharge Against Medical Advice) among the study population were determined using univariate analysis and step-wise multivariate logistic regression model (Backward LR) (SPSS, version 16). Time series analysis was used to decompose the trend, seasonal and residual components for the climate data and the LPS genotypes. Correlations of the climate data with the LPS genotypes was obtained using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Generalized additive model was used to predict the LPS genotypes using the climate data. Analysis was carried out using R version 3.3.3. All values were considered significant with p≤0.05.</p>

Of the 199 patients, 187 (94%) were from Karnataka and 12 patients (8 from Kerala and 4 from Goa) were from other states on the southwestern coastal part of India (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007312.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Majority of the patients were males (153, 76.9%) and had the disease episode during monsoon (148, 74.3%).</p>

<p>A large number of patients (169, 85%) had either one or more of the severe forms of the disease, like bacteremic (97, 48.7%), pulmonary (71, 35.6%), septicemic (50, 25.1%) neurological (22, 11%) and others like osteoarticular and deep seated abscess (36, 18%). Amongst bacteremic patients, 47 (48.4%) had no other focus of infection as diagnosed clinically or radiologically. In septicemic melioidosis, 38 (76%) patients had bacteremia with or without evident foci and the rest 12 patients had osteoarticular or pulmonary forms of the disease. Localized form of the disease was observed amongst 30 (15%) patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic>, the etiological agent of melioidosis, demands no further negligence in view of its increasing geographical distribution, possession of numerous virulence traits and intrinsic resistance mechanisms to several antimicrobial agents. Severity of the infection and disease outcomes among patients significantly depend on the underlying host-factors, time for diagnosis/detection and befitting medical management. Few hostfactors such as DM, renal dysfunction and chronic alcoholism are well associated with poor disease outcomes among patients with melioidosis. <italic>B</italic>.<italic>pseudomallei</italic> possesses numerous proteins that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>].Some genes that encode these proteins (conferring virulence) are known to be ubiquitously present among all the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>].More recently, a study on the global evolution of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> reported geographically distinct genes/variants, conferring virulence among Australasian and Southeast Asian isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref013">13</xref>]. However, there is a visible scant of whole genome sequencing data and the virulence attributes of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> isolates from regions outside northern Australia and northeast Thailand. Numerous studies have reported the influence of ecological factors on <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> positivity in environmental niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref015">15</xref>]. However, it is currently unknown if there is any influence of the ecological factors on the variable virulence genes of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> and whether these variations in the virulence gene profiles can lead to distinct clinical presentations and outcomes. Given this context, we report here the correlation of ecological factors in a geographical locality on infecting LPS genotypes of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> amongst patients.</p>
<p>Lipopolysaccharide of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> is an important virulence factor that facilitates the evasion of human immune responses during the early stages of infection. Monoclonal antibodies against the LPS of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> were found to reduce the severity of disease in animal models, thus implying the role of LPS as a potential vaccine candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref001">1</xref>].Most intriguing finding from our study is that the majority (74%) of our patients were infected by the LPSB genotype of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic>. This observation is in contrast with the findings from Thailand (2.3%) and Australia (13.8%), where LPSA was reported to be the prevalent infecting genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>]. Immunological responses and disease outcomes among animal models administered with LPS A and B types of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> were reported previously. While LPSA is known to confer serum resistance and grow in the presence of 10–30% of normal human serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref016">16</xref>], evidence from recent experimental and animal model studies suggest that LPSB is a more potent inducer of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and septic-shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref017">17</xref>]. In our previous study ST 1368 was the most common sequence type observed among 32 <italic>B</italic>.<italic>pseudomallei</italic> isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref011">11</xref>]. Out of 14 ST 1368, 12 (85.7%) were LPSB,2 (14.2%) were LPSA and none were LPSB2. This finding suggests that the LPS genotypes can vary among isolates belonging to the same sequence type and thus making it difficult to ‘brand’ a particular ST as either a more or a less virulent one. In the present study, we did not observe a significant association of any of the three genotypes (A, B and B2) with any particular clinical presentation. We observed that infection due to LPSB genotype was an independent risk factor for mortality among our study population. However, we foresee the need for further validating this finding amongst patient populations from other geographic locations.</p>
<p>Expression of Burkholderia intracellular motility (BimA) protein is crucial in the pathogenesis of the disease. Among the two variants of Bim A known, BimA<sub>Bp</sub> was the only variant reported among isolates from Thailand and other South Asian countries. On the contrary, isolates from Australia were reported to have both BimA<sub>Bp</sub> and BimA<sub>Bm</sub> variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>]. Among our study isolates BimA<sub>Bp</sub> variants were more commonly observed, but with no association with any particular clinical form of the disease. Presence of BimA<sub>Bm</sub> was also observed in few (n = 9) of our isolates and had a significant association with neurological presentations. Similar association of BimA<sub>Bm</sub> variant with neurological melioidosis was reported in Australian patients and more recently in a study using mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref018">18</xref>]. Filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is a surface protein of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> involved in adhesion to the host epithelial cells and formation of multinucleated giant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref019">19</xref>].<italic>fhaB3</italic> is one of the three variable genes responsible for encoding the FHA protein, which was reported previously among 100% and 83% of the isolates from Thailand and Australia respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>]. Further, presence of <italic>fhaB3</italic> gene was reported in all the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> isolates obtained from Thai patients with bacteremic form of the disease and absence of <italic>fhaB3</italic> gene was reported to have a significant association with cutaneous melioidosis among Australian patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref004">4</xref>]. Presence of <italic>fhaB3</italic> gene was observed in almost 95% of our study isolates with no significant association with any form of the disease.</p>
<p>The epidemiology of melioidosis is characterized by environmental factors where rainfall plays a key role in transmission of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref020">20</xref>]. Majority of the cases in other endemic nations are known to occur during the monsoon when patients acquire the disease via inhalation or inoculation of the bacteria from soil and water. Occurrence of cases during the dry season, in many instances, is considered as a consequence of long latency and activation of the pathogen from latent foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref021">21</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that the LPSA genotypes had a reverse correlation with rainfall. This finding suggests the possibility of presence of LPSA genotype in dry environmental conditions, unlike the LPSB genotypes, which had a positive correlation with rainfall and humidity. However, we did not observe a significant increase in the occurrence of infections due to the LPSA genotypes during the dry season to support the assumption. Further analyzing the data, a lag period was observed between the occurrence of the cases and rainfall. The observed lag period could not be determined due to lack of enough data points and unavailability of weekly rainfall data, which remains as one of the limitations of our study. Temperature did not show any correlation with the infecting genotypes in our study, which can be attributed to the absence of striking variations in temperature through the year across the western coastal part of the country. Upon dismissing the seasonal trends, LPSB showed a positive correlation with the residual component, suggesting an influence of other environmental factors along with rainfall and humidity which needs further investigations.</p>
<p>Among the co-morbid illnesses observed in the present study population, renal dysfunction was found to be an independent risk factor for septicemic and bacteremic forms of the disease. DM was found to be an independent risk factor for mortality due to melioidosis in our settings, as reported in patients from Thailand and northern parts of Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref023">23</xref>]. Strong association of DM with mortality was not surprising since 62% of the 169 patients with severe form of the disease were diabetic in our study cohort. However, DM did not have any significant association with any one particular form of the disease. Considering the high prevalence (16%) of DM amongst adult population residing in our settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref024">24</xref>], we foresee the need of more focused clinical studies to understand the disease outcome amongst patients with controlled and uncontrolled DM.</p>
<p>In our study cohort, though not statistically significant, we observed localized melioidosis amongst a higher proportion of patients with age &lt;18 years (28.6%) in comparison with those with age &gt;51 years (10.5%). Skin/soft tissue infections were the common clinical presentations among cases of localized melioidosis in our settings. These infections are more likely to occur in children due to their exposure to the bacteria while playing in water lodged fields during monsoon season. Higher frequency of localized, non-bacteremic cases were previously reported among Australian patients belonging to age group of &lt;16 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007312.ref025">25</xref>]. Increased occurrence of localized form of the disease among patients of &lt; 18 years of age can also be attributed to the lack of other predisposing factors responsible for the dissemination.</p>
<p>Put together, the present study reports few important host and pathogen-specific virulence determinants that have significant associations with clinical presentations and disease outcomes among Indian patients infected with <italic>B</italic>.<italic>pseudomallei</italic>. These findings can help in identifying high-risk cohort of patients for future studies aiming to understand the molecular pathogenesis mechanisms of the disease using integrated omics based approaches.</p>
