<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic>, which causes keratitis and blindness in under-resourced countries, is an emerging pathogen worldwide, because of its association with contact lens use. The wall makes cysts resistant to sterilizing reagents in lens solutions and to antibiotics applied to the eye.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) showed purified cyst walls of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> retained an outer ectocyst layer, an inner endocyst layer, and conical ostioles that connect them. Mass spectrometry showed candidate cyst wall proteins were dominated by three families of lectins (named here Jonah, Luke, and Leo), which bound well to cellulose and less well to chitin. An abundant Jonah lectin, which has one choice-of-anchor A (CAA) domain, was made early during encystation and localized to the ectocyst layer of cyst walls. An abundant Luke lectin, which has two carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM49), outlined small, flat ostioles in a single-layered primordial wall and localized to the endocyst layer and ostioles of mature walls. An abundant Leo lectin, which has two unique domains with eight Cys residues each (8-Cys), localized to the endocyst layer and ostioles. The Jonah lectin and glycopolymers, to which it binds, were accessible in the ectocyst layer. In contrast, Luke and Leo lectins and the glycopolymers, to which they bind, were mostly inaccessible in the endocyst layer and ostioles.</p>

<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>The most abundant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst wall proteins are three sets of lectins, which have carbohydrate-binding modules that are conserved (CBM49s of Luke), newly characterized (CAA of Jonah), or unique to <italic>Acanthamoebae</italic> (8-Cys of Leo). Cyst wall formation is a tightly choreographed event, in which lectins and glycopolymers combine to form a mature wall with a protected endocyst layer. Because of its accessibility in the ectocyst layer, an abundant Jonah lectin is an excellent diagnostic target.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>A half century ago, investigators identified cellulose in the <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> cyst wall, which has two layers and conical ostioles that connect them. Here we showed cyst walls contain three large sets of cellulose-binding lectins, which localize to the ectocyst layer (a Jonah lectin) or to the endocyst layer and ostioles (Luke and Leo lectins). We used the lectins to establish a sequence for cyst wall assembly when trophozoites are starved and encyst. In the first stage, a Jonah lectin and glycopolymers were present in dozens of distinct vesicles. In the second stage, a primordial wall contained small, flat ostioles outlined by a Luke lectin. In the third stage, a Jonah lectin remained in the ectocyst layer, while Luke and Leo lectins moved to the endocyst layer and ostioles. A description of the major events during cyst wall development is a starting point for mechanistic studies of its assembly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Acanthamoebae</italic>, which include the genome project <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> Neff strain, are soil protists named for acanthopods (spikes) on the surface of trophozoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref001">1</xref>]. In immunocompetent persons, <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> is a rare but important cause of corneal inflammation (keratitis), which is difficult to treat and so may lead to scarring and blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref004">4</xref>]. In immunosuppressed patients, <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> may cause encephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> is endemic in under-resourced populations in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref011">11</xref>]. <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> is an emerging pathogen in Europe, North America, and Australia, where 80 to 90% of infections are associated with contact lens use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref014">14</xref>]. Because water for washing hands may be scarce in places where the free-living protist is frequent, we recently showed that alcohols in concentrations present in hand sanitizers kill <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> trophozoites and cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>When <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> trophozoites are deprived of nutrients in solution or on agar plates, they form cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref019">19</xref>]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows cyst walls have two microfibril-dense layers (outer ectocyst and inner endocyst), which are separated by a relatively microfibril-free layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref020">20</xref>]. The endocyst and ectocyst layers are connected to each other by conical ostioles, through which the protist escapes during excystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The cyst wall of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> protects free-living protists from osmotic shock when exposed to fresh water, drying when exposed to air, or starvation when deprived of bacteria or other food sources. The cyst wall also acts as a barrier, sheltering parasites from killing by disinfectants used to clean surfaces, sterilizing agents in contact lens solutions, and/or antibiotics applied directly to the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We are interested in the cyst wall proteins of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> for three reasons. First, although monoclonal antibodies to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> have been made, the majority react to trophozoites, and no cyst wall proteins have been molecularly identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref027">27</xref>]. Indeed the only cyst-specific protein identified, which was named for its 21-kDa predicted size (CSP21), is unlikely to be a cyst wall protein, as it lacks a signal peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref028">28</xref>]. A cyst wall protein that is unique, abundant, accessible, and conserved across many strains of <italic>Acanthamoebae</italic> would therefore be an excellent target for a new diagnostic antibody. Second, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> and related species are the only human pathogens that contain cellulose in their wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref031">31</xref>]. <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, which also has cellulose in its walls, is not a significant pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition, the whole genome of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> predicts a set of candidate cyst wall proteins that contain two or three carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM49s), which are homologs of a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain (SlCBM49) of the <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> (tomato) endocellulase SlGH9C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref036">36</xref>]. Further, the genome predicts a chitin (a polymer of β-1,4-linked GlcNAc) synthase, a chitinase, and two chitin deacetylases, suggesting the possibility that chitin and chitin-binding proteins are also present in the cyst wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref037">37</xref>]. Note, however, that monosaccharide analysis of cyst wall glycopolymers revealed β-1,4-linked glucose and galactose rather than GlcNAc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref031">31</xref>]. Third, we are interested in whether abundant cyst wall proteins localize to particular structures in the mature wall: ectocyst layer, endocyst layer, and ostioles. If so, the location of these proteins at numerous time points during encystation might provide insights into how the cyst wall is assembled.</p>
<p>Our experimental design was relatively simple. We used TEM, as well as structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and probes for glycopolymers, to judge the intactness and cleanliness of purified <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref038">38</xref>]. We used mass spectrometry to identify candidate cyst wall proteins, which were compared to proteins present in walls of other protists, bacteria, fungi, and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref039">39</xref>]. We used SIM to localize abundant cyst wall proteins, each of which was tagged with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed under its own promoter, in encysting protists and in mature cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref041">41</xref>]. We also determined whether each cyst wall protein, expressed as a GFP-tagged protein under a constitutive glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter in trophozoites or as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the periplasm of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, binds to microcrystalline cellulose and/or chitin beads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref042">42</xref>]. Finally, we used anti-GFP antibodies and MBP-cyst wall protein fusions to test the accessibility of proteins and glycopolymers, respectively, in the ectocyst and endocyst layers of mature walls.</p>
<p>In this way, we began to answer five basic questions concerning <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst wall proteins: What are their identities? When are they made?

For SIM, cysts in 500-μl lysis buffer were broken four times for 2 min each with 200 μl of 0.5 mm glass beads in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). For TEM, where glass beads cannot be used, cysts in 200-μl lysis buffer were broken by sonication four times for 20 seconds each in continuous mode in a Sonicator Cell Disruptor (formerly Heat Systems Ultrasonic, now Qsonica, Newtown, CT). Broken cysts were added to the top a 15-ml falcon tube containing 60% sucrose in <sub>dd</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O and centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 10 min. Bead beating breaks 95 to 100% of cysts.

In an Eppendorf tube, 4 μg of Midiprep (PureLink HiPure Midiprep Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) plasmid DNA was diluted to 100 μl with non-nutrient medium. Twenty microliters of SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen Inc, Germantown, MD) was added to the DNA suspension, mixed gently by pipetting five times, and incubated for 10 min at RT. Six hundred microliters of non-nutrient medium were added to the DNA-SuperFect mix, and the entire suspension was added to the trophozoites adhering to the 6-well culture plate. The culture plate was incubated for 3 hr at 30°C, after which the non-nutrient medium was replaced with ATCC medium 712 and incubated for another 24 hr at 30°C. To select for transfectants, we added 12.5 μg/ml of Gibco G418 antibiotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the culture after 24 hr, and we changed the medium plus antibiotic every four days. After 2 to 4 weeks, the transfectants were growing robustly in the presence of the antibiotic, and trophozoites and/or cysts expressing GFP were detected by widefield microscopy.

<p>In summary, TEM and SIM both showed that ectocyst and endocyst layers, as well as ostioles, were intact in purified cyst walls, which were relatively free of cellular material. While GST-CBM49, WGA, and CFW, as well as abundant cyst wall proteins (see below), were extremely useful for distinguishing structures in the developing and mature cyst walls, their lack of carbohydrate-binding specificity (again see below) made it impossible to distinguish whether ectocyst layer, endocyst layer, and ostioles were composed of cellulose, chitin, or both glycopolymers. Indeed, nowhere in this paper have we shown that chitin or chitosan are present in cyst walls of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic>.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry showed candidate cyst wall proteins of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> were encoded by multigene families and contained tandem repeats of short domains</title>
<p>Trypsin treatment of purified <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst walls, which was followed by LC-MS/MS of the released peptides, gave similar results in five biological experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0007352.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s012">S2 Excel file</xref>). While some proteins remained in cyst walls after trypsin digestion, their identities were similar to those detected in the soluble fractions by in gel-digests with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Candidate cyst wall proteins with the most unique peptides identified by LC-MS/MS belonged to three families, which we named Luke, Leo, and Jonah lectins, because each bound to cellulose +/- chitin (see below). Although it was impossible to draw a line that separates actual cyst wall proteins from contaminating proteins, secreted proteins with 18+ unique peptides included six Leo lectins, four Luke lectins, and three Jonah lectins. The vast majority of proteins with &lt;18 unique peptides were predicted to be cytosolic (including CSP21) and so were likely intracellular contaminants of cyst wall preparations. The exception to this hypothesis, we think, were additional Luke, Leo, and Jonah lectins, which were most likely less abundant cyst wall proteins.

<p>Luke lectins were comprised of an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by two or three CBM49s that were separated by Ser- and Pro-rich spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007352.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref050">50</xref>]. The N-terminal CBM49 of Luke lectins contained three conserved Trp resides conserved in SlCBM49 from tomato.

The other CBM49s (middle and/or C-terminal) of Luke lectins had two conserved Trp residues. Luke lectins were acidic (pI 5 to 6) and had formula weights (FWs) from 27 to 29-kDa (two CBM49s) or 42 to 44-kDa (three CBM49s). There were no predicted transmembrane helices or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors in the Luke or Leo lectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref052">52</xref>]. LC-MS/MS of the released cell wall peptides identified at least one unique peptide corresponding to all 12 genes encoding Luke lectins, although the number of unique peptides varied from 78 to two (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0007352.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s012">S2 Excel file</xref>). In general, Luke lectins with two CBM49s had more unique peptides than Luke lectins with three CBM49s. One to four unique peptides were derived from three CBM49-metalloprotease fusion-proteins, which consisted of an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a single CBM49 with four conserved Trp residues and a metalloprotease (ADAM/reprolysin subtype) with a conserved catalytic domain (HEIGHNLGGNH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>].

<p>Leo lectins were comprised of an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by two repeats of a unique 8-Cys domain, some of which were separated by a long Thr-, Lys-, and His-rich spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007352.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Leo lectins without a spacer were acidic (pI ~4.8) and had FWs from 19 to 24-kDa, while Leo lectins with the TKH-rich spacer were basic (pI ~8.3) and had FWs from 36- to 59-kDa. Leo lectins were encoded by 16 genes, of which 14 proteins were identified by our LC-MS/MS analysis. While the number of unique peptides varied from 34 to one, Leo lectins without a spacer generally had more unique peptides than Leo lectins with the TKH-rich spacer. We used abundant Leo lectin without a spacer (ACA1_074730) to perform RT-PCR, make rabbit anti-peptide antibodies, and make MBP- and GFP-fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Jonah lectins were comprised of an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one or three choice-of-anchor A (CAA) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007352.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>]. The binding activity of the CAA domain, which is adjacent to a collagen-binding domain in a microbial surface component recognizing the adhesive matrix molecule (MSRAMM) of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, was not characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref057">57</xref>]. Jonah(1) lectins with a single CAA domain were acidic (pI ~6), had a FW from 44 to 58-kDa and had an N-terminal Thr-, Lys-, and Cys-rich domain. A Jonah(3) lectin with three CAA domains was basic (pI ~8.8), had a FW of ~146-kDa, and contained Ser- and Pro-rich spacers between CAA domains, as well as hydrophobic regions that may be transmembrane helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref051">51</xref>]. Jonah lectins were encoded by eight genes, of which five were identified by our LC-MS/MS analysis based on one to 147 unique peptides. We used an abundant Jonah(1) lectin (ACA1_164810) with a single CAA domain to perform RT-PCR, make rabbit anti-peptide antibodies, and make MBP- and GFP-fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Other secreted proteins with 18+ unique peptides detected by LC-MS/MS, which are candidate cyst wall proteins, included a laccase with three copper oxidase domains (ACA1_068450), a protein with a C-terminal ferritin-like domain (ACA1_292810), a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor (ACA1_291590), a conserved uncharacterized protein (ACA1_068630), and a protein unique to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> (ACA1_145900) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref058">58</xref>]. Interestingly, a bacterial laccase has been shown to bind cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref059">59</xref>]. There were also three serine proteases, which have been localized to the secretory system of encysting <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>These results suggested that the most abundant candidate cyst wall proteins of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> contain tandem repeats of conserved domains (CBM49 in Luke lectins and CAA in Jonah lectins) or a unique domain (8-Cys in Leo lectins). Peptides corresponding to nearly all members of each gene family were detected by mass spectrometry. However, the relative abundances of unique peptides for each cyst wall protein varied by more than an order of magnitude, suggesting marked differences in gene expression. Because it was not possible to separate cyst walls into component parts (endocyst and ectocyst layers and ostioles) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides, we used SIM and GFP-tags to localize abundant members of each protein family in cyst walls of transfected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> (see below).</p>

<title>Origins and diversity of genes that encode Luke, Leo, and Jonah lectins</title>
<p>Leo lectins, which had two domains with 8-Cys each, appeared to be unique to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic>, as no homologs were identified when BLAST analysis were performed using the nonredundant (NR) database at NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref035">35</xref>]. The origin of genes encoding Luke lectins was difficult to infer, because its CBM49s showed only a 31% identity over a short (77-amino acid) overlap with a predicted cellulose-binding protein of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> (expect value of BLASTP was just 7e-05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref056">56</xref>]. In contrast, the CAA domain of Jonah lectins appeared to derive from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), as no other eukaryote contained CAA domains, and there was a 28% identity over a bigger (263-aa) overlap with a choice-of anchor A family protein of <italic>Saccharibacillus sp</italic>. <italic>O16</italic> (5e-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>]. The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> laccase (also known as copper oxidase), whose signals were abundant in the mass spectra, was likely the product of HGT from bacteria, as there was a 44% identity over a large (526-aa) overlap with a copper oxidase of <italic>Caldicobacteri oshimai</italic> (6e-135) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref058">58</xref>]. The uncertainty was based upon the presence of similar enzymes in plants, one of which (<italic>Ziziphus jujube</italic>) showed a 39% identity over a 484-aa overlap (4e-101) with the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> laccase.</p>
<p>No pairs of genes within each lectin family were syntenic as defined by AmoebaDB, indicating duplicated genes are paralogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref036">36</xref>]. With the exception of two Luke lectins (ACA1_253500 and ACA1_253650) that were 98% identical and two Leo lectins (ACA1_074770 and ACA1_083920) that were 85% identical, members of each family of cyst wall proteins differed in amino acid sequence by &gt;40%. Genes that encode cyst wall proteins also varied in the number of introns (zero to two in Luke, two to four in Leo, and zero to 24 in Jonah). Searches of genomic sequences of 11 strains of <italic>Acanthamoebae</italic>, deposited in AmoebaDB without protein predictions by Andrew Jackson of the University of Liverpool, using TBLASTN and sequences of abundant Luke, Leo, and Jonah lectins localized in the next section, showed four results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref036">36</xref>]. First, although stop codons were difficult to identify using this method, all 11 strains appeared to encode each cyst wall protein. Second, most strains showed 100 to 200-amino acid stretches of each cyst wall protein that were 80 to 90% identical to the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> Neff strain studied here. These stretches did not include low complexity spacers, which were difficult to align. Third, some of the strains showed greater differences from the Neff strain in each cyst wall protein, consistent with previous descriptions of <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> strain diversity based upon 18S rDNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref061">61</xref>]. Fourth, while coding sequences and 5’ UTRs were well-conserved, intron sequences were very poorly conserved, with the exception of branch-point sequences.</p>
<p>In summary, genes encoding Jonah lectins and laccase likely derived by HGT, while genes encoding Leo lectins appeared to originate within <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic>. Although CBM49s of Luke lectins shared common ancestry with plants and other Amoebazoa, their precise origin was not clear. For the most part, gene duplications that expanded each family within the <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> genome occurred a long time ago, as shown by big differences in amino acid sequences of paralogous proteins and variations in the number and sequences of introns. Regardless, the set of Luke, Leo, and Jonah lectins identified by mass spectrometry, as well as the sequences of abundant cyst wall proteins localized in the next section, appeared to be conserved among 11 sequenced isolates of <italic>Acanthamoebae</italic>.</p>

GFP-tagged candidate cyst wall proteins expressed under their own promoter were absent in the vast majority of log-phase trophozoites, while GFP-tagged cyst wall proteins were present in small numbers in trophozoites in stationary cultures, where a few organisms began to encyst spontaneously.</p>

The glycopolymer detected with WGA was also made early and was present in vesicles of varying sizes, which did not overlap with those containing Jonah(1)-GFP. The glycopolymer labeled with GST-CBM49 was also made early in dozens of small vesicles, which were distinct from those labeled with WGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007352.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Glycopolymers labeled with CFW were not visible in organisms encysting for 3 and 6 hr, but CFW labeled a thin, spherical wall after 9 hr encystation.

<p>These results suggested carbohydrate-binding specificities or protein-protein interactions were more important than timing of expression for localization of Jonah(1) and Luke(2) lectins. While the Jonah(1) lectin localized to the ectocyst layer, Luke and Leo lectins, which do not share common ancestry, both localized to the endocyst layer and ostioles. Finally, Luke lectins with either two or three CBM49s localized to the same place.</p>
<p>Numerous control experiments suggested the timing of expression and locations of the GFP-tagged cyst wall proteins in cyst walls were accurate. First, RT-PCR showed that mRNAs of abundant Luke(2), Leo, and Jonah(1) lectins, as well as cellulose synthase (ACA1_349650), were absent or nearly absent from trophozoites but were present during the first three days of encystation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In contrast, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which catalyzes the sixth step in glycolysis, was expressed by both trophozoites and encysting <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref041">41</xref>]. Second, monospecific, polyclonal rabbit antibodies to a 50-amino acid peptide of an abundant Jonah(1) lectin and a 16-amino acid peptide of an abundant Leo lectin bound to Western blots of proteins from cysts but not from trophozoites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We were unable to generate rabbit antibodies to the Luke(2) lectin, using methods that worked to make antibodies to Jonah(1) and Leo lectins. Because the rabbit anti-peptide antibodies failed to recognize native proteins, none was useful for localizing cyst wall proteins by SIM. Third, GFP-tagged CSP21 expressed under its own promoter was present in cytosolic accumulations of mature cysts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref062">62</xref>]. As CSP21 is homologous to universal stress proteins and lacks an N-terminal signal peptide, its presence in the cytosol after nutrient deprivation was expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref063">63</xref>]. Fourth, a GFP-fusion protein (SP-GFP), which was appended with an N-terminal signal peptide from the Luke(2) lectin and expressed under a GAPDH promoter, localized to secretory vesicles of cysts but not to cyst walls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).

<p>Although we expected Luke lectins with two or three CBM49s would be present in the cellulose-rich cyst wall, we could not have predicted the other abundant cyst wall proteins, because the 8-Cys domains of Leo lectins are unique to <italic>Acanthamoebae</italic> and the CAA domains of Jonah lectins were previously uncharacterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref057">57</xref>]. While Luke lectins have two or three CBM49s, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> has dozens of proteins with a single CBM49 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The Luke lectins bind cellulose and chitin, while the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> proteins with a single CBM49 bind cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref056">56</xref>]. Chitin-binding by DdCBM49 or SlCBM49 was not tested, because this glycopolymer is not present in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> and tomato walls. Demonstration that CBM49s of the Luke lectin also bind chitin fibrils is new, but is consistent with recent studies showing CBMs may bind more than one glycopolymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref055">55</xref>]. The metalloprotease fused to an N-terminal CBM49 of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> is absent in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>, while <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> adds two CBM49s to a cysteine proteinase, which lacks these domains in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic>. The CBM49 may act to localize the metalloproteases to the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst wall, as is the case for the chitin-binding domain in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> Jessie lectins or glucan-binding domain in a <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> glucanase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref067">67</xref>]. Alternatively, the CBM49 may suggest the metalloprotease cleaves glycopeptides rather than peptides. While the GH5 glycoside hydrolases of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> lack CBM49s, CBM49 is present at the C-terminus of GH9 glycoside hydrolases of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>lycopersicum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Even though <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> Leo lectins and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> Jacob lectins share no common ancestry, they have 8-Cys and 6-Cys lectin domains, respectively, often separated by low complexity sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref068">68</xref>]. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> low complexity sequences vary from strain to strain, contain cryptic sites for cysteine proteases, and are extensively decorated with <italic>O</italic>-phosphate-linked glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref069">69</xref>]. We have not yet identified any Asn-linked or <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans on Leo lectins or any of the other cyst wall proteins, but we expect they will be there. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> and oomycetes (<italic>Pyromyces</italic> and <italic>Neocallmistic</italic>) each contain proteins with arrays of CAA domains, but the sequences of the CAAs are so different that it is likely that concatenation of domains occurred independently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref054">54</xref>].

Concatenation of carbohydrate-binding domains in Luke, Leo, and Jonah(3) lectins, which has previously been shown in WGA, Jacob lectins of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, and peritrophins of insects, most likely increases the avidity of the lectins for glycopolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref070">70</xref>].</p>

<title>Three distinct stages in the development of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst wall</title>
<p>While the boundaries between the three stages of the development of the cyst wall were somewhat arbitrary (based upon the times selected for examining cyst walls with SIM), each stage had several essential, distinguishing features. In the first stage, encysting organisms rapidly and in an explosive manner transformed from amoeboid trophozoites, which were full of vacuoles and have acanthopods, to immotile, rounded forms making glycopolymers and Jonah(1) lectins in dozens of distinct vesicles. Because vesicles labeled with WGA and GST-CBM49 did not overlap, it is likely that they contain different glycopolymers. Definitive identification of glycopolymers in vesicles of encysting organisms will depend upon localization of tagged cellulose and chitin synthases, each of which is encoded by a single gene in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref037">37</xref>]. Encysting <italic>Entamoebae</italic> also transform from amoeboid trophozoites to immotile, rounded forms making chitin, chitinase, and the Jacob lectin in distinct vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref064">64</xref>]. Encysting <italic>Giardia</italic> also transform from flagellated forms with an adherence disc to an spherical, immotile forms making β-1,3-linked GalNAc glycopolymer and cyst wall proteins (CWP1 to CWP3) in distinct vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref065">65</xref>]. In contrast, no dramatic secretory event occurs in fungi or plants, which remodel their walls with growth, differentiation, or cell division, but never make their walls from scratch, with exception of the septum separating dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref072">72</xref>].</p>
<p>In second stage, the two most remarkable features of the primordial cyst wall were the distinct distributions of the GFP-tagged lectins and the sets of small, circular ostioles. Early on, Jonah(1)-GFP was homogenously distributed across the primordial wall, while Luke(2)-GFP outlined some ostioles. Later, Luke(2)-GFP spread across the primordial wall, while Leo-GFP appeared in patches, which were not specific to any structure. It was as if Leo-GFP was secreted onto the surface of second stage organisms but had not yet found the glycopolymer to which it binds. Because the ostioles labeled with the least specific external probe (CFW), it was not possible to determine whether ostioles are composed of cellulose, chitin, or another glycopolymer. Indeed CFW has been shown to bind numerous β-1,3 and β-1,4 polysaccharides, including cellulose, chitin, mixed linkage glucans, and galactoglucomannan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref047">47</xref>]. The presence of the internal probe Luke(2)-GFP in the small ostioles did not settle this problem, as Luke(2)-GFP extracted from lysed trophozoites bound to both microcrystalline cellulose and chitin beads. As ostioles labeled with CFW before they contained Luke(2)-GFP, it is likely that glycopolymers are the drivers behind the circular or ring-like structures. How the small ostioles simultaneously appear in an even distribution across the surface of the primordial cyst wall and synchronously develop into conical structures is of great interest but is beyond the scope of the present study. Because <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> has almost nine ostioles but uses just one for the excysting trophozoite to escape the cyst wall, it is likely that ostioles serve other functions such as holding layers of the cyst wall together and/or exchanging nutrients or waste products with the environment.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the Jonah(1) lectin and the glycopolymer that it binds remained in the ectocyst layer, while Luke(2) and Leo lectins and the glycopolymers that they bind move to the endocyst layer and ostioles. In the same way, the outer primary layer of plant cells forms before the inner secondary layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref072">72</xref>]. The distinct distributions of the three GFP-tagged lectins in the primordial, third stage, and mature cyst walls strongly suggests each lectin binds to different glycopolymers (e.g. cellulose versus chitin), glycopolymers modified in different ways (e.g. unmodified chitin versus deacetylated chitosan), and/or glycopolymers with different microfibrillar structures (e.g. microcrystalline versus amorphous cellulose). In support of this idea, the lectins had the same localization in mature cyst walls when expressed as an internal probe with a GFP-tag under its own or under a constitutive GAPDH promoter or when applied externally as an MBP-fusion. There may also be protein-protein interactions and/or lectin-glycoprotein interactions, which determine the localization of cyst wall lectins in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cyst wall. As an example of protein-protein interactions, an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> Jessie lectin has a chitin-binding domain and a self-agglutinating “daub” domain, which makes cyst walls impermeable to small probes such as phalloidin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref064">64</xref>]. As an example of lectin-glycan interactions, the Gal/GalNAc lectin on the plasma membrane of <italic>Entamoebae</italic> binds to glycans on Jacob lectins, which, in turn, bind to chitin fibrils in the cyst wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Anti-GFP antibodies and MBP-lectin fusions showed Jonah(1) lectin and glycopolymers to which it binds are accessible in the ectocyst layer of mature cyst walls, while Luke(2) and Leo lectins and the glycopolymers to which they bind are, for the most part, inaccessible in the endocyst layer and ostioles. Jonah(1) lectin, which is unique, abundant, accessible, and conserved across many strains, therefore, is an excellent target for diagnostic antibody to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cysts. Diagnostic antibodies bind to abundant cyst wall protein 1 of <italic>Giardia</italic> and Jacob2 lectin of <italic>Entamoeba</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref074">74</xref>]. In contrast, Luke(2) and Leo lectins are inaccessible and so not good targets for diagnostic antibodies.</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>Caveats</title>
<p>While abundant Luke(2) and Luke(3) lectins with two or three CBM49s, respectively, localized to the endocyst layer and ostioles of mature cyst walls, we have no evidence that other less abundant Luke lectins localize in the same place. In the same way, we do not know whether other Leo lectins localize to the endocyst layer and ostioles, or other Jonah lectins localize to the ectocyst layer. The large number of genes encoding Luke, Leo, and Jonah lectins may simply be necessary to increase the quantity of proteins coating glycopolymers in the cyst wall. Alternatively, there may be differences in timing and localization of proteins within the same family, based upon a TKH-rich spacer in Leo lectins or transmembrane helices in Jonah(3) lectins with three CAA domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007352.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Finally, other candidate cyst wall proteins, which are abundant but present at lower copy numbers (e.g. laccase or ferritin-domain protein) and so not tested here, may have important functions in the cyst wall.</p>
<p>While localization of abundant lectins was highly reproducible throughout cyst wall development, identification of the glycopolymers to which they bound was much more difficult. First, while each of the lectins bound well to microcrystalline cellulose, the lectins also bound to varying degrees to chitin beads. Second, the N-terminal CBM49 of a Luke(2) lectin fused to GST bound to the ectocyst layer of mature cyst walls, while N- and C-terminal CBM49s of the same Luke(2) lectin fused to MBP bound to the endocyst layer and ostioles. Third, WGA, bound to the ostioles and endocyst layer, the ectocyst layer, or all three structures of mature cyst walls, depending upon the experiment. Fourth and finally, experiments with anti-GFP antibodies and MBP-lectin fusions showed that proteins and glycopolymers in the endocyst layer and ostioles of mature cyst walls are, for the most part, inaccessible to external probes. We, therefore, cannot make any conclusions at this time as to the locations of cellulose and chitin in developing and mature cyst walls. In particular, we do not think it is a simple as cellulose in the ectocyst layer and chitin in the endocyst layer, as suggested by binding of GST-CBM49 and WGA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007352.g002">Fig 2</xref>. However, localization of cellulose and/or chitin in vesicles of encysting organisms and in cyst walls is a solvable problem with 1) more specific probes for each glycopolymer, 2) GFP-tags for cellulose and chitin synthases that are each encoded by single genes, 3) protease or chemical treatments to expose glycopolymers to external probes, cellulases, and chitinases, and/or 4) inhibition of chitin and cellulose synthases with pharmacological agents or silencing RNAs. Indeed other investigators have explored the possibility of cellulose synthase inhibitors or cellulases as therapeutics versus <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref075">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref078">78</xref>].</p>

The former are preceded by Thr-, Lys-, and Cys-rich sequences (gray), while the latter are separated by Ser- and Pro-rich spacers (blue) and hydrophobic domains (tan). Predicted proteins of oomycetes (<italic>Pyromyces</italic> or <italic>Neocallimastix</italic>) have three to five CAA domains, while the spore coat protein of <italic>Bacilllus</italic> has a single CAA domain attached to a collagen-binding domain, which is absent in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007352.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
