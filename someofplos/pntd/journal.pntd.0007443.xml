<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic>’s ability to restrict arbovirus transmission makes it a promising tool to combat mosquito-transmitted diseases. <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are currently being released in locations such as Brazil, which regularly experience concurrent outbreaks of different arboviruses. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> can become co-infected with, and transmit multiple arboviruses with one bite, which can complicate patient diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<title>Methodology/principle findings</title>
<p>Using experimental oral infection of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and then RT-qPCR, we examined ZIKV/DENV-1 and ZIKV/DENV-3 co-infection in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and observed that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes experienced lower prevalence of infection and viral load than wildtype mosquitoes, even with an extra infecting virus.

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is an endosymbiotic bacterium that infects insects. It has been artificially transferred into <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a mosquito species that can transmit medically important viruses including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> limits infection with these viruses, making the mosquitoes much less capable of transmitting them to people. In tropical areas, where these viral pathogens are commonly found, it is not unusual for outbreaks of different viruses to occur at the same time, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment for those afflicted. Mosquitoes with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are currently being released into these areas to reduce transmission of these diseases. In our study, we assessed whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes could still effectively inhibit the dengue and Zika viruses if the mosquitoes were fed both viruses at the same time. We found that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was still very effective at inhibiting the replication of both viruses in the mosquito, and likewise still greatly reduced the chance of transmission of either virus. Our results suggest that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes should be able to limit infection with more than one virus, should they encounter them in the field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arboviruses, viruses transmitted by arthropods including <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, cause diseases that represent a serious threat to human health, with more than half of the global population at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref002">2</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the impact of these diseases is growing, as there has been an increase in case numbers of established arboviral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref005">5</xref>], while several other arboviruses have emerged as potential disease agents of the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref007">7</xref>]. Consequently, finding a means to reduce the impact of these diseases is a significant public health issue.</p>
<p>The most significant viral pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes is dengue virus (DENV), which can cause severe fever, and produces an estimated 390 million infections per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref001">1</xref>]. DENV is highly prevalent in Latin America, and in South and Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref003">3</xref>]. There are four known DENV serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4), and a subsequent infection with a second serotype can produce far more severe symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref008">8</xref>]. This is particularly problematic, given that the multiple serotypes often co-circulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref011">11</xref>]. Compounding this issue is the lack of adequate treatment for dengue infections. There is no antiviral therapy, and while a vaccine effective against all four serotypes has been involved in late-stage clinical trials, the results have proven controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Another notable arbovirus is Zika virus (ZIKV), which was first isolated from febrile sentinel monkeys in 1947, in the Ziika forest of Uganda, and then emerged from relative obscurity to cause a massive outbreak that peaked during 2015–2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref014">14</xref>]. The majority of cases of ZIKV appear to be asymptomatic, however infection has been associated with significant clinical consequences, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is an important vector of arboviruses including DENV, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and ZIKV. It has a broad distribution across tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, where it lives in close association with human dwellings, and typically lays eggs in discarded containers that collect rainwater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref019">19</xref>]. Adult female <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> feed on human blood in order to produce eggs, and they can become infected with an arbovirus after biting someone who is viremic. Within the mosquito, the virus invades the cells of the midgut epithelial layer where it exploits a range of host factors in order to replicate, and then releases mature virions that eventually infect the salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref022">22</xref>]. This process takes approximately 7–14 days, depending on intrinsic and extrinsic factors including mosquito genetic background and environmental temperature, after which the mosquito can transmit the virus to new people when it bites them.</p>
<p>With the exception of yellow fever and Japanese Encephalitis virus, there are no effective commercially available vaccines against mosquito-borne arboviral diseases, and there are few viable treatment options available for those infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref002">2</xref>]. For these reasons, disease prevention strategies are usually focused on mosquito control, relying on population elimination by clearing breeding sites, and using chemical insecticides to quickly and effectively kill mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref023">23</xref>]. However, maintaining persistent control of mosquito populations is a difficult and costly prospect, which has led to the development of many novel mosquito control strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>One such strategy involves <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>, a maternally inherited bacterial endosymbiont of arthropods and worms that naturally occurs in at least 40% of terrestrial insect species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref025">25</xref>]. Stable, heritable <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> have been generated by transinfection, the injection of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from a donor species into <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref029">29</xref>]. These <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes have been deployed in the field in multiple countries that experience high, endemic DENV transmission, as part of the World Mosquito Program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is suitable for the biological control of mosquitoes because infection alters mosquito physiology and reproductive biology in ways that make them less effective vectors, facilitating the spread of the bacteria into wild populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref033">33</xref>]. This ability to spread is due to cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation that acts as a natural form of genetic drive specific to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref035">35</xref>]. Cytoplasmic incompatibility occurs because the mating of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected males to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>–uninfected females does not result in viable progeny. In contrast, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected females produce viable, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected progeny when mating to any male, thereby, proportionally increasing the number of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected individuals.</p>
<p>Infection with some <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains causes pathogen blocking—the restriction of viral infection and replication in the tissues and reduced likelihood of transmission in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> strongly inhibits infection with viruses harmful to humans such as DENV, CHIKV, Mayaro virus, West Nile virus, YFV, and ZIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref042">42</xref>], and has been demonstrated to make them less effective vectors for a range of medically important mosquito-transmitted viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref044">44</xref>]. Multiple interactions between the mosquito immune system and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have been characterized, however it is still unclear if any of these are definitively involved in virus blocking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref045">45</xref>]. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may stimulate the host immune system to respond more effectively to viral infection, as the endosymbiont causes broad-spectrum immune induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref048">48</xref>]. It notably increases the expression of many immune genes, including antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref050">50</xref>]. It also induces the production of reactive oxygen species, a key factor in antimicrobial immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref047">47</xref>]. There are also putative links between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and the mosquito RNAi immune pathway, through the gene Argonaute 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref051">51</xref>]. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection alters miRNA production, and the subsequent changes to gene expression could impact on viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref052">52</xref>]. It causes the downregulation of an insulin receptor that is linked to DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref053">53</xref>]. Finally, there is evidence that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> preferentially utilizes host resources, like cholesterol, that are also required for viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Releases of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes infected by the <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain have been ongoing in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil since 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tinyurl.com/WMPBrazil" xlink:type="simple">https://tinyurl.com/WMPBrazil</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref056">56</xref>]. Mosquito control strategies in disease-endemic regions, including Rio de Janeiro, may be complicated by the co-circulation of different arboviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref057">57</xref>]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that humans can become infected with more than one mosquito-transmitted virus at a time, complicating diagnosis and recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref058">58</xref>]. Recent studies have also determined that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> can harbour and transmit more than one virus, after experimental co-infection, suggesting that a single mosquito bite could lead to a person contracting two diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref060">60</xref>]. Interestingly, co-infection may lead to competition between viruses, producing differential infection rates, and even altering transmission rates. For instance, during co-infection with ZIKV/DENV-2, the transmission of ZIKV is favoured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref059">59</xref>]. Other studies have shown that co-infection can promote viral infection and transmission. For example, sequential infection with ZIKV and CHIKV enhances ZIKV transmission in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref061">61</xref>], and co-infection of CHIKV/DENV-2 leads to increased replication of DENV, compared to mono-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref062">62</xref>]. Little is known about the impact of co-infection on the mosquito immune system, however there are differences in the host proteomic profile for CHIKV/DENV co-infected and mono-infected mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref063">63</xref>], which suggests that there is some impact.</p>
<p>However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have described the effects of viral co-infection in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes. Given that the mechanism of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced pathogen blocking may be immune based, we were interested to see how the bacterium responded to infection with multiple arboviruses. Any decrease of blocking activity would be particularly important given that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes are currently being released into areas where multiple medically important arboviruses are transmitted. For these reasons, we sought to determine whether co-infection with ZIKV and DENV-1, or with ZIKV and DENV-3, all recently circulating in Brazil, would lead to less effective pathogen blocking in the <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> line that is currently being used for mosquito control in that country, as well as in other parts of the world. To do so, we orally challenged <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes with ZIKV/DENV-1 or ZIKV/DENV-3, and then examined disseminated infection rates and viral load in mosquito heads and thoraces at 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection (dpi). We also examined the effect on virus transmission, using saliva samples collected at 14 and 21dpi.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the nature of interactions between <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, arboviruses and the mosquito immune system, we examined the effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection, and ZIKV/DENV co-infection on five candidate genes that had previously been linked to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced viral interference and/or mosquito response to viral infection. We selected two genes that had previously been associated with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection and virus interference: Defensin C (DEFC), an antimicrobial peptide that is upregulated during <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>], and Transferrin 1 (TSF), an iron-binding protein with a putative immune role, which is upregulated during <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>]. We selected Niemann-Pick Protein C1b (NPC1b), a cholesterol binding protein involved in DENV infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref064">64</xref>], due to the known association between <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, viruses and host cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref055">55</xref>]. Finally, we selected two genes that were previously identified as being responsive to viral infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> but were not characterized in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes: a pupal cuticle protein (PCP) that is downregulated during DENV infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref065">65</xref>], and a putative NF-κB repressing factor (NFKBR) that is upregulated during arboviral infection but downregulated by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref065">65</xref>]. We observed that all of these genes were differentially expressed due to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection, ZIKV and/or DENV infection, or <italic>Wolbachia</italic> x virus infection status.</p>
<p>Our results indicated that very few <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes become infected by either ZIKV or DENV after experimental co-infection with either ZIKV/DENV-1 or ZIKV/DENV-3, which suggests that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced pathogen interference is effective against multiple pathogens. Our observation that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced inhibition of co-infecting viruses extended to the level of transmission suggests that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes are likely to be a suitable tool for disease control in areas experiencing simultaneous transmission of multiple arboviruses.</p>

<p>The mosquito lines used in this work were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>]. The <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected (Mel) line was originally developed in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref028">28</xref>], before being transferred to Brazil, and backcrossed with Brazilian <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> collected near the residential neighbourhood of Urca, RJ, Brazil. The wildtype, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-uninfected line (WT) used in these experiments was originally collected from the same area in 2016.

<p>The ZIKV strain used in these experiments (ZIKV/<italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>/Brazil/BRPE243/2015) was isolated in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref066">66</xref>]. The DENV-1 strain (DENV-1/<italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>/Brazil/Contagem/MG/BRMV09/2015) was isolated from human blood in Contagem, MG, Brazil during 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref042">42</xref>]. The DENV-3 strain (DENV-3 MG20 (375)) was isolated from human blood in Brazil during 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>]. Virus stocks were maintained at 28°C, in C6/36 cells in Leibowitz L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref067">67</xref>]. Fresh supernatant from infected C6/36 cells was harvested 6–7 days after infection. The RNA from 50μL of fresh infected supernatant was extracted in 50μL of squash buffer (1mM EDTA, 50mM NaCl, 10mM Tris, pH 8.2) and 0.6μL of proteinase K (Qiagen), and then quantified via RT-qPCR using the LightCycler Multiplex RNA virus Master (Roche). The quantification protocol is described in more detail below. Based on these results, viruses were diluted in fresh, sterile media to approximately equal titres (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0007443.t001">Table 1</xref>), and these were used in mosquito oral infections, without ever being frozen.

<p>Undiluted, virus-infected supernatant was also used to perform plaque assays as an additional method of quantification. Plaque assays for DENV-1 and DENV-3 were performed using BHK 21 cells, while plaque assays for ZIKV were performed using VERO cells. Briefly: 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells were added to each well in a 6-well plate (Kasvi) containing DMEM media (Gibco) supplemented with 5% inactivated FBS (Gibco), and then incubated overnight at 37°C, with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Then, infected supernatant was serially diluted from 10<sup>−3</sup> through 10<sup>−7</sup> and 400µL added to the plate. After a one-hour incubation at 37°C, the media was removed and 4mL of DMEM containing 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose (Synth) and 2% FBS was added to each well. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 6 days in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After this period, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Exodo Cientifica) for 1 hour, and then stained with 1% crystal violet (Merck) for 20 minutes. Plaque numbers were counted to determine the number of plaque forming units per millilitre of virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref069">69</xref>].</p>

<title>Experimental infection and sample collection</title>
<p>Four to six day-old adult female mosquitoes were starved overnight prior to experimental infection. For co-infection meals, 1mL of each virus culture was mixed with 1mL of fresh human blood. For mono-infected meals, 2mL of virus was mixed with 1mL of fresh human blood. For mock-infected meals, 1mL of fresh human blood was mixed with 2mL of supernatant collected from uninfected C6/36 cells. Feeding was performed using a membrane feeding system with a circulating water bath to keep temperatures at 37°C. Immediately post-feeding, mosquitoes were knocked down with carbon dioxide, and sorted on ice. All females that were not fully engorged were discarded. The remainder were returned to cages and maintained on 10% sucrose, which was changed daily. Mosquitoes were collected on ice at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection, and then stored at -80°C until the time of processing. One mono-infection assay was performed for ZIKV, DENV-1 and DENV-3. Two ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection assays, and two ZIKV/DENV-3 assays were performed. Samples were dissected on dry ice using microscissors to remove the head/thorax (minus legs and wings) from the remainder of the carcass, and then returned to storage at -80°C.</p>

<title>Saliva collection and injection</title>
<p>Saliva was collected from Mel and WT mosquitoes during one ZIKV/DENV-3 co-infection experiment at both 14 and 21dpi. Mosquitoes were starved overnight to promote feeding. The next day, mosquitoes were knocked down with carbon dioxide and kept on ice while legs and wings were removed. Mosquitoes were allowed to revive, and then saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis into a sterile pipet tip containing 5μL of a 1:1 solution of sterile fetal bovine serum and 30% sucrose. Mosquitoes were then permitted 30 minutes to salivate. Saliva from mosquitoes, that were still alive after the 30 minutes, was collected in sterile tubes and stored at -80°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Using a Nanoject II (Drummond), saliva samples were intrathoracically injected into 4–6 day-old WT mosquitoes that had not previously been challenged by ZIKV or DENV, in order to determine if they contained infectious virus. A total of 32 saliva samples (WT 14dpi– 7, Mel 14dpi– 7, WT 21dpi– 9, Mel 21dpi—9) were injected into 435 WT females. A fresh glass needle was used for each saliva sample. Between 9 and 16 mosquitoes were injected per saliva, with each mosquito injected with 207nL of saliva. Injected mosquitoes were maintained on 10% sucrose for 5 days, with the sucrose changed daily. Including those mosquitoes that died as a result of injection-induced trauma, there was a mean survival rate of 84.65% for the experiment. The presence or absence of ZIKV and DENV was analysed for a maximum of 8 injected mosquitoes per saliva, corresponding to an average sampling rate of 58.12% across all samples, and a total of 251 injected mosquitoes sampled.

<title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits infection with ZIKV, DENV-1 and DENV-3 in mono-infection</title>
<p>In this study we sought to determine if the pathogen blocking properties of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection could still function effectively if <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes were challenged with two viruses simultaneously. First, we examined the effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> individually on the three viruses we intended to use in co-infection assays. These viruses (ZIKV BRPE strain, DENV-1 and DENV-3) were all isolated in Brazil. We had previously determined that <italic>w</italic>Mel infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> caused pathogen blocking against both ZIKV and DENV-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>], while this isolate of DENV-1 had not previously been examined with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes. We used RT-qPCR with virus-specific TaqMan probes to quantify ZIKV or DENV load in <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected (Mel) and wildtype (WT) mosquito head/thorax samples, in order to assess disseminated infection, at 7, 14 and 21 days post-oral infection (dpi). Data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007443.s002">S2 File</xref>.</p>

<title>Pathogen blocking is not affected by ZIKV/DENV co-infection in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes</title>
<p>We examined the effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on ZIKV/DENV co-infection in WT and Mel mosquitoes by performing co-oral infection assays where viruses were fed to mosquitoes in approximately equivalent titres (as determined by RT-qPCR in the hours prior to infection). Two experimental infections were performed for ZIKV/DENV-1, and two for ZIKV/DENV-3, all using fresh virus. Head/thorax samples were then assayed for the presence of both viruses using a multiplex RT-qPCR assay. Raw data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007443.s002">S2 File</xref>.</p>
<p>When examining prevalence of viral infection for these experiments, we classified the samples as uninfected (no detectable infection with either virus), DENV-infected (only DENV detected), ZIKV-infected (only ZIKV detected), or co-infected (both viruses detected). These data were compared by Chi-square test. Viral load data from both replicate experiments were examined as one data set, however data were examined independently for each virus.</p>
<p>For the ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection experiments, prevalence of infection was significantly lower for Mel mosquitoes than WT mosquitoes at all three time points (Chi-square test; 7dpi–<italic>X</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 35.49, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 14dpi–<italic>X</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 46.66, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 21dpi–<italic>X</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 32.52, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007443.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The overall prevalence of infection in Mel mosquitoes increased over time, and reached 33.33% at 21dpi, however only 4/39 samples (10.25%) had detectable co-infection at this time point.

<p>To determine whether co-infection affected pathogen blocking in Mel mosquitoes, we compared the prevalence and viral load of each virus when fed singly or in co-infection.

Likewise, there was no difference in prevalence of either DENV strains fed in mono-infection or co-infection with ZIKV. The one exception to this was with ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection at 14dpi, where prevalence of infection was actually lower than for ZIKV mono-infection (Fisher’s exact test; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0014). However, there was no significant difference observed between these treatments at either 7dpi or 21dpi.</p>
<p>For viral load, we observed no significant difference between Mono- or co-infected Mel mosquitoes for any virus for all but one comparison.

<title>Viral load in ZIKV/DENV co-infected mosquitoes is dominated by ZIKV</title>
<p>Analysis of our prevalence data in the co-infection assays suggested that more WT samples were positive for DENV-1 than for ZIKV during ZIKV/DENV-1 co-feeding, while by comparison more WT samples were positive for ZIKV than for DENV-3 during ZIKV/DENV-3 co-feeding. To see if a similar trend occurred for viral load in co-infected samples, we examined the ratio of ZIKV copies to DENV copies, across all co-infection assays. These comparisons were only made for WT mosquitoes, as there were too few co-infected Mel mosquitoes to perform statistical analysis.</p>
<p>For the ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007443.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), the majority of co-infected samples had higher levels of ZIKV than DENV-1 (LOG<sub>10</sub> Ratio &gt; 0).

<title>Effect of co-infection on pathogen blocking</title>
<p>Biological control programs involving <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes must be sufficiently robust to restrict virus transmission in epidemiologically complex environments. There is concurrent transmission of multiple arboviruses in many areas of the world, with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, a major vector of DENV, CHIKV, YFV and ZIKV, capable of transmitting multiple viruses in a single bite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref060">60</xref>]. Prior to our study, there was no information on whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was capable of inhibiting infection with two pathogens in a mosquito at the same time. Given that different arboviruses induce different immune responses in mosquito hosts, and exhibit different infection dynamics in their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref073">73</xref>], we sought to determine if <italic>Wolbachia</italic> would be less effective at blocking two viruses when they were fed simultaneously. We examined disseminated infection in ZIKV/DENV-1 and ZIKV/DENV-3 co-infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> heads/thoraces with and without infection with the <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain, using the same mosquito line being released into the field in Brazil.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that the ZIKV, DENV-1, and DENV-3 strains that we used, which were all isolated in Brazil in the last five years, were capable of infecting wildtype <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. These viruses exhibited different infection dynamics, varying in terms of prevalence of infection, and viral load. We observed that, as expected, <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected mosquitoes challenged with any of these viruses were significantly less susceptible to infection than WT mosquitoes. While those Mel mosquitoes that did become infected exhibited lower viral titres, even at 21dpi. These data were reflective of previous studies on pathogen blocking in <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, which indicate that for this strain strong pathogen blocking occurs against a range of viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>], although it is slightly less effective at blocking arbovirus infections than other <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>During the co-infection assays, mosquitoes were fed a blood meal containing fresh ZIKV/DENV-1 or ZIKV-DENV-3 in approximately equal proportions, with quantification via RT-qPCR taking place immediately after the virus was harvested from infected cell culture. In these experiments we observed that Mel mosquitoes challenged with two viruses still exhibited significantly lower prevalence of infection than WT mosquitoes–in terms of overall number of mosquitoes infected by at least one virus. For those few Mel mosquitoes that did become infected with any virus, we observed that the viral load was still significantly lower than for WT mosquitoes.</p>
<p>We observed that the prevalence of infection and viral load in co-infected Mel mosquitoes was not significantly higher than for mono-infected Mel mosquitoes, suggesting that the ability of <italic>w</italic>Mel to block virus infection was not significantly impacted by the presence of an additional virus. We did observe a significant difference between mono-infected and co-infected groups for two conditions, however in both of these cases the effect was decreased prevalence of infection associated with the co-infection. These statistical comparisons were performed with awareness of the fact that only one mono-infection experiment was conducted for each virus, compared to two experiments each for ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection, and for ZIKV/DENV-3 co-infection. However, given that the data for the mono-infection assays revealed a similar level of pathogen blocking to previously published data from our group with the same <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>], we would not expect the results of the comparisons to change greatly if additional experiments had been performed.</p>
<p>We also examined the effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection on virus transmission in ZIKV/DENV-3-challenged mosquitoes, by collecting their saliva and then injecting it into naïve mosquitoes, in an experiment akin to a plaque assay in live mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref042">42</xref>]. Saliva samples were collected at 14 and 21dpi, and then injected into a group of mosquitoes, a proportion of which were assayed via RT-qPCR for the presence of virus. Mel saliva sample selection was intentionally biased, as the saliva from the five head/thorax samples (out of 40 across the two time-points) that were positive for at least one virus were selected for injection. This allowed us to determine whether transmission of these viruses was possible if Mel mosquitoes had detectable disseminated infection. As such, our data likely underestimate the degree to which <italic>w</italic>Mel would inhibit viral transmission in a mosquito population. In spite of this bias, at both 14 and 21dpi, we observed a significantly lower overall prevalence of infection in the mosquitoes injected with saliva from Mel mosquitoes, with only 5/16 Mel saliva positive for any virus, as opposed to WT saliva where 15/16 were positive for any virus. Only 1 Mel saliva sample produced ZIKV/DENV-3 co-infection after injection, as opposed to 9/16 for WT saliva.</p>
<p>These results suggest that while the prevalence of disseminated infection is greatly reduced, a small number of Mel mosquitoes that do get infected may still be able to transmit virus, although the overall transmission rate is likely to be much lower than for WT mosquitoes. Virus transmission in a small subset of <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected mosquitoes has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref044">44</xref>], and is not expected to greatly impact the ability of a <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> population to limit virus transmission, as the fact that most individuals in the population appear to be refractory to infection would be sufficient to collapse transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref044">44</xref>]. Taken together, our data indicate that pathogen blocking is still highly effective in <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> that are challenged with two arboviruses at the same time, and we have found no evidence to suggest that this effect would not occur for mosquitoes in the field.</p>
<p>We observed lower overall prevalence in mosquitoes after infection with the DENV-3 isolate, compared to the DENV-1 and ZIKV isolates that we used. Similarly, DENV-3 load in mosquitoes was lower than what was seen with the other two viruses, and plaque assays revealed that it also had less infectious virus. These data were in line with previous experimental infection assays we have published using this isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>]. The results suggest that the DENV-3 MG20 strain is likely to be less infectious to mosquitoes than the other viruses. Several previous studies have indicated that there can be great variability in infectivity between DENV isolates in mosquitoes, and predominant underlying factors in this variation include DENV serotype, and viral genetic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref074">74</xref>]. An important factor to note is that we still observed strong <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced interference during ZIKV/DENV-1 where the titre of both viruses was high.</p>

<title>Changes in viral infection dynamics during co-infection</title>
<p>Our data revealed several potential examples of viral competition during co-infection in wildtype mosquitoes. We saw that co-infection led to decreased prevalence of ZIKV and DENV-1, but not DENV-3. Additionally, viral load during co-infection was lower than viral load during the mono-infection assays at least one time point for all three viruses. We also observed higher prevalence of DENV-1 than ZIKV during ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection, and higher prevalence of ZIKV than DENV-3 during ZIKV/DENV-3 co-infection. Other studies on arbovirus co-infection have found similar results. This includes studies on mosquitoes that found higher ZIKV load during ZIKV/DENV-2 co-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref059">59</xref>], reduced DENV-2 dissemination at 7dpi during DENV-2/CHIKV co-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref075">75</xref>], or a competitive advantage for DENV-4 during DENV-1/DENV-4 co-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref076">76</xref>], and also reduced growth of ZIKV during ZIKV/CHIKV infection of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref077">77</xref>]. Taken together with our data, these studies suggest that there is no one virus always has a competitive advantage over another. Instead it is more likely that the dominance of one virus during co-infection occurs due to factors associated with specific viral isolates, with the mosquito lines used, or potentially due to factors associated with the virus culturing or infection conditions that are used. Further analysis of the nature and mechanisms that underlie competitive relationships between different viruses in mosquitoes is worthy of future study.</p>
<p>We observed several instances where the overall prevalence of viral infection in Mel mosquitoes was lower with co-infection than with mono-infection. As this pattern was not consistent across all conditions, it is our opinion that these differences likely reflect stochastic variation between experimental infections, rather than reflecting decreased infectivity due to co-infection. So few <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes became infected with any virus that it was difficult to make any definitive statement on changes in viral dynamics due to co-infection. In the one instance where we observed a significant difference in a comparison (where DENV-1 levels were lower during ZIKV/DENV-1 co-infection than for mono-infection), there were only 3 positive Mel samples. Across all experiments, we only observed 4 co-infected Mel mosquitoes, all for ZIKV/DENV-1. Each of these samples had higher levels of ZIKV than DENV, exhibiting the same overall trend towards higher ZIKV load seen with the WT mosquitoes. While the number of virus-infected Mel mosquitoes was too low to make a definitive statement on whether co-infection and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> affect virus dynamics, our findings reveal a clear lack of evidence that co-infection with these viruses could produce less effective pathogen blocking.</p>

<title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> x virus effects on gene expression</title>
<p>In order to gain insight into the impacts of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus infections on the mosquito host at the transcriptional level, we quantified the expression of five genes associated with viral infection at 24 hours post-infection with DENV-1, ZIKV or ZIKV/DENV-1. Pathogen blocking has been associated with the upregulation of antimicrobial peptides, including, prominently, <italic>defensin c</italic> (DEFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>]. Knockdown of DEFC via RNAi led to less effective pathogen blocking against DENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref050">50</xref>]. We observed consistently higher levels of DEFC in Mel mosquitoes than in WT in all treatments, and a higher average fold change in expression for Mel mosquitoes infected by ZIKV in mono- or co-infection. The specific antiviral activity of DEFC remains unknown, but our results provide additional evidence of a role in pathogen blocking.</p>
<p>We assessed levels of the cholesterol binding/transport protein NPC1b, and determined that while Mel mosquitoes had significantly higher expression levels than WT in the Mock treatment, there was no consistent effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the virus-infected treatments. NPC1b has previously been shown to promote DENV infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref064">64</xref>], while cholesterol has been linked to pathogen blocking in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref055">55</xref>]. It is possible that assessing NPC1b levels at a later time post-feeding may provide further insight into a potential role for this gene in pathogen blocking.</p>
<p>We assayed expression levels of a pupal cuticle protein (PCP) that is downregulated during DENV infection, and binds WNV (<italic>West Nile Virus</italic>) envelope protein, thereby inhibiting infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref065">65</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed significantly higher PCP levels in Mel mosquitoes than WT mosquitoes when DENV-1 was present during either mono- or co-infection, suggesting that PCP may plays some role in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced response to DENV-1. However, we saw no effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on PCP expression during ZIKV mono-infection.</p>
<p>AAEL008415-RA, a putative NF-κB repressing factor (NFKBR) was identified from microarray studies of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> as being significantly downregulated by both <italic>w</italic>Mel and <italic>w</italic>MelPop infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref048">48</xref>], and strongly upregulated during WNV and DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref065">65</xref>]. Comparative analysis of protein sequences in Uniprot BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/blast/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uniprot.org/blast/</ext-link>) suggested that this protein had very high levels of similarity to NFKB repressors across many species. We observed significantly higher transcription levels of NFKBR in all WT virus-infected treatments compared to Mock-infected WT mosquitoes, and in comparison to Mel mosquitoes challenged with any virus. A potential explanation for this is that in WT mosquitoes, virus infection induces expression of NFKBR and thus helps to supress NFKB transcriptional activity, which is known to impact DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref078">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref079">79</xref>]. For Mel mosquitoes there was no virus-induced increase in NFKBR expression, potentially suggesting that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection limits viral induction of this gene.</p>
<p>We observed <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus-specific induction of the iron-binding gene TSF1. Levels of this gene have been shown to be strongly induced during <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref048">48</xref>], with this effect responsive to changes in host nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref049">49</xref>]. Iron sequestration is thought to represent a key component of the mosquito immune response to many different pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref080">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref083">83</xref>], while iron is also essential for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in many different host species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref084">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref086">86</xref>]. We observed that Mel mosquitoes had higher TSF1 levels under mock infection conditions. During infection with DENV and/or ZIKV, TSF1 levels in WT mosquitoes were greatly decreased, while TSF1 levels in Mel mosquitoes were increased beyond levels in the Mock treatment. This suggests that TSF1 is highly and differentially responsive to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus infection, and indicates that iron binding may be an important aspect of the pathogen blocking response.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>During the oral infection assays, we assessed viral titre via two different methods, and obtained drastically different results. The initial titration in the infectious blood meal provided to mosquitoes was based on RT-qPCR quantification for viral genomic RNA, while the second was via plaque assay. It should be noted that these assays measure viral titre differently, with the plaque assay describing the titre of infectious virus after 6 days of infection in mammalian cells and the RT-qPCR performed directly on the virus-infected cell culture supernatant that was used in the oral infection experiments. Our plaque assay data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0007443.t001">Table 1</xref>) depict a high degree of difference in viral load between the ZIKV, DENV-1, and DENV-3 isolates. It should be noted that these estimates of viral load were determined for undiluted virus-infected supernatant, and are therefore not reflective of the virus mixture that fed to our mosquitoes. Critically, both techniques have inherent difference in accuracy and sensitivity, and therefore provide different estimates of viral titre, and there is no guarantee that either method provided an accurate estimate of the number of particles of either virus that reached the mosquito midgut epithelium. We were also limited in that we were only able to perform a single experiment with ZIKV, DENV-1 and DENV-3 mono-infections. While our results showed a similar of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced blocking to what we had seen in previous studies with the same viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref042">42</xref>], it limited our ability to compare data between the mono- and co-infection datasets.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our study occurred due to the strong nature of the pathogen blocking seen in the Mel mosquitoes. Overall, too few Mel mosquitoes were positive for both viruses after co-infection, making it impossible for us to determine whether there were <italic>Wolbachia</italic> x co-infection interactions that affected virus dynamics similar to what we observed with wildtype mosquitoes. A further limitation of the study was that additional DENV and ZIKV isolates were not examined. We tested isolates from only two of the four DENV serotypes, although this did include an isolate of DENV-1, which has previously been shown to induce weaker blocking in <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref044">44</xref>]. We also examined only a single ZIKV isolate, although of the two isolates that were available to us, we did select the isolate that displayed stronger infection in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007443.ref038">38</xref>]. Finally, the gene expression assays were limited by the fact that we did not have the resources to test additional genes, transcriptional changes in the presence of our DENV-3 isolate, to perform a broader transcriptomic assay at multiple time points, or to perform gene silencing assays in order to assess the role of each gene in pathogen interference. As with all assays of gene expression, it is important to remember that changes in transcript levels do not always correlate to changes at the protein level. Consequently, we recommend further validation of our five gene candidates.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Here we present the first examination of arbovirus co-infection in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes. We have demonstrated that the <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain is capable of blocking ZIKV, DENV-1 and DENV-3 when challenged singly or in co-infection, with Mel mosquitoes demonstrating significantly reduced prevalence of infection and viral load compared to wildtype mosquitoes. Only a small minority of <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected mosquitoes assayed across multiple time points and experiments, demonstrated infection with both viruses simultaneously. In contrast, wildtype mosquitoes displayed high levels of disseminated co-infection. We also demonstrated that wildtype mosquitoes were capable of transmitting both ZIKV and DENV-3 at high rates after co-infection, however transmission rates for Mel mosquitoes were greatly reduced, even after we intentionally biased our data by selecting saliva from the small proportion of Mel mosquitoes that had detectable disseminated infection. Our data provide a strong indication that co-infection would not adversely affect pathogen blocking in the <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> that are currently in the field in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Given that this region also sees regular transmission of CHIKV and YFV, in addition to DENV and ZIKV, examination of the ability of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to block infection with these viruses would be beneficial. It would also be interesting to examine the effect of super-infection of two arboviruses, feeding one after the other has already established infection in the mosquito, and to assess whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes in the field respond to co-infection in a similar manner. However, our data provide no evidence that either of these scenarios would detrimentally impact on pathogen blocking, or the utility of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as an arbovirus control agent.</p>
