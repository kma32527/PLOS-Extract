<abstract>
<p>The ability to appropriately mimic human disease is critical for using animal models as a tool for understanding virus pathogenesis. In the case of Nipah virus (NiV), infection of humans appears to occur either through inhalation, contact with or consumption of infected material. In two of these circumstances, respiratory or sinusoidal exposure represents a likely route of infection. In this study, intermediate-size aerosol particles (~7 μm) of NiV-Malaysia were used to mimic potential routes of exposure by focusing viral deposition in the upper respiratory tract. Our previous report showed this route of exposure extended the disease course and a single animal survived the infection. Here, analysis of the peripheral immune response found minimal evidence of systemic inflammation and depletion of B cells during acute disease. However, the animal that survived infection developed an early IgM response with rapid development of neutralizing antibodies that likely afforded protection. The increase in NiV-specific antibodies correlated with an expansion of the B cell population in the survivor. Cell-mediated immunity was not clearly apparent in animals that succumbed during the acute phase of disease. However, CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory cells increased in the survivor with correlating increases in cytokines and chemokines associated with cell-mediated immunity. Interestingly, kinetic changes of the CD4+ and CD8<sup>bright</sup> T cell populations over the course of acute disease were opposite from animals that succumbed to infection. In addition, increases in NK cells and basophils during convalescence of the surviving animal were also evident, with viral antigen found in NK cells. These data suggest that a systemic inflammatory response and “cytokine storm” are not major contributors to NiV-Malaysia pathogenesis in the AGM model using this exposure route. Further, these data demonstrate that regulation of cell-mediated immunity, in addition to rapid production of NiV specific antibodies, may be critical for surviving NiV infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Nipah virus (NiV) infection in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India has been correlated with severe respiratory and neurological disease that led to death in over 50% of known cases. In this study, we used a nonhuman primate model for NiV infection to evaluate the peripheral immune response to virus infection in an effort to identify aspects of the immune response that may be important for survival. An aerosol exposure that targeted virus deposition in sinuses and upper respiratory tract was used in an effort to mimic a probable human exposure route. Following exposure, five of six animals included in the study succumbed to the infection. The survivor developed a virus-specific antibody response and showed clear evidence of cell-mediated immunity. Interestingly, the rate of change in CD4+ and CD8<sup>bright</sup> T cell populations in the survivor over the course of the acute disease, were the reverse of animals that succumbed to infection. These data suggest that rapid development of virus-specific adaptive immunity is critical for survival of NiV infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of disease processes requires the use of a model that accurately recapitulates significant components of human disease. In this study, we continue efforts to develop the African green monkey (AGM) model of Nipah virus (NiV) infection. This work focused on examining the peripheral immune response induced by NiV infection following exposure to intermediate-size aerosol particles of the Malaysian isolate of NiV (NiV-M). In addition to evaluating immune responses during the acute phase of disease, an animal that survived exposure has provided the opportunity to characterize the acute and convalescent immune responses to NiV-M infection and to identify immune characteristics of the animal that may have provided it with a competitive advantage for survival.</p>
<p>Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted to humans and other animals through contact with, or consumption of, excreta from infected fruit bats (<italic>Pteropus spp</italic>.) or other infected animals. In the first recognized outbreak of NiV infection in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998, a large number of infected humans developed neurological disease while others developed a severe respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref002">2</xref>]. In this outbreak, the typical route of exposure was associated with close contact with infected pigs suggesting a fomite/contact or respiratory droplet route of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref004">4</xref>]. An outbreak of NiV infection was first reported in January 2004 in Bangladesh with an initial focus of 12 cases with unknown etiology, but interaction with bats was a suspected commonality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref005">5</xref>]. In this initial outbreak, both neurological and respiratory disease symptoms were reported. In more recent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, there is an apparent higher frequency of respiratory disease compared to cases seen in Malaysia, although neurological disease is still common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref006">6</xref>]. Rather than proximity to pigs, in Bangladesh and India human infection has been associated with the consumption of unpasteurized date palm sap and limited human-to-human transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref009">9</xref>]. To date there have been over 600 known cases of NiV infection with a case fatality rate over 50%.</p>
<p>Previous work has established the AGM as a model for NiV infection, however, in most of these studies the mortality rate was near 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref013">13</xref>]. In the AGM model, neurological involvement was not a clear and consistent component of the disease, although making assessments in nonhuman primates in a biocontainment environment to determine subtle neurological changes is challenging. Previous work has documented systemic vasculitis as a significant aspect of the disease with hemorrhage and pulmonary edema identified by both pathological assessment and computed tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>]. Despite limited overt indication of neurological disease in this model, we have shown that animals exposed to intermediate-size (~7 μm) particles of NiV-M developed brain lesions that were identified by magnetic resonance imaging and were reminiscent of previously reported lesions in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Clinical and pre-clinical studies of NiV infection published to date have focused primarily on clinical and pathological assessments of disease progression. In this study, in order to gain a better understanding of the disease process, comprehensive immunological characterization of the peripheral immune response in infected animals was performed. Analyses included evaluation of the antibody response, systemic cytokine responses and temporal changes in peripheral immune cell populations of individual animals. The objective of these analyses was to determine if there were characteristics of NiV infection in the AGM model that could be exploited as potential targets for development of medical countermeasures. One of the animals challenged in this study became infected and developed disease but survived the acute infection and progressed into convalescence. Evaluation of immunological responses of this animal identified characteristics that were unique to this animal relative to others included in this study and may have provided a competitive advantage allowing this animal to survive. In addition, the survivor developed a classic antibody response and T cell response indicative of protective adaptive immunity. The studies presented here highlight not only the variability of the host response between outbred animals, but also the value of understanding the role host immunity plays in disease progression and the importance of appreciating host diversity in the ability to survive disease.</p>

<title>Survival</title>
<p>In this study animals were exposed to doses of NiV-M ranging from 22–90 pfu in the low dose group (average particle size 7.16 μm) and 408–1197 pfu in the high dose groups (average particle size of 6.41 μm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>]. All animals developed acute disease with no clear observational differences between the low and high dose groups. One of the six inoculated animals survived the infection and recovered with no evident sequelae. This animal received a dose of approximately 400 pfu of NiV. Clinical and pathological assessments and medical imaging of these animals can be found in a companion paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<title>Antibody response</title>
<p>Determination of the antibody response to NiV in infected AGMs found no antibody response until 10 dpi at which time one of the animals, the survivor (8197), had evidence of IgM and neutralizing antibody titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Two additional animals (8155 and 8043) developed IgM, but not neutralizing, titers on days 12 and 14, but ultimately succumbed to the infection. One animal (8164) had a very low neutralization titer (1:20) on day 14 post-infection. The IgM titers of 8197 peaked at 14 dpi when a NiV-specific IgG response became apparent with evidence of NiV-specific IgG1 antibodies, but not IgG2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses were not tested. The neutralizing antibody titer of 8197 plateaued at 23 dpi where it remained until the end of the study. None of the other animals in this study had apparent neutralizing antibody titers.</p>

<title>Systemic cytokine response</title>
<p>Plasma cytokine levels were measured temporally over the course of disease using a bead-based multi-plex assay. The assay used in this study was a standard array that evaluates a broad range of cytokines and chemokines. There were few consistencies between the individual animals that could be used to characterize the disease process, with the exception of increased production of IFN-γ in all six animals between days 6 and 14 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). There were also some apparent dose specific responses with peak IFN-γ levels generally higher in high dose group animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, blue squares). The IL-1RA levels were markedly higher in all three high dose group animals at 12 days post-infection while levels in the low dose group remained much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>An opportunity from these studies was the ability to evaluate the disease process in an animal that survived NiV infection. This animal had marked increases in several cytokines and chemokines between days 10 and 16 post-infection that correlate with increases in IgG production and improved clinical health. These cytokines included IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-15, TNFα, MIP-1α (CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), TGFα and GM-CSF (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g003">3</xref>). The increases in IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF and MIP-1β are all potentially associated with the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. The proinflammatory IL-8 and TNFα may be elevated in an effort to manage the systemic vasculitis that is common in this model of NiV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>], although, in some circumstances, excessive TNFα may exacerbate vasculitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

<p>The peripheral populations of CD4+, CD4+ Th17 and CD8+ T-cells were also quantified. In five of six animals the overall population of CD4+ T cells increased over the course of the disease while in the survivor (8197), the CD4+ T cell population decreased, even when evaluated over only the acute phase of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007454.s003">S1 Table</xref>). The population of Th17 cells was nominally decreased in some animals over the acute phase of disease, but unchanged in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The population of Th17 cells did increase in the convalescent animal with a peak at 29 days post-infection. However, the identification of Th17 cell populations did not include intracellular staining for IL-17 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007454.s003">S1 Table</xref>) so additional cell populations may be included in these analyses. Further delineation of CD4+ populations into central and effector memory cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007454.s003">S1 Table</xref>) found that the central memory CD4+ T cells were least abundant in the survivor, but that populations were largely unchanged over the course of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Baseline values of CD4+ central memory populations were consistent with previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref020">20</xref>].

The CD8<sup>bright</sup> populations serve a typical CD8+ functional role in adaptive immunity. The CD8<sup>dim</sup> population appears to arise due to down-regulation of CD4 on T cells, but the cells retain some of their CD4 helper functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref022">22</xref>].

<p>Evaluation of the populations of proliferating B and T cells based on expression of the Ki67 marker found that, in agreement with the increase in population of B cells in the convalescent animal, the percentage of Ki67+ B cells increased markedly beginning on day 12 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

<p>Additional peripheral immune cell populations evaluated included NK cells, monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Monocytes represented 2–6% of the total leukocyte population in the blood at baseline. Linear regression analysis of this population suggested that the population trended downward over the acute phase of disease in all of the animals except the survivor, which trended slightly upward, but these analyses were complicated by marked day-to-day variability of the analyzed populations in some animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g009">Fig 9A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007454.s003">S1 Table</xref>).

The surviving animal had a large increase in the basophil population beginning at day 10 post-infection with a peak at day 14 and gradual decline as the animal convalesced. Using Ki67 as a proliferation marker, most basophils on days 10–14 appeared to be proliferating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g010">Fig 10E</xref>).</p>
<p>As a component of the analysis of peripheral immune cell populations, the presence of NiV antigen was determined in individual cell populations using a NiV-M glycoprotein specific polyclonal antibody. While not consistent in all animals, and dependent upon the point in the disease course, viral antigen was detected in CD4+ T cells, CD8<sup>bright</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>dim</sup> T cells, B cells, NK cells and DCs/nonclassical monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Interestingly, the surviving animal had the most robust and persistent increase in NiV antigen positive NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g011">Fig 11E</xref>). While the presence of viral antigen is intriguing, this does not mean these cell populations are infected and that virus is replicating. However, the persistent presence of NiV in some peripheral cell populations, and NK cells in particular, is suggestive of viral replication. Specific analyses to determine if NiV was replicating in these cell types are a component of on-going studies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this project our objective is to develop a model of NiV infection that is similar to both the disease course and survival rate that is seen in humans. Previous work using IT or small particle aerosol infections led to rapidly progressing pulmonary disease with 100% lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref011">11</xref>]. The IT and small-particle inoculation routes provide either a bolus of virus or drive the virus deep into the lungs, neither of which is likely to represent probable human exposure routes. In the initial outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore, humans were likely infected through contact with or inhalation of respiratory excreta from pigs. In Bangladesh and India, the primary routes of infection are through consumption of contaminated date palm sap or direct human-to-human contact. There is no evidence to support alimentary infection and it is unlikely that the virus would remain infectious in the low pH environment of the stomach. Subsequently, our hypothesis is that the virus either enters through open wounds in the mouth or it is distributed into the lungs or sinuses through either accidental inhalation or coughing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In the current study we used aerosol exposure with an intermediate-size particle (~7 um) to focus virus deposition into the upper respiratory tract and sinuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref024">24</xref>]. The analyses described here focused on the impact of NiV infection on serum cytokine expression and changes in peripheral immune cell populations. Critical aspects of these findings demonstrate that there were no specific correlates of the acute disease that were uniform among the animals tested in this study, with the exception of increased levels of IFNγ toward the end of the acute disease phase. However, the lack of a systemic inflammatory cytokine response highlights the potential importance of local inflammation in disease development and control and belies our expectation that extensive vasculitis would lead to a systemic inflammatory response. Furthermore, the limited adaptive immune response prior to day 12 in all but the surviving animal suggests that rapidly developing adaptive immunity may be important to surviving NiV infection in this model. However, the change in CD4+ T cell population is in contrast to findings from studies using a porcine model of NiV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref025">25</xref>] where a decrease in the CD4+ CD8- populations was associated with a poor outcome. Here, we found that the disease course was delayed relative to previous work and that the pulmonary disease was less severe, despite 5 of 6 animals succumbing to the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>]. The animal that survived the infection had an immune response that was different from the other five animals in many respects. Specifically, these differences were in the kinetics of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses over the acute phase of disease, and an earlier increase in its B cell population after an initial decrease. The differentially regulated T cell response may have allowed the surviving animal to develop an earlier transition from innate to adaptive immunity allowing a more rapid expression of virus specific IgM and induction of protective immunity. While these data are for only a single animal, they provide useful insights for areas of additional research into mechanisms regulating the development of adaptive immunity in this animal model. Similar to the work reported here, previous studies in the AGM and ferret models of NiV infection don’t generally indicate a marked increase in virus specific antibody titers until around days 7–10 post infection where virus neutralization was evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref027">27</xref>]. In these studies, most of the surviving animals were either in a therapeutic treatment group or had been infected with an attenuated virus which allowed for an extended disease course.</p>
<p>The kinetics of the CD4+ T cell response in the surviving animal is interesting as this population decreased over the acute phase of the disease and continued to drop during convalescence. The CD4+ T cell population in all other animals increased over the acute phase of disease which one might expect if developing an adaptive immune response. The surviving animal had an increase in IL-2 beginning around day 4 that may be correlated with a decrease in CD4+ T cells as this has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref029">29</xref>]. These data suggest an early Th1 response in the acute phase of disease in this animal, similar to what we previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref010">10</xref>], followed by a Th2 response during convalescence. This hypothesis is supported by the production of Th1-associated IgG1, although testing for the Th2-associated IgG4 was not performed. In addition, in the AGM model, CD4 downregulation has been shown to correlate with an increase in CD8<sup>dim</sup> T cells in the context of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) which retain CD4 functionality, but also develop cytotoxic activity of classical CD8+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref030">30</xref>]. In this study, the CD8<sup>dim</sup> population was largely unchanged over the course of disease in all of the animals, but this may be due to the acute nature of the disease, whereas SIV is a chronic infection. Decreases in lymphocyte populations may also be associated with homing to lymphoid tissue, but this question was not specifically addressed in this study. The surviving animal also provided insights to T cell changes during convalescence including a nominal increase in CD8<sup>dim</sup> effector memory cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a recent study examining B and T cell populations in two survivors of NiV infection in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref031">31</xref>] identified activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and proliferation (Ki67+) of CD8+ T cells in a response that is similar to that seen in the surviving animal in the study reported here. While the survivor study examined a very limited population (n = 2) and the study reported here identified only a single NHP survivor, the correlations between the human and NHP B and T cell responses is compelling and potentially identifies key correlates of protective immunity.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the NK cell population found considerable variability between animals across the acute phase of disease. Proliferation of NK cells, based on expression of Ki67, began around 10 days post-infection with the peak percentage of Ki67+ NK cells on either 10- or 12-days post-infection, depending on the terminal day of the disease course. In the survivor, the peak NK population among the total cells analyzed was at the end of the study on day 36, however the peak Ki67+ population was on day 12 suggesting that NK cells were no longer proliferating, but that populations of other cells were declining. Interestingly, approximately 15% of the NK cells identified in the survivor were NiV antigen positive from 6–16 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g011">Fig 11E</xref>). While there is no direct evidence, other than the presence of viral antigen, supporting NiV infection of NK cells in this study, previous work with a porcine model has shown that NiV can infect and replicate in porcine NK cells, albeit at low titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref025">25</xref>]. If this report is accurate, it could be surmised that NiV is infecting NK cells but not until the late acute to convalescent phase of disease. This finding may suggest that NK cell activation is required for the cells to become permissive to NiV infection. Levels of IL-15, a cytokine that stimulates NK cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref032">32</xref>], were elevated above baseline 6–12 days post-infection but were lower than in other animals during the same time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Stimulation of NK cells induces the release of TNFα and IFNγ from NK cells with IFNγ release leading to the upregulation of MHC II on numerous cell types for activation of CD4+ T cells. While the level of IFNγ peaked at day 8 in the survivor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), TNFα was elevated late in the acute phase of disease (days 10–14) and returned to baseline by the end of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), similar to the percentage of NiV antigen positive NK cells. These data suggest activation, proliferation and functional activity of NK cells during both the acute and convalescent phase of NiV infection in the surviving animal. A similar response profile during the acute phase was not evident in animals that succumbed to the disease.</p>
<p>In addition to increased NK cells during the late acute and convalescent phase of disease, basophil populations in the survivor increased dramatically beginning 10 days post-infection, peaked at day 14 and gradually returned to near baseline levels at study termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). Only one other animal had moderately elevated basophil populations that peaked at its terminal day. Evaluation of basophil proliferation using the Ki67 marker varied among animals during the acute phase of disease. All of the animals reached at least 70% of the population positive for Ki67 on days 10–12 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g010">Fig 10E</xref>). The levels of GM-CSF, which stimulates production of granulocytes from stem cells and can stimulate maturation of dendric cells and differentiation of granulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref033">33</xref>], was elevated above baseline in several of the infected animals and peaked in the survivor at day 14 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). IL-4, which is produced by basophils was elevated above baseline beginning around 6 days post-infection in the surviving animal, and peaked at day 14, similar to the peak population of basophils in this animal (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g002">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007454.g010">10D</xref>). These data demonstrate that the basophil population was stimulated to increase during NiV infection in the surviving animal, possibly by elevated production of GM-CSF, and that these cells were potentially a source of IL-4 in the plasma.</p>
<p>Previous work by Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that NiV binds human leukocytes and suggested that these cells were a means of virus dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref034">34</xref>]. Additionally, Stachowiak and Weingartl found that NiV was able to productively infect porcine CD6+CD8+ T cells and NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref025">25</xref>]. Here we identified NiV antigen in leukocyte populations including CD4+ and CD8<sup>dim</sup> T cells of all of the animals analyzed, as well as in CD8<sup>bright</sup> T cells, B cells, NK cells and DC/non-classical monocyte populations. While these data do not clearly demonstrate infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, combined with the work of Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., it is suggestive that NiV is able to either bind to or infect multiple human leukocyte populations. Previous work with measles virus (MV), a related paramyxovirus, has shown that MV can infect human B cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref035">35</xref>] and B and T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in a macaque model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref036">36</xref>] and has been proposed as a potential means of immune suppression. While the route of MV infection of lymphocytes is believed to be through binding with its CD150 receptor, it is possible that NiV has developed a similar means of immune suppression by stimulating lymphocyte depletion. Ephrin B2 has been shown to be expressed in <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated human Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref037">37</xref>]. Ephrin B2 is also found on thymocytes in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref038">38</xref>] and CD3+ T cells isolated from humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref039">39</xref>]. However, it is not clear if ephrin B2 or ephrin B3 are expressed on peripheral human or AGM CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and if so, at what levels. This question will be addressed in future studies. In addition, the presence of NiV in NK cells or lymphocytes well after the disease has ended may indicate a potential source of viral persistence or chronic infection as there have been reported cases of delayed or recurrent encephalitis in some NiV patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref040">40</xref>]. Histopathological assessment of animals included in this study demonstrated neurological involvement, although evidence of virus infection in the brain was limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>This work provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the peripheral immune response in the AGM model of NiV infection. The results shown here clearly demonstrate some commonalities in the response to acute lethal disease and also suggests potential immune correlates to survival of NiV infection. These studies, combined with previous work, suggest that immunopathogenesis associated with NiV infection is likely to be focal as there no clear evidence of a large systemic response. These studies also suggest the potential importance of rapid development of virus-specific adaptive immunity for survival of NiV infection. While these studies do not provide definitive examples of NiV-driven immune modulation, they do indicate that a more focused approach to understanding the regulation of the immune response to NiV infection and the regulation of host immunity by NiV is critical to managing this disease.</p>

<p>Wild-caught Caribbean origin AGM were purchased from PrimGen (Hines, IL). Animals were identified for inclusion based on similarity of size with one male and two females included in each group. Group sizes (n = 3) were limited due to clinical imaging requirements associated with this study where each imaging session was approximately 2 hours per animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007454.ref014">14</xref>]. Animals were group housed prior to being assigned to the study and were singly housed during the course of the study. At all times animals were provided with appropriate enrichment including, but not limited to, polished steel mirrors and durable toys. Animals were anesthetized in accordance with BSL-4 standard protocols prior to all procedures including inoculation, imaging and collection of blood to minimize stress to the animals.
