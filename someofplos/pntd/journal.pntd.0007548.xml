<abstract>
<p>Viroporins like influenza A virus M2, hepatitis C virus p7, HIV-1 Vpu and picornavirus 2B associate with host membranes, and create hydrophilic corridors, which are critical for viral entry, replication and egress. The 6K proteins from alphaviruses are conjectured to be viroporins, essential during egress of progeny viruses from host membranes, although the analogue in Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) remains relatively uncharacterized. Using a combination of electrophysiology, confocal and electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations we show for the first time that CHIKV 6K is an ion channel forming protein that primarily associates with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The ion channel activity of 6K can be inhibited by amantadine, an antiviral developed against the M2 protein of Influenza A virus; and CHIKV infection of cultured cells can be effectively inhibited in presence of this drug. Our study provides crucial mechanistic insights into the functionality of 6K during CHIKV-host interaction and suggests that 6K is a potential therapeutic drug target, with amantadine and its derivatives being strong candidates for further development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chikungunya fever is a severe crippling illness caused by the arthropod-borne virus CHIKV. Originally from the African subcontinent, the virus has now spread worldwide and is responsible for substantial morbidity and economic loss. The existing treatment against CHIKV is primarily symptomatic, and it is imperative that specific therapeutics be devised. The present study provides detailed insight into the functionality of 6K, an ion channel forming protein of CHIKV. Amantadine, a known antiviral against influenza virus, also inhibits CHIKV replication in cell culture and drastically alters the morphology of virus particles. This work highlights striking parallels among functionalities of virus-encoded membrane-interacting proteins, which may be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antivirals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chikungunya fever is a severe and debilitating illness caused by the mosquito-borne arbovirus, Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref004">4</xref>]. Infections are generally non-fatal, but this virus has been much in the limelight lately, due to its rapid spread and outbreaks worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref004">4</xref>]. Although, India is endemic for CHIKV; outbreaks do occur, the latest one reported in New Delhi in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref004">4</xref>]. Currently, there are no specific therapeutics against CHIKV infections, the treatment being primarily symptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>CHIKV, like other alphaviruses, is an enveloped RNA virus with particle diameter ranging between 65–70 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref005">5</xref>]. The viral genome is organized into structural and non-structural protein-encoding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref005">5</xref>]. The structural protein cassette is composed of glycoproteins (E1-E2-E3), capsid protein (C), and 6K, which was recently shown to have a transframe variant (TF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref007">7</xref>]. 240 copies each of glycoproteins E1 and E2; as well as the capsid protein, are arranged in accordance with T = 4 symmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref008">8</xref>]. Although the roles of capsid and envelope proteins in the life cycle of CHIKV are fairly well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref014">14</xref>], reports pertaining to the direct functional characterization of 6K are rare, making it the least understood amongst all CHIKV structural proteins. A recent report suggests that 6K is a prime target for mounting CTL- mediated immune response in the host, indicating its significance as a therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref015">15</xref>]. One contributing factor for the lack of direct biochemical characterization of CHIKV 6K is its extreme intrinsic hydrophobicity, as well as cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref016">16</xref>], which makes the production of sufficient quantity of functionally active, recombinant protein fairly challenging. In fact, the majority of the studies on 6K from other alphaviruses—demonstrating the biochemical properties and role in viral life cycle—have been carried out by analysis of mutated virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref023">23</xref>] or by RNA expression at the cellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref024">24</xref>], with only a few studies characterizing recombinant 6K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref025">25</xref>]. Further, the molecular details of membrane association by 6K and the exact role of this activity in promoting virus budding remains unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, a transframe (TF) variant of 6K was identified, which is generated from the 6K gene as a result of a (-1) ribosomal frameshift. TF has the same N-terminal domain as 6K, but a different C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref007">7</xref>]. 6K and TF are produced during infections by most alphaviruses, and both are thought to be essential for virus budding, although only TF appears to be packaged within virions while 6K is probably retained at the membranes of infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref007">7</xref>]. Additionally, studies with SINV have highlighted the role of palmitoylation for the localization of TF to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The membrane permeabilization activity of alphavirus 6K places it in the category of viroporins. Nucleation of aqueous passageways by viroporins allows movement of ions and small molecules, which in turn, facilitates virus entry, replication, and egress. Some well-characterized members of the viroporin family include M2 of influenza A virus, Vpu of HIV, p7 of HCV, and 2B of picornaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref027">27</xref>]. The role of viroporins in sustaining infections, and their significance as targets for drug development, is illustrated by the antiviral activity of amantadine, which targets the ion-channel forming protein M2 and prevents Influenza A infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the recent scenario of frequent outbreaks of Chikungunya fever in different parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref004">4</xref>], and the role of 6K in supporting alphavirus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref023">23</xref>], we attempted to functionally characterize CHIKV 6K and assess its potential as a target for drug development. Using a combination of electrophysiology, cryo-electron microscopy, biophysical techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that CHIKV 6K interacts with membranes in multifaceted ways, leading to permeability as well as vesicle fusion. We show that CHIKV 6K exists in oligomeric forms, and forms ion channels in membranes. In addition, we demonstrate that virus-like particles (VLPs) of CHIKV show a marked deviation from their usual morphology when treated with amantadine; and that the inhibitory activity of amantadine extends to CHIKV replication in cell culture. Thus, it can be strongly emphasized that 6K is critical in CHIKV biology and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Chikungunya fever.</p>

<title>6K is a highly hydrophobic protein which migrates as a hexamer in size exclusion chromatography</title>
<p>The 6K proteins of alphaviruses are extremely hydrophobic in nature with more than 50% of the residues having a positive value on the hydrophobicity scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). A GRAVY (grand average of hydropathy) value of 1.006 also indicates that the protein has an overall hydrophobic nature. This, as well as the presence of transmembrane regions predicted by several servers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), were likely responsible for our inability to generate CHIKV 6K alone, in soluble form, by recombinant expression in bacteria.</p>

<p>A fusion of CHIKV 6K with GST (Glutathione S Transferase) was successfully expressed and purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Rosetta (pLysS cells). We found that IPTG induction and subsequent bacterial growth at a relatively lower temperature of 18°C, is an essential requirement for maximizing expression. GST-6K was initially purified by pulldown with GST beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), followed by size-exclusion chromatography, which generated two separate peaks corresponding to GST and GST-6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The GST-6K peak was fairly broad and the molecular weight corresponding to the primary peak fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, indicated with an arrow) was calculated to be 190.98 kDa, which indicated the formation of a hexamer (monomer MW = 33.5 KDa). Since the recombinant protein appeared to have the propensity to break into its constituent parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), GST-6K was utilized within 24–48 hours post purification for every experiment.</p>

<title>CHIKV 6K forms ion channels in lipid bilayers</title>
<p>The ability of GST-6K to form ion channels <italic>in vitro</italic> was investigated using an electrophysiology setup as described in Materials and Methods. The ion channel activity of GST-6K was measured as a flow of current across an otherwise intact DPhPC membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref> (i, iii, v and vii) represent the current versus time traces of GST-6K incorporated into the lipid bilayer membrane at applied membrane potentials of -100 mV and +100 mV respectively.

Addition of GST-6K to the membrane caused spikes in the current trace, which displayed the typical stepped nature of the opening and closing of an ion channel. This showed that GST-6K successfully incorporated within the bilayer and formed ion-conducting, stable channels, which were functional under the aforementioned membrane potentials, and opened at both negative and positive voltages.</p>

<p>Altogether, observations were made at four different protein concentrations of 0.2, 0.85, 1.2 and 2.6 ng/μl. The lipid (DPhPC) concentration remained fixed in all cases, as the formation of bilayer membrane in the BLM cup demands an exact amount of lipid. Increasing concentration of GST-6K coincided with the appearance of multiple open states with higher currents, at both positive and negative membrane potentials. These observations can be best explained as follows. GST-6K forms pore on the membrane by oligomerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007548.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), however, the number of monomers which oligomerize to form a pore is not fixed. Increase in protein concentration may result in the generation of higher-order oligomers, leading to the formation of bigger pores in the membranes and higher currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007548.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Generation of multiple oligomeric states is well evidenced in pore-forming proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref029">29</xref>]. Similar experiments with only GST as negative control do not result in the formation of ion channels, as seen by us (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007548.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref030">30</xref>]. This indicates that the ion-channel forming activity is exclusively due to 6K.</p>

<title>CHIKV 6K disrupts liposomes mimicking Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane</title>
<p>Since GST-6K appeared to be capable of forming ion-channels in membranes, we attempted to determine if it preferentially damages target membranes. Liposomes mimicking the lipid composition of ER and plasma membranes encapsulating the fluorescent dye sulforhodamine B, were generated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref032">32</xref>]. The ability of GST-6K, at a concentration ranging from 0.1 μM-10 μM, to disrupt these liposomes, was tested using standard methods. A distinct increase in disruption of ER mimicking liposomes was observed with concentrations of 0.5 μM (and higher) of GST-6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Transmission electron micrographs of GST-6K treated, vs non-treated ER-mimicking liposomes, displayed a clear difference in morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), with the latter image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) showing liposomes with their surfaces decorated with proteinaceous material. Incubation of plasma membrane mimicking liposomes with GST-6K did not cause any significant release of dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), or alteration of surface features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>), indicating the inability of GST-6K to effectively rupture these membranes.</p>

<p>To further pinpoint the role of specific lipids in GST-6K-mediated membrane damage, similar experiments were conducted with SulfoB-encapsulating liposomes composed of DOPC (Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol in a 1:1 molar ratio. GST-6K, even at relatively higher concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, was incapable of disrupting these liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). These observations, taken together, indicated that CHIKV 6K is probably unable to damage membranes rich in cholesterol. Free, purified GST did not display any significant ability to disrupt membranes, indicating that the GST tag did not influence the effect of CHIKV 6K on membranes in any way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>6K and E2 localization within cells indicate plasma membrane trafficking</title>
<p>The inability of CHIKV 6K to cause leakage in plasma membrane specific liposomes was somewhat surprising, as the stipulated role of 6K during virus particle egress implies some association with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref021">21</xref>]. We, therefore, tested the cellular location of 6K tagged with EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) in mammalian epithelial cells using confocal microscopy. Upon transfection of EGFP-6K into HEK (Human Embryonic Kidney) 293T cells, the GFP fluorescence showed a very high degree of localization with the ER, partial localization with Golgi membranes, but no localization to mitochondria, nucleus or the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g004">Fig 4A–4E</xref>). HEK-293T cells were also co-transfected with pCDNA3.1 containing either CHIKV E2 or E1 glycoproteins, along with GFP-6K. The E1 and E2 glycoproteins were expressed in conjunction with an N-terminal myc-tag, which was detected with an anti-rabbit HRP conjugated antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). 6K selectively localized with E2 as opposed to E1 and traversed to the plasma membrane upon simultaneous expression with E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). This data, in conjunction with previous instances of E2 trafficking to the plasma membrane by itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref035">35</xref>], suggests that the physiological role of 6K in infected cells is quite possibly dependent on E2, which might dictate the trafficking of 6K to the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Oligomers of 6K form ion channels in membranes <italic>in silico</italic></title>
<p>In order to better understand the mode of membrane association and ion channel formation by CHIKV 6K, we carried out microsecond scale (1.5 μs) MD simulation studies. In the absence of an experimentally derived tertiary structure for 6K, two different predicted structures - 6k<sub>1</sub> and 6k<sub>2</sub>—were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5A-i and 5B-i</xref> respectively).

</fig>
<p>When a single molecule of 6k<sub>1</sub> was embedded within a pre-equilibrated POPC (1-pamitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) membrane the peptide adopted an overall angular conformation with the central alpha-helical segment (<sup>14</sup>QQPLFWLQALIPLAALIVLCNCLR<sup>37</sup>) attaining an almost 15-degree tilt with respect to its initial conformation. The peptide retained this conformation for the rest of the simulation period.</p>
<p>However, embedding 6 molecules of 6k<sub>1</sub> in the membrane led to the formation of a small stable channel through which ions were observed to pass through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5A-iv</xref>). Secondary structural analysis of the individual monomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007548.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) showed that 6k<sub>1</sub> primarily remains helical during simulation time, with the central alpha-helical segment of each monomer spanning through the length of the membrane, thereby providing structural stability to the overall complex. The average size of the channel was found to be ~1 nm, which is sufficient for ions and small molecules like sulforhodamine B to pass through and also corresponds closely to the channel diameter obtained from electrophysiology experiments. We utilized the “Pore Walker” server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref036">36</xref>] to detect the residues within the channel and found that the channel lumen was primarily lined by residues Ala<sup>1</sup>, Thr<sup>2</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>, Glu<sup>5</sup>, Ile<sup>24</sup>, Pro<sup>25</sup>, Ala<sup>28</sup>, Leu<sup>32</sup> and Arg<sup>37</sup> from each monomer.</p>
<p>Similar simulations studies with the oligomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5B-ii</xref>) of 6k<sub>2</sub> produced an interesting outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5B-iii, iv</xref>). No stable channel for ion passage, unlike that observed for 6k<sub>1</sub> oligomers, were detected in these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5-iv</xref>). A plausible explanation for this discrepancy was provided by the difference in the orientation of the N-terminal helix in 6k<sub>1</sub> and 6k<sub>2</sub> conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5A-i and 5B-i</xref> respectively). We generated two potential oligomeric arrangements with the best possible spatial placement of 6k<sub>1</sub> and 6k<sub>2</sub>. The 6k<sub>1</sub> oligomer contains the N-terminal helices positioned towards the interior of the assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5A-ii</xref>), whereas the 6k<sub>2</sub> oligomer has the N-terminal helices projected outwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g005">Fig 5B-ii</xref>). The hydrophobicity plot for 6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) clearly shows that, except the small N-terminal stretch of approximately 15–20 residues, the rest of the sequence is considerably hydrophobic. Thus, as the simulation progressed, the inward orientation of N-terminal helices of 6k<sub>1</sub> probably favored the stabilization of the channel, widening it enough for the passage of small molecules; whereas, for 6K<sub>2</sub>, the cavity collapsed on itself, thus hindering the formation of a stable channel. Our simulation studies provide indications as to how CHIKV 6K forms ion channels within biological membranes and the dynamics of ion conduction and hints towards the critical role of the N-terminal residues of 6K in the formation and stabilization of the ion channel.</p>

<title>6K also displays membrane fusogenic properties</title>
<p>During the visualization of GST-6K interaction with ER mimicking liposomes by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), the formation of a population of liposomes with larger diameter was noticed. Further studies clearly showed the occurrence of liposomal fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), which was further investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). First, 1 mM calcium chloride was utilized as a positive control, as calcium ions are known to facilitate fusion of artificial vesicles <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref037">37</xref>]. Addition of calcium chloride resulted in a size-shift of vesicles to larger liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Upon exposure of ER-mimicking liposomes to 1 μM GST-6K, a distinct overall increase in the diameter of vesicles was noted, indicating the presence of larger sized structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This additional, fusogenic ability of CHIKV 6K appears to be similar to that of the M2 channel protein of Influenza A virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref038">38</xref>]. Given these similarities between Influenza A M2 and CHIKV 6K, we attempted to check whether the membrane fusion events orchestrated by CHIKV 6K could be prevented by amantadine, a well-known inhibitor of M2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref038">38</xref>]. The fusion of ER-mimicking liposomes by GST-6K was entirely abrogated by 1μM amantadine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

Transfection of the structural protein cassette resulted in the formation of CHIKV VLPs, which were purified and observed using cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). While the majority of particles generated from untreated cells (~74%) displayed the usual size and morphology of wild type CHIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), particles generated from amantadine-treated cells were relatively smaller, heterogeneous, and in some cases appeared to lack lipid-associated glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).

<p>To check whether the inhibitory activity of amantadine on correct virus assembly extends to the infectivity of virus particles, the ability of CHIKV (strain S 27) to replicate in vero cells was tested in presence and absence of amantadine. First, any cytotoxic effects of amantadine on vero cells was tested with different concentrations of the drug (25–200 μM) for 24 h. MTT assay showed that while ~100% cells were viable upon being treated with 100 μM of amantadine, the cellular viability decreased to 95% upon treatment with 150 μM of the drug, and was further reduced to 88% with 200 μM of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). To check the effect of amantadine on CHIKV replication, a dose kinetics assay was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), in which vero cells were either mock infected or infected with CHIKV (MOI 0.1) and treated with different concentrations of the drug (2.5–200 μM). Cell culture supernatants were harvested at 18 hpi and plaque assay, as well as qRT-PCR, were carried out to estimate the virus titer.

<p>Additionally, for assessing the effect of amantadine on CHIKV propagation at different time points post-infection, a growth kinetics experiment was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Vero cells infected with CHIKV (0.1 MOI) and treated with 60 μM of amantadine, 90 minutes post infection, were harvested at 6, 12 and 18hpi, and the harvested cell culture supernatants were processed through a plaque assay to estimate the viral titer. It was observed that there was ~38% reduction in viral titer at 6hpi and ~60% reduction at 12hpi and 18hpi as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g008">Fig 8C</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although different virus families have distinct mechanisms for host interaction, however, there exist notable similarities in the processes of entry, uncoating, replication, and egress. Some examples are membrane fusion for cellular entry of enveloped viruses, amphipathic peptide-mediated membrane disruption by non-enveloped viruses, and viroporin-mediated membrane alteration/remodeling for facilitating viral propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref041">41</xref>]. These analogous steps in the virus-host interaction pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref043">43</xref>] can potentially be targeted for generating broad-spectrum antivirals. This approach may ultimately be more cost-effective than engineering separate therapies against specific viral pathogens.</p>
<p>Viroporins constitute a group of virally encoded membrane-interacting proteins that are crucial for initiating and maintaining successful viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref041">41</xref>] and consequently are suitable therapeutic targets. The 6K protein from alphaviruses, due to its ion channel forming ability, and its critical role in facilitating virus budding, has been considered a member of the viroporin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref024">24</xref>]; although the analogue protein from CHIKV has not been characterized functionally. Here, we show for the first time that the 6K protein from CHIKV associates into oligomers and interacts with membranes–two essential features which categorize virally encoded proteins as viroporins. Interestingly, our data show that CHIKV 6K interacts with membranes in multifaceted ways–it can induce ion channel formation, allow passage of small molecules like fluorescent dyes, and also facilitate fusion of vesicles. As this kind of complex membrane association was earlier identified for the M2 protein of Influenza A Virus, also categorized as a viroporin, we attempted to test whether an existing, FDA-approved and marketed M2 ion channel inhibitor–amantadine- can affect the functionality of CHIKV 6K. Our data showed that indeed, amantadine at a concentration of 1μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref045">45</xref>] was able to inhibit ion channel activity, vesicle fusion and membrane permeabilization properties of 6K <italic>in vitro</italic>. We further hypothesized that if 6K is required for correct budding of CHIKV particles from cells, the inhibition of 6K functionality by amantadine would lead to the production of virus particles with a significant degree of aberrance in morphology, similar to the phenotype earlier observed upon deletion of 6K in other alphaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref021">21</xref>]. We found that indeed, amantadine at a concentration of 1μM was sufficient to cause structural aberrations in a majority of CHIKV virus-like particles budding out of cells. This effect of amantadine on the activity of CHIKV 6K is surprising, given the lack of primary sequence similarity between 6K and M2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref044">44</xref>]. However, there could be similarities in the tertiary or quaternary folds of M2 and 6K, which might allow amantadine binding and is worthy of further investigation through structural studies.</p>
<p>Given the effect of amantadine on particle morphology, we tested the possibility of utilizing amantadine as an inhibitor of CHIKV infection. Vero cells infected with CHIKV virions (strain S 27), showed a significant decrease in viral titer upon exposure to 5 μM or more amantadine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). This concentration was higher than that required for alteration of particle morphology, which indicates that during infection, there could be other compensatory factors resulting in the generation of infectious particles, or that the morphologically altered particles do retain some infectivity. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of amantadine was calculated to be 29.51 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007548.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), which is comparable to that observed for other antiviral drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref046">46</xref>]. Additionally, the qRT-PCR assay also confirmed that the expression of viral RNA progressively reduced with increase in amantadine concentration. Moreover, through a growth curve analysis, it was observed that the addition of amantadine inhibited CHIKV infection remarkably at later times <italic>in vitro</italic>. This strongly implies that 6K is indeed a valuable target for the development of pan-alphaviral inhibitors, using amantadine and its derivatives as the starting point.</p>
<p>Our work also highlights interesting features of 6K localization and functionality, which are essential for understanding the mechanism of CHIKV assembly. Our liposome assays show that CHIKV 6K preferentially disrupts vesicles that mimic the lipid composition of the endoplasmic reticulum (~ 60% disruption) as opposed to those that mimic the lipid profile of plasma membrane (~10% disruption). Likewise, recombinant expression of 6K in mammalian cells results in the protein being localized primarily in ER, highlighting a preference shown by the protein for the ER membrane. Indeed, it appears that enhanced cholesterol composition, as present in the plasma membrane, is a deterrent for 6K; however, existing literature conjectures that 6K forms ion channels in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref016">16</xref>]. In order to rationalize these contradictory phenomena, we hypothesized that 6K can probably traffic to the plasma membrane, only if it has a binding partner. Specifically, previous studies showing that the E2 glycoprotein of other alphaviruses interact with 6K, that any detrimental alteration in 6K hinders effective glycoprotein processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref021">21</xref>], and that E2 is also capable of traversing to the plasma membrane on its own, led us to conjecture that E2 might play a role in conveying 6K to the plasma membrane. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out confocal microscopy studies of EGFP tagged 6K, in presence of E1 and/or E2 glycoproteins; and found that CHIKV 6K strongly colocalizes with E2 as opposed to E1, and that its primary location is altered to the plasma membrane upon co-expression with E2. It is possible that the functionality of 6K in altering ionic homeostasis at the plasma membrane is contingent upon its alliance with E2 during virus budding, and that 6K in presence of E2 utilizes the trans-golgi network from ER to reach the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Our data shows that CHIKV 6K has the propensity to form oligomers and can integrate with planar lipid membranes to produce ion channels. However, how these oligomeric associations are stabilized can only be answered from high resolution experimental structural data. All-atom molecular dynamics simulation studies indicate that the diameter of channels formed by 6K oligomers is in the range of 1.0–1.10 nm, which is sufficient for the passage of small ions and fluorescent dyes. A 2D classification of GST-6K particles dotting the surface of ER liposomes also indicated heterogeneity in the structure of particles formed on these liposome surfaces. A close analysis of amino acids forming the lumen of the channel identified a sizeable proportion of residues from the hydrophilic N-terminal region of individual monomers. The rest of the polypeptide, which is highly hydrophobic, appeared to provide the necessary structural anchorage required to prevent the collapse of the channel. The validity of this arrangement for channel formation is highlighted by attempted simulations with an oligomeric form of 6K, where the N-terminal regions of individual monomers extended outwards from the channel. In this particular arrangement, the central helical transmembrane segments collapsed on one another, disrupting the formation of the central channel.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the field have indicated that the transframe or TF variant of 6K may also be involved in membrane penetration and may be packaged in virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref007">7</xref>]; while the fate of 6K is to remain associated with cellular membranes. Since the sequence for ribosomal frameshift is inherent in the 6K cDNA, we expect that a minor proportion of recombinant protein produced by us will also have an altered C-terminus. However, this alteration will consist of incorporation of an expression-vector derived stretch of 7 residues, which is entirely different from the actual C-terminal region of TF derived from the CHIKV genome. This minor population of recombinantly generated variant is therefore not expected to have similar functionality as viral genome generated and virus-incorporated TF. In the absence of detailed structural and functional data on 6K and TF, it is at this point impossible to comment on the possibly separate roles played by these components in the life cycle of alphaviruses. Our work highlights the biophysical characteristics and functionalities of CHIKV 6K that are analogous to those displayed by viroporins and attempts to fundamentally characterize its cellular localization and multifaceted membrane interacting abilities. We hope that given the requirement for 6K for the propagation of the important human pathogen CHIKV, efforts will be made to utilize 6K as a drug target to develop therapeutic strategies in the future.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of GST-6K</title>
<p>Expression of GST-6K was induced in E. coli Rosetta pLysS cells. Cells were grown at 37°C until OD reached 0.8, when the temperature was reduced to 18°C, followed by addition of 1 mM IPTG. After 3 hours of induction, cells were pelleted and the expression of GST-6K was confirmed by western blotting, using an anti-GST antibody (Abcam, USA). The pelleted cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol and 1% CHAPS, lysed by sonication, followed by centrifugation to remove cellular debris, and a two-step purification process. In the first step, the soluble fraction was incubated with 200 μl of GST beads (Pierce Glutathione Agarose, Thermo Scientific) for 60 minutes at 4°C, with shaking, to pull down the fusion protein. The bound protein was eluted from beads using 10–20 mM glutathione in lysis buffer. The second step of purification involved size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 10/300 G/L column, using an ÄKTApurifier 10 (GE Healthcare).

<title>Electrophysiology experiments</title>
<p>Purified GST-6K was incorporated in the bilayer membrane as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref052">52</xref>]. The apparatus for electrophysiology experiments consisted of a polystyrene cuvette (Warner Instruments) with a thin wall separating two aqueous compartments. The polystyrene divider had a circular aperture with a diameter of 150μm. Both compartments were filled with 1 ml buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and connected to an integrating patch amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) through a matched pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes. The cis chamber was connected to the head stage (CV-203BU) of the amplifier, while the trans-chamber was held at virtual ground. A solution of DPhPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, USA) and cholesterol (6:1) in n-decane (10 μl) was painted over the aperture to form the membrane. Reconstitution of GST-6K in BLM (Bilayer Membrane) was initiated by adding desired concentration (0.2, 0.85, 1.2, 2.6 ng/μl) of protein in BLM buffer, followed by mixing using a magnetic stirrer. A sudden shift in the membrane current indicated the incorporation of the channel in BLM. For amantadine inhibition experiments, GST-6K was added to a final concentration of 2.6 ng/μl. Amantadine to a final concentration of 1 μM was added to the BLM buffer containing GST-6K only after ensuring that the protein has properly integrated in the membrane. Channel current was recorded using Digidata (1440A, Axon Instruments), Low pass Bessel filter of 2 KHz and the acquisition software CLAMPEX (PCLAMP 10.2, Axon Instruments). The channel current was recorded at fixed applied membrane potentials in the range of -100 to +100mV at a sampling frequency of 10 KHz (temperature between 24–25°C). Open and closed states of the channel (s) were identified as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref052">52</xref>].

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>In the absence of any experimentally determined three-dimensional structure for CHIKV 6K, two different structures predicted by the server Bhageerath-H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref057">57</xref>] were utilized for simulation studies. Both structures contain a central alpha-helical segment with two other short helical stretches at the N- and the C-termini. The predicted three-dimensional structures of CHIKV 6K were embedded within a pre-equilibrated 392 POPC lipid bilayer. Peptide molecule(s) were placed perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. The entire system was solvated in water and 100 mM NaCl was added. After equilibration for 100 ns, the system was simulated without position restraints for 700 ns. After 700 ns, an electric field corresponding to 90–110 mV was switched on along the z-axis for facilitating ion conduction through the channel. All simulations were carried out for 1.5 μs, using the GROMACS package v5.1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref058">58</xref>]. Specific simulation steps followed has been outlined earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref059">59</xref>]. Gromacs analysis tools, UCSF Chimera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref060">60</xref>] and VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0007548.ref061">61</xref>] were utilized for data analysis and molecular visualization.</p>
