Here, we show that defective <italic>vif</italic> alleles can readily be found in HIV-1 isolates and infected patients. Single residue changes in the Vif protein sequence are sufficient to cause the loss of Vif-induced APOBEC3 neutralization. Interestingly, not all the detected defects lead to a complete inactivation of Vif function since some mutants retained selective neutralizing activity against APOBEC3F but not APOBEC3G or vice versa. Concordantly, independently hypermutated proviruses with distinguishable patterns of G-to-A substitution attributable to cytidine deamination induced by APOBEC3G, APOBEC3F, or both enzymes were present in individuals carrying proviruses with completely or partly defective Vif variants. Natural variation in Vif function may result in selective and partial neutralization of cytidine deaminases and thereby promote viral sequence diversification within HIV-1 infected individuals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Host cells express DNA-editing enzymes, termed APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, that are capable of profoundly attenuating the replication of retroviruses.

These findings extend the conventional view that errors of reverse transcription and recombination are largely responsible for the rapid evolution of HIV-1 in vivo. Indeed, variation in Vif function may profoundly impact the extent and direction of viral sequence evolution within HIV-1-infected individuals.

Importantly, the expression of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F seems to be coordinated, probably because they have arisen by gene duplication/ recombination and possess highly homologous promoters. Both are expressed in cell populations susceptible to HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b17">17</xref>].</p><p>APOBEC3G- or APOBEC3F-catalyzed deamination is not highly sequence-specific, and many cytidines on the minus strand of nascent retroviral genomes or reporter genes can be deaminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b20">20</xref>]. However, dinucleotide context strongly influences the efficiency with which cytidine deamination occurs, such that 5′-dCdC and 5′-dTdC are the favored dinucleotides targeted by APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b21">21</xref>]. Cytidine deamination events can be manifested as G-to-A changes on the plus strand of the viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b21">21</xref>], and incomplete suppression of cytidine deaminases by HIV-1 Vif might explain the adenosine biased nucleotide composition of the HIV-1 genome. Similarly, the occasional occurrence of hypermutated genomes containing numerous G-to-A changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b26">26</xref>] could reflect occasional inactivating mutations in HIV-1 Vif. Overall, it seems likely that Vif-mediated protection of HIV-1 genomes from host-mediated viral cDNA deamination in vivo is not absolute.</p><p>Thus far, analyses of natural variation in HIV-1 Vif function have been restricted to prediction of defects resulting from gross mutations (e.g., missing translation initiation or premature stop codons). Indeed, some reports suggest that long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) harbor grossly mutated Vif more frequently than do those with progressive HIV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b27">27</xref>]. However, this is not a consistent finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b29">29</xref>]. Because natural variation in the function of apparently intact HIV-1 <italic>vif</italic> alleles remains largely unexplored, we examined the extent of variation in APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F neutralizing activity among naturally occurring HIV-1 Vif variants. Surprisingly, we found that apparently intact but inactive Vif variants are frequently detected in viral sequences from very different sources. Importantly, we also found Vif variants that selectively fail to neutralize APOBEC3G and/or APOBEC3F activity, as well as proviruses in LTNPs that appeared to be independently hypermutated as a result of APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F action. These studies indicate that sporadic inactivation of Vif likely occurs rather frequently in vivo, and that natural variation in Vif function is likely to profoundly impact the extent and direction of viral sequence evolution within HIV-1-infected individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Naturally Occurring Vif Diversity</title><p>Two distinct sources of Vif alleles were selected in order to either maximize or minimize the occurrence of inactive variants. The first group was derived from uncultured DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of three extensively studied individuals (P1, P2, and P3) with non-progressive HIV-1 infection for more than 20 y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b35">35</xref>]. We reasoned that the very low (undetectable) level of HIV-1 replication that occurs in these individuals would maximize the chances of detecting naturally occurring defective <italic>vif</italic> alleles, because replication-defective HIV-1 variants should not be obscured by superimposed replicating virus. Moreover, some viral DNA sequences in these individuals contained numerous G-to-A changes in the 5′LTR (P2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b33">33</xref>] and in <italic>gag</italic> (P3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b31">31</xref>]. Amplification and sequence analysis of APOBEC3G mRNA from all three LTNPs excluded the possibility that hypermutation of viral sequences was due to the existence of a naturally occurring Vif-resistant APOBEC3G mutant (data not shown).</p><p>A second set of Vif variants was derived from four short-term HIV-1 isolates (V1, V2, V3, and V4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b36">36</xref>]. Vif variants were cloned after a limited period of co-culture of patient cells with “non-permissive” PBMCs, so as to provide a selective pressure for active <italic>vif</italic> alleles while minimizing the introduction of new mutations. V1, V3, and V4 were obtained from recently infected individuals, and V2 was obtained from a chronically infected patient. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0010006-st001">Table S1</xref> provides a summary of characteristics of the patients from which viral isolates and DNA were obtained.</p><p>The phylogenetic relationships among a total of 79 independent <italic>vif</italic> sequences obtained from these sources is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

In addition, a subpopulation of obviously defective Vif sequences from P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>) contained numerous G-to-A substitutions.

Therefore, we employed a functional test to measure Vif activity. We generated VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 vector particles in the presence of APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F and patient/isolate-derived Vif proteins and measured their infectivity using a reporter cell-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Additionally, APOBEC3F was more resistant to neutralization by NL4–3 Vif, which restored infectivity to about 15% to 25% of its uninhibited level, even at the maximum level of Vif expression tested.

In fact, nine of the 40 apparently intact Vif proteins were non-functional despite the fact that they were well expressed. One additional amino-terminally truncated Vif variant (V4–8) that contained a stop at codon 11 but was expressed via an alternative translation initiation site at codon 16 was found to be inactive. Five additional <italic>vif</italic> variants (P2, P3) that contained premature stop codons were assumed to be inactive.

Additionally, even among functional Vif variants, there was significant variation in the extent to which they restored HIV-1 infectivity that was not explained by variation in expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mutations Conferring Loss of APOBEC3G- and/or APOBEC3F-Neutralizing Activity</title><p>To determine the amino acid substitutions responsible for functional inactivation of apparently intact Vif proteins, we identified the closest functional relative of each non-functional variant.

Interestingly, mutants W11R, K22E, Y40H, and E45G displayed a selective propensity to neutralize one of the two APOBEC3 proteins. These mutants were analyzed in more detail by measuring viral infectivity in the presence of APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F and varying levels of Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). This analysis revealed that the K22E mutant retained partial activity against APOBEC3F but was inactive against APOBEC3G. The Y40H and E45G Vif mutants neutralized APOBEC3F activity almost as efficiently as wild-type NL4–3 Vif, but displayed only weak activity against APOBEC3G. Conversely, the W11R mutant exhibited the precisely opposite phenotype and neutralized APOBEc3G but not APOBEC3F. Thus, naturally occurring mutations can result in Vif variants that neutralize one but not the other cytidine deaminase.</p><fig id="ppat-0010006-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010006.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Effect of Naturally Occurring Single Amino Acid Substitutions on NL4–3 Vif APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F Neutralization Activity</title><p>The HIV-1 vector infectivity generated in the presence of APOBEC3G (A) and APOBEC3F (B) and a fixed dose of NL4–3 Vif mutant was measured.

This is perhaps due to the fact that the three LTNPs became infected more than 20 y ago, quite early in the North-American HIV-1 epidemic and around the time the viral isolate NY5, which comprises the 5′ portion of the reference sequence NL4–3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b37">37</xref>], was obtained. Conversely, the viral isolates were derived from patients infected in the late 1990s. Nonetheless, the fraction of changes relative to the reference sequence that were G-to-A mutations was quite similar for patient and viral isolate sequences (about 25% of all changes) and higher than would be expected if nucleotide substitutions were random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This phenotype was exaggerated in several P2- and P3-derived sequences that were clearly hypermutated. In some cases, examples of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">5</xref>B, about 65–70% of all changes relative to the reference sequence were G-to-A changes. In P1, no obviously hypermutated viral sequences were detected, while in P2 and P3, viral DNA was often hypermutated and defective. Indeed, hypermutated Vif sequences were previously detected in P3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In principle, G-to-A mutations can occur in one of four different dinucleotide contexts. We sequenced hrGFP-containing viral DNA generated following infection with HIV-1 vectors assembled in the presence of APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F. Consistent with recent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b11">11</xref>], APOBEC3F primarily induced GA-to-AA changes and very few GG-to-AG changes in hrGFP. Conversely, APOBEC3G caused twice as many GG-to-AG as GA-to-AA changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In the sequences from all the isolate-derived DNA as well as in some patient-derived <italic>Gag-Pol</italic> clones (e.g., P1–29, P3–11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), GA-to-AA changes were more prevalent than GG-to-AG changes, relative to the reference sequence, suggesting that HIV-1 is more often mutated by APOBEC3F than by APOBEC3G. In contrast, in the extensively hypermutated <italic>Gag-Pol</italic> clones (e.g., P2–21, P2–31, P3–2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g005">5</xref>B) there was an approximately 2:1 ratio of GG-to-AG versus AG-to-AA substitutions, which closely recapitulated the result of APOBEC3G- (and not APOBEC3F-) induced hrGFP mutagenesis.</p><p>Because the p17MA region of <italic>Gag</italic> provided a reasonable representation of mutations present in <italic>Gag-Pol,</italic> and because p17MA sequences present in P3 had previously been extensively sampled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b31">31</xref>], we restricted a more detailed phylogenetic analysis to this region. Thus, the larger dataset comprised a total of 70 p17MA sequences, and the phylogenetic analysis is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>A. Notably, the p17MA sequences obtained from a single individual harboring numerous hypermutated proviruses (P3) were exceptionally heterogeneous and exhibited greater diversity than that observed among a selection of subtype B reference sequences. While very diverse hypermutated sequences co-existed in a patient and sometimes within a single sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), sampling bias due to the very low number of proviruses present in these LTNPs makes it difficult to derive conclusions about temporal variation in the proportion of hypermutated to “normal” sequences. Nonetheless, it was clear that in some individuals at some time-points, hypermutated sequences predominated. Notably, individual p17MA clones contained distinct patterns of G-to-A substitutions that reflect the generation of multiple, independently hypermutated proviruses within a single individual. Moreover, some clones almost exclusively harbored GG-to-AG changes relative to the reference sequence (e.g., P2–3, P2–5, P3–8, P3–9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), while in others GA-to-AA changes predominated (e.g., P3–13, P3–14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In other clones, GG-to-AG and GA-to-AA substitutions occurred in variable proportions. This bias recapitulated the footprints expected to result from mutation induced either by APOBEC3G, APOBEC3F, or a mixture of both and is likely, therefore, the result of variation in the ability of Vif, within an individual, to neutralize these cytidine deaminases.</p><fig id="ppat-0010006-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010006.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic Relationships and Hypermutation in p17MA Sequences</title><p>(A) Neighbor joining tree representing the phylogenetic relationships among 70 independent p17MA sequences derived from patients (P1, P2, P3) and viral isolates (V1, V2, V3, V4).

In turn, lentivirus Vif proteins counter the antiretroviral activity of these cytidine deaminases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b05">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b12">12</xref>] by inducing their degradation.</p><p>While defective <italic>vif</italic> alleles should render the majority of HIV-1 progeny virions noninfectious, establishment of proviruses that have APOBEC3G- and/or APOBEC3F-induced mutations should endow the proviral population with additional diversity beyond that resulting from error-prone reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b03">3</xref>]. Here, we show that defective <italic>vif</italic> alleles are easily found, even in a relatively small sample of viral isolates and uncultured viral DNA from infected individuals. Because active and defective Vif variants were detected in similar proportions (about 19%) in LTNP DNA and viral isolates, it seems probable that Vif is sporadically inactivated at some frequency by reverse transcriptase errors or cytidine deamination in all HIV-1-infected individuals. We also found multiple, independent hypermutated proviruses in two of the three LTNPs studied. It is likely that the relative ease of detection of extensively hypermutated proviruses is an unusual property of LTNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b26">26</xref>] and hypermutated proviruses are only rarely detected in other situations because they are obscured by superimposed replication competent virus. Put another way, the ease of detection of hypermutated HIV-1 is likely a consequence, rather than a cause, of LTNP status.</p><p>A recent report provides independent evidence for the occurrence of sporadic Vif inactivation in vivo: indeed, more than 9% of proviral sequences derived from resting CD4+ cells of HAART-treated patients with plasma viremia below the level of detection were found to be hypermutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b40">40</xref>].</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed a number of residues and domains located throughout Vif that are essential for infectivity and viral replication in non-permissive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b44">44</xref>]. We identified here several examples of naturally occurring mutations in Vif that induce selective defects in APOBEC3G- or APOBEC3F-neutralizing activity. Interestingly, these occurred toward the amino-terminus of Vif, while those causing general defects occurred either near the amino-terminus or close to the functionally important SLQ motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b45">45</xref>]. These findings suggest the possibility that the Vif amino-terminal domain contains determinants that confer specific binding to APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F. Such mutations should cause nascent viral DNA to be exposed either to APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F or both, with the induction of very different patterns of G-to-A changes in the viral quasi-species. Due to the nature of sampling proviral DNA in a patient, it is practically impossible to link a particular Vif point mutant to a subsequently generated hypermutated provirus. Nonetheless, even within a tiny fraction of the total burden of, e.g., P3′s HIV-1 sequences, Vif variants that selectively failed to neutralize APOBEC3G as well as p17MA sequences bearing the footprint of selective mutation by either cytidine deaminase were rather easily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Selective and sporadic loss of cytidine deaminase neutralization can result in massive sequence variation. Indeed, the extent of p17MA sequence diversity within one of the individuals studied herein (P3) surpassed the variation observed among a selection of subtype B reference sequences and contemporary isolates. While the bulk of hypermutated proviruses are replication defective, they could, in principle, provide a genetic “resource,” and selected fragments could easily be recombined into the circulating viral population as cells harboring them become super-infected. Moreover, while intermittent inactivation of Vif has the measurable consequence of deposition of hypermutated proviruses, this likely represents an extreme manifestation of the loss-of-function phenotype. It is quite likely that more subtle (and less easily measurable) variation in Vif's anti-APOBEC3G and anti-APOBEC3F activities occurs at greater frequency than the roughly 20% inactivation documented herein. It is also interesting that some of the mutations that affected Vif function were themselves the result of G-to-A changes. Thus, “feedback” loops of Vif mutation resulting in more or less mutation of Vif and other viral genes could result from variation in Vif function.</p><p>The high adenosine content of lentiviral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b22">22</xref>] and the sporadic detection of hypermutated genomes in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010006-b26">26</xref>] suggest that cytidine deamination provides an important source of viral diversification. Thus, an activity that likely evolved as a host defense against viruses might have been usurped and may facilitate HIV-1 escape from immunological and pharmacological inhibition. In addition, an appreciation of the respective contributions of viral and host-mediated mutagenesis to viral diversity may be important for determining the potential efficacy and the potential risks associated with the use of antiretroviral strategies that target vif:APOBEC3G/3F interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patient-derived and NL4–3 mutant <italic>vif</italic> alleles.</title><p>DNA was extracted from either patient's PBMCs (P1, P2, and P3), or from PBMCs used for viral propagation (V1, V2, V3, V4) using DNeasy DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States).
