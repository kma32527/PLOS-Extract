However, these cell types are considered resistant to killing by LT. Here we show that LT kills primary human DCs in vitro, and murine DCs in vitro and in vivo. Kinetics of LT-mediated killing of murine DCs, as well as cell death pathways induced, were dependent upon genetic background: LT triggered rapid necrosis in BALB/c-derived DCs, and slow apoptosis in C57BL/6-derived DCs. This is consistent with rapid and slow killing of LT-injected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. We present evidence that anthrax LT impairs adaptive immunity by specifically targeting DCs. This may represent an immune-evasion strategy of the bacterium, and contribute to anthrax disease progression. We also established that genetic background determines whether apoptosis or necrosis is induced by LT. Finally, killing of C57BL/6-derived DCs by LT mirrors that of human DCs, suggesting that C57BL/6 DCs represent a better model system for human anthrax than the prototypical BALB/c macrophages.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized white blood cells that identify and present antigens to immune cells, T cells, in order to mount an immune response targeted against specific pathogens. DCs are critical to a host's defense against infection. Previous work has shown that the anthrax bacterium disables many immune cells, including DCs, through the action of a released toxin, lethal toxin. Here the authors show that lethal toxin efficiently kills both human and murine DCs. The means by which DCs were killed by the anthrax toxin were notably distinct and dependent on their genetic background. Human DCs, as well as those derived from the murine strain C57BL/6, died over the course of 72 h via activation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. DCs from BALB/c mice, however, died rapidly of a necrotic cell death following toxin exposure. As human and C57BL/6 DCs share an identical response to anthrax toxin, C57BL/6 mice appear to provide an excellent model for human anthrax. The study's findings suggest that specific targeting of DCs by the anthrax toxin impairs the immune response of the infected host, and the authors believe that this strategy promotes spread of the bacterium and disease progression.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Alileche A, Serfass ER, Muehlbauer SM, Porcelli SA, Brojatsch J (2005) Anthrax lethal toxin-mediated killing of human and murine dendritic cells impairs the adaptive immune response.

Lethal toxin consists of two components: protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF). PA binds to specific cell surface receptors and mediates endocytosis of LF, a metalloprotease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b06">6</xref>]. LF cleaves six of seven mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MAPKKs), thereby disrupting MAPK signaling pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b08">8</xref>]). Despite ubiquitous uptake by mammalian cells, LT kills only a few cell types, including murine macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b04">4</xref>]. Susceptibility of murine macrophages to LT killing is strain-specific, and is controlled by a region of Chromosome 11 that encodes the kinesin-like motor protein Kif1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>B. anthracis</italic> appears to combat the host immune response by inactivating MAPK pathways, which renders immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), nonresponsive to immune stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b13">13</xref>]. This may weaken the immune response by limiting the production of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b16">16</xref>].

These findings call into question the in vivo relevance of LT-mediated nonresponsiveness. DCs, which are considered resistant to LT-mediated cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>], are key elements of the adaptive immune response, and are responsible for uptake and presentation of microbial antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b18">18</xref>]. Upon maturation, DCs migrate to secondary lymphoid organs where they stimulate naïve T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b18">18</xref>].</p><p>Here we report that murine and human DCs are efficiently killed by LT. The mechanism of LT-mediated DC killing is dependent on genetic background: LT triggers rapid necrotic cell death in BALB/c-derived DCs, and slow apoptosis in C57BL/6-derived DCs, as well as human DCs. Finally, we show rapid DC depletion in LT-treated BALB/c mice, suggesting direct immune impairment and in vivo relevance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Killing of Human DCs by Anthrax LT</title><p>LT-treated DCs were reported to be non-responsive to LPS stimulation, as well as impaired in their abilit7y to present antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>]. To determine whether the impairment of DCs could be due to cytopathic effects mediated by LT, we generated immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) from human peripheral blood monocytes. MoDCs were found to be CD11c<sup>+</sup>, CD80<sup>+</sup>, CD86<sup>+</sup>, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>, DEC-205<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>−</sup>, and CD16<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g001">Figure 1</xref>), consistent with markers found on immature human DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b19">19</xref>]. MoDCs were challenged with a dose of LT (500 ng/ml PA and 250 ng/ml LF) cytotoxic to murine J774A.1 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b20">20</xref>]. In contrast to previous findings, we found that human MoDCs were efficiently killed by LT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>]. LT-treated MoDCs from five different subjects showed a consistent increase in annexin V binding, while remaining propidium iodide-negative 48 h after LT challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g002">2</xref>B). Induction of cytopathic effects was further supported by a drop in MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). At 72 h post-LT exposure, the MTT signal declined to levels only marginally above those observed in MoDCs treated with the apoptosis inducer camptothecin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). No cytopathic effects were observed in MoDCs treated with PA or LF alone (unpublished data). Ultrastructural analysis of LT-treated human MoDCs revealed signs of apoptotic cell death, including chromatin condensation, pycnotic nuclei, and cytoplasmic vacuolization, along with membrane preservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Apoptosis induction was further supported by TUNEL staining of LT-treated MoDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g002">Figure 2</xref>E).

To determine whether BALB/c-derived DCs also require proteasomal activity for LT killing, we added the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or Velcade (bortezomib) to BALB/c-derived BMDCs at different time points following exposure to LT. Both proteasome inhibitors completely blocked LT killing when added simultaneously with LT to BALB/c-derived DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Strikingly, the MTT signal recovered completely from an initial drop when proteasome inhibitors were added to BALB/c BMDCs up to 1 h post-LT exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Partial recovery was obtained when the proteasome inhibitors were added 2 h post-LT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggested that proteasomal degradation of protective factors controls a late step in LT killing of BALB/c DCs. Experiments using proteasome inhibitors were limited to BALB/c DCs, as both MG132 and Velcade were highly toxic to DCs when applied for more than 8 h. It is conceivable that slow LT killing of C57BL/6-derived cells is due to increased levels or stability of putative protective factors. Proteasomes may also control LT-induced morbidity and mortality in LT-treated mice.</p><fig id="ppat-0010019-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010019.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proteasome Inhibitors Block LT-Mediated Killing of BALB/c-Derived DCs</title><p>Proteasome inhibitors MG132 (10 μM) (A), or Velcade (0.1 μM) (B) were added either simultaneously with LT or 1 or 2 h post-LT exposure, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay.

We selected BALB/c mice, the commonly recognized prototype strain for anthrax research, for our in vivo experiments. Consistent with our in vitro data, levels of splenic DCs dropped rapidly in LT-treated BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Levels of DCs declined to 10% of those found in untreated control mice 3 h after LT challenge, and remained at this level for at least 24 h. Levels of splenic macrophages were also reduced, reaching 20% of control levels 24 h post-LT challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

In a previous report, Tournier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b29">29</xref>] showed that infection of C57BL/6 and BALB/c DCs by anthrax spores disrupts the cells' ability to produce cytokines. The authors also reported a loss of viability in BALB/c DCs treated with a combination of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores and purified LT. Our results show that purified LT alone was sufficient to reproduce these observations.</p><p>Our findings on DC killing challenge an earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>], which described DC impairment without cell killing. Agrawal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>] specifically reported no cytopathic effects in LT-treated C57BL/6-derived DCs, as measured by Trypan blue exclusion. This is not surprising, as LT-mediated killing of C57BL/6 BMDCs occurred without significant membrane perturbation. Additionally, they reported no caspase-3 activation in C57BL/6 DCs at 6 and 48 h post-LT exposure. We found that a window of caspase-3 activation occurred between 18 and 32 h (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010019-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). At the time points reported in their study, we also found no increase in active caspase-3.</p><p>We show that genetic background determines the type of cell killing induced by LT: LT triggered rapid necrosis in BALB/c-derived DCs and slow apoptosis in C57BL/6-derived DCs. A genetic polymorphism containing a putative susceptibility factor at the <italic>Kif1c</italic> locus on Chromosome 11 has been identified that correlates with the sensitivity of macrophages to LT killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b30">30</xref>]. We believe that the strain-specific cell death pathways we report are also controlled by this genetic locus. It remains to be shown how genetic factors determine whether apoptotic or necrotic pathways are induced by LT.</p><p>DC killing precedes lethal effects in LT-treated BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice by approximately 24 h, and therefore constitutes an early event in anthrax pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b03">3</xref>]. The reason for selective LT targeting of antigen presenting cells, including macrophages and DCs, is unknown. Murine C57BL/6 DCs and human DCs share slow killing kinetics and induction of apoptosis following LT exposure. Therefore, C57BL/6-derived cells appear to be a better model system for human anthrax than the prototypical BALB/c-derived macrophages, which rapidly undergo necrotic cell death after LT challenge. Induction of distinct cell death pathways suggests that LT-mediated cell killing is controlled by strain-specific regulators and inhibitors. Extensive investigation has led to the discovery of multiple potent apoptosis inhibitors, which might block LT-mediated apoptosis, and possibly anthrax disease progression, in C57BL/6 mice and human subjects. Additionally, these findings might be important for therapeutic applications. It is conceivable that agents that block LT killing are strain-specific, and that drugs blocking LT-mediated killing of BALB/c-derived cells might be inefficient in targeting LT killing of C57BL/6-derived and human cells and vice versa. Based on our findings, it is now possible to differentiate, in LT-treated C57BL/6 mice, cells that are directly killed by LT, presumably by apoptosis induction, from cells killed by indirect means via induction of necrotic pathways.</p><p><italic>B. anthracis</italic> infections appear to challenge the immune system in two phases. During the early phase of infection, subtoxic concentrations of LT disrupt MAPK signaling pathways, rendering immune cells nonresponsive to cytokine and immune stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b13">13</xref>]. We present evidence that this phase is followed by LT killing of DCs, which presumably occurs when the concentration of LT reaches cytotoxic levels. This likely causes additional impairment of adaptive immunity, and represents an immune-evasion strategy of the bacterium. DCs as well as macrophages are primary entry sites of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b32">32</xref>]<italic>,</italic> and early replication of the bacterium occurs exclusively within these cells. The slow LT killing kinetics found in C57BL/6 and human DCs may promote bacterial proliferation.</p><p>Specific targeting of DCs by LT should prevent stimulation of the adaptive immune response, rendering hosts highly susceptible to other microbial pathogens. Depletion of DCs also plays a critical role in human and murine sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b33">33</xref>]. Additionally, it is possible that LT killing of DCs could be exploited in therapeutic applications of the toxin. LT's potential for medical applications is not novel; sublethal LT treatment was employed in nude mice containing human melanoma xenograft tumors, resulting in tumor regression without any cytotoxic side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010019-b34">34</xref>]. Due to the high specificity and sensitivity of DCs to LT, exposure of DCs to specific toxin concentrations could represent a useful approach to transiently suppress the immune response, if cytotoxic effects of LT on other cell types could be effectively controlled or eliminated.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and materials.</title><p>C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, United States).
