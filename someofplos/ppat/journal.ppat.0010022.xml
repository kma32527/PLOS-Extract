In the insect, EP and GPEET procyclins are the major surface glycoproteins of procyclic (midgut) forms of the parasite, with GPEET predominating in the early procyclic form and two isoforms of EP in the late procyclic form. EP procyclins were previously detected on salivary gland trypanosomes, presumably epimastigotes, by immunoelectron microscopy. However, no procyclins could be detected by mass spectrometry when parasites were isolated from infected glands. We have used qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR to analyse the procyclin mRNAs expressed by trypanosomes in the tsetse midgut and salivary glands at different time points after infection. The coding regions of the three EP isoforms (EP1, EP2 and EP3) are extremely similar, but their 3′ untranslated regions contain unique sequences that make it possible to assign the cDNAs amplified by this technique. With the exception of EP2, we found that the spectrum of procyclin mRNAs expressed in the midgut mirrors the protein repertoire of early and established procyclic forms. Surprisingly, procyclin mRNAs, including that of GPEET, are present at relatively high levels in salivary gland trypanosomes, although the proteins are rarely detected by immunofluorescence. Additional experiments using transgenic trypanosomes expressing reporter genes or mutant forms of procyclin point to a mechanism of translational or post-translational control, involving the procyclin coding regions, in salivary gland trypanosomes. It is widely accepted that <italic>T. brucei</italic> always has a coat of either variant surface glycoprotein or procyclin. It has been known for many years that the epimastigote form does not have a variant surface glycoprotein coat. The finding that this life cycle stage is usually negative for procyclin as well is new, and means that the paradigm will need to be revised.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The tropical parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> relies on the tsetse fly for its transmission between mammals. The parasite first establishes an infection in the fly midgut then migrates and colonizes the salivary glands. A paradigm in trypanosome biology is that parasites in contact with the mammalian host are covered by variant surface glycoproteins, enabling them to evade the immune system, while all other life cycle stages are covered by repetitive glycoproteins known as procyclins.</p><p>In this publication the authors investigated the expression pattern of procyclins in all life cycle stages in infected tsetse flies, including epimastigote and metacyclic forms in the salivary glands. These stages are usually neglected as, in contrast to trypanosomes from the midgut, they cannot be cultured. The researchers showed that the vast majority of trypanosomes in the salivary glands have no procyclin coat although the levels of procyclin messenger RNAs are comparatively high. Experiments with reporter genes indicated that procyclin expression in the glands is regulated by the coding region. The lack of procyclins on salivary gland trypanosomes leads to the prediction that the epimastigote form possesses a novel surface coat that may be responsible for the tight binding of the parasite to gland tissue.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Urwyler S, Vassella E, Van Den Abbeele J, Renggli CK, Blundell P, et al.

The parasite causes the disease Nagana in domestic animals in sub-Saharan Africa and two subspecies, <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic>, also cause human sleeping sickness. The fly (<italic>Glossina</italic> spp.) is the definitive host, where genetic exchange can occur, and this part of the life cycle is considerably more complex than that in the mammalian host. When a tsetse fly takes a blood meal from an animal carrying <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the parasites reach the midgut lumen and encounter proteases that can trigger the differentiation of the short stumpy bloodstream form to the early procyclic form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b02">2</xref>]. An infection becomes established when trypanosomes migrate to the ectoperitrophic space of the gut and colonise it as late procyclic forms. It has been recognised only fairly recently that early and established procyclic forms are separate entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b03">3</xref>]. In a second phase, known as maturation, the parasite progresses through several more rounds of differentiation, from the mesocyclic form in the anterior midgut to a recently described asymmetrically dividing form that is thought to deliver the epimastigote form to the salivary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b04">4</xref>]. Proliferating epimastigote forms that are tightly associated with the salivary gland epithelium give rise, in turn, to non-proliferating metacyclic forms that are released with the saliva. It is the metacyclic form that is capable of infecting a new mammalian host.</p><p>It is becoming apparent that the complexity of the life cycle in the fly is matched by equally complex changes at the surface of the parasite. Metacyclic forms and bloodstream forms are covered by a coat of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) that protects the parasite from the host's immune system (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b05">5</xref>]). Differentiation of the bloodstream to the early procyclic form involves shedding of the VSG coat and its replacement by a new coat consisting of procyclins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b07">7</xref>]. There are four different isoforms of procyclin that are named according to internal repeats, GPEET—which contains pentapeptide repeats and is highly phosphorylated—and EP1, EP2 and EP3, all of which contain glutamic acid-proline dipeptide repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b09">9</xref>]. EP1 and EP3 are modified by N-linked carbohydrates whereas EP2 has no such glycosylation site. The individual isoforms can be distinguished by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b10">10</xref>]. We have previously used this technique to examine the procyclin repertoire of trypanosomes differentiating synchronously in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>] and of trypanosomes isolated from infected tsetse flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>]. In culture, all procyclins are expressed at similar levels 3–6 h after triggering differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>], during the phase in which the VSG coat is being replaced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b07">7</xref>]. By 24 h, the cells show the characteristic profile of early procyclic forms, with high levels of GPEET and traces of EP. GPEET is phosphorylated by a membrane-associated kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b13">13</xref>] that also becomes active within a few hours of triggering differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b14">14</xref>]. If glycerol is present in the medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b03">3</xref>] and the mitochondrial alternative oxidase is active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b15">15</xref>], the cells continue to proliferate as early forms and express GPEET. In medium lacking glycerol, the trypanosomes differentiate to late procyclic forms within 7–9 d; this is marked by the replacement of GPEET by the glycosylated isoforms of EP (EP1 and EP3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>] and loss of GPEET kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b13">13</xref>]. The same sequence of events, expression of GPEET by early procyclic forms and its replacement by EP1 and/or EP3 in established procyclic forms also occurs during tsetse fly infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>]. The repression of GPEET in late procyclic forms—both in culture and in the fly—operates through a 25 nucleotide sequence, known as the glycerol responsive element, in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of GPEET mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b15">15</xref>].</p><p>Almost nothing is known about procyclin expression later in the life cycle, as there is no culture system for epimastigote and metacyclic forms of <italic>T. brucei</italic>. EP procyclins have been detected on salivary gland trypanosomes by immunoelectron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b16">16</xref>]. However, no procyclins could be detected by mass spectrometry when trypanosomes were isolated from the salivary glands and processed in the same way as midgut forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>]. As an alternative to studying the proteins, we have analysed the expression and distribution of procyclin mRNAs in trypanosomes in the tsetse midgut and salivary glands at different points after infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis of the Procyclin mRNA Repertoire in Tsetse-Derived Trypanosomes</title><p>A possible explanation for the failure to detect procyclins by MALDI-TOF analysis of salivary gland trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>] is that proteins that are expressed at low levels might be overlooked, particularly when post-translational modification or processing results in a range of products with different masses. We previously found this to be the case for EP procyclins in early procyclic forms; these could be detected at low levels in cultured trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>], but not at all in midgut-derived trypanosomes because of heterogeneous cleavage by tsetse proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>]. As an alternative approach to ascertain if procyclins are expressed by salivary gland trypanosomes, we first used RT-PCR to assay for the presence and the relative distribution of transcripts. Total RNA was isolated from salivary glands at different time points after infection and all four types of procyclin cDNA were amplified using a single pair of primers. RNA isolated from the midguts of the same flies was used as a positive control. We assumed that the ratios of the different procyclin cDNAs would not change significantly during amplification as the mRNAs are very similar in length and sequence. The products were cloned and assigned by hybridisation with oligonucleotides specific for the 3′ UTRs of the individual EP genes or the GPEET coding region. In total, 1,584 procyclin cDNA clones were obtained from infected midguts and 897 from the salivary glands. The distribution of the different types of procyclin during the course of infection is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010022-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-0010022-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010022.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Distribution of Procyclin mRNAs Expressed by Tsetse-Derived Trypanosomes</title><p>RNA was isolated from the midguts and salivary glands at various days post infection and subjected to RT-PCR using generic primers for all procyclins.

The total number of procyclin clones analysed at each time point is indicated within the chart. The standard deviations for the data from days 11–24 derive from two independent tsetse infections.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0010022.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>At day 3, post-infection, the most abundant species of procyclin cDNA obtained from midgut trypanosomes was GPEET (42%). Based on their 3′ UTRs, each of the three EP isoforms accounted for 18–21% of the total. By day 7, however, no GPEET clones were obtained and EP3 and EP2 became the predominant isoforms (51% and 42%, respectively) followed by low levels of EP1 (7%). Very similar patterns of procyclin expression were found in midgut trypanosomes isolated up to 24 d post-infection. On the whole, this resembles the pattern of procyclin proteins present in these stages, with the exception that the EP2 isoform has never been detected in the fly. The stock AnTat 1.1 used in this study contains two hybrid genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>]. Besides one normal copy each of EP1 and EP2, there are two genes in which the EP3 coding region is fused to the 3′ UTR of EP1 or EP2, respectively. The coding regions of EP1 and EP3 could not be distinguished by hybridisation because their open reading frames (ORFs) differ by only three nucleotides outside the repetitive region. In contrast, the coding regions of the clones that were positive for the EP2 3′ UTR could be assigned using specific oligonucleotides. We found that the EP2 and EP3 coding regions were equally represented (unpublished data) and that mRNAs encoding EP2 therefore constitute only ~15–20% of the total procyclin transcripts in midgut trypanosomes.</p><p>When salivary gland RNA was analysed, procyclin cDNAs could be amplified on day 3, but not on day 7. The PCR products obtained on day 3 were probably due to trypanosomes that entered the mouthparts during the initial infective blood meal and persisted there until the first meal of uninfected blood. Procyclin mRNAs were detected consistently in the salivary glands from day 11 onwards. This correlates with the first appearance of trypanosomes in this compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b04">4</xref>]. Surprisingly, the relative amounts of the various PCR products changed during the course of infection. While the distribution on day 11 resembled that of established midgut forms, with 12% with an EP1 3′ UTR and only a single GPEET clone, over the following 2 wk there was an increase in both these forms, with the EP1 3′ UTR cDNAs finally accounting for 40% and GPEET for 16%. The differences in expression between midgut and salivary gland trypanosomes were reproducible in <italic>G. morsitans morsitans</italic> and were also apparent in another species of tsetse fly, <italic>G. pallidipes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010022-g001">Figure 1</xref>, right panels).</p><p>We next performed double immunofluoresence on trypanosomes from the salivary glands with antibodies directed against EP and GPEET. Midgut trypanosomes and cultured procyclic forms were used as controls. The majority of trypanosomes in the salivary glands did not react with either antibody, but we occasionally detected cells that were positive for EP and/or GPEET. EP-positive trypanosomes were detected slightly more frequently, but the fluorescence intensity was much weaker than that of midgut trypanosomes (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Levels of Procyclin Transcripts in the Midgut and Salivary Glands</title><p>The RT-PCR experiments described above gave information on the distribution of the different procyclin transcripts in salivary gland trypanosomes, but not on their absolute amounts, and it could not be excluded that these were extremely low. We therefore used real time quantitative PCR to monitor the level of procyclin mRNAs in infected flies. Since variable amounts of tsetse RNA were present in the samples, procyclin transcripts were normalised against trypanosome β-tubulin. Values are expressed relative to a reference cDNA from cultured procyclic forms that was run in parallel with each set of samples, in which the procyclin/tubulin ratio was set at 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010022-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Throughout the course of infection, the cDNAs obtained from the midgut gave slightly higher levels of procyclin than the reference culture (1.6- to 3.9-fold). In agreement with previous estimates of procyclin transcripts in long slender bloodstream forms, we found that the level of procyclin mRNA was 22 times lower than in the reference culture and, on average, 53 times lower than in midgut forms. However, trypanosomes from the salivary glands contained substantially more procyclin mRNA than bloodstream forms. The samples taken from the salivary glands at days 11 and 14 contained slightly more procyclin mRNA than the reference culture (1.2–fold) and approximately half as much as midgut forms; as the infection progressed this declined to three times less than the reference culture and eight times less than midgut forms. This decrease may reflect the higher proportion of metacyclic forms, with correspondingly less procyclin mRNA, in mature infections.</p><fig id="ppat-0010022-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010022.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Relative Amount of Procyclin mRNA in Different Life Cycle Stages</title><p>RTQ-PCR was performed on RNA samples from bloodstream forms and midgut and salivary gland trypanosomes at various days post infection. β-tubulin was used as an internal control.

It has been shown that a major surface glycoprotein of <italic>T. congolense</italic>, glutamic acid/alanine-rich protein (GARP), which is expressed by epimastigote forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b17">17</xref>] is decorated by oligosaccharides attached to threonine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b18">18</xref>]. Should GPEET be similarly modified, it might not bind antibodies that are directed against a synthetic peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b19">19</xref>] or phosphorylated GPEET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b14">14</xref>]. To circumvent this problem we replaced one copy of GPEET with GPEEA, a mutant in which the threonine residues in the repeat have been substituted by alanines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b20">20</xref>]. This mutation does not alter midgut infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b20">20</xref>]. Although procyclic cells expressed this mutant form of procyclin, we did not find more GPEEA-positive cells than GPEET-positive cells in the salivary glands (unpublished data).</p><p>An alternative explanation for the presence of transcripts, but lack of proteins, is that translation is regulated by the 3′ UTRs. To test this hypothesis we generated four mutants in which the GARP coding region replaced that of an endogenous procyclin. In this context, the mRNA is transcribed as part of a procyclin expression site and has the same UTRs as the corresponding procyclin. Flies were infected with individual mutants and GARP expression was monitored by immunofluorescence as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b15">15</xref>]. The majority of cells expressing the hybrid GARP/EP1 transcript, including post-mesocyclic and salivary gland forms, were positive by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010022-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Apart from the earliest time point, cells expressing GARP/EP3 were positive throughout the midgut, as were 21% of salivary gland forms. In contrast, the midgut forms of GARP/EP2 mutant were negative for the first 7 d, and positive trypanosomes in the anterior midgut and salivary glands were detected in only two out of three flies. Trypanosomes expressing GARP/GPEET were positive early in infection and negative from day 7 onwards. However, 48% of the salivary gland trypanosomes were positive at day 28. Taken together, these results indicate that each 3′ UTR confers a unique expression profile. In all cases however, GARP can be translated in the salivary glands, indicating that the lack of the procyclin protein is not due to inhibitory sequences in the 3′ UTRs.</p><fig id="ppat-0010022-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010022.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effect of Procyclin 3′ UTRs on Expression of a Reporter Gene during Fly Transmission</title><p>The coding region of GARP was fused to individual procyclin 3′ UTRs and stably integrated in place of the corresponding procyclin coding region.

In late procyclic forms isolated from <italic>G. morsitans</italic>, approximately 85% of the mRNAs encode the glycosylated forms EP1 and EP3, and 15% encode EP2. When the distribution of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>] and mRNAs from midgut trypanosomes are compared, the one disparity is that there is no EP2 protein, despite the relatively high level of its mRNA. Two lines of evidence indicate that the EP2 3′ UTR is responsible for inefficient translation in procyclic forms. When procyclic culture forms were transiently transfected with reporter constructs containing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) coding region, eight times less CAT activity was obtained when the construct contained the EP2 3′ UTR rather than the EP1 3′ UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, a stable transformant containing a GARP/EP2 hybrid gene showed no expression in the posterior midgut, although positive trypanosomes were detected in the anterior midgut and salivary glands.</p><p>As mentioned above, no procyclins could be identified in the salivary glands by MALDI-TOF MS. Nevertheless, procyclin transcripts were present at levels comparable to those in procyclic culture forms and cDNAs were readily amplified from the salivary glands. Apart from the samples taken at day 11, the time at which trypanosomes start to colonise the salivary glands, the distribution of procyclin mRNAs differed from that in the midgut, with increasing amounts of EP1 and GPEET mRNAs and decreasing amounts of EP2 and EP3 mRNAs as the infection aged. Since GPEET and EP1 are the first genes in the procyclin expression sites on chromosome VI and X, respectively, these differences may reflect an attenuation of transcription from the procyclin promoters in epimastigote or metacyclic forms, as is the case in bloodstream forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b21">21</xref>]. Alternatively, they may be due to changes in mRNA stability between midgut and salivary gland forms. The 3′ UTRs are known to have a major influence on the stability of procyclin transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b24">24</xref>] and it is worth noting that the 3′ UTRs of EP1 and GPEET are 86% identical.</p><p>Extremely few trypanosomes from the salivary glands or saliva reacted with antibodies against any form of procyclin. The most plausible explanations for these findings are that the mRNAs are not translated or that the proteins are rapidly degraded. Fixation with acetone exposes internal epitopes, so the failure to detect procyclins was not due to alterations in protein trafficking. It is also unlikely that the proteins were destroyed by proteases since the EP and GPEET repeats are extremely robust and resist digestion by tsetse midgut proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b25">25</xref>] and the trypanosome's own surface protease(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b26">26</xref>]. We could also exclude post-translational modifications such as O-linked carbohydrates for the lack of reactivity with anti-GPEET antibodies. While we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the procyclin repeats are otherwise masked or modified by tsetse factors, shielding them from antibodies, it should not be forgotten that the tsetse also expresses a protein, tsetseEP, that contains an extended glutamic acid-proline repeat and that this protein can be detected in salivary gland lysates by the same monoclonal antibody that recognises EP repeats in procyclins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b27">27</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to EP and GPEET proteins, GARP could be detected readily in salivary gland forms of transgenic trypanosomes, although the mRNA was transcribed from a procyclin promoter and the ORF was flanked by procyclin 5′ and 3′ UTRs. This clearly suggests that at this stage of trypanosome development in the tsetse fly, the procyclin coding regions are involved in regulating protein expression. We have previously encountered a similar phenomenon in bloodstream form trypanosomes that expressed high levels of EP1 mRNA (once negative elements were removed from the 3′ UTR) but no detectable protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b24">24</xref>] as long as they were maintained at 37 °C. It is worth noting, however, that this translational regulation appears to be lost in cold-shocked bloodstream forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b28">28</xref>].</p><p>In the light of these results, it will be necessary to revise the concept that all life cycle stages of <italic>T. brucei</italic> are covered either by VSG or procyclins as has long been supposed. The identification of alternative coats may prove challenging, however, as long as the only specific marker for the epimastigote form is the anteronuclear position of the kinetoplast and this form of the parasite can be obtained only from infected flies.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Trypanosome stocks.</title><p>The pleomorphic stock <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> AnTat1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010022-b30">30</xref>] and mutants that derived from this strain were used in this study.
