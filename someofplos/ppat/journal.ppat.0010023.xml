Inhalation infection with <italic>B. anthracis,</italic> the etiological agent of anthrax, is almost always lethal, yet cutaneous infections usually remain localized and resolve spontaneously. Neutrophils are typically recruited to cutaneous but seldom to other forms of anthrax infections, raising the possibility that neutrophils kill <italic>B. anthracis.</italic> In this study we infected human neutrophils with either spores or vegetative bacteria of a wild-type strain, or strains, expressing only one of the two major virulence factors. The human neutrophils engulfed <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores, which germinated intracellularly and were then efficiently killed. Interestingly, neutrophil killing was independent of reactive oxygen species production. We fractionated a human neutrophil granule extract by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified α-defensins as the component responsible for <italic>B. anthracis</italic> killing. These data suggest that the timely recruitment of neutrophils can control cutaneous infections and possibly other forms of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infections, and that α-defensins play an important role in the potent anti-<italic>B. anthracis</italic> activity of neutrophils.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p><italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> is the bacterium that causes anthrax, a disease that can occur through natural infections and also through intentional release. <italic>B. anthracis</italic> makes spores, which are in a dormant state, similar to seeds of a plant, and are extremely resistant to the environment. <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores can infect through the skin or the lung. Lung infections disseminate through the body and are lethal. In contrast, skin infections often remain localized, and patients survive even without treatment.

Neutrophils are the first white blood cells recruited to a site of infection and are specialized in killing microbes. Previous studies show that neutrophils are abundant in the skin form, but not in the lung form of anthrax. The researchers report that human neutrophils can take up <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores. Once inside, the spores germinate to form vegetative bacteria. The vegetative bacteria are extremely susceptible to neutrophil-killing mechanisms. The <italic>B. anthracis</italic> virulence factors (molecules that make bacteria cause diseases) manipulate other human cells but do not deter neutrophils. <italic>B. anthracis</italic> is indeed exquisitely sensitive to the neutrophil protein α-defensin.

Spores are dormant forms of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and are extremely resistant to environmental stress. In the current model of respiratory infections, the spores are first taken up by macrophages where they germinate and become vegetative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b001">1</xref>]. Macrophages then transport the bacteria to the regional lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b002">2</xref>]. In these organs, the bacteria escape from the macrophage and spread through the lymphatics and blood stream causing massive septicemia. Vegetative <italic>B. anthracis</italic> express two essential virulence factors: the tripartite anthrax toxin and the poly-γ-D glutamic acid capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b003">3</xref>]. The toxin-protective antigen binds to its specific receptor and translocates the edema and lethal factors into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b004">4</xref>]. Edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that causes tissue edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b005">5</xref>], whereas lethal factor is a metalloprotease that inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase and provokes cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>Neutrophils are a vital component of the acute inflammatory response and play a key role in the resolution of microbial infections. They are terminally differentiated cells, incapable of cell division, and synthesize very low levels of RNA and protein. Neutrophils engulf microbes into a phagosome that fuses with intracellular granules to form a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome the bacteria are killed through the interaction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b007">7</xref>] and oxygen-independent mediators such as enzymes and antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b008">8</xref>]. Antimicrobial peptides are predominantly cationic and are thought to permeabilize the bacterial membrane and lyse microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b009">9</xref>].</p><p>Inhalation <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infections result in sepsis and death, while cutaneous anthrax almost always remains localized. Interestingly, in untreated cutaneous cases, neutrophils surround the necrotic, bacteria-containing tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b010">10</xref>], whereas neutrophil infiltration is rarely seen in the lung during inhalation anthrax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b011">11</xref>]. Although there are reports of pulmonary infiltration in <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b012">12</xref>], they were thought to be due to preexisting lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b014">14</xref>]. Pigs and dogs also develop a cutaneous form when infected subcutaneously. This form is reminiscent of human cutaneous anthrax and is accompanied by massive neutrophil infiltrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b013">13</xref>]. Also, neutrophil recruitment is found in the lungs of pulmonary infected dogs and pigs that survive high infection doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010023-b014">14</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that neutrophils can kill <italic>B. anthracis.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human Neutrophils Kill <italic>B.anthracis</italic> Spores Independent of Reactive Oxygen Species</title><p>We tested wild-type <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and strains expressing only the toxin or the capsule.
