Erythrocyte invasion by merozoites of the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> requires the shedding of ectodomain components of two essential surface proteins, called MSP1 and AMA1. Both are released by the same merozoite surface “sheddase,” but the molecular identity and mode of action of this protease is unknown. Here we identify it as PfSUB2, an integral membrane subtilisin-like protease (subtilase). We show that PfSUB2 is stored in apical secretory organelles called micronemes. Upon merozoite release it is secreted onto the parasite surface and translocates to its posterior pole in an actin-dependent manner, a trafficking pattern predicted of the sheddase. Subtilase propeptides are usually selective inhibitors of their cognate protease, and the PfSUB2 propeptide is no exception; we show that recombinant PfSUB2 propeptide binds specifically to mature parasite-derived PfSUB2 and is a potent, selective inhibitor of MSP1 and AMA1 shedding, directly establishing PfSUB2 as the sheddase. PfSUB2 is a new potential target for drugs designed to prevent erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Malaria causes immense suffering and loss of life across the globe. In the face of growing resistance to available drugs and no licensed vaccine, new approaches are urgently required to tackle its control. Fundamental to these is an improved understanding of the basic biology of the malaria parasite. The parasite invades and replicates within red blood cells. During invasion a number of important proteins need to be shed from the parasite surface, probably in order to disengage the adhesive interactions that enable initial binding. Shedding of these surface proteins is achieved by a parasite enzyme called a protease, and compounds or antibodies that block the action of this protease prevent invasion, killing the parasite. Here the authors identify this protease as PfSUB2, a large, membrane-bound member of the subtilisin-like protease superfamily. They find that PfSUB2 is secreted from apical organelles called micronemes at the point of invasion to migrate rearwards over the surface of the parasite, and that a protein designed to be a specific inhibitor of PfSUB2 potently prevents shedding of parasite surface proteins. This work sets the scene for the development of inhibitors of PfSUB2 as a new generation of antimalarial drugs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Harris PK, Yeoh S, Dluzewski AR, O'Donnell RA, Withers-Martinez C, et al.

The disease results from cyclical replication within erythrocytes of protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The parasite divides asexually within its host cell to produce a number of progeny merozoites. Upon eventual rupture of the schizont, these are released to rapidly invade fresh red cells and perpetuate the cycle. Like all apicomplexan parasites, the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> merozoite enters its host cell by an active invasion process that is mediated by adhesive receptor–ligand interactions and driven by an actinomyosin motor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b002">2</xref>]. Light and electron microscopic studies have shown that initial attachment to the host erythrocyte is followed by reorientation of the merozoite such that its apical end contacts the cell surface. This results in the formation of an irreversible zone of contact, or tight junction, between the apical prominence and the host cell surface. The host cell membrane then invaginates, forming a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) into which the parasite is propelled; in the process, the junction sweeps around the periphery of the parasite with concomitant “shaving” of bristle-like structures from the parasite surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b004">4</xref>], eventually sealing behind the intracellular parasite. The initial low-affinity binding appears to be mediated by a large, glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored protein complex which is uniformly distributed around the parasite surface and is composed of fragments of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) plus associated partner proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b007">7</xref>]. Many subsequent interactions in the invasion pathway are mediated by proteins released from micronemes, secretory vesicles at the apical end of the merozoite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b008">8</xref>]. One of these proteins, apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1), is a type I integral membrane protein that is secreted onto the merozoite surface just prior to interaction with the host cell and may play a role in reorientation, junction formation, or government of the release of a second set of apical organelles called rhoptries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b011">11</xref>]. Both MSP1 and AMA1 play essential roles in the blood-stage cycle of the malaria parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>During invasion both AMA1 and the MSP1 complex are quantitatively shed from the parasite surface, in each case as a result of a single proteolytic cleavage at a juxtamembrane site. Shedding of MSP1 results from cleavage just distal to a tandem EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domain called MSP1<sub>19</sub> at its C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b014">14</xref>]. MSP1<sub>19</sub> remains bound to the parasite surface via its GPI anchor and is the only part of the MSP1 complex to be carried into the host cell. AMA1 is cleaved precisely 29 residues away from the transmembrane domain (TMD), releasing the bulk of the ectodomain and resulting in just the juxtamembrane “stub” being carried into the host cell with its cognate TMD and cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b017">17</xref>]. Shedding of these proteins is required for productive invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b019">19</xref>], and may be important to release adhesive interactions between the parasite and host cell surface in order to allow unimpeded passage into the nascent PV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b020">20</xref>]. The MSP1 complex is an abundant merozoite component, and together with AMA1 likely corresponds to the surface structures shed adjacent to the moving junction. Importantly, shedding of both AMA1 and the MSP1 complex can occur even in the absence of invasion, and a simple assay based on the use of isolated merozoites has shown that both proteins are shed by the same parasite-derived, membrane-bound, calcium-dependent serine protease, called <underline>me</underline>rozoite surface <underline>sh</underline>eddase, or MESH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b020">20</xref>]. MESH is active against its physiological substrates only when in the same membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b021">21</xref>]. Its molecular identification has proved elusive, but the accumulated microscopic and biochemical evidence suggests that at invasion it must distribute across the surface of the parasite, probably localising at the moving junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b020">20</xref>]. We and others have previously identified a large, membrane-bound subtilisin-like serine protease called SUB2 that is expressed in the late stages of intraerythrocytic development and accumulates within the apical domain of the merozoite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b023">23</xref>]. The enzyme has not been expressed in a recombinant, enzymatically active form, but SUB2 is conserved throughout <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> and attempts to disrupt both the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> gene <italic>(pfsub2)</italic> and that of the rodent malaria <italic>P. berghei</italic> have been unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b025">25</xref>], indicating an essential function within the blood-stage cycle. Here we present the first experimental evidence that PfSUB2 is MESH, and show that it has the remarkable capacity to translocate across the merozoite surface exactly as predicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Epitope Tagging of PfSUB2 by Targeted Homologous Recombination</title><p>PfSUB2 is a poorly abundant parasite protein, hindering our earlier attempts at precise sub-cellular localization of the mature protein. To overcome this obstacle, we set out to modify the endogenous <italic>pfsub2</italic> gene by fusing it to a sequence encoding three consecutive haemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags using targeted homologous recombination. Parasites transfected with construct pHH1-T996HA3 and the control plasmid pHH1-T996w (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) were cultured in the presence of the antifolate WR99210 followed by rounds of drug cycling to remove parasites harbouring free episomes (which are rapidly lost in the absence of drug pressure). The resulting parasite lines, called PfSUB2HA and PfSUB2w, were cloned by limiting dilution and maintained in the presence of WR99210. Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) showed that all transgenic clones contained more than one copy of the targeting plasmid integrated into the <italic>pfsub2</italic> locus, as is common in single-crossover homologous recombination in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as a result of the plasmids being maintained as concatamers (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b013">13</xref>]). Note that despite this, only one copy of the modified gene is expected to be functional, because all downstream copies contain either the targeting fragment only or a promoterless, truncated remnant of the endogenous locus lacking the epitope tag. In over 6 mo of continuous culture, none of the clones exhibited any growth defect compared to the parental D10 clone (not shown), indicating that neither the addition of the HA tags to the C-terminus of PfSUB2 nor replacement of the <italic>pfsub2</italic> 3′ UTR with the heterologous <italic>P. berghei</italic> sequence was detrimental to parasite replication.</p><fig id="ppat-0010029-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0010029.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Epitope Tagging of PfSUB2</title><p>(A) Schematic depiction of integration plasmids pHH1-T996HA3 and pHH1-T996w, and single-crossover homologous recombination events (for clarity shown only for pHH1-T996HA3).

Pulse-chase studies have shown that PfSUB2 maturation involves two post-translational processing steps in which the approximately 150-kDa primary translation product (called PfSUB2<sub>P</sub>) is converted first to a 75-kDa intermediate form (PfSUB2<sub>I</sub>) and finally to a 72-kDa terminal intracellular form (PfSUB2<sub>T</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b025">25</xref>].

An additional anti-HA reactive species of 55 kDa, also often evident on Western blots, has previously been observed as a minor component in pulse-chase experiments, and is likely a non-specific degradation product of PfSUB2.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PfSUB2 Is a Microneme Protein</title><p>To establish the sub-cellular location of PfSUB2, parasites were then analysed by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) using both of the anti-HA mAbs.

In contrast, both mAbs produced a strong punctate pattern in mature schizonts of both the uncloned PfSUB2HA line (not shown) and its clones. To examine this localisation in detail, dual labelling was performed using mAbs specific for a plasma membrane marker (MSP1), two different rhoptry markers (RhopH2 and RAP2; data not shown for RAP2), and a microneme protein (AMA1).

As with intracellular parasites in mature schizonts, all merozoites exhibited an intense, punctate anti-HA signal. Unexpectedly, however, in the great majority of cases (≥70% of free merozoites), it comprised a single tight focus of fluorescence that clearly localised to the opposite pole of the merozoite to that recognised by the anti-rhoptry mAbs. This posterior localisation was also found in the free merozoite by IEM, labelling being present just interior to the cell surface, consistent with antibodies binding to the epitope tag at the extreme C-terminus of the PfSUB2 cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g002">2</xref>E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, top row). There are no known organelles situated at the posterior of the merozoite, so this suggested that, just after schizont rupture, PfSUB2 is secreted from the micronemes onto the merozoite surface and redistributed rearwards to accumulate at its posterior end. In a portion of cases (~10%), the anti-HA IFA signal presented as two separate foci that lay lateral to the anterior–posterior axis of the merozoite, suggesting the presence of a mid-bodied ring of fluorescence encircling the parasite at right angles to this axis and perhaps representing PfSUB2 en route to the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, middle row). Only in less than 20% of cases did the anti-HA IFA signal remain adjacent to the rhoptries as reproducibly observed in intact schizonts. In contrast, the anti-AMA1 IFA signal in free merozoites took the form of a uniform circumferential pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, bottom row) as observed previously (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b016">16</xref>]). In no case did the anti-AMA1 IFA signal concentrate at the posterior pole of the parasite as seen for the anti-HA signal. Several apicomplexan microneme proteins translocate onto the parasite surface upon release from the host cell. The best-studied example, the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> adhesin TgMIC2/M2AP, is secreted spontaneously at low basal levels and capped to the posterior pole of the free tachyzoite. As the parasite invades a host cell, secretion is markedly up-regulated and driven rapidly to completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b026">26</xref>].

These findings document the first demonstration of capping of a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> merozoite surface protein.

Shedding of MSP1 by cleavage just upstream of its C-terminal EGF-like region occurs in all species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> examined, and new interest in the protease responsible was sparked by the revelation that the same protease also mediates release of another essential surface protein, AMA1. Here we have identified this protease as PfSUB2, an integral membrane merozoite subtilase.</p><p>PfSUB2 is a very minor parasite component, and in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b023">23</xref>], we were insufficiently confident in our antibody localisation data to assign it to a specific sub-cellular location. By epitope tagging the endogenous <italic>pfsub2</italic> gene and using a range of mAbs to study its expression profile compared to other well-defined markers, we have now definitively localised PfSUB2 to micronemes. This differs from the conclusions of Barale et al. (1999) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b022">22</xref>] who used polyclonal antibodies to obtain evidence suggesting that PfSUB2 localizes to a different set of organelles called dense granules. However, cross-reactivity of polyclonal antibodies combined with the small dimensions of the malaria merozoite can render localization of sub-cellular components particularly challenging, and merozoite proteins have been previously mis-localised (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b040">40</xref>]). A possible alternative explanation for the discrepancy between these results is that epitope tagging of PfSUB2 resulted in its mistargeting. This phenomenon has previously been observed in Apicomplexa, but seems most unlikely in this case; given the evidence that PfSUB2 is an essential gene product, a defect in sorting would likely have phenotypic consequences. Our transgenic lines and clones displayed normal growth and morphology. Importantly, moreover, our conclusions are lent credence by the finding that PfSUB2 is secreted onto the parasite surface prior to or at invasion, an activity typical of microneme proteins. Dense granule proteins, in contrast, are discharged predominantly following invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b041">41</xref>].</p><p>Collectively, our findings support the following model. PfSUB2 undergoes maturation by post-translational proteolytic processing that is initiated by propeptide cleavage and results in the formation of a membrane-bound protease. By analogy with PfSUB1 maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b025">25</xref>], both PfSUB2<sub>I</sub> and PfSUB2<sub>T</sub> are likely to be enzymatically active, but it is probably the PfSUB2<sub>T</sub> form that accumulates in micronemes where it is stored until schizont rupture. At merozoite release PfSUB2 is secreted onto the parasite surface where it engages with an actin-based motor. This could occur through its cytoplasmic domain or through ectoplasmic interactions with other micronemal proteins that are themselves connected to the motor. PfSUB2 is then shuttled towards the posterior pole of the merozoite, in the process encountering and cleaving the MSP1 complex and AMA1 from the surface of the parasite. Our present results show that this capping process can occur efficiently in the absence of invasion, satisfactorily explaining the limited shedding of MSP1 and AMA1 seen in preparations of free merozoites. However, our observations may not accurately reflect the dynamics of PfSUB2 translocation at invasion. The invasive half-life of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites is extremely short, and shedding of MSP1 is known to go to completion during the brief (~30 s) time course of erythrocyte invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b007">7</xref>]. We therefore propose that—similar to TgMIC2/M2AP—capping of PfSUB2 on the <italic>invading</italic> merozoite likely occurs predominantly concomitant with invasion, the protease perhaps concentrating at the moving junction. IEM studies of merozoites “captured” in the process of invasion will be required to test this postulate. Unfortunately this is a highly ambitious goal in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in which, as a result of the short invasive half-life of merozoites, no surface protein has ever been localised by this technique on the invading parasite. The issue would be best addressed in the simian malaria model <italic>P. knowlesi,</italic> free merozoites of which are relatively long lived. This will be a major focus of future work.</p><p>An additional prediction of our model is that PfSUB2 may not be substantially exposed at the surface of the invasive merozoite prior to the point of junction formation. In support of this, we have found that addition of purified PfSUB2PD to parasite cultures has no effect on invasion (P. Harris, unpublished data). In an analogous example, antibodies against sporozoite TRAP or TgMIC2 have no effect on invasion, because these adhesins are not displayed at high levels on the parasite surface until the point of invasion, and only those molecules inhabiting the moving junction are functional during invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b042">42</xref>] (V. Carruthers, personal communication). Nonetheless, we expect that it should be possible to target PfSUB2 with appropriately selective low-molecular weight, membrane-permeable compounds.</p><p>Capping of PfSUB2 to the merozoite posterior could be prevented by latrunculin A but not by cytochalasin D, a puzzling finding in view of the latter's known potent effects on invasion by the malaria merozoite and the fact that both compounds prevent invasion at the concentrations used here. Both drugs induce rapid disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells, but through distinct mechanisms; whereas cytochalasin D binds to filamentous actin, inhibiting polymerization at both barbed and pointed ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b043">43</xref>], latrunculin binds to and sequesters actin monomers, preventing their de novo polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b045">45</xref>]. One consequence of this is that cytochalasin D does not induce net depolymerization of actin, whereas latrunculin does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b047">47</xref>], and there are now numerous examples of cellular actin-based processes that exhibit differential sensitivity to these drugs (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b048">48</xref>]). Only a single actin gene is expressed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites, and a recent study has shown that filaments formed by this actin are unusually short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b049">49</xref>]. One explanation for the discrepancy between the effects observed with the two actin antagonists used in our experiments is that the degree of actin polymerisation required to provide the traction for invasion may be much greater that than required to translocate the bulk of secreted PfSUB2 the short distance (~1.2 μm) from the apical region of the merozoite to its posterior. This could explain why invasion is more sensitive than capping of PfSUB2 to perturbation by cytochalasin D.</p><p>The motility of apicomplexan zoites is stringently regulated, primarily by control of actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b050">50</xref>], and in highly motile apicomplexan zoites such as the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoite, motility ceases abruptly after invasion, implying rapid disassembly of the actinomyosin motor. The malaria merozoite is one of the smallest known eukaryotic cells, and so removal of the forces powering and maintaining retrograde flow of PfSUB2 after invasion would allow subsequent redistribution of the protease by simple diffusion in the parasite membrane. Our observation that PfSUB2 uniformly decorates the plasma membrane of the intracellular ring is consistent with this.</p><p>The estimated IC50 of approximately 300 nM for inhibition of MESH by PfSUB2PD is somewhat higher than K<sub>i</sub> values measured for other subtilase propeptides against their cognate enzymes, which range from around 1–6 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b033">33</xref>] to around 200 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b051">51</xref>]. However, the combination of a relatively large molecular mass and the fact that it has to interact with membrane-bound protease may preclude ready access of PfSUB2PD to merozoite surface PfSUB2 in our assay. Moreover, PfSUB2PD may not represent the optimal propeptide construct; the exact internal sites at which processing takes place during PfSUB2 maturation are unknown, and it is well documented that even small truncations of propeptide constructs can compromise their inhibitory capacity (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b033">33</xref>]). Despite this, PfSUB2PD exhibited clear selectivity, showing no effect on a number of serine proteases and only weak inhibition of a phylogenetically related bacterial subtilisin. A total of only three subtilases are encoded in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b025">25</xref>]. Previously, we have conclusively excluded a role for PfSUB1 in MESH activity, but one criticism of our present conclusions is that the inhibition of MESH mediated by PfSUB2PD could be the result of interactions with PfSUB3, a subtilase that is poorly characterised but known to be transcribed in parasite blood-stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b025">25</xref>]. However, we have recently successfully disrupted the <italic>pfsub3</italic> gene in blood-stages of <italic>P. falciparum;</italic> the resulting parasites are viable, and processing of both MSP1 and AMA1 occurs normally (R. O'Donnell and M. Blackman, unpublished data), demonstrating that PfSUB3 is not essential for MESH activity.</p><p>In <italic>Toxoplasma gondii,</italic> several integral membrane microneme adhesins that cap to the parasite posterior through interactions with the actinomyosin motor are shed in the final seconds of invasion via cleavage within their TMD by a class of intramembrane proteases called rhomboids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b053">53</xref>]. A malaria merozoite rhomboid-like activity has also recently been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b017">17</xref>], the role of which may be to shed merozoite adhesins that are functional homologues of these transmembrane adhesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b020">20</xref>]. The merozoite rhomboid(s) cannot be involved in juxtamembrane shedding or shedding of GPI-anchored proteins such as MSP1, because rhomboids can only cleave within a TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b054">54</xref>]. A <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> rhomboid, TgROM5, was recently localised to the posterior surface of the tachyzoite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b055">55</xref>], suggesting that temporal and spatial regulation of release of capped microneme proteins is achieved through the simple expedient of maintaining the protease at the rear of the parasite; substrates are effectively recruited to the protease by the capping process. Our present findings show that PfSUB2 has evolved to function in a converse fashion; because its substrates (MSP1 and AMA1) are uniformly distributed about the parasite circumference, the sheddase must be tracked across the parasite surface in order to efficiently engage with them. PfSUB2 probably acts in concert with the merozoite rhomboid(s) during invasion.</p><p>Do functional homologues of PfSUB2 exist in other Apicomplexa? Aside from the rhomboid studies alluded to above, little is known of the molecular details of shedding of surface and microneme proteins in other apicomplexan genera. Two subtilisin-like serine proteases, TgSUB1 and TgSUB2, have been identified in <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, but neither of these likely performs a role analogous to that of PfSUB2; TgSUB1 is a nonessential GPI-anchored microneme protease, whereas TgSUB2 is located in rhoptries in which it appears to be involved in maturation of other rhoptry proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b056">56</xref>]. It remains to be seen whether Apicomplexa other than <italic>Plasmodium</italic> use a subtilisin-like sheddase at invasion.</p><p>Erythrocyte invasion is an obvious but thus far underexploited target for drugs designed to block the malarial lifecycle. PfSUB2 may represent an excellent target for new protease inhibitor-based drugs, and to this end, recombinant expression of the protease in an enzymatically active form is now a priority.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Parasite culture and transfection.</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> clones D10, 3D7, and T9/96 were maintained and free merozoites produced as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010029-b057">57</xref>]. For some experiments, medium was supplemented with cytochalasin D or latrunculin A (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, United Kingdom) added from stock solutions in DMSO.
