We investigated the murine inflammatory response to conidia of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus,</italic> the most common invasive mold in immunocompromised hosts. In contrast to dormant spores, germinating conidia induce neutrophil recruitment to the airways and TNF-α/MIP-2 secretion by alveolar macrophages. Fungal β-glucans act as a trigger for the induction of these inflammatory responses through their time-dependent exposure on the surface of germinating conidia. Dectin-1, an innate immune receptor that recognizes fungal β-glucans, is recruited in vivo to alveolar macrophage phagosomes that have internalized conidia with exposed β-glucans. Antibody-mediated blockade of Dectin-1 partially inhibits TNF-α/MIP-2 induction by metabolically active conidia. TLR-2- and MyD88-mediated signals provide an additive contribution to macrophage activation by germinating conidia. Selective responsiveness to germinating conidia provides the innate immune system with a mechanism to restrict inflammatory responses to metabolically active, potentially invasive fungal spores.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> is a mold that forms spores that are often inhaled by mammals. Humans with normal immune systems inhale several hundred <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> spores per day without developing detectable disease. Immunocompromised hosts, on the other hand, can develop invasive <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infections. In these cases, inhaled spores germinate and form tissue-invasive hyphae that invade blood vessels and disseminate to remote tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the normal inflammatory response to inhaled spores in mouse lungs. The researchers found that the earliest stage of spore germination, referred to as “swelling,” triggered the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung airways. Consistent with this finding, lung-derived cells stimulated with swollen spores secreted copious amounts of proteins that attract inflammatory cells. Analysis of spores revealed that swelling is accompanied by surface expression of β-glucan polymers. These carbohydrates, which are not present on the surface of mammalian cells, induce signaling by the mammalian Dectin-1 receptor and activate the expression of genes that promote the inflammatory response. The results suggest that mammalian lungs have evolved a mechanism to distinguish swollen and potentially threatening spores from innocuous, dormant spores.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Hohl TM, Van Epps HL, Rivera A, Morgan LA, Chen PL, et al.

Overly robust inflammatory responses can compromise host tissues and organ function, which, in the case of the lungs, can be severely debilitating or even lethal. In contrast, inadequate immune responses to pathogens can promote tissue invasion and systemic dissemination with equally dire consequences. Lung airways are perpetually exposed to inhaled particulate materials that include pollens, viruses, and bacterial and fungal spores. While many of these particles are innocuous, some spores have the potential to germinate and cause invasive diseases. Distinguishing these rare pathogenic microbes from the innocuous majority and calibrating inflammatory responses to the invasive potential of the microbe are fundamental challenges faced by the pulmonary innate immune system.</p><p><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> is a mold that forms conidia with a diameter of 2–3 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b004">4</xref>]. Owing to their small size, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia can bypass mucociliary clearance mechanisms and are inhaled into terminal airways and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (AMØs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b006">6</xref>]. Conidia are killed in a phagocyte oxidase-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b007">7</xref>]. Neutrophils recruited to the site of infection form a second line of defense against germinating conidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b005">5</xref>].</p><p>Conidial germination begins with swelling and progresses to germ tube formation and hyphal extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b008">8</xref>]. Genetic, acquired, or pharmacologically induced states that impair macrophage and neutrophil function enable in vivo conidial germination and the formation of fungal hyphae that can invade pulmonary tissues, enter the bloodstream, and disseminate to remote tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b009">9</xref>].</p><p>Hyphae contain four major carbohydrate polymers: chitin, galactomannan, branched β–1,3/β–1,6 glucans, and linear β–1,3/β–1,4 glucans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b010">10</xref>]. In contrast to hyphae, conidia have morphologically distinct features—an outermost proteinaceous rodlet layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b011">11</xref>] and an inner cell wall layer that is exposed during swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b012">12</xref>], a process that can occur within macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b007">7</xref>]. The complex composition of the conidial cell wall is incompletely defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b013">13</xref>], and the identity of conidial surface molecules that induce proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses through cognate host cell receptors has not been determined.</p><p>Germline encoded pattern recognition receptors constitute a major surveillance and defense mechanism against microbial invaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b014">14</xref>]. The 11 mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) differ in their subcellular localization, tissue distribution, and ligand specificity, yet signal through a limited set of adaptor proteins that includes myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). TLR-mediated signals induce proinflammatory responses, activate antimicrobial effector functions, and stimulate adaptive immune responses. In the case of <italic>A. fumigatus,</italic> TLR-2, TLR-4, and MyD88 have been implicated in the recognition of conidia and hyphae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b020">20</xref>]. TLR-2-, TLR-4-, and MyD88-deficient animals survive pulmonary <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b021">21</xref>]; this finding implies the existence of MyD88-independent pathways in host defense against inhaled conidia.</p><p>Dectin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b023">23</xref>], a type II transmembrane protein that belongs to the NK-like C-type lectin-like receptor family, is a pattern recognition receptor for β–1,3/β–1,6-linked glucans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b024">24</xref>].

The contribution of Dectin-1-mediated signals to innate immune defense against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection remains undefined.</p><p>To characterize the innate inflammatory response following spore inhalation, we investigated cell recruitment into the airways of immune competent mice exposed to live and killed <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia. The early pulmonary innate immune response to these two challenges is distinct; live conidia induce rapid neutrophil recruitment, while killed conidia are far less stimulatory. Live conidia display β-glucans on their cell surface during swelling and hyphal formation; this process triggers Dectin-1 recruitment to phagosomal membranes of AMØs in vivo. Exposure of macrophages to germinating conidia reveals a direct correlation between surface β-glucan display and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine induction<italic>.</italic> This induction is partially inhibited by antibody-mediated blockade of Dectin-1 signaling. The innate immune system, therefore, restricts responsiveness to conidia that are germinating and ignores the less threatening dormant conidia. This mechanism may limit pulmonary damage following microbial spore inhalation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bronchoalveolar Cellular Infiltrates Vary in Response to Live and Heat-Killed Conidia</title><p>To examine in vivo inflammatory responses to metabolically active and inert <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia, 10<sup>7</sup> live or heat-killed conidia were administered intratracheally to immune competent mice.

First, neither innate immune response pathway is activated by dormant conidia; each responds only to conidia that have initiated the germination process. We propose that restricted recognition of germinating conidia provides a mechanism to focus pulmonary inflammatory responses on spores that are most likely to cause invasive disease. Second, the contributions of the Dectin-1- and MyD88-mediated signaling pathways are, in the case of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia, additive. The ability of AMØs to generate Dectin-1-dependent, MyD88-independent inflammatory responses to germinating conidia may, in part, provide an explanation for the survival of TLR-2- and MyD88-deficient mice in a pulmonary infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between MyD88- and Dectin-1-dependent signaling has not been examined previously in the host response to intact fungi. Studies with the β-glucan-rich particle zymosan revealed that TNF-α secretion by macrophages is fully dependent on the presence of TLR-2 and MyD88 and is blocked by the addition of glucan phosphate, a soluble high-molecular-weight β-glucan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b029">29</xref>]. Experiments with transfected cell lines found that co-expression of Dectin-1- and TLR-2- enhanced zymosan-dependent transcriptional responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b025">25</xref>]. Zymosan also binds the extracellular domain of TLR-2 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b038">38</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that Dectin-1 and TLR-2/MyD88 collaborate to mount zymosan-dependent inflammatory responses. In our experimental system, Dectin-1- and MyD88-mediated TNF-α/MIP-2 secretion did not depend on the functional presence of the other signaling molecule.</p><p>Our results, to our knowledge, differ from previous work examining TLR- and MyD88-dependent signaling in response to conidia and hyphae. This may be, in part, due to differences in TLR/MyD88- and Dectin-1-dependent signaling by macrophages isolated from different anatomical sites. Mambula et al. found that in peritoneal macrophages MyD88-dependent signals account for approximately 90% of TNF-α secreted in response to live resting and heat-killed swollen conidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b017">17</xref>]. In contrast, our results suggest that MyD88-dependent signals account for roughly 50% of the TNF-α secreted by BMMØs and AMØs in response to live, resting conidia. Macrophages from different sources may also react uniquely to killed, resting conidia. For example, Marr et al. also observed that BMMØs do not produce TNF-α in response to heat-killed resting conidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b020">20</xref>], while two other studies demonstrated that peritoneal macrophages secrete TNF-α in response to heat- or ethanol-killed conidia in a largely TLR-4-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b019">19</xref>]. We have investigated AMØs given their central role as first responders to inhaled conidia. Unlike peritoneal macrophages, AMØs and BMMØs kill conidia and prevent germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b039">39</xref>].</p><p>Conidial ligands that activate TLR/MyD88-dependent signals remain unknown and may involve molecules derived from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids. The complex interaction between conidia and mammalian cells involves multiple sets of ligand-receptor interactions beyond the β-glucan/Dectin-1 and the unknown ligand(s)-TLR/MyD88 pairs. Experiments using soluble carbohydrates or antibodies as blocking agents have implicated a number of receptors in conidial binding or internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b041">41</xref>]; these include a mannosyl-fucosyl receptor (in murine AMØs), a β-glucan inhibitable receptor (in human monocytes), the macrophage mannose receptor, the DEC205 lectin, and the CD11b/CD18 integrin (all in murine pulmonary DCs). Conidial galactomannan binds the soluble pattern recognition receptor pentraxin 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b042">42</xref>], a C-type lectin of galactomannan-specificity on Langerhans cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b043">43</xref>], as well as DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) on human DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b036">36</xref>]. However, it remains unknown whether DC-SIGN or any of these other cell surface receptors implicated in conidial binding or internalization contribute to inflammatory cytokine/chemokine induction and neutrophil recruitment.</p><p>Human fungal pathogens propagate and grow using different mechanisms. For example, the yeast <italic>C. albicans</italic> divides by separation of mother and daughter cells and can switch between yeast and filamentous growth. It has been recently demonstrated that the process of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell division creates bud and birth scars with exposed β-glucans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b026">26</xref>]. Unlike filamentous growth, <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast growth is thus susceptible to Dectin-1-dependent recognition and antifungal responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b026">26</xref>].</p><p><italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis,</italic> a thermal dimorph, forms conidia that are inhaled and transform into pathogenic yeast forms within the host. The dimorphic transition is associated with a change in the polymer linkage from β-glucan to α-glucan in the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b044">44</xref>]. In contrast, the mold <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> forms conidia that swell and germinate prior to hyphal extension; our study indicates that this process exposes β-glucan polymers on the surface of swollen conidia. The appearance of surface-exposed β-glucans at specific stages of fungal growth and division as well as their conserved presence among fungal organisms renders these carbohydrate polymers ideal recognition molecules for innate immune receptors that trigger antifungal responses.</p><p><italic>C. albicans, P. jiroveci, C. posadasii,</italic> and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> vary significantly in terms of human disease and host susceptibility, tissue tropism and damage, and metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010030-b015">15</xref>]. However, innate immune defenses against these organisms are mobilized, at least in part, through the recognition of exposed β-glucans by Dectin-1-dependent pathways. Despite their common β-glucans, yeasts, molds, and zymosan differ in terms of other surface and cell-wall components. It is likely that these disparities account for distinct innate immune responses to different fungal organisms and components. The identification of both common and distinct fungal components that activate innate immune responses will be an intense focus of further research. In turn, the repertoire of signaling pathways activated in leukocytes and other host cells will undoubtedly yield experimental strategies to modulate inflammatory states and responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chemical reagents and antibodies.</title><p>Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, United States) unless noted otherwise.
