For example, it has been known for almost 90 y that clinical isolates of the human bacterial pathogen group A streptococci (GAS) have extensive phenotypic heterogeneity linked to variation in virulence. However, the complete underlying molecular mechanism(s) have not been defined. Expression microarray analysis of nine clinical isolates identified two fundamentally different transcriptomes, designated pharyngeal transcriptome profile (PTP) and invasive transcriptome profile (ITP). PTP and ITP GAS differed in approximately 10% of the transcriptome, including at least 23 proven or putative virulence factor genes. ITP organisms were recovered from skin lesions of mice infected subcutaneously with PTP GAS and were significantly more able to survive phagocytosis and killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Complete genome resequencing of a mouse-derived ITP GAS revealed that the organism differed from its precursor by only a 7-bp frameshift mutation in the gene <italic>(covS)</italic> encoding the sensor kinase component of a two-component signal transduction system implicated in virulence. Genetic complementation, and sequence analysis of <italic>covR/S</italic> in 42 GAS isolates confirmed the central role of <italic>covR/S</italic> in transcriptome, exoproteome, and virulence modulation. Genome-wide analysis provides a heretofore unattained understanding of phenotypic variation and disease specificity in microbial pathogens, resulting in new avenues for vaccine and therapeutics research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Phenotypic heterogeneity within an infecting population is a strategy commonly used by bacterial pathogens to evade the host immune system and enhance survival. Such phenotypic variation has been observed for the human pathogen group A streptococci (GAS), which can cause a wide range of diseases with differing severity. However, the underlying mechanisms that control this variation, and the survival- and virulence-associated effects of this variation, have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>By assaying total gene expression the authors found that clinical GAS isolates from invasive and pharyngeal diseases had distinct gene expression patterns during growth in standard laboratory media. These two gene expression patterns conferred distinct virulence-associated attributes on the expressing GAS strain, as assessed using bacteremia and soft-tissue infection models of disease. Likewise, the ability to survive the bactericidal activity of human neutrophils was significantly different between GAS strains with the two distinct expression patterns. Transition from one gene expression pattern to the other required the mutation of the two-component signal transduction system CovRS (control of virulence R/S). The authors conclude that the ability of GAS to remodel its transcriptome plays a major contribution in its ability to colonize distinct niches of the human body and cause disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Sumby P, Whitney AR, Graviss EA, DeLeo FR, Musser JM (2006) Genome-wide analysis of group A streptococci reveals a mutation that modulates global phenotype and disease specificity.

Historically, interest in this phenomenon has been fueled by the observation that phenotypic variants can differ in pathogenesis characteristics, such as increased or decreased virulence, or adaptation to a particular anatomic site. Extensive work has been directed at elucidating the molecular genetic events that contribute to phenotypic variation, with antigenic variation being the best-studied category. With few exceptions, most studies have focused on analysis of a distinct phenotype such as adhesin production or lipooligosaccharide structural modification. Several molecular mechanisms have been documented to contribute to phenotypic variation, the most common being slipped-strand mispairing events that result in phase-variable expression of the associated gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b001">1</xref>].</p><p>The group A streptococci (GAS) cause many distinct human infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b002">2</xref>]. Disease manifestations range from mild infections such as pharyngitis (“strep throat”) and impetigo, to extensive tissue destruction in the case of necrotizing fasciitis (the “flesh-eating” syndrome). Postinfection sequelae such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis can also occur. The mechanisms that enable GAS to cause diverse diseases are unknown, although both bacterial and host-specific components are thought to be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>Associated morphologic and virulence variation in GAS has been known for almost 90 y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b005">5</xref>]. Classic studies identified GAS phenotypic variation during invasive and upper respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b006">6</xref>]. More recently, correlations have been reported between the source of GAS clinical isolates and their ability to invade human epithelial cells or secrete high concentrations of virulence factors such as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, B, and C (SpeA, SpeB, and SpeC), or streptolysin O (SLO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b009">9</xref>]. Such correlations have been observed for multiple GAS serotypes, including clonal contemporary serotype M1 GAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b010">10</xref>]. The idea that GAS phenotypic heterogeneity contributes to distinct disease manifestations is supported by the identification of inherited alterations in virulence factor production when GAS is passaged in human blood ex vivo or through mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>Virulence factor production by GAS is regulated by stand-alone transcription factors and two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b015">15</xref>]. Thirteen TCSs have been described in GAS, of which the CovRS system (also known as CsrRS) is the best characterized. CovRS is a negative regulatory TCS that directly or indirectly influences expression of 10% to 15% of GAS genes, including several virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite these advances, we have an imprecise understanding of the contribution of phenotypic variation to host–pathogen interactions in GAS, and the molecular mechanism(s) controlling this heterogeneity. Recently, genome-wide investigative strategies have been used successfully to provide new information about GAS population genetics, evolution, and pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b022">22</xref>]. Inasmuch as phenotypic variation in GAS may be a key component of the pathogen life cycle, we chose to investigate this phenomenon using genome-wide analytic strategies, including transcriptome profiling and genome resequencing. Here we report genome, transcriptome, and partial secretome differences that distinguish GAS isolated from invasive and pharyngeal infections and permit a heretofore unattainable understanding of phenotypic variation in a microbial pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Transcriptome-Based Grouping of Serotype M1 GAS Strains</title><p>The transcriptomes of nine contemporary (post-1987) serotype M1 GAS strains grown to early exponential phase in Todd-Hewitt broth with yeast extract (THY) were analyzed with an Affymetrix expression microarray.

To test this hypothesis, GAS were isolated from the spleens and skin lesions of mice euthanized 5 d after subcutaneous injection with strain MGAS2221 (a representative PTP strain) or strain MGAS5005 (a representative ITP strain) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020005-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). A total of approximately 1,000 colonies obtained from infected mice were inspected visually for colony morphology. Colony morphology was used as an initial indicator of transcriptional profile because PTP GAS are nonmucoid, whereas ITP GAS are mucoid. This difference in colony morphology correlates with the increased expression of the capsule synthesis operon <italic>(hasABC)</italic> by ITP isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Regardless of the colony morphology of the original infecting strain, all GAS isolated from the spleens of infected animals were mucoid. These data imply that our hypothesis that PTP GAS have the ability to transition to ITP GAS during invasive infections was correct. More important, although all GAS isolated from the skin lesions of mice infected with the ITP strain also were mucoid, colonies grown from the skin lesions of PTP-infected mice were a mixture of nonmucoid parental and mucoid variant strains at approximately 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020005-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>To provide additional evidence that the mucoid derivatives of strain MGAS2221 had ITPs, we performed Western immunoblots assessing reactivity of SpeA, SpeB, SLO, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Streptococcus pyogenes</named-content> NAD-glycohydrolase (SPN, also known as NADase), Mac, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pyogenes</named-content> DNase 3 (Spd3).

Thus, in contrast to the bacteremia model data, the soft-tissue infection study identified PTP GAS as being more virulent than ITP GAS, as assessed by lesion volume. Consistent with the increased virulence of the PTP organisms during soft-tissue infection, four PTP infected animals reached near death, whereas no ITP infected mice reached this end point.

This strain variation also is observed among GAS clinical isolates, thereby raising the possibility that such variation is an important contributor to disease outcome. We used expression microarray and genome resequencing to characterize transcriptome differences in GAS variants and identify the underlying molecular mechanism. We discovered that a single 7-bp insertion mutation in the gene encoding the sensor kinase component of a TCS was solely responsible for the tremendous number of transcript differences distinguishing a PTP isolate from its ITP derivative.</p><p>ITP and PTP GAS strains have very distinct transcriptomes and cause significantly different disease manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g003">3</xref>). The increased virulence of ITP GAS in the bacteremia model was linked to up-regulation of many factors that inhibit PMN function, including capsule, Sic, Mac, streptococcal DNase D2, C5a peptidase, <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> cell-envelope protease, and other exoproteins that assist pathogen survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g003">3</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b027">27</xref>]. Increased production of these virulence factors by ITP GAS occurs concurrently with decreased production of SpeB, a broad-spectrum cysteine protease virulence factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g002">Figure 2</xref>A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b030">30</xref>]). SpeB degrades fibronectin, vitronectin, preinterleukin-1B, and other host molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b031">31</xref>]. More important, SpeB also cleaves and inactivates bacterial proteins that contribute to host–pathogen interactions, including many cell-wall anchored and secreted GAS virulence factors such as M protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b032">32</xref>]. Hence, despite the modest (1.16-fold) increase in <italic>emm</italic> transcription in ITP strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020005-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), the relative amount of mature M protein may be significantly greater for ITP strains because of the SpeB-mediated degradation of M protein by PTP GAS. Thus, decreased SpeB production may play a key role in the increased lethality of ITP GAS by preserving GAS virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b033">33</xref>]. Indeed, an inverse correlation between in vitro SpeB expression and human disease severity has been observed for contemporary M1 GAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b009">9</xref>]. However, the in vivo consequences of this in vitro observation are unclear. Indeed, despite minimal in vitro SpeB expression by the highly virulent ITP strain MGAS5005, this strain produces extensive amounts of SpeB when grown ex vivo in human saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b034">34</xref>].</p><p>Mice infected subcutaneously with PTP GAS had significantly larger skin lesions than animals injected with ITP strains (all of which were <italic>covS<sup> −</sup></italic>), an unexpected finding given a previous report of increased lesion formation by a <italic>covS</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g003">Figure 3</xref>B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b021">21</xref>]). Differences between the animal studies reported by Engleberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b021">21</xref>] and our own include their use of Cytodex beads, a different inoculum concentration, and smaller group sizes (<italic>n</italic> = 5 mice). It is possible that the 2-fold increase in transcription of the <italic>sag</italic> operon (encoding streptolysin S) by PTP isolates is one contributory factor for the larger lesion volumes observed following PTP GAS infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g003">3</xref>B).

It should be noted, however, that no difference was observed between four ITP and four PTP GAS strains following determination of hemolytic zone size after plating on blood agar plates (unpublished data).</p><p>Transcription of the genes encoding streptokinase <italic>(ska),</italic> Mac <italic>(mac),</italic> and capsule production (the <italic>has</italic> operon) are repressed by CovRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b025">25</xref>], providing an explanation for the increased expression of these genes by ITP GAS strains. While CovRS represses the <italic>has</italic> operon directly, it is not known whether repression of <italic>ska</italic> and <italic>mac</italic> is direct or indirect. Recently, CovR has been shown to directly bind and repress expression from the <italic>sagA</italic> promoter in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b037">37</xref>]. This observation differs from that observed in the present study where mutation of <italic>covR</italic> or <italic>covS</italic> resulted in a decrease in <italic>sagA</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g002">2</xref>C). In addition to encoding streptolysin S, a noncoding RNA with gene regulatory properties is also transcribed from the <italic>sag</italic> locus (also referred to as <italic>pel</italic> for pleiotropic effect locus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b038">38</xref>]. This regulatory RNA positively regulates the expression of several GAS virulence factor-encoding genes including <italic>sic, nga, emm,</italic> and <italic>ska.</italic> As <italic>sagA</italic> transcription is increased in PTP GAS strains this would be expected to lead to increased transcription of <italic>sic, nga, emm,</italic> and <italic>ska.</italic> However, transcription of these genes is decreased in comparison to ITP GAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). We believe that this observation highlights the hierarchy and extensive cross-talking that occurs between GAS transcriptional regulators. That is, we believe that despite a greater concentration of <italic>sagA</italic> RNA in PTP GAS strains <italic>(sagA<sup>++</sup>, covR/S<sup> +</sup>),</italic> the transcription of <italic>sic, nga,</italic> and <italic>ska</italic> are repressed compared to ITP GAS <italic>(sagA<sup>+</sup>, covR/S<sup> −</sup>)</italic> due to CovRS-mediated repression.</p><p>In comparison to the <italic>sagA</italic> data, production of the transcription factor-encoding gene <italic>rgg</italic> correlates well with differences in known Rgg-regulated genes. Rgg acts as both a positive (e.g., <italic>speB, grab</italic>) and negative (e.g., <italic>slo, mac</italic>) regulator of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b039">39</xref>]. As <italic>rgg</italic> transcription is 3.8-fold higher in PTP GAS, the increase in <italic>speB</italic> and <italic>grab</italic> transcription and decrease in <italic>slo</italic> and <italic>mac</italic> transcription by PTP GAS isolates may at least be partially mediated through greater Rgg activity.</p><p>Genome resequencing found that only a single 7-bp insertion mutation in <italic>covS</italic> differentiated PTP strain MGAS2221 from its ITP derivative (strain 26PL1), an unexpected finding given the extensive differences in transcriptome, exoproteome, and mouse virulence between these strains. Although mutations in <italic>covR/S</italic> have been reported to arise during mouse passage resulting in enhanced virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b021">21</xref>], the extensive effect of a <italic>covS</italic> mutation on the transcriptome and resulting phenotypes was not known until the studies reported herein. While we do not believe it to be the case, the possibility that the genome resequencing study failed to identify all genomic differences between strains cannot be discounted. Documented limitations of the resequencing array approach are difficulties in identifying DNA insertions, DNA inversions, and expanded/retracted simple sequence repeats. However, our resequencing arrays identified the 1- and 7-bp insertions in <italic>covS,</italic> and the deletion of an insertion sequence, upon confirmation of putative polymorphisms by PCR and sequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020005-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the resequencing microarrays used in this study were powerful tools to identify genetic differences between GAS strains at a whole genome level. Even if genomic alterations were missed in our study, the strong correlation between GAS transcriptional profile and <italic>covR/S</italic> genotype, coupled with <italic>covR/S</italic> complementation data, strongly supports the notion that mutation of <italic>covR/S</italic> is sufficient for transition from PTP to ITP.</p><p>We hypothesize that PTP GAS are preferentially suited for survival in the human pharynx. Consistent with this hypothesis are recent reports that SpeB is required for growth and persistence in saliva and protection from killing by LL-37, an antimicrobial compound present in high levels in human airway-surface fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b040">40</xref>]. Nyberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b040">40</xref>] have reported that binding of SpeB to the GAS cell surface protects the pathogen from killing by LL-37 by targeted degradation of this antibacterial factor. In this regard, we note that the gene encoding GRAB, a GAS cell-surface protein that tethers α-2-macroglobulin to the bacterial cell surface, is itself up-regulated approximately 8-fold in PTP isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b041">41</xref>]). The α-2-macroglobulin is a protease inhibitor that binds and retains SpeB at the bacterial cell surface, protecting against LL-37-mediated killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b041">41</xref>]. Thus, coordinated up-regulation of SpeB and GRAB likely enhance survival of GAS in the upper respiratory tract.</p><p>ITP GAS arise from PTP precursors during invasive infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g002">Figures 2</xref> and S2), presumably due in part to their increased ability to escape PMN-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020005-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since several of the antiphagocytic effectors made by ITP strains are freely diffusible, PTP GAS present at the infection site with ITP organisms might profit from a “bystander” effect. Together, these processes increase the likelihood that the infecting bacteria are able to disseminate to a new host.</p><p>We have not obtained evidence that ITP GAS can convert to a PTP form. Similarly, we did not recover PTP GAS from the upper respiratory tract of nonhuman primates with experimental GAS pharyngitis induced by an ITP strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020005-b026">26</xref>] (unpublished data). These observations, coupled with the fact that many distinct <italic>covR/S</italic> mutations were found in different ITP isolates, lead us to conclude that the PTP to ITP conversion is largely unidirectional. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that transition of ITP to PTP GAS occurs at a very low frequency due to back or second-site mutations.</p><p>Following the assumption that infecting GAS is a homogeneous population, clinical diagnostic laboratories generally retain only one or a small number of colonies from each infected patient. However, the data presented herein found that both ITP and PTP GAS can be recovered from an invasive infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020005-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, this observation may help to explain the imperfect correlations between GAS phenotypic variation and disease source seen in this and other studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>). Isolation of PTP GAS from an invasive infection does not preclude ITP GAS from also playing an important role.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Concluding Comment</title><p>Our genome-wide analysis has provided a precise explanation for global modulation of phenotype and disease specificity in a bacterial pathogen.
