These proteins are encoded by a large, polymorphic gene family called <italic>var</italic>. The family contains approximately 60 individual genes, which are subject to strict, mutually exclusive expression, with the single expressed <italic>var</italic> gene determining the antigenic, cytoadherent, and virulence phenotype of the infected cell. The mutually exclusive expression pattern of <italic>var</italic> genes is imperative for the parasite's ability to evade the host's immune response and is similar to the process of “allelic exclusion” described for mammalian Ig and odorant receptor genes. In mammalian systems, mutually exclusive expression is ensured by negative feedback inhibition mediated by production of a functional protein. To investigate how expression of the <italic>var</italic> gene family is regulated, we have created transgenic lines of parasites in which expression of individual <italic>var</italic> loci can be manipulated. Here we show that no such negative feedback system exists in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> and that this process is dependent solely on the transcriptional regulatory elements immediately adjacent to each gene. Transgenic parasites that are selected to express a <italic>var</italic> gene in which the PfEMP1 coding region has been replaced by a drug-selectable marker silence all other <italic>var</italic> genes in the genome, thus effectively knocking out all PfEMP1 expression and indicating that the modified gene is still recognized as a member of the <italic>var</italic> gene family. Mutually exclusive expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> is therefore regulated exclusively at the level of transcription, and a functional PfEMP1 protein is not necessary for viability or for proper gene regulation in cultured parasites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Mutually exclusive gene expression refers to the ability of an organism to select one member of a large, multicopy gene family for expression while simultaneously silencing all other members of the family. Human malaria parasites utilize this process in regulating the expression of the major antigenic and virulence-determining proteins encoded by a multicopy gene family called <italic>var</italic>. In any given parasite, only a single <italic>var</italic> gene is expressed at a time, while all other members of the family are transcriptionally silenced. The mechanism that regulates this tightly controlled process and coordinates switches in gene expression is largely unknown. Here Dzikowski and colleagues show that this process is regulated entirely at the level of transcription, and that protein production and chromosomal context of the genes are not involved. In addition, they identify the DNA elements required for a <italic>var</italic> gene promoter to be recognized and co-regulated along with the rest of the family. This knowledge has enabled the authors to create transgenic parasites in which they can manipulate expression of the entire <italic>var</italic> gene family through selection for expression of specific, modified <italic>var</italic> genes, thus knocking out expression of the main virulence factor of malaria.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported National Institutes of Health Grant AI 52390 and a grant from the Ellison Medical Foundation.

The most prominent virulent surface antigen expressed by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> is the protein PfEMP1 (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> erythrocytic membrane protein 1) encoded by the multicopy <italic>var</italic> gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b004">4</xref>]. This protein is thought to be the primary antigenic molecule on the infected cell surface as well as the major determinant of the cell's cytoadherent and virulence properties. Over the course of an infection, parasites regularly switch which PfEMP1 is expressed, thus avoiding the antibody response specific to previously expressed forms of PfEMP1 and mediating the process of antigenic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b005">5</xref>]. This process is regulated at the level of <italic>var</italic> gene transcription and depends on the fact that only one gene is expressed at a time in a single parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b007">7</xref>]. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> genome contains approximately 60 <italic>var</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b008">8</xref>]; however, frequent recombinations, deletions, and gene conversions create an endless <italic>var</italic> repertoire for antigenic variation. The processes of mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> gene expression, rapid switching of the expressed gene, and the ability to generate a virtually limitless collection of new <italic>var</italic> genes is thought to be responsible for the fact that complete immunity to malaria infection is difficult or impossible to achieve.</p><p>There are many examples of mutually exclusive gene expression described in several organisms, including dosage compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b009">9</xref>] and imprinting in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b010">10</xref>] and VSG expression in African trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b011">11</xref>]. While the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process are not completely understood in any eukaryotic system, many advances have been made recently with regard to the regulation of the mammalian Ig heavy-chain genes expressed in B cells as well as the odorant receptor gene family expressed in olfactory sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b013">13</xref>]. In both of these examples, the genes encode cell surface receptors that are expressed in a mutually exclusive, mono-allelic manner, leading to the “one cell–one receptor” paradigm. This phenomenon is frequently referred to as “allelic exclusion,” and the ultimate decision as to which allele will be expressed in an individual cell has been shown to depend on negative feedback at the level of protein expression. Replacement of the receptor coding region with that of a reporter gene, or disruption of the open reading frame lead to activation of an additional allele, thus confirming the model that mono-allelic gene expression is ultimately regulated via the production of a functional protein on the cell surface. In the case of the Ig heavy-chain genes, the inhibitory feedback signal has been shown to require the spleen tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b014">14</xref>], leading to silencing of the alternative locus through modifications in chromatin structure.</p><p>Regulation of expression of the <italic>var</italic> gene family has many similarities to the systems described above. <italic>var</italic> genes are likewise expressed in a mutually exclusive manner and encode cell surface receptors. In addition, epigenetic alterations in chromatin structure appear to be important for maintaining “off” genes in a transcriptionally silent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b016">16</xref>]. However, it is not known whether a negative feedback mechanism exists requiring production of a functional PfEMP1 protein from one <italic>var</italic> gene to repress expression of other members of the gene family. Previously, Gannoun-Zaki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b017">17</xref>] had shown that a <italic>var</italic> promoter driving expression of a drug-selectable marker rather than PfEMP1 is not recognized by the mechanism that controls <italic>var</italic> allelic exclusion. We have subsequently confirmed this result, suggesting the possibility that a negative feedback mechanism does exist. However, the <italic>var</italic> promoter in this construct is constitutively active because it has been separated from a silencing element found in <italic>var</italic> introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b017">17</xref>]. Therefore it is unclear if this promoter remains “uncounted” because it fails to produce a functional protein or rather if its separation from potential regulatory elements in the intron and elsewhere in the regulatory regions surrounding the gene has simply made it unrecognized by the process that controls allelic exclusion.</p><p>To begin to address the question of allelic exclusion in <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> we created transgenic parasite lines where we could select for transcriptional activation of specific <italic>var</italic> promoters. In these genetically modified parasites, recombinant <italic>var</italic> promoters drive expression of a drug-selectable marker rather than the surface protein PfEMP1. These promoters are initially silenced, implying that they are properly regulated. However, selection for activation results in the silencing of all other members of the <italic>var</italic> gene family, indicating that these promoters are indeed “counted” by the mechanism that regulates mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> gene expression. These results indicate that mono-allelic expression of <italic>var</italic> genes depends solely on noncoding elements at each <italic>var</italic> gene and is independent of production of a functional PfEMP1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Integration of a Selectable Marker into Internal and Subtelomeric Chromosomal <italic>var</italic> Loci</title><p>To acquire accurate data regarding transcriptional regulation, it is preferable to study a <italic>var</italic> promoter within its chromosomal context that can be both transcriptionally silenced and activated. For this purpose we utilized constructs designed to integrate directly into a <italic>var</italic> locus in such a way as to preserve any surrounding elements that might regulate gene expression. These constructs carry two selectable markers: the Blaticidin S deaminase <italic>(bsd)</italic> gene behind a <italic>var</italic> upstream region and the human dihydrofolate reductase <italic>(hdhfr)</italic> gene driven by the promoter activity of a <italic>var</italic> intron. The presence of a <italic>var</italic> intron on these plasmids ensures that the upstream <italic>var</italic> promoter driving <italic>bsd</italic> expression can be silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b017">17</xref>]. The <italic>var</italic> upstream regions included in the constructs were truncated to include only sequences downstream of the transcription start site, thus preventing expression of the <italic>bsd</italic> gene without homologous integration into the correct chromosomal <italic>var</italic> upstream region. This design enables rapid positive selection for integration into the desired locus as described by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b018">18</xref>]. The constructs, cloning strategy, and expression patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g005">5</xref>. <italic>var</italic> loci are found in both subtelomeric and internal regions of the chromosomes, and it has been speculated that chromosomal location might influence gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b019">19</xref>]. Therefore we targeted our constructs to both internal and subtelomeric <italic>var</italic> loci by using UpsB (typical subtelomeric promoter) and UpsC (typical internal promoter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b020">20</xref>] upstream regions in the plasmids pV<sub>b</sub>BB/IDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g004">4</xref>A) and pV<sub>c</sub>BB/IDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), respectively. A recently cloned population of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> parasites (NF54/C3) predominantly expressing <italic>var</italic> PFD1005c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g003">Figure 3</xref>, top panel) was transfected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b022">22</xref>], selected using pyrimethamine until resistant lines stably containing episomes were established and then grown in the presence of blasticidin to select for integration at the targeted <italic>var</italic> loci. At this point episomes could no longer be detected by “plasmid rescue.” Limiting dilution was then used to clone distinct genetic lines from the established blasticidin resistant culture. The sites of integration were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and confirmed by sequencing across integration sites and Southern blotting. To monitor <italic>var</italic> gene transcription levels and to examine the expression state of the rest of the <italic>var</italic> gene family, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis applying the primer set developed by Salanti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b023">23</xref>].

Expression levels of each <italic>var</italic> gene in the genome as well as the inserted <italic>bsd</italic> gene were monitored at each step in the selection and cloning process and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g003">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Transcription-level quantification of ring-stage parasites showed that in B12E3 parasites kept under <italic>bsd</italic> pressure the only active <italic>var</italic> promoter in the genome was the one driving <italic>bsd,</italic> while the rest of the <italic>var</italic> family was silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g003">Figure 3</xref>, second panel). Removal of the drug resulted in gradual activation of other <italic>var</italic> genes over time, indicating that in the absence of drug selection, <italic>var</italic> gene expression may be switching away from the modified locus, resulting in the activation other <italic>var</italic> genes. Three weeks after drug removal, an increase in the level of transcription was detected in a few <italic>var</italic> genes, although no <italic>var</italic> transcript reached the level of the <italic>bsd</italic> gene. However, 10 wk after drug removal, <italic>Mal7P1.55</italic> was then the most highly transcribed <italic>var</italic> gene, transcripts from two other genes reached the level of <italic>bsd,</italic> and a few others reached the level of the housekeeping gene (seryl-tRNA synthetase, PF07_0073) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g003">Figure 3</xref>, third panel). To determine if the activation of other <italic>var</italic> genes is the result of true expression switching or is instead due to deletion of the transgene, we re-cloned this transcriptionally heterogeneous population without drug pressure and evaluated <italic>var</italic> gene transcription in several of the resulting individual clones. In eight isolated clones, three demonstrate true epigenetic switching, four did not switch and continued exclusively expressing <italic>bsd,</italic> and one had deleted the <italic>bsd</italic> transgene. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g003">Figure 3</xref> (fourth panel), in the DC-J clone the <italic>bsd</italic> gene switched to a silent state while <italic>var</italic> PFD1015c was actively transcribed, thus demonstrating a switch in <italic>var</italic> gene expression. Quantification of gene copy number by gDNA realtime PCR confirmed that the <italic>bsd</italic> gene was still present in the genome as a single copy gene in these parasites, but was now transcriptionally silent. Interestingly, the gene that became activated is located in a Chromosome 4 internal cluster adjacent to the gene that was active in the originally transfected NF54/C3 clonal population. To determine if the switch in expression is reversible, we put the DC-J line back under blasticidin pressure and were able to reselect a culture exclusively transcribing <italic>bsd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g003">Figure 3</xref>, bottom panel). These results demonstrate that a <italic>var</italic> locus expressing an exogenous protein is recognized as an “on” <italic>var</italic> gene by the mechanism that controls mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> gene expression, and that silencing and activation of such a gene is a reversible, epigenetic process.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Active <italic>var</italic> Promoters Separated from PfEMP1 Coding Regions by Multicopy Inserts Induce Silencing of the <italic>var</italic> Gene Family</title><p>In the double crossover line B12E3, the coding region of exon I was replaced with the drug-selectable marker while keeping the gene structure intact.

It has been proposed that the location and chromosomal context surrounding <italic>var</italic> genes may contribute to expression patterns or to recombination between genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b020">20</xref>]; however, the role that chromosomal context plays in mutually exclusive expression has not been directly considered. To address whether location within a chromosome is necessary for the “on” <italic>var</italic> promoter to be counted by the mechanism controlling mutually exclusive expression of the <italic>var</italic> family, we transfected the construct pVBB/IDH into the same NF54/C3 clonal population. This construct is similar to the constructs that were integrated into the chromosome with the exception that it includes a full-length <italic>var</italic> upstream region (UpsC) including the start site of transcription, thus allowing selection of parasites that have activated an episomal <italic>var</italic> promoter without integration into the genome. Parasites carrying stable episomes were isolated as described above using pyrimethamine selection for expression of the <italic>hdhfr</italic> gene driven by the promoter activity of the <italic>var</italic> intron. After verifying that the transformed parasites carried an intact pVBB/IDH, they were placed under blasticidin pressure to select for activation of the episomal <italic>var</italic> promoter and analysis of expression of the entire <italic>var</italic> family was performed. The active episomal <italic>var</italic> promoter was counted by the mechanism regulating exclusive expression and effectively silenced the rest of the endogenous <italic>var</italic> repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This indicates that recognition of a <italic>var</italic> promoter and coordinated expression of the <italic>var</italic> gene family depends only on the noncoding elements at each <italic>var</italic> locus and is independent of chromosomal context. Further, these experiments demonstrate that all of the DNA elements necessary for recognition of a <italic>var</italic> promoter by the mechanism that controls mutually exclusive expression are included within the transfected construct.</p><fig id="ppat-0020022-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020022.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>An Active <italic>var</italic> Promoter on an Episome Is Exclusively Expressed</title><p>NF54/C3 parasites stably carrying the episome pVBB/IDH were grown under blasticidin pressure.</p><p>(A) Plasmid map of pVBB/IDH.</p><p>(B) Transcription levels were then measured by Q-RT-PCR and indicated that the parasites exclusively express <italic>bsd</italic> while all endogenous <italic>var</italic> genes are silent.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020022.g007" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>For the first time, expression of the entire <italic>var</italic> gene family can be knocked out in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in a reversible way. We have created transgenic parasites where by using a drug-selectable marker we can now turn “on” different subtelomeric and internal <italic>var</italic> promoters and thus shut “off” transcription of the rest of the <italic>var</italic> family. This study shows that the expression of a transgene from <italic>var</italic> locus does not interrupt the mechanism controlling mutually exclusive expression, implying that this phenomenon is independent of the expression of the antigenic protein PfEMP1, and therefore suggests that there are noncoding elements at each <italic>var</italic> locus that are essential and sufficient for this mechanism. The fact that we could get activation of endogenous <italic>var</italic> genes by removing drug pressure and subsequently recover complete silencing of the entire family by growing the parasites back in the presence of drug implies that mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> is a reversible, epigenetic process. In addition, all <italic>var</italic> genes, regardless of promoter type or chromosomal location, appear to be coordinately regulated in these transgenic parasites, indicating that all <italic>var</italic> genes must share similar intrinsic regulatory properties.</p><p>Previous work demonstrated that a transfected <italic>var</italic> promoter that is impaired in silencing and therefore constitutively active is not “counted” by the mechanism that controls mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b017">17</xref>]. The fact that the recombinant promoters described here that can be silenced are also “counted” implies that the mechanisms that control gene silencing and allelic exclusion may be linked. This hypothesis is supported by recent descriptions of two other <italic>var</italic> promoters that are constitutively active but not recognized by the mechanism that controls allelic exclusion. The first is the <italic>var1csa</italic> gene (also called <italic>var</italic><sub>common</sub>). This gene appears to be impaired in silencing and is constitutively transcribed in many parasite isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b025">25</xref>]. However, transcription of this gene does not affect expression of other <italic>var</italic> genes and it is therefore not recognized as part of the <italic>var</italic> gene family. The second example is from a transgenic line in which the <italic>var2csa</italic> gene has been disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b026">26</xref>]. This integration event also disrupted silencing of the gene and rendered the promoter constitutively active. Other <italic>var</italic> genes are also transcribed in this parasite line, indicating that the promoter of the disrupted gene is not recognized by the rest of the <italic>var</italic> gene family.</p><p>Silencing and activation of <italic>var</italic> promoters as well as recognition by the mechanism that controls mutually exclusive expression have now all been achieved in an episomal context. This indicates that all of these functions are encoded by the regulatory regions included in the plasmid constructs and that they are not dependent on characteristics of the chromosomal environment in which <italic>var</italic> genes reside. Thus specific chromosomal characteristics and elements that are frequently found in close proximity to <italic>var</italic> genes, for instance rep20 repeats or subtelomeric specific heterochromatin, are not likely to play a role in regulating <italic>var</italic> gene expression. Rather it seems likely that each individual <italic>var</italic> gene contains all of the elements that necessary for proper regulation and that these elements can be isolated within a plasmid construct. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that two adjacent <italic>var</italic> genes that occupy the same chromosomal environment can assume different states of transcriptional activity.</p><p>The transgenic parasite lines described here provide an excellent tool for investigations into cytoadherence and virulence as well as the mechanism responsible for mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> gene expression. For example, preliminary examination suggests that the switching rate may vary in the different transgenic cultures. In particular, the rate at which additional <italic>var</italic> genes are activated appears to be much slower in the parasite line containing the integration at the internal <italic>var</italic> gene containing the UpsC type promoter (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g004">Figures 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020022-g005">5</xref>C). This may indicate that different <italic>var</italic> promoters have different intrinsic “on” and “off” switching rates, as was previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020022-b027">27</xref>], or alternatively that the apparent “on” rate of other <italic>var</italic> genes actually reflects a higher deletion rate of the transgene in this recombinant line. Future extensive cloning and expression analysis will directly address this question.</p><p>The ability to manipulate expression within the <italic>var</italic> gene family should allow studies into switching frequencies and the possibilities for either random or programmed switching between individual <italic>var</italic> genes. In addition, without PfEMP1 on the cell surface, the role of other red cell surface proteins in cytoadherence and antigenicity can now be more easily assessed. In particular, the roles of putative surface proteins including those encoded by <italic>rif</italic> and <italic>stevor</italic> genes, can be more definitively addressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Parasite culture and transfection.</title><p>All experiments utilized the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. falciparum</named-content> NF54 line cultivated at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium, 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States), 0.25% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin.
