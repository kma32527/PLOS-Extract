These are arranged in two clusters: 14 miRNAs are located in the introns of the viral <italic>BART</italic> gene while three are located adjacent to <italic>BHRF1.</italic> The <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs are expressed at high levels in latently infected epithelial cells and at lower, albeit detectable, levels in B cells. In contrast to the tissue-specific expression pattern of the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs, the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNAs are found at high levels in B cells undergoing stage III latency but are essentially undetectable in B cells or epithelial cells undergoing stage I or II latency. Induction of lytic EBV replication was found to enhance the expression of many, but not all, of these viral miRNAs. Rhesus lymphocryptovirus, which is separated from EBV by ≥13 million years of evolution, expresses at least 16 distinct miRNAs, seven of which are closely related to EBV miRNAs. Thus, lymphocryptovirus miRNAs are under positive selection and are likely to play important roles in the viral life cycle. Moreover, the differential regulation of EBV miRNA expression implies distinct roles during infection of different human tissues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Vertebrate cells express a large family of diverse small RNAs, called microRNAs, that can inhibit the expression of specific target genes. Recently, it has become apparent that several pathogenic human viruses, and in particular herpes viruses, also encode microRNAs that these viruses likely use to prevent infected cells and individuals from mounting effective antiviral responses. Here, we demonstrate that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which causes infectious mononucleosis and also some cancers in humans, makes 17 different microRNAs in infected human cells. These microRNAs are found in two clusters in the viral genome, one of three microRNAs, the second of 14 microRNAs, that are differentially expressed in different kinds of EBV-induced human tumors. Analysis of the closely related rhesus lymphocryptovirus shows that seven of these EBV microRNAs have been conserved in this simian virus across &gt;13 million years of divergent evolution. This argues that these microRNAs likely play an important role in EBV replication and represents the first demonstration of the evolutionary conservation of viral microRNAs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health to BRC (GM071408), RCD (DE14388; AI63928), JPB (AI0724522), and NRT (CA32979).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Cai X, Schäfer A, Lu S, Bilello JP, Desrosiers RC, et al.

Over 300 miRNAs have been identified in humans, and comparable numbers are expressed in all metazoan eukaryotes analyzed thus far. Although relatively few mRNA targets for specific miRNAs have been identified in vertebrates, experiments in plants, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila,</italic> and zebra fish indicate that miRNAs play a critical role in the appropriate regulation of gene expression during the differentiation and development of metazoan organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>miRNAs are closely related to small interfering RNAs, approximately 22-nt-long noncoding RNAs that are generated by cleavage of double-stranded RNAs by the RNase III enzyme Dicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b001">1</xref>]. In plants and in invertebrates, small interfering RNAs generated from double-stranded RNAs produced during viral replication have been shown to play an important role in the innate immune response of these organisms to viral infection by inducing an RNA interference response specific for the infecting virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b009">9</xref>]. While it was therefore initially proposed that a virus-induced RNA interference response might also be important in allowing vertebrate species to attenuate virus replication, evidence obtained so far has not supported this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b010">10</xref>]. However, a number of viruses have been shown to encode miRNAs that are believed to play a potentially critical role in the viral life cycle in vivo. Thus, the herpesviruses Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), human cytomegalovirus, and mouse herpesvirus 68 have previously been reported to encode five, eleven, nine, and nine miRNAs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b013">13</xref>]. Moreover, the unrelated DNA tumorvirus SV40 encodes at least one miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b014">14</xref>]. In the case of the EBV miRNA miR-BART2 and the SV40 miRNA, it has been proposed that these viral miRNAs down-regulate the expression of a virus-encoded mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b014">14</xref>]. In contrast, mRNA targets for the other viral miRNAs have yet to be identified, although several host mRNAs have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that these herpesvirus miRNAs, which are all expressed in latently infected cells, may facilitate the viral life cycle by blocking innate or adaptive host immune responses or by interfering with the appropriate regulation of apoptosis, cell growth, or DNA replication in infected cells.</p><p>In this manuscript, we have extended this earlier work by identifying an additional 14 miRNAs in EBV and by cloning and characterizing 21 miRNAs encoded by the related rhesus lymphocryptovirus (rLCV), a primate virus that is believed to have diverged from EBV ≥13 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b016">16</xref>]. We show that both EBV and rLCV encode two clusters of miRNAs, one located near the viral <italic>BHRF1</italic> gene and a second in the <italic>BART</italic> gene. Remarkably, several miRNAs are highly conserved between these two evolutionarily distinct herpesviruses, thus arguing for their importance in the viral life cycle. We also show that the <italic>BHRF1</italic> cluster of EBV miRNAs is selectively expressed in EBV-infected cells undergoing a stage III latent infection, including lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and passaged Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells, but is not detected in cells undergoing stage II or stage I EBV latent infection, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. In contrast, the viral <italic>BART</italic> miRNA cluster is highly expressed in NPCs and was also readily detected in an EBV+ primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell line, all of which represent EBV stage II latency, but it is barely detectable in LCLs and in most BL cell lines. These data suggest that virally encoded miRNAs may play distinct roles in the EBV-induced transformation of different human target cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of 14 Novel EBV miRNAs Encoded within the Viral <italic>BART</italic> Gene</title><p>Previously, we reported the cloning and analysis of a set of 11 miRNAs encoded by the pathogenic human herpesvirus KSHV that are expressed in the PEL cell line BC-1, which is latently infected by KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>]. BC-1 cells are also latently infected by a wild-type strain of EBV, and we also cloned 222 cDNAs representing EBV miRNAs, out of the 557 cDNA clones of cellular and viral miRNAs obtained in total. These 222 EBV miRNAs consisted of 15 distinct sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020023-t001">Table 1</xref>) that derived from 13 different predicted primary miRNA stem-loop precursors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Remarkably, only one of these 15 miRNAs was essentially identical in sequence to one of the five EBV-encoded miRNAs previously reported by Pfeffer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>]. Specifically, miR-BART1-5p is identical to the previously reported miR-BART1 miRNA except that it is 2 to 3 nt longer at the 3′ end. This difference may be real or, alternately, the previously reported miR-BART1 cDNA, which was only cloned once, may have suffered a 3′ deletion during cloning. In total, these data indicate that wild-type EBV actually encodes at least 17 different viral miRNAs.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="ppat-0020023-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020023.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sequence and Genomic Location of EBV miRNAs Cloned from the BC-1 Cell Line</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020023.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Name</td><td><hr/>Sequences 5&prime; to 3&prime;</td><td><hr/>Length (nt)</td><td><hr/>Hits</td><td><hr/>Position</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>miR-BART3-5p</td><td>AACCUAGUGUUAGUGUUGUGCU</td><td>22</td><td>34</td><td>139086:139107</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART3-3p</td><td>CGCACCACUAGUCACCAGGUGU</td><td>22</td><td>44</td><td>139124:139145</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART4</td><td>GACCUGAUGCUGCUGGUGUGCU</td><td>22</td><td>76</td><td>139228:139249</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART1-5p</td><td>UCUUAGUGGAAGUGACGUGCUGU(G)</td><td>23&ndash;24</td><td>&ensp;9</td><td>139351:139373</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART1-3p</td><td>UAGCACCGCUAUCCACUAUGUCU</td><td>23</td><td>&ensp;3</td><td>139387:139409</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART5</td><td>CAAGGUGAAUAUAGCUGCCCAUCG</td><td>24</td><td>17</td><td>139675:139698</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART6</td><td>CGGGGAUCGGACUAGCCUUAGA</td><td>22</td><td>&ensp;3</td><td>140072:140093</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART7</td><td>CAUCAUAGUCCAGUGUCCAGG(G)</td><td>21&ndash;22</td><td>&ensp;5</td><td>146475:146495</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART8</td><td>UACGGUUUCCUAGAUUGUACAG</td><td>22</td><td>&ensp;6</td><td>146772:146793</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART9</td><td>UAACACUUCAUGGGUCCCGUAG</td><td>22</td><td>&ensp;3</td><td>146997:147018</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART10</td><td>(U)ACAUAACCAUGGAGUUGGCUGU</td><td>22&ndash;23</td><td>17</td><td>147357:147378</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART11</td><td>ACGCACACCAGGCUGACUGCC</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>147575:147595</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART12</td><td>UCCUGUGGUGUUUGGUGUGGUUU</td><td>23</td><td>11</td><td>147936:147958</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART13</td><td>UGUAACUUGCCAGGGACGGCUGA</td><td>23</td><td>&ensp;1</td><td>148563:148585</td></tr><tr><td>miR-BART14</td><td>UACCCUACGCUGCCGAUUUACA</td><td>22</td><td>&ensp;2</td><td>148744:148765</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Sequence variation surrounding the recovered EBV miRNAs is indicated by parentheses surrounding the variable nucleotides. miRNAs derived from a single primary miRNA stem-loop precursor are indicated by a 5p (5&prime; arm) or 3p (3&prime; arm) suffix.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap><p>The previous report on EBV miRNAs by Pfeffer et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>] cloned several copies of three other EBV miRNAs derived from a second, distinct miRNA cluster adjacent to the <italic>BHRF1</italic> gene. Specifically, these workers cloned miR-BHRF1–1 twice, miR-BHRF1–2 fifty times and miR-BHRF1–3 twenty-three times. Using PCR analysis, we confirmed that the <italic>BHRF1</italic> gene was intact in latently EBV-infected BC-1 cells (unpublished data), and the reason for our inability to clone any of the three previously reported EBV BHRF1 miRNAs was therefore unclear. To address this issue, we analyzed the expression of a selection of EBV miRNAs and mRNAs in the PEL cell line BC-1; in the wild-type EBV-infected BL cell lines Raji, MUTU, Jijoye, and Namalwa; in the EBV strain B95–8-infected BL cell line BL41/95 (used as a source of EBV miRNAs by Pfeffer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>]); in the LCL IM-9; in the NPC cell line C666–1; and finally in the NPC tumor C15, which is passaged as a xenograft in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b019">19</xref>]. BCBL-1, a PEL cell line not infected by EBV, was used as a negative control. This analysis included several BL cell lines that have been extensively passed in culture—i.e., Raji, Jijoye, Namalwa, and MUTU III—all of which represent EBV stage III latency. We also analyzed one BL cell line, MUTU I, that is an early passage variant of MUTU III and has been shown to be in stage I latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b020">20</xref>]. All these EBV-infected cell lines contain type I EBV except for Jijoye, which is infected with a type II EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>As noted above, miRNA analysis using RNA derived from the latently EBV-infected cell line BC-1 resulted in the cloning of the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>A but failed to identify EBV miRNAs derived from the distinct <italic>BHRF1</italic> cluster. Consistent with this cloning result, we observed readily detectable levels of the mature miR-BART1-3p, miR-BART3-3p, miR-BART5, miR-BART7, miR-BART10, and miR-BART12 miRNAs upon Northern analysis of RNA prepared from BC-1 cells, but failed to detect either miR-BHRF1–1 or miR-BHRF1–2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 2).

Specifically, very high-level expression of all EBV miRNAs derived from the <italic>BART</italic> miRNA cluster was observed in the NPC samples without detectable expression of the miRNAs encoded within the <italic>BHRF1</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). Conversely, the IM9 LCL and the BL cell lines Raji, MUTU III, and Namalwa had readily detectable expression of miR-BHRF1–1 and miR-BHRF1–2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 3, 7, 9, and 11), yet very low to almost undetectable expression of the viral <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs, even though the <italic>BART</italic> gene is intact in all these cell lines. A different miRNA expression pattern was noted in MUTU I, which did not express readily detectable levels of any viral miRNA, and in Jijoye, which expressed high levels of <italic>miR-BHRF1–2,</italic> no detectable <italic>miR-BHRF1–1,</italic> and intermediate levels of all the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>To extend this analysis to additional EBV-infected cell lines, we also performed Northern analyses for miR-BART1-3p, miR-BART3-3p, miR-BART7, miR-BART10, miR-BHRF1–1, and BHRF1–2, using RNA derived from the BL cell lines P3HR-1 and Daudi, the LCLs HMy2.CIR and HCC1739 BL, and the PEL cell line JSC-1. P3HR-1 is a subclone of Jijoye containing an EBV that has lost a segment of the viral genome including the <italic>EBNA-2</italic> gene but that should retain all the EBV miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b022">22</xref>]. While HMy2.CIR is a spontaneous LCL, HCC1739 BL is derived by infection of B cells with the EBV B95–8 laboratory strain, which as noted above is deleted for miR-BART5 through miR-BART14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Analysis of the viral miRNA expression pattern showed that JSC-1 is similar to BC-1, the other PEL cell line tested, in that it expressed the viral BART miRNAs but did not express detectable BHRF1 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The LCLs HMy2.CIR and HCC1739 BL were similar to the IM-9 LCL in that they both expressed readily detectable levels of miR-BHRF1–1 and BHRF1–2 but little or no viral BART miRNAs. Daudi was similar to the other BL cell lines examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>, in that it expressed readily detectable levels of the viral BHRF1–1 and BHRF1–2 miRNAs but only low levels of the five BART miRNAs analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Finally, P3HR-1, a BL cell line that derives from Jiyoye, shared with Jijoye the property of expressing high levels of miR-BHRF1–2 but no detectable miR-BHRF1–1. However, P3HR-1 differed from Jijoye, and was more similar to the other BL cell lines examined, in that the various viral BART miRNAs were not detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>The discordant expression of the miR-BHRF1–1 and miR-BHRF1–2 miRNAs observed in Jijoye and its subclone P3HR-1 was unexpected, given that these miRNAs are located close to each another and show concordant expression in all other EBV-infected cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and S2). We therefore used PCR to clone and sequence a 418-bp region flanking the <italic>miR-BHRF1–1</italic> sequence from the EBV genome present in Jijoye cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). This analysis revealed only two single nucleotide sequence differences, neither of which was located in the mature <italic>miR-BHRF1–1</italic> sequence. However, one sequence change maps to the <italic>miR-BHRF1–1</italic> passenger strand and this G to C change is predicted to disrupt a G–C basepair located within the primary miRNA hairpin, thereby generating a 4-nt symmetrical bulge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B). Inspection of a wide range of vertebrate miRNA precursors failed to identify any stems containing two symmetrical 4-nt bulges within the miRNA duplex region (unpublished data), and we therefore hypothesize that this 1-nt mutation is disrupting the appropriate processing of the primary <italic>miR-BHRF1–1</italic> transcript in Jijoye and P3HR-1 cells. Whether this mutation is restricted to the EBV isolate present in Jijoye and P3HR-1, or is a general characteristic of EBV type II strains, remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Transcriptional Origin of the EBV miRNAs</title><p>The 14 EBV miRNAs encoded within the viral <italic>BART</italic> gene cluster are all located within the predicted introns of this alternatively spliced gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), and one would therefore predict that the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs would be coordinately expressed and that the total level of expression of the various alternatively spliced <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs would correlate with the expression level of the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs. The miRNA expression data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and S2 strongly support the hypothesis that the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs are indeed coordinately expressed. To examine whether <italic>BART</italic> miRNA expression indeed correlates with <italic>BART</italic> mRNA expression, we performed a Northern analysis using the same RNA samples analyzed for miRNA expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A but this time using a probe specific for the invariant exon 7 found in all spliced <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, we indeed observed high-level expression of <italic>BART</italic> mRNA in the NPC cell samples (lanes 6 and 7), an intermediate level of <italic>BART</italic> mRNA expression in Jijoye and BC-1 cells (lanes 2 and 11), and low to almost undetectable expression in the other BL cell lines and in the LCL tested. The <italic>BART</italic> gene has previously been shown to give rise to several alternatively spliced mRNA variants, with a major species at approximately 4.8 kb and a more minor species at approximately 6.2 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b025">25</xref>], and the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>B are consistent with this prediction. These data also confirm the previous observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b027">27</xref>] that <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs are expressed at high levels in NPC cells and at much lower levels in most BL cells, with Jijoye an obvious exception. More important, these data largely confirm the hypothesis that the <italic>BART</italic> mRNA expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) is predictive of the expression pattern of the entire EBV <italic>BART</italic> miRNA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). We do not currently understand why the BART miRNA expression levels seen in BC-1 and Jijoye are comparable, yet Jijoye expresses a significantly higher level of BART mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">2</xref>B), although we hypothesize that this may reflect less efficient miRNA processing in Jijoye cells.</p><p>Previously, Pfeffer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>], who first identified the EBV <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster, proposed that these three miRNAs might be coexpressed with mRNAs encoding the <italic>BHRF1</italic> gene product. However, this appears unlikely as <italic>BHRF1</italic> is thought to be first expressed early during lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b029">29</xref>], and the hairpin precursor for miR-BHRF1–1 appears to be located 5′ to the cap site for the promoter that drives lytic <italic>BHRF1</italic> mRNA expression. An alternative hypothesis is that the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster is actually processed out of the BamHIH intron present in the very long pre-mRNAs that initiate at the viral Cp and Wp promoters and, when processed, are translated to give rise to the viral EBNA proteins. Transcription from Cp and Wp is characteristic of type III EBV latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b030">30</xref>], while EBV-infected cells that are undergoing stage I or II latency instead use the Qp promoter to express EBNA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b032">32</xref>]. Because the Qp promoter differs from the Cp and Wp promoters in being located between the <italic>BHRF1</italic> and <italic>EBNA1</italic> open reading frames, viral pre-mRNAs initiating at Qp could not be processed to yield any of the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNAs.</p><p>To test whether expression of the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster indeed correlates with the activity of the Cp and/or Wp promoters, we performed RT-PCR using previously described primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b033">33</xref>] specific for RNAs initiating at Wp, Cp, or Qp. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, we saw readily detectable levels of transcription from Cp in Namalwa, Jijoye and MUTU III, with weaker activity in Raji and MUTU I. The Wp promoter was active in Jijoye, Namalwa, IM-9, and BL41/95. Finally the Qp promoter, which is characteristic of stage I or stage II latency, was active in MUTU I, C666–1, C15, BC-1 and, less strongly, in Raji. Therefore, these data show that the cells predicted to be undergoing EBV stage III latency (Raji, BL41/95, IM-9, MUTU III, Jijoye, and Namalwa) all utilize the Cp and/or Wp promoters, while the cells predicted to be undergoing stage I or stage II latency (MUTU I, C666–1, BC-1, and C15) all utilize the Qp promoter to express EBNA1. The observation that Raji is weakly positive for Qp function, while MUTU I is weakly positive for Cp function, likely implies that these BL cell lines are actually a mixture of cells in stage I and stage III latency. Nevertheless, the overall conclusion from these data is that expression of the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster indeed correlates with usage of the Cp and Wp promoters and is therefore likely to be characteristic of stage III latency.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Expression of Several EBV miRNAs Increases during Lytic Replication</title><p>In the case of the miRNAs encoded by the γ herpesvirus KSHV, induction of lytic viral replication fails to significantly enhance the level of expression of ten out of the 11 viral miRNAs, all of which are expressed in latently infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>]. The exception to this generalization, miR-K10, appears to be expressed at higher levels during lytic replication because, unlike the other ten viral miRNAs, it lies within a viral transcription unit that is activated by lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>]. Consideration of the genomic location of the viral EBV miRNAs suggests, in contrast, that expression of many of these viral miRNAs is likely to increase after induction of lytic replication. miR-BHRF1–2 and BHRF1–3 lie within the 3′ untranslated region of the early lytic mRNA encoding BHRF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b029">29</xref>] and therefore would be expected to be induced during lytic EBV replication. Moreover, recent data demonstrate that BART mRNA expression is also significantly induced during lytic replication of EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b034">34</xref>], so one would predict that BART miRNA expression would increase in parallel. It is less clear whether lytic replication would be likely to result in increased miR-BHRF1–1 expression, as this viral miRNA appears to lie 5′ to the BHRF1 mRNA transcription start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>Examination of the level of lytic EBV replication induced by treatment of the various LCL, BL, and PEL cell lines analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and S2 with TPA and n-butyrate revealed that Daudi and MUTU I were the most responsive. Specifically, using immunofluorescence to detect the EBV Zebra protein, which is activated very early during lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b029">29</xref>], we observed that TPA/n-butyrate treatment increased the number of Zebra-positive Daudi cells from approximately 1.7% to 19.4%, while the number of Zebra-positive MUTU I cells increased from less than 0.5% to approximately 54% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Analysis of viral miRNA expression revealed that induction of EBV lytic replication resulted in a clear increase in the expression of the viral miRNAs miR-BART1-3p, miR-BART3-3p, miR-BART7, miR-BART10-3p, and miR-BHRF1–2, but did not significantly enhance expression of miR-BHRF1–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the case of miR-BHRF1–2, this increase was particularly apparent when the level of expression of the pre-miRNA was analyzed, although an increase in the mature miR-BHRF1–2 level was also detected in MUTU I cells. Together these data therefore argue that the expression level of several EBV miRNAs increases significantly during lytic replication, with the apparent exception of miR-BHRF1–1.</p><fig id="ppat-0020023-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020023.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Induction of Lytic Replication Can Increase EBV miRNA Expression</title><p>The EBV-infected B-cell lines Daudi and MUTU I were either cultured under normal conditions or treated with TPA (30 ng/ml) and n-butyrate (300 ng/ml) for 48 h.

On the other hand, the herpesviruses that have been analyzed, i.e., EBV, KSHV, cytomegalovirus, and mouse herpesvirus 68, are either from different herpesvirus genera or, in the case of mouse herpesvirus 68, derived from a very different species.</p><p>We reasoned that if virally encoded miRNAs are indeed important for aspects of the virus replication cycle in vivo, then viral miRNAs should tend to be conserved during viral evolution. To address the validity of this hypothesis, we sought to identify miRNAs encoded by rhesus lymphocryptovirus (rLCV), a member of the lymphocryptovirus genus of which EBV is the human representative. The primate LCV genus includes members that infect every primate species examined so far, and the sequence divergence between different primate LCVs predicts a phylogenetic tree that parallels that of the primate species themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b016">16</xref>].

Sequence analysis of rLCV shows that this primate virus has approximately 65% overall nucleotide homology with EBV, with structural proteins being highly conserved, while genes expressed during EBV latent infection are much less well conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b015">15</xref>].

Conversely, if this conservation is functionally important, then closely adjacent sequences might show more extensive sequence divergence. To examine this issue, the sequences of the predicted primary miRNA stem-loop precursors for each of these EBV and rLCV miRNAs were compared. Previously, we and others have reported that these RNA stem-loops consist of at least three distinct domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b037">37</xref>]. The central domain consists of the approximately 22-nt mature miRNA sequence, shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g006">Figure 6</xref>, and its complement, termed the miRNA passenger strand, that forms part of the approximately 22-bp miRNA duplex intermediate, but is generally not incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex, or is incorporated less efficiently. The terminal loop is a large (≥10-nt) unstructured loop (although RNA folding programs may predict a smaller loop adjacent to a short, rather unstable stem) whose sequence appears irrelevant as long as it maintains an open structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b037">37</xref>]. Finally, the base of the stem consists of an approximately 8- to 10-bp helical extension of the miRNA duplex that is critical for efficient nuclear processing of the primary miRNA precursor. Because this sequence does not form part of the miRNA duplex intermediate per se, its sequence is not important in and of itself, although maintenance of a helical structure is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b038">38</xref>]. The approximately 80-nt primary miRNA stem-loop structure is in turn flanked by largely nonstructured RNA sequences that are not believed to play a sequence-specific role in miRNA processing and expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b039">39</xref>]. Therefore, we would predict that, even though the mature viral miRNA sequences are well conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the flanking basal stem and, particularly, the terminal loop and adjacent single-stranded RNA regions should show significantly more sequence variation.</p><fig id="ppat-0020023-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020023.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Sequence Comparison of the Predicted Primary miRNA Stem-Loop Structures of the Indicated rLCV and EBV miRNAs</title><p>The stem-loop shown is the rLCV sequence, with the changes observed in EBV indicated.

As may be observed, there is indeed better conservation of the mature miRNA sequence when compared to the flanking basal stem and, particularly, the terminal loop. Overall, the sequences of the six miRNA duplex intermediates are approximately 89% conserved between EBV and rLCV, the basal stems are approximately 84% conserved, the terminal loops are approximately 62% conserved, while the adjacent unstructured flanking sequences, extending approximately 90 nt each side of the predicted miRNA stem-loops shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g006">Figure 6</xref>, are approximately 68% conserved. This compares to an overall sequence conservation of 65% between the EBV and rLCV genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b015">15</xref>]. The statistical significance of the observed conservation in EBV and rLCV of the pre-miRNA stem extension, the miRNA duplex, and the pre-miRNA terminal loop sequence was analyzed using the paired t-test with the null hypothesis being that these sequences are not more highly conserved than the 5′ and 3′ 100-nt segments flanking each viral pre-miRNA. In fact, both the miRNA duplex regions and the miRNA extended stem regions were found to be significantly more highly conserved from EBV to rLCV than either the terminal loop or the flanking sequences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Additional computer analysis of the rLCV genome sequence revealed that this virus contains a sequence that is identical at 18 out of 23 positions to the mature EBV miR-BHRF1–2 miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, this sequence is found at the same relative genomic position in rLCV, i.e., immediately 3′ to the BHRF1 open reading frame. This candidate rLCV miRNA, termed miR-rL1-2, also forms part of a predicted RNA hairpin that is closely similar to the RNA hairpin predicted for the primary EBV miR-BHRF1–2 precursor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020023-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). To test whether this candidate rLCV miRNA is expressed in latently infected cells, we performed a Northern analysis that confirmed the expression of miR-rL1-2 in rLCV-infected 211–98 and 309–98 cells but not in control, uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It therefore appears that rLCV encodes an additional miRNA, missed during cDNA cloning, that is closely similar to EBV miR-BHRF1–2. This brings the number of distinct miRNAs conserved during the evolutionary divergence of EBV and rLCV to at least seven.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Lymphocryptovirus miRNA Conservation and Function</title><p>Recent reports have documented the existence of miRNAs encoded within the genomes of several herpesviruses, including five miRNAs in EBV, all of which are expressed in latently infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b013">13</xref>]. This report extends these earlier data by (1) documenting that wild-type EBV actually encodes at least 17 miRNAs, ( 2) showing that these viral miRNAs are derived from two distinct miRNA clusters that are differentially expressed in latently EBV-infected cells, and (3) showing that several EBV miRNAs have been conserved across ≥13 million years of primate lymphocryptovirus evolution.</p><p>Analysis of EBV miRNA expression has demonstrated the existence of a three-miRNA cluster located adjacent to the viral <italic>BHRF1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>] and a second cluster of 14 miRNAs located within the viral <italic>BART</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020023-t001">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, analysis of viral miRNA expression in rLCV latently infected cells identified at least 16 distinct miRNAs, two encoded adjacent to the rLCV <italic>BHRF1</italic> homolog and the other 14 in the rLCV <italic>BART</italic> gene locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020023-t002">Table 2</xref>). Of these, nine miRNAs, derived from seven different precursor stem-loops, have been largely conserved across the &gt;13 million years of evolution that separate these two primate lymphocryptoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g005">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b016">16</xref>]. This conservation is clearly statistically significant, and a comparison of the similarity of closely adjacent viral sequences—e.g., those that form the terminal loop of the viral primary miRNA precursors—reveals far less sequence conservation than seen in the viral miRNAs themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g006">Figure 6</xref>). So, what does this evolutionary conservation tell us about EBV miRNA function?</p><p>One possibility raised by this high level of sequence conservation is that some of these viral miRNAs are actually acting as small interfering RNAs—i.e., inducing target mRNA degradation—rather than as canonical vertebrate miRNAs—i.e., blocking target mRNA translation. Translational inhibition requires only fairly modest miRNA sequence complementarity to the mRNA target, most notably in the approximately 8-nt “seed” region located near the 5′ end of the miRNA, while mRNA cleavage requires extensive homology to the target mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b044">44</xref>]. The almost complete conservation of several of these viral miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g005">Figure 5</xref>) therefore could argue for a degradative mechanism. On the other hand, it is also possible that each of these conserved viral miRNAs is partially complementary to multiple cellular mRNAs and that the observed sequence conservation is mandated by a requirement to maintain significant complementarity to several targets that are subject to translational inhibition.</p><p>The extensive conservation of these viral miRNAs suggests that their mRNA targets are likely to be predominantly cellular rather than viral. EBV and rLCV show significant sequence divergence, especially in the viral latent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b015">15</xref>], and one would predict that a putative viral mRNA target sequence and its viral miRNA complement would coevolve over time. This is indeed what is seen in the flanking basal stems of the viral miRNA precursors, which show more sequence divergence between EBV and rLCV than do the miRNAs themselves, yet retain their ability to form an RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, if the target mRNA is cellular, and hence fairly invariant, then very little viral miRNA sequence change could be tolerated. Moreover, with the exception of miR-BART2, which is antisense to the EBV BALF5 mRNA and has been proposed to regulate BALF5 expression by a degradative RNA interference mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>], none of the EBV miRNAs are, in fact, located opposite known viral exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Rather, they are found opposite introns or noncoding sequences.</p><p>While seven of the lymphocryptovirus miRNAs are largely conserved in terms of both sequence and relative genomic position in EBV and rLCV, the remaining approximately nine miRNAs are not. We believe this is not surprising given the short approximately 22-nt size of mature miRNAs, and given that some sequence differences with the mRNA target can be tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b036">36</xref>]. As a result, one might expect potentially very rapid evolution of viral miRNAs, resulting in the selection of novel cellular mRNA targets whose down-regulation is advantageous to the virus. More surprising, in our view, is the fact that several of the lymphocryptovirus miRNAs have been conserved across millions of virus replication cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Differential Expression of EBV miRNAs</title><p>In addition to the functional implications suggested by the observed evolutionary conservation of these lymphocryptovirus miRNAs, our analyses also provide insights into the regulation of EBV miRNA expression. The initial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>] identifying the miR-BHRF1–1, BHRF1–2, and BHRF1–3 miRNAs, as well as miR-BART1 and miR-BART2, suggested that these two <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs were derived from introns in the <italic>BART</italic> mRNA, as indeed confirmed in this report, while the three miRNAs that form the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster were proposed to be derived from the mRNA encoding the <italic>BHRF1</italic> open reading frame, which is actually thought to be expressed early during replicative infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b029">29</xref>]. However, our data show that the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster is only detectably expressed in BL and LCL samples (Raji, BL41/95, IM-9, MUTU III, Jijoye, and Namalwa) that use the Wp and Cp promoters characteristic of type III latency to express the <italic>EBNA</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, no miRNAs derived from the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster were detected in samples that were derived from cells in type II EBV latency (the NPCs C666–1 and C15 and the PEL cell lines BC-1 and JSC-1) or type I latency (MUTU I) that use the Qp promoter to express EBNA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b032">32</xref>]. This correlation of <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster expression and Cp/Wp promoter usage suggests that the <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNAs are actually processed out of the BamHI H intron present in the very long EBNA pre-mRNAs that are transcribed from the Cp and Wp promoters and not, at least during latent infection, from mRNAs encoding <italic>BHRF1.</italic> We therefore propose that expression of the EBV <italic>BHRF1</italic> miRNA cluster is likely to be a characteristic of type III EBV latency. Nevertheless, the observation that miR-BHRF1–2 expression is markedly enhanced after induction of lytic replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the BHRF1 mRNAs induced early during productive infection can also function as a pri-miRNA precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>]. The observation that the expression of most EBV miRNAs is enhanced during lytic replication distinguishes EBV from KSHV, where the majority of the viral miRNAs show at most a modest increase in expression after induction of lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we have documented the existence of at least 12 novel EBV miRNAs all of which, like the previously reported miR-BART1 and miR-BART2, are located in the predicted introns of the alternatively spliced mRNAs derived from the EBV <italic>BART</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020023-t001">Table 1</xref>). We present data arguing that the various <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs are therefore coordinately expressed and that their abundance is largely predicted by the level of expression of the <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020023-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs were first identified and shown to be readily detectable in NPC samples but not in EBV-infected lymphoid cell lines, although subsequent studies identified the spliced <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs by RT-PCR in most samples analyzed [18,23,26,27,45,46]. However, the data presented here reveal that the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs are only readily detected in samples that express significant levels of <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs as determined by Northern blotting, including the C666 and C15 NPC samples and B cell lines BC-1 and Jijoye. We note, however, that low levels of the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs can be detected in essentially all the cell lines analyzed upon prolonged exposure (unpublished data and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b011">11</xref>]). Therefore, while the NPC samples clearly express higher levels of both the <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs and miRNAs than any of the EBV-infected B cells, EBV-infected B cells do appear to express low but detectable levels of both. Overall, these data therefore indicate that expression of the <italic>BART</italic> miRNA cluster is also characteristic of latent EBV infection and suggest that the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs, like the <italic>BART</italic> mRNAs, may be preferentially expressed in EBV-infected epithelial cells and hence may play a particularly important role during EBV infection of this differentiated cell type. In this context, it is interesting to note that while the EBV <italic>BART</italic> gene is clearly dispensable for transformation of B lymphocytes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b047">47</xref>], a region of the EBV genome that includes the <italic>BART</italic> gene, but excludes known EBV transforming genes such as <italic>LMP1,</italic> has been reported to immortalize primate epithelial cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b048">48</xref>]. It remains to be established whether the miRNAs encoded within the <italic>BART</italic> miRNAs cluster play a role in epithelial cell transformation by EBV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture, tumors, and RNA preparation.</title><p>The various PEL, BL, and LCL cell lines analyzed in this report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b050">50</xref>] were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% or 20% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Where necessary, TPA (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States; final concentration 30 ng/ml) and n-butyrate (300 ng/ml) were added for 48 h prior to RNA preparation. The C15 nasopharyngeal tumor was passaged in nude mice as a xenograft as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b019">19</xref>].

The 211–98 cells latently coinfected with rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) were maintained similarly and were used as a source of RNA for miRNA cloning. All total RNA samples were prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsblad, California, United States). No difference in the pattern of rLCV miRNA expression was detected in 211–98 cells coinfected with RRV, and no RRV-specific miRNAs were cloned from the coinfected cells (unpublished data). The cloning and sequencing of cDNA copies of small RNA species derived from BC-1 cells dually infected with KSHV and EBV, or from 211–98 cells dually infected with rLCV and RRV, was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020023-b051">51</xref>] using 750 μg of total RNA as starting material.
