Here, we determined how Vpu expression affects the subcellular distribution of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag proteins in human cells where Vpu is, or is not, required for efficient particle release. In HeLa cells, where Vpu enhances HIV-1 and MLV release approximately 10-fold, concentrations of HIV-1 Gag and MLV Gag fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) were initially detected at the plasma membrane, but then accumulated over time in early and late endosomes. Endosomal accumulation of Gag-CFP was prevented by Vpu expression and, importantly, inhibition of plasma membrane to early endosome transport by dominant negative mutants of Rab5a, dynamin, and EPS-15. Additionally, accumulation of both HIV and MLV Gag in endosomes required a functional late-budding domain. In human HOS cells, where HIV-1 and MLV release was efficient even in the absence of Vpu, Gag proteins were localized predominantly at the plasma membrane, irrespective of Vpu expression or manipulation of endocytic transport. While these data indicated that Vpu inhibits nascent virion endocytosis, Vpu did not affect transferrin endocytosis. Moreover, inhibition of endocytosis did not restore Vpu-defective HIV-1 release in HeLa cells, but instead resulted in accumulation of mature virions that could be released from the cell surface by protease treatment. Thus, these findings suggest that a specific activity that is present in HeLa cells, but not in HOS cells, and is counteracted by Vpu, traps assembled retrovirus particles at the cell surface. This entrapment leads to subsequent endocytosis by a Rab5a- and clathrin-dependent mechanism and intracellular sequestration of virions in endosomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1 encodes a small protein, termed HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu), which enhances the release of retroviral particles from certain cell types. This study shows that Vpu affects the distribution of the major retroviral structural protein within cells. In particular, the viral structural protein was initially detected at the exterior surface of the cell, where it assembles into particles, but over time was internalized. Vpu prevented internalization, and instead induced the release of particles from the cell surface. The effect of Vpu was specific for retroviral particles and simply blocking particle internalization did not obviate the requirement for Vpu. These experiments strongly suggest that Vpu counteracts a cellular activity that traps newly formed retrovirus particles at the cell surface. Surface entrapment of retroviral particles ultimately leads to their internalization to the cell interior, rather than their release to infect new cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the NIH (R0150111 and R0152774).

Vpu appears to have two major functions in HIV-1 replication (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b008">8</xref>]). First, it associates with newly synthesized CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum and recruits βTrCP/SCF ubiquitin ligases to mediate its degradation by proteosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b009">9</xref>], perhaps following dislocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b010">10</xref>]. This is thought to prevent CD4–Env binding in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b012">12</xref>], and thereby to facilitate proper Env assembly into virions, and perhaps prevent retention of virions at the cell surface via CD4–Env interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b015">15</xref>]. Second, Vpu expression enhances HIV-1 particle release by an additional, ill-defined, Env- and CD4-independent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b019">19</xref>]. Vpu-defective HIV-1 mutants replicate poorly in CD4+ T cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>], and recent studies in macaques have demonstrated that Vpu-defective simian–HIV strains are attenuated in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b020">20</xref>].</p><p>Structurally, Vpu consists of two major domains: an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain that anchors Vpu in cellular membranes and appears to form a cation channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b022">22</xref>], and a cytoplasmic tail consisting of two putative α-helices separated by a conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b023">23</xref>]. Both the cytoplasmic tail and the TM domain are required for CD4 down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b024">24</xref>]. Conversely, while truncations of the cytoplasmic tail are reported to have little effect on the ability of Vpu to enhance virion release, mutations that truncate the TM domain or change blocks of conserved residues within it impede this second function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>Early studies showed that expression of Vpu could enhance the release of diverse retroviral particles from human cells, irrespective of whether those retroviruses normally encode a Vpu protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>]. More recent studies strongly suggest that Vpu, as well as the Vpu-like activity of HIV-2 envelope proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b027">27</xref>], acts by overcoming a novel species-specific host restriction to HIV release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b029">29</xref>]. Specifically, while efficient HIV-1 particle release from African green monkey (AGM) COS cells exhibits no requirement for Vpu expression, release from heterokaryons formed between COS and various human cell lines appears Vpu-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b028">28</xref>]. Additionally, the Env protein of HIV-2, previously reported to harbor a Vpu-like activity in that it stimulates virion release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b027">27</xref>], also enhances HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) release from simian–human cell heterokaryons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b029">29</xref>]. The host factors responsible for this apparently dominant restriction and the method by which they act to inhibit release are undefined at present. Nonetheless, several electron microscopy studies showed that Vpu-defective HIV-1 accumulates as morphologically mature virion particles at the plasma membrane (PM) and in intracellular vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>]. In addition, one previous study suggested that Vpu changes the subcellular localization of HIV-1 Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b030">30</xref>].</p><p>The matrix domain of HIV-1 Gag is largely responsible for targeting to the cellular membrane, but conflicting studies have postulated a role for HIV-1 matrix in Vpu-mediated particle release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b032">32</xref>]. Nonetheless, the appearance of HIV-1 Vpu-defective particles in internal membrane-bound compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>] is suggestive of a Gag targeting defect, or a defect in the endosome-to-PM trafficking pathway that has recently been proposed to be important for retrovirus assembly and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b041">41</xref>]. Importantly, the HIV-1 morphogenesis defect associated with Vpu deficiency is distinct from that associated with p6 mutations that abolish late-budding domain (L-domain) function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b042">42</xref>]. In the latter case, class E vacuolar protein-sorting (VPS) factor recruitment is defective, resulting in maintenance of continuity between viral and cellular membrane and accumulation of incompletely formed immature virions at the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b044">44</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we determined the effects of Vpu on HIV-1 and MLV Gag distribution in cells where Vpu is required, or not required, for efficient virion release. Notably, we find that Vpu can cause a dramatic change in HIV-1 and MLV Gag localization in cells where it enhances virus release. Specifically, Vpu prevented accumulation of HIV-1 and MLV Gag in endosomal compartments. Interestingly, inhibition of endocytosis or early endosome function similarly prevented the intracellular accumulation of Gag in endosomes, but did not rescue Vpu-defective virus release. Moreover, Gag localization to endosomes required that it be competent to complete late-budding steps. Thus, we propose that Vpu overcomes a host activity that prevents the release of completely formed virions from the cell surface, and that this host cell–specific activity leads to subsequent virion endocytosis and sequestration in endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Vpu-Mediated Enhancement of Retroviral Release Is Human Cell Type–Dependent</title><p>To permit studies of the effects of Vpu on retrovirus assembly and release, we first sought to identify human cell lines in which particle release was Vpu-dependent and -independent. Cells were transfected with an HIV-1 proviral plasmid (NL4.3), a Vpu-defective derivative (NL4.3delVpu), or an MLV Gag-Pol–expression plasmid along with plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP, as a control), Vpu, or an inactive Vpu mutant in which the TM domain was replaced by that of human CD8 (V8). As expected, Western blot and infectious virion titration assays showed that HIV-1 release from human HeLa cells was clearly responsive to Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, the levels of extracellular virions, as detected by an anti-p24CA antibody, from cells transfected with the NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmid, were significantly reduced as compared to those released from wild-type proviral plasmid-transfected cells, despite equivalent levels of precursor p55Gag levels in the cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Expression of Vpu in <italic>trans</italic> rescued Vpu-defective HIV-1 release to levels similar to those of the wild-type virus, whereas the mutant Vpu, V8, was inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><fig id="ppat-0020039-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020039.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cell Type–Dependent Effects of Vpu on Retroviral Particle Release</title><p>Human HeLa and HOS cells, together with AGM Vero cells, were transfected with HIV-1 NL4.3 and NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids, or an MLV Gag-Pol–expression vector, as indicated, in the presence of plasmids expressing either no Vpu (none), codon-optimized Vpu, or an inactive Vpu mutant containing a CD8 TM domain (V8).</p><p>(A and B) Western blot analyses of cell and virion lysates, probed using antibodies to HIV-1 (A) or MLV CA (B).</p><p>(C and D) Results of chemiluminsecent β-galactosidase assays following inoculation of HeLa-TZM indicator cells with supernatants derived from HeLa, HOS, or Vero cells transfected with NL4.3 (white bars) or NL4.3delVpu (black bars) proviral plasmids (C) or plasmids expressing MLV Gag-Pol, a packageable HIV-1 Tat–expression vector, and VSV-G (D).

In the case of MLV, it was notable that more mature processed capsid (CA, p30) accumulated in HeLa cells in the absence of Vpu than in its presence, despite unchanged levels of Pr65 Gag precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, Vpu expression apparently reduced HeLa cell–associated mature MLV CA and redistributed it to the culture supernatant. Infectious virion–release assays also showed that Vpu expression enhanced NL4.3delVpu release from HeLa cells by approximately 10-fold, as assayed by β-galactosidase activity in TZM indicator target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). A similar increase in yield of infectious MLV vector particles (pseudotyped with VSV-G and carrying an HIV-1 Tat–expressing vector) was obtained in response to Vpu expression in virus-producing HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>In contrast, the effect of Vpu on HIV-1 or MLV release was very different in HOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">1</xref>D). Specifically, NL4.3 and NL4.3delVpu were released equivalently from HOS cells, and there was no discernable effect of Vpu expression in <italic>trans</italic> on the level of HIV-1 or MLV particle release, measured using Western blot or infectious particle assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">1</xref>D). Curiously, when compared to HeLa cells, HOS cell lysates appeared to contain proportionally less HIV-1 CA compared to p55Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Moreover, only low levels of mature or immature MLV Gag were detected in HOS cell lysates, despite reasonably abundant particle yield from culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These data suggested that mature HIV-1 and MLV particle release is somewhat more efficient from HOS cells than from HeLa cells. Finally, as a control, AGM Vero cells were also tested, and these results were consistent with previous studies that HIV-1 release from AGM cells is unresponsive to Vpu expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g001">1</xref>D). Taken together, these results show that the ability of Vpu to enhance retroviral release is not only dependent on host-cell species, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b028">28</xref>], but is also human cell type–dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>HIV-1 and MLV Gag Accumulate in Endosomal Compartments in HeLa Cells but Not in HOS Cells, and This Accumulation Is Prevented by Vpu</title><p>Having identified human cell types (HeLa and HOS) in which Vpu expression differentially affected retroviral particle release, we next examined whether HIV-1 and MLV Gag proteins displayed any differences in distribution in HeLa and HOS cells. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 or MLV Gag-CFP, then fixed and observed by deconvolution microscopy. Initially, observation was done using cells fixed at 18 h after transfection, and we found that HIV-1 and MLV Gag-CFP could exhibit three distinct patterns of localization in HeLa cells. First, a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed primarily in cells expressing apparently lower levels of Gag-CFP (unpublished data). Alternatively, in cells expressing apparently higher levels of Gag-CFP, the fluorescent signal could be observed to be concentrated primarily either at the PM or in intracellular accumulations. Mixed distributions could also be observed and examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. In contrast, Gag-CFP only rarely exhibited discrete intracellular accumulations in HOS cells, with most cells exhibiting only PM-associated accumulation or low-level diffuse fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). By simply counting the number of Gag-CFP–positive cells on the basis of whether CFP accumulated only at the PM or at both the PM and intracellular compartments, we found that for both HIV-1 and MLV Gag-CFP, the majority of HeLa cells (~70%) exhibited clear intracellular accumulations of Gag-CFP, as well as PM fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), while less than 5% of HOS cells exhibited intracellular accumulations of Gag-CFP.</p><fig id="ppat-0020039-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020039.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Expression of Vpu Prevents Intracellular Accumulation of Retroviral Gag-CFP Fusion Proteins in HeLa Cells</title><p>Cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors, fixed 18 h after transfection, and observed by deconvolution microscopy.</p><p>(A and B) Localization of HIV-1 Gag-CFP or MLV Gag-CFP in HeLa cells (A) or HOS cells (B) in the absence of Vpu.

In other words, in cells that require Vpu for efficient particle release, Gag molecules might be inappropriately targeted to endosomal compartments or retarded during transit through endosomal compartments. The likely consequence of such a scenario would be a failure or a delay in accumulation of Gag at the PM. To examine the kinetics of Gag accumulation at intracellular versus PM sites, we fixed HeLa cells at various times after transfection with an HIV-1 Gag-CFP–expression plasmid and counted the number of transfected cells that exhibited diffuse, PM, or internal Gag accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Surprisingly, visible accumulation of Gag-CFP at the PM significantly preceded visible accumulation at intracellular sites. Indeed, at early time points (&lt;12 h after transfection) cells exhibiting Gag-CFP accumulations exclusively at the PM predominated and increased over time. However, at later time points (&gt;12 h after transfection), the fraction of cells with significant intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations, in addition to PM fluorescence, increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Indeed, these cells eventually predominated and, by 16–18 h after transfection, an apparent steady state was achieved, with approximately 70% of the transfected cells containing primarily intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations. In marked contrast, co-expression of Vpu with Gag-CFP prevented the accrual of cells containing intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations, and cells exhibiting PM fluorescence exclusively increased over time to represent 60–70% of the total number of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

Conversely, Vpu expression prevented endosomal localization and preserved the early, primarily PM, distribution of HIV-1 Gag-CFP. This result indicated that Vpu is not required for PM targeting of Gag and suggested the possibility that intracellular accumulations of Gag-CFP might arise via endocytosis of Gag molecules or nascent virion particles that are retained on the PM of HeLa cells in the absence of Vpu. To test this idea, HeLa cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP in the presence of dominant inhibitors of endocytosis. Thereafter, cells were examined at 18 h after transfection, at which time intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations would predominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g004">4</xref>).

However, in this case, while the proportion of HeLa cells that exhibited intracellular HIV-1 Gag-CFP accumulation remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), the vast majority of intracellular HIV-1 Gag-CFP co-localized with CherryFP-Rab5a(Q79L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This result indicates that Rab5a(Q79L) can trap HIV-1 Gag-CFP in an aberrant early endosome compartment, and presumably prevent further transit to CD63+ late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In some cases, these swollen endosomes could be resolved as Rab5a-bound structures containing distinct Gag-CFP accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, far-right panel). Importantly, the wild-type form of Rab5a had no effect on the localization of Gag-CFP in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and neither wild-type nor mutant Rab5a proteins had any effect on Gag-CFP localization in HOS cells. Indeed, Gag-CFP accumulations in HOS cells remained robustly at the PM despite any of the aforementioned manipulations of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g005">5</xref>C). Thus, the effect of Vpu expression on HIV-1 Gag localization in HeLa cells can be recapitulated by factors that inhibit endocytosis, and this suggests that Vpu blocks a cellular activity that ultimately results in the endocytosis of Gag molecules or virions.</p><p>To verify that the aforementioned effects were not an artifact of the use of Gag-GFP fusion proteins, we repeated several experiments using full-length or Vpu-defective HIV-1 proviral plasmids, coupled with Gag detection by immunofluorescence. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, immunofluorescent detection of Gag revealed that it accumulated primarily at the PM of HeLa cells when expressed in the context of an intact proviral plasmid, but was also observed in intracellular compartments when a Vpu-defective proviral plasmid was used. Conversely, Gag accumulations were exclusively at the PM of HOS cells, even when expressed in the absence of Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Furthermore, Rab5a(S34N) prevented detectable intracellular accumulation of intracellular Gag in HeLa cells, while Rab5a(Q79L) showed significant co-localization with Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).

Conversely, a mutant MLV Gag-CFP protein, in which the PPPY L-domain was replaced by the PTAP motif from HIV-1, behaved like wild-type MLV Gag-CFP and localized to internal structures in the absence of Vpu, but was exclusively PM-associated when Vpu was co-expressed (unpublished data). Thus, for both MLV and HIV-1, internalization requires that Gag contains functional L-domain sequences, and either PTAP or PPPY motifs can mediate this effect. This finding suggests that the endocytosis of nascent virions that can occur in the absence of Vpu requires that virion and cell membranes should be discontinuous, or that L-domains recruit factors required for Gag or virion endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Mature, Vpu-Defective Virion Particles Are Tethered to the Surface of HeLa Cells by Protease-Sensitive Factor(s)</title><p>Since the aforementioned experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g010">10</xref>) suggested that the Vpu defect imposes a block to virion release that is subsequent to the action of L-domains, we reasoned that particle endocytosis was likely a downstream consequence of the failed release of fully formed virions from the PM. Implicit in this scenario is some form of post-budding adhesion of nascent virions to the surface of the HeLa cells from which they are derived. To test this notion, HeLa cells were transfected with NL4.3 or NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids, and the level of particles that were either constitutively released, or were released only following treatment with a protease (subtilisin) was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">Figure 11</xref>). As expected, NL4.3 virions were constitutively released more efficiently than NL4.3delVpu virions. Indeed, far fewer NL4.3 virions remained associated with HeLa cells (in a form that could be released by subtilisin treatment), than the number that were constitutively released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">Figure 11</xref>A).</p><fig id="ppat-0020039-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020039.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Absence of Vpu Results in Cell-Surface Entrapment of Mature Virions</title><p>Subtilisin-induced release of mature, Vpu-defective HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells.

Cells and supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection and analyzed directly (no treatment), while cells in replicate wells were either treated with 1 mg/ml subtilisin (+ subtilisin) or a buffer control (+ buffer) for 15 min at 37 °C. Virions released by buffer or subtilisin and corresponding cell lysates were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti p24CA antibody as before.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020039.g011" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>In contrast, a significant proportion (at least half) of the virions generated by NL4.3delVpu-transfected HeLa cells were not constitutively released, but could be released following subtilisin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). Thus, the absence of Vpu resulted in a loss of extracellular virion production in favor of an increase in a mature virion population, containing fully processed CA, which could be released from cells by subtilisin. The number of Vpu-defective virions that were released from HeLa cells by susbtilisin treatment was increased when cells co-expressed Rab5a(S34N) to inhibit endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). Indeed, in this case, the quantity of virions that were released by subtilisin significantly exceeded the quantity that were constitutively released, and actually approached the levels that were constitutively released by the Vpu-competent provirus-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">Figure 11</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">11</xref>B).

In the case of this L-domain mutant, virions are known to remain immature and accumulate at the PM, tethered by a membrane that is contiguous with that of the host cell. Importantly, subtilisin treatment did not increase the release of NL4.3 (PTAP<sup>−</sup>) virons, irrespective of Rab5(S34N) co-expression. This finding indicates that subtilisin treatment does not compromise the integrity of the PM and that Vpu-defective virions differ from late-budding domain mutant virions in that the former are tethered to the PM by one or more protease-sensitive factor(s), and not by continuity between the virion envelope and the PM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although Vpu can strongly induce retrovirus particle release from cells, we, and others, have not observed co-localization, or any other form of interaction, between retroviral Gag proteins and Vpu (unpublished data). Vpu can localize to intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, and endosomal structures, as well as the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b056">56</xref>]. While ER localization is required for CD4 down-regulation, and may be required for enhancement of virus release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b057">57</xref>], the site at which events relevant to particle release occur is not unambiguously established. A recent study that showed that expression of DN Rab11a or MyosinVb can inhibit HIV-1 release in the presence of Vpu suggests that a functioning recycling endosomal compartment is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b056">56</xref>]. Since Vpu localizes to sites distinct from those at which retroviral particles assemble, and from which they are released, it seems likely that the virus-release function of Vpu results from indirect effects on the host cell, rather than on specific components of the virion. Our findings are consistent with this notion, particularly when viewed alongside a recent study that strongly suggested that Vpu overcomes a host cell–specific restriction to retrovirus particle release in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b028">28</xref>].</p><p>The effect of Vpu on virus release varied significantly among human cell lines, and HeLa cells proved particularly useful for studying this property, because Vpu stimulated both HIV-1 and MLV release by about 10- to 20-fold from these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>]. Conversely, human HOS cells served as a useful control, because efficient HIV-1 and MLV release was completely independent of Vpu, as was previously shown to be the case in AGM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b028">28</xref>]. By observing the localization of Gag-CFP fusion proteins as well as authentic Gag proteins in HeLa and HOS cells, we found that Vpu prevented the accumulation of HIV-1 and MLV Gag in HeLa cell endosomal compartments, and instead constrained Gag accumulation to the PM. In the absence of Vpu, accumulation of Gag at intracellular sites required a functional L-domain and was blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (DN dynamin and EPS-15) or the function of early endosomes (DN Rab5a). Our observations strongly suggest that accumulations of retroviral Gag proteins and virion particles in endosomes, observed here and previously in the context of defective Vpu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b030">30</xref>], arise from endocytosis of completely assembled virions from the PM. Consistent with this notion, an aberrant early endosomal compartment that is induced and marked by Rab5a(Q79L) appeared to contain the majority of intracellular HIV-1 Gag in the absence of Vpu.</p><p>It is important to note that while these experiments document a PM-to-endosome trafficking route for two retroviral Gag proteins, they do not address how Gag first achieves PM localization. Indeed, several groups have suggested that retroviral Gag molecules and/or completely assembled particles traffic to the PM and/or leave the cell via an intermediate step that involves Gag localization and even particle formation in endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b040">40</xref>]. While the existence of a late endosome-to-PM trafficking route for HIV-1 particles or assembly intermediates has gained wide acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b058">58</xref>], the precise method by which Gag moves to the PM in non-macrophage cell types remains somewhat ambiguous. The findings reported herein highlight the need to distinguish between Gag molecules that are directly targeted to endosomal membranes and those that arrive in endosomes as a consequence of virion endocytosis from the PM. Given the dramatic effects of the host-cell type, the presence or absence of Vpu, and the effect of Gag expression level on steady-state Gag distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b060">60</xref>], it is perhaps unsurprising that there is wide discordance among studies that have determined this superficially simple parameter.</p><p>While Vpu appeared to prevent endocytosis of nascent retrovirus particles, it did not appear to inhibit endocytosis in a general sense, as judged by transferrin-uptake assays. Moreover, generalized inhibition of endocytosis prevented intracellular accumulation of HIV-1 and MLV Gag but could not substitute for Vpu function. Therefore, we propose that endocytosis of nascent virions is a downstream consequence of absent Vpu function, and that Vpu inhibits an activity that prevents the release of completely assembled virions from the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g012">Figure 12</xref>). While the nature of this putative host-restriction activity is unknown, its existence is the simplest explanation for our findings and is completely consistent with earlier studies on Vpu which showed that Vpu-defective HIV-1 particles accumulate at the cell surface as well as in intracellular vacuoles as mature virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>]. One possibility is that virions remain attached to cells via incorporation of cellular proteins with adhesive properties into the viral membrane. That mature, Vpu-defective, virions can be released from the cell surface by protease treatment, particularly when endocytosis is inhibited, is entirely consistent with this notion. Indeed, a variety of cell-surface proteins are well known to be incorporated into the HIV-1 virion membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b061">61</xref>]. This scenario has several conceptual attractions. First, an analogous situation exists in other virus families. Many viruses that bind to sialic acid molecules for cell entry require a neuraminidase enzyme to release nascent virions from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b062">62</xref>]. Second, Vpu is known to target two cell-surface receptors, CD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b008">8</xref>] and MHC class I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b063">63</xref>], for destruction by proteosomes. Thus, Vpu-mediated destruction of other specific cell-surface factors with adhesive properties could conceivably enhance virion release.</p><fig id="ppat-0020039-g012" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020039.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Model for the Role of Vpu in Retroviral Particle Release</title><p>Retroviral Gag molecules targeted to the PM (by unknown mechanisms) require the recruitment of class E VPS factors to enable budding of mature virions. At this point, nascent viral particles are subject to an unknown, subtilisin-sensitive, host-cell type-specific restriction (depicted as a question mark) that results in their retention at the cell surface. Subsequently, endocytosis by a dynamin-, EPS-15-, and Rab5a-dependent process result in intracellular accumulation in early/late endosomes, where they may be simply sequestered, or perhaps destroyed, in lysosomes. Vpu overcomes this restriction, leading to more efficient release of virions from the cell surface. In contrast, inhibition of endocytosis by DN mutants of dynamin, EPS-15, or Rab5a prevents the accumulation of virions in endosomes, but does not enhance virion release, suggesting Vpu inhibits a specific host-restriction activity, rather than imposing a generalized inhibition on endocytosis.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020039.g012" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Variations on this scenario are also possible. Because endosomal localization of Vpu-defective HIV-1 Gag and MLV exhibits a requirement for a functional L-domain, we currently favor the interpretation that discontinuity of virion and cell membrane is required for particle endocytosis. However, it is also possible that whatever restriction factors impose Vpu dependence and induce Gag endocytosis, they are themselves indirectly recruited by L-domains. Indeed, L-domain motifs are known to recruit ubiquitin ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b054">54</xref>] and/or class E VPS factors to sites of virus budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b064">64</xref>]. Since other class E VPS factors (for example Hrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b065">65</xref>] and AIP-1/ALIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b066">66</xref>]) are known to also regulate endocytic traffic, it is entirely plausible that Vpu may prevent the L-domain–dependent recruitment of endocytosis-inducing or virus release–inhibiting factors to sites of virion assembly. In our view, however, this model is less attractive, because it is more difficult (albeit not impossible) to reconcile with the observation that the Vpu defect induces accumulation of fully assembled mature virions at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020039-b018">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020039-g011">11</xref>) .</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented herein strongly suggest that that Vpu prevents entrapment of nascent retroviral particles at the cell surface and, as a consequence, subsequent transport into early and late endosomal compartments. The absence of a such a pathway in HOS cells, and the finding that generalized inhibition of endocytosis “corrects” Gag localization but does not enhance release, strongly suggests that specific host-cell factors that are targeted by Vpu, but otherwise prevent efficient release of widely divergent retroviruses from the PM, exist in some human cell types. Clearly, the identification of Vpu target factors that exhibit such properties will be required to definitively show whether or not such a model is correct.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and plasmids.</title><p>HeLa, HeLa-TZM, HOS, and Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin.
