The occurrence of arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers is largely confined to Third World countries with a limited medical infrastructure, and therefore live-attenuated vaccines have long been sought as a method of choice for prevention. Yet their rational design and engineering have been thwarted by technical limitations. In addition, viral genes had not been identified that are needed to cause disease but can be deleted or substituted to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, the prototype arenavirus, induces cell-mediated immunity against Lassa fever virus, but its safety for humans is unclear and untested. Using this virus model, we have developed the necessary methodology to efficiently modify arenavirus genomes and have exploited these techniques to identify an arenaviral Achilles' heel suitable for targeting in vaccine design. Reverse genetic exchange of the viral glycoprotein for foreign glycoproteins created attenuated vaccine strains that remained viable although unable to cause disease in infected mice. This phenotype remained stable even after extensive propagation in immunodeficient hosts. Nevertheless, the engineered viruses induced T cell–mediated immunity protecting against overwhelming systemic infection and severe liver disease upon wild-type virus challenge. Protection was established within 3 to 7 d after immunization and lasted for approximately 300 d. The identification of an arenaviral Achilles' heel demonstrates that the reverse genetic engineering of live-attenuated arenavirus vaccines is feasible. Moreover, our findings offer lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or other arenaviruses expressing foreign glycoproteins as promising live-attenuated arenavirus vaccine candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Arenaviruses such as Lassa fever virus (LFV) account for substantial mortality in endemic Third World countries and represent potential bioterrorist weapons. Live-attenuated vaccine strains would likely represent an optimal strategy for prevention, but their rational design and engineering have been thwarted by technical limitations. As an additional difficulty, arenaviruses have only four genes, all of which are needed for the infectious cycle. Unlike for other virus families, attempts at deleting a “virulence gene” would therefore interfere with the virus' viability and thereby with its immunogenicity. Using the prototype arenavirus as a model, the authors have developed the necessary tools to investigate an alternative strategy for tailoring of live-attenuated strains: Recombinants were engineered to express a foreign envelope gene instead of the natural one. Thereby, the virus was crippled but still viable. When testing such “envelope-exchange” viruses in a mouse model, they failed to cause disease. Nevertheless, they elicited rapid and long-lived immunity against overwhelming infection and lethal disease upon wild-type virus challenge. This delineates a novel general strategy for the reverse genetic engineering of live-attenuated arenavirus vaccines to be used in endemic areas or in case of a bioterrorist attack.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AB holds a fellowship of the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds.

The genome of these enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b001">1</xref>] consists of a small (S) and a large (L) segment, each of them expressing two viral genes in an ambisense coding strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The S segment codes for the viral nucleoprotein (NP, approximately 63 kDa) and the glycoprotein (GP). The GP, encoded in genome polarity, is synthesized as a precursor protein GP-C (75 kDa) and posttranslational processing generates GP1/GP2 complexes forming club-shaped projections on mature infectious virions. NP, encoded in antigenome polarity, is the most abundant viral protein and encapsidates viral genomes and antigenomic replicative intermediates. The L gene segment codes for a 200-kDa L protein with characteristic hallmarks of all RNA dependent RNA polymerases and for the small 11-kDa RING finger protein Z that functions as the viral matrix protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b002">2</xref>].</p><fig id="ppat-0020051-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020051.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Wild-Type and Recombinant Viruses Used in this Study</title><p>All LCM viruses used in this study contain an identical L segment encoding for the LCMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L ORF) and for the matrix protein Z.

In addition, arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever have recently obtained much attention due to their potential use in warfare and bioterrorism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b005">5</xref>]. Among them are Lassa fever virus (LFV), found in West Africa, and the South American viruses Junin, Machupo, and Guanarito that cause Argentine, Bolivian, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, respectively. LFV, with 100,000 to 300,000 estimated human infections and several thousand deaths, annually affects by far the largest number of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b003">3</xref>]. After its first description in the late 1960s, LF was thought of as a rare disease with high case-fatality rate that was transmitted by contact in hospital epidemics. This picture has changed dramatically since it has been found that in rural areas of West Africa, LFV accounted for approximately 10% of febrile illnesses and that seroprevalence reached locally up to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b003">3</xref>]. Moreover, human-to-human transmission in a more recent nosocomial outbreak could largely be accredited to poor medical practice including needle sharing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b006">6</xref>]. Together with the failure of LFV to spread outside the West African distribution of its rodent reservoir <italic>Mastomys,</italic> this indicated that the virus cannot efficiently sustain itself by human-to-human transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b003">3</xref>]. Increasing numbers of imported cases due to traveling, however, are reported from around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b008">8</xref>].</p><p>Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, represents the only currently available therapy for clinical application in LF but it appears to be of limited efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b009">9</xref>]. Hence, protective vaccines are needed, but the viral immunobiology has rendered their development a difficult undertaking. Immunization with inactivated virus has failed to induce neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) or to protect against LFV in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b010">10</xref>], and convalescent serum transfer rarely increased the survival rate of LFV-infected humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b011">11</xref>]. Accordingly, life-long protection against LFV in previously infected human subjects is commonly accredited to cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b013">13</xref>] and candidate vaccines should therefore aim at inducing long-lived T cell memory.</p><p>A variety of vector systems have been tested as potential vaccines for arenaviruses, among them DNA immunization and recombinant salmonella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b015">15</xref>]. Engineered vaccinia viruses expressing either the GP or NP of LFV have been shown to confer guinea pigs and nonhuman primates with cell-mediated immunity against lethal LFV challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b016">16</xref>]. Unfortunately, the safety profile of vaccinia virus and the high HIV prevalence rate in West Africa preclude the application of this vaccine where it would be most needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b013">13</xref>]. The protective capacity of alphavirus-based vectors has been demonstrated in guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b017">17</xref>], and very recently it was shown that a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing LFV-GP protected nonhuman primates against LF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b018">18</xref>]. In the latter two studies, challenge infections were invariably carried out 28 d after immunization. Thus the long-term protective capacity of these vectors may require additional testing, particularly for VSV that has served as a prototype model infection eliciting only short-lived T cell−mediated protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b019">19</xref>]. In case of a bioterrorist attack or for health care workers and military personnel transiently deployed to endemic areas, the longevity of protection may be of less importance. For the population of West Africa, however, this will be a key criterion because of the local cumulative lifetime risk of contracting LFV ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b003">3</xref>], see also above).</p><p>As an alternative to recombinant vector systems, heterologous Old World arenaviruses would likely represent very efficient LFV vaccines. Mopeia virus (MV) and LCMV, and recently also an LFV/MV reassortant, have been shown to protect against LF in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b021">21</xref>] and guinea pigs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b022">22</xref>]. In the latter model, adoptive transfer experiments could formally show that cross-protection was cell mediated. Cross-reactivity between LCMV and LFV has also been demonstrated at the level of T cell clones and single cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b024">24</xref>]. Moreover, the strategy of vaccinating with a closely related but less pathogenic virus (heterologous immunity) has a famous precedent in the eradication of smallpox by using vaccinia virus. Yet the safety profile of different LCMV and MV strains for humans remains unclear and untested. We therefore considered the possibility of using genetically engineered LCM viruses with a molecularly defined basis of attenuation as long-sought live-attenuated arenavirus vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>The arenavirus GP mediates receptor binding and cell entry, but additional roles in the viral life cycle including the efficient release of particles have recently been described (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b027">27</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b030">30</xref>]). GP1 represents the only target for virus neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>], and we have documented a critical role of the LCMV-GP in viral evasion from efficient nAb-mediated control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>]. Similar to LCMV in mice, human LFV infection elicits commonly only vastly delayed and relatively poorly nAb responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b032">32</xref>]. Accordingly, only the most potent convalescent sera confer passive protection against virus challenge, and prevention of lethal disease seems relatively virus isolate specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b032">32</xref>]. Thus, cell-mediated immunity is considered the mechanism of choice for vaccine candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b012">12</xref>]. α-Dystroglycan is the only characterized cellular arenavirus receptor, and the ability of certain LCMV isolates to cause overwhelming systemic infection in mice has been correlated with their high affinity binding to α-dystroglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b033">33</xref>]. Interestingly, also the GP of LFV exhibits high affinity for α-dystroglycan, lending support to speculations that GP-related properties could contribute to the viral phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b034">34</xref>]. Studies in guinea pigs and also in monkeys have shown that determinants on the L genome segment are primarily responsible for the viral ability to cause hemorrhagic fever and that determinants on the S segment of virulent viruses (e.g., LFV) were not sufficient for disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b035">35</xref>]. While addressing the contribution of GP to strain-specific differences in pathogenesis, a potential need for features that are common to all arenaviral GPs had not been addressed in these experiments. Thus, we hypothesized that the reverse genetic exchange of the LCMV-GP for a foreign surface determinant may attenuate the virus and thereby may offer a general strategy for the directed engineering of live-attenuated arenavirus vaccines.</p><p>We had previously reported on a recombinant LCM virus (rLCMV/INDG) expressing the surface GP of vesicular stomatitis virus serotype Indiana (INDG) instead of its own GP (schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g001">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>]). rLCMV/INDG exhibits attenuated growth in tissue culture ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>], see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and unlike for wild-type LCMV (LCMVwt), it elicits a rapid and protective neutralizing antibody response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>]. In the present report, we show that rLCMV/INDG has lost its pathogenic potential in mice but has retained the property of LCMVwt to induce long-lived protective CTL memory. Using newly developed techniques, we engineered two additional recombinant LCM viruses to formally accredit the attenuated phenotype of rLCMV/INDG to GP exchange and to reproduce our findings with a second attenuated virus. Our observations provide a strong rationale for testing LCMV or other arenaviruses with foreign GPs as promising live-attenuated vaccine candidates in nonhuman primate models of arenaviral diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Attenuation of rLCMV/INDG Prevents Lethal Disease in Infected Mice</title><p>Attenuated growth of rLCMV/INDG in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>] prompted us to study its fitness and pathogenicity in infected mice. We infected C57BL/6 mice intravenously (i.v.) with 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the LCMVwt strain Armstrong (LCMV-ARM) or with the same dose of rLCMV/INDG. Groups of mice were killed 2, 4, and 8 d later to determine virus titers in spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g002">2</xref>B and unpublished data). Following its typical kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b033">33</xref>], LCMV-ARM replicated to initially high titers in spleen and liver but was cleared to below detection limit within 6 to 8 d. In contrast, rLCMV/INDG infectivity was undetectable in all organs and at all time points tested. We therefore set out to study the pathogenic potential of rLCMV/INDG. In mice, all known LCMVwt strains including LCMV-ARM typically cause lethal lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) upon intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation. This immunopathologic disease is mediated by virus-specific cytotoxic T cells, whereas the viral infection per se is noncytolytic. Severe or fatal LCM is also a frequent complication in accidental infection of human adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b037">37</xref>]. Little is known about the capacity of different LCMVwt isolates to cause central nervous system disease in humans, but this potential side effect of live-attenuated vaccines should be excluded as far as possible. We therefore assessed the capacity of rLCMV/INDG to elicit lethal LCM after i.c. inoculation of C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t001">Table 1</xref>). Surprisingly, rLCMV/INDG-infected mice remained clinically healthy during the entire period of observation, while LCMV-ARM control infected mice exhibited signs of terminal LCM within 6 d of infection. Notably, mice that are tolerant to LCMV-GP due to transgenic expression of this protein in the thymus (DEE mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b038">38</xref>]) developed normal LCM after i.c. infection with LCMV-ARM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the failure of rLCMV/INDG to cause LCM was not due to the lack of the LCMV-GP as one of the main targets of CTL-mediated immunopathology. This indicated that GP exchange had largely abrogated the virus' pathogenic potential in mice.</p><fig id="ppat-0020051-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020051.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Attenuation of rLCMV/INDG Prevents Lethal Disease in Infected Mice</title><p>(A, B) C57BL/6 mice were infected i.v. with 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of either rLCMV/INDG or LCMV-ARM.

Here, we made analogous observations after i.c. infection with rLCMV/INDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). This was not surprising considering that most of the i.c. inoculum is rapidly drained to the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b039">39</xref>]. To test whether GP recombinant arenaviruses could be used as live-attenuated vaccines, we determined the protective capacity and longevity of T cell memory in rLCMV/INDG-immune C57BL/6 mice. Lethal i.c. challenge with LCMV-ARM was performed at various time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t002">Table 2</xref>). This setting ruled out any contribution of serum antibodies to challenge virus control because LCMV-ARM and rLCMV/INDG are exclusively neutralized by either LCMV-GP1− or INDG-specific antibodies, respectively ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>]; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-st001">Table S1</xref>) and therefore represent distinct serotypes. In three independent experiments, a total of 21 of 24 animals immunized with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLCMV/INDG i.v. and all 16 mice immunized with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of rLCMV/INDG i.c. survived a lethal i.c. challenge with LCMV-ARM at time points ranging from 30 to 321 d after immunization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t002">Table 2</xref>). This protective effect of rLCMV/INDG immunization correlated with the rapid expansion of virus-specific memory CTL and with efficient clearance of LCMV-ARM from the central nervous system before infection became too widespread (for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). A lack of protection in a challenge experiment carried out at days 345 and 386 suggested, however, that protection might not last infinitely.</p><p>In contrast to the needs in endemic areas (longevity of protection), a vaccine for health care workers or military personnel deployed to such places should primarily provide rapid protection. The same criterion would also apply in case of a bioterrorist attack. Thus, it was important to find that rLCMV/INDG immunization was protective even when administered no earlier than 7 d prior to i.c. challenge with LCMV-ARM and that protection was even seen in two of five animals challenged on day 3 after immunization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>rLCMV/INDG Immunization Confers Rapid and Long-Lived Cell-Mediated Protection against Overwhelming Systemic Infection and Liver Disease</title><p>To confer protection against arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers, vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity should prevent overwhelming viremia, the primary predictor for the outcome of human LFV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b009">9</xref>]. Moreover, efficient virus control should avoid the disturbance of clinical parameters predictive for an unfavorable outcome, among them elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, which is used to monitor human LF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b009">9</xref>]. In mice, high-dose infection with the viscerotropic WE strain of LCMV results in prolonged viremia, severe AST elevation, and occasionally a fatal outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b041">41</xref>]. We therefore tested whether immunization with rLCMV/INDG could protect mice against high-dose LCMV-WE challenge. Considering the similarly efficient immune protection conferred by i.c. or i.v. infection with rLCMV/INDG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t002">Table 2</xref>), mice that had originally been inoculated via either route were used likewise for the subsequent sets of experiments. The peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pool of mice immunized 109 and 314 d previously by i.v. or i.c. inoculation of rLCMV/INDG, respectively, contained approximately 0.2% to 0.5% NP396-specific memory CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Upon high-dose (2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU) LCMV-WE i.v. infection (sharing the NP396 epitope with rLCMV/INDG), these cells expanded to approximately 10% by day 4 and to approximately 30% to 50% by day 7 after challenge. In naïve control animals, only approximately 1% to 2% NP396-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected no earlier than 7 d after challenge. At this time point, mice without immunization exhibited high virus load in blood, spleen, and liver, whereas the virus had been cleared to below detectable levels in 109-d rLCMV/INDG i.v. immune animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g003">3</xref>D). Even in mice that had been infected with rLCMV/INDG i.c. 314 d prior to challenge, virus load was either considerably reduced or undetectable. This was reflected in serum AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of immune mice that remained in the normal range, whereas the corresponding values of nonimmune control mice reflected serious disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g003">3</xref>F). Histopathologic analysis of the liver 7 d after challenge infection documented clearance of viral antigen at the cellular level and revealed considerably milder mononuclear infiltrations in the liver of rLCMV/INDG-immune mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The reduction in hepatocellular damage was also reflected in a lower histopathological hepatitis score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g003">Figure 3</xref>G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b042">42</xref>]). In the i.c. challenge model with LCMV-ARM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t002">Table 2</xref>), we had found that rLCMV/INDG-induced protection was rapidly established. Analogous observations were made when mice were challenged with a high dose of LCMV-WE i.v. either 3 or 6 d after immunization (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).

It remained, however, to be formally demonstrated that GP exchange was indeed the main reason for the attenuated phenotype of rLCMV/INDG. Randomly accumulated mutations in the virus' RNA genome could also have accounted for a loss of fitness. Moreover, the partial cDNA origin of rLCMV/INDG per se could have caused some attenuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b043">43</xref>]. This prompted us to determine whether the phenotype of rLCMV/INDG was reproducible with another GP exchange virus. For this, we generated a recombinant LCMV (rLCMV/NJG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g001">Figure 1</xref>) expressing the GP of the New Jersey (NJ) serotype of VSV instead of INDG or LCMV-GP. rLCMV/INDG had so far represented the only genetically engineered recombinant arenavirus, and the protocol we had used for its generation had been extremely labor intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>]. For the recovery of rLCMV/NJG, we therefore developed a new experimental protocol that was, like the original protocol, based on the reassortment of viral genome segments (schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). We transfected BHK-21 cells with a polymerase I (pol-I)−driven vector [pS<sub>NJ</sub>(−), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>B] for intracellular expression of an NJG recombinant LCMV S segment RNA in combination with polymerase II (pol-II)-driven plasmids for coexpression of the minimal viral transacting factors NP and L (pC-NP, pC-L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>]). Forty-eight hours later when recombinant S segment ribonucleoproteins had formed intracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>], the transfected cells were infected with rLCMV/INDG helper virus, providing an L genome segment for reassortment. The appearance of rLCMV/NJG reassortant virus in the supernatant and the subsequent selection process were monitored by immunofluorescence. For this, fresh BHK-21 cells were incubated with culture supernatant sampled at different time points, and the rLCMV/INDG- or rLCMV/NJG-specific infectivity contained therein was detected 24 h later in a semiquantitative manner by INDG- or NJG-specific immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Supernatant collected 24 h after helper virus infection contained already a low but detectable fraction of rLCMV/NJG reassortant virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, P0/24h). To select against the dominant population of rLCMV/INDG helper virus, the mixed virus population was propagated for two consecutive passages (P1 and P2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">4</xref>C) on fresh BHK-21 cells in the presence of INDG-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (VI-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>]). This procedure resulted in a substantial enrichment of rLCMV/NJG and simultaneously in the loss of rLCMV/INDG to below detectable levels by immunofluorescence. The so-obtained population of rLCMV/NJG was subject to a single round of limiting dilution, and the absence of rLCMV/INDG helper virus in rLCMV/NJG (&lt;1 PFU in 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLCMV/NJG) was verified by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).</p><p>Characterization of rLCMV/NJG in cell culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-st001">Table S1</xref>) showed that this virus was neutralized by VSV-NJ−specific, but not by VSV-IND− or LCMV-ARM−specific, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), demonstrating that receptor binding and cell fusion of rLCMV/NJG were mediated by the foreign NJG protein as expected. Moreover, we observed that rLCMV/NJG infection elicited a very rapid and potent serotype-specific nAb response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) as previously reported for rLCMV/INDG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>]. Most important, however, rLCMV/NJG and rLCMV/INDG exhibited similarly attenuated growth in cell culture when compared to LCMV-ARM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

To determine the fitness of rLCMV-ARM* in vivo, we infected mice i.v. with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of either rLCMV-ARM* or LCMV-ARM and determined viral titers in the spleen 3, 6, and 9 d later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

In particular, viral variants of increased fitness and pathogenicity may be selected during persistent infection of immunocompromized vaccinees that continue to shed virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b045">45</xref>]. We therefore assessed how easily rLCMV/INDG could evolve into a virus that was pathogenic for mice. For this, we infected five either interferon type I receptor<sup>−/−</sup> RAG<sup>−/−</sup> double deficient mice (AR) or interferon type I receptor<sup>−/−</sup> interferon type II receptor<sup>−/−</sup> RAG<sup>−/−</sup> triple deficient mice (AGR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b046">46</xref>]) with rLCMV/INDG and kept them in three separate cages for 225 to 300 d (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t003">Table 3</xref>) to prevent virus transmission between mice. The combined genetic deficiencies of these animals allowed rLCMV/INDG to readily establish viremia and to replicate systemically (AB, DM, and DDP, unpublished data), which should facilitate the evolution of the viral quasi-species and the emergence of more pathogenic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b047">47</xref>]. Notably, rLCMV/INDG viremia in these mice did not cause clinically apparent disease, confirming our earlier observation that this virus is noncytolytic in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>], which may be of importance with regard to vaccine safety. To test for a clear increase in viral pathogenicity after 225 to 300 d of in vivo replication, we inoculated C57BL/6 mice i.c. with viremic serum or with undiluted supernatant from a single cell culture passage of blood-derived virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t003">Table 3</xref>). Mouse-passaged rLCMV/INDG preparations contained no more than approximately 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> PFU/ml infectious virus due to low level viremia even in AGR mice and relatively poor in vitro amplification of ex vivo isolated rLCMV/INDG (unpublished data). Accordingly, the i.c. inoculum that could be administered to C57BL/6 indicator mice was relatively low (&lt;50 PFU in 30 μl, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t003">Table 3</xref>). Still, all viral preparations tested elicited high frequencies of epitope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells indicative for a productive infection, but the infected animals remained clinically healthy. This failure of mouse-passaged rLCMV/INDG to induce disease could unlikely be attributed solely to dose limitations but suggested stable attenuation. Even an i.c. inoculum of a single PFU of LCMV-ARM is lethal in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b041">41</xref>], and analogous findings were made here with an i.c. inoculum of only 3 PFU of rLCMV-ARM* (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t003">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, the finding that only low amounts of virus were recovered from the serum of AR and AGR mice provided per se additional support for this notion. Nevertheless, additional testing will be needed to confirm and extend these findings, and a certain increase in fitness concomitant with prolonged or even repeated in vivo passage of rLCMV/INDG seems likely and cannot be excluded at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b047">47</xref>]. Similarly, limitations in the volume and hence in the amount of infectivity that could be administered i.c. have so far precluded the formal assessment of a 50% lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) for rLCMV/INDG, rLCMV/NJG, or any of the ex vivo isolated virus populations shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t003">Table 3</xref>. Considering, however, that even the administration of low doses (1 to 10 PFU) of rLCMV/INDG elicited considerable frequencies of antiviral CTL, whereas i.c. infections with up to 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLCMV/INDG failed to elicit clinical disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020051-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t003">3</xref>, and unpublished data), the safety margin for such a vaccine is likely to be broad, i.e., ≥100-fold the dose needed for vaccination. Even arenaviruses with foreign GPs are, however, unlikely to be considered for application in pregnant women or in newborns, owing to the teratogenic potential of their parent viruses. Also, we had previously reported that rLCMV/INDG persists in neonates, and it was therefore of concern that the virus might also persist in the central nervous system when administered in adult life. rLCMV/INDG was detectable in the meninges by immunohistochemistry around 4 d after i.c. inoculation of adult mice although at lower levels than LCMVwt. Yet, the virus was cleared to below detection levels of our RT-PCR assay within 2 wk, whereas it persisted in neonatally infected animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg008">Figure S8</xref> and unpublished data). Also, upon i.v. infection, viral RNA in the serum was detectable by RT-PCR on only day 4 but not on day 8 (unpublished data), alleviating potential concerns regarding the virus' ability to establish a persistent infection in adult immunocompetent individuals. It is clear, however, that arenaviruses with foreign GPs need to be investigated in much more detail, specifically also in nonhuman primate models, before projections on their use in the human population can be made.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The directed introduction of mutations in viral genes often results in a complete loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b048">48</xref>], abrogating the virus' viability and thereby also its immunogenicity. Conversely, even RNA viruses carrying multiple attenuating point mutations are prone to reversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b044">44</xref>]. Hence, the deletion of a dispensable nonstructural gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b049">49</xref>] or the substitution of a structural gene for a foreign protein like in the present report may provide an advantageous new strategy. Arenaviruses have only four known genes and hence the range of potential targets is limited. As supported by recent mutagenesis studies, major changes in the minimal viral transacting factors NP or L would unlikely be tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b048">48</xref>]. Z mutants with residual budding activity have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b002">2</xref>], and therefore the viral matrix protein may represent an attractive target for attenuating mutagenesis. Yet, the concerns related to the possibility of back mutation and phenotypic reversion would remain. In this respect, exchange of the arenavirus GP for foreign surface determinants like VSVG may be entirely different because the roles of LCMV-GP in the viral life cycle are multifaceted. Recent studies have shown that the signal peptide of LCMV-GP serves not only to target the nascent GPC polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum: It is apparently needed at multiple steps of GP biosynthesis and trafficking as well as for its functioning in the viral envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b029">29</xref>]. More important, the signal peptide is efficiently packaged in viral particles and is thought to contribute to the budding process by supporting membrane curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b027">27</xref>]. Highly specific functions are also located in the C-terminus of arenavirus GPs. A cluster of basic amino acid residues in the intracellular portion of LCMV-GP is supposed to mediate critical protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b030">30</xref>]. Such interplay includes with all likelihood the binding of GP to intracellular viral components and thereby either directly or indirectly with the ribonucleoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b050">50</xref>], allowing for the efficient recruitment of GP molecules into viral particles. The INDG or NJG proteins of the engineered viruses can apparently mediate receptor binding and cell fusion, whereas additional roles of LCMV-GP including those mentioned above are likely to remain without substitute. To recover these functions of LCMV-GP in the virus' life cycle, a foreign GP like INDG or NJG would need to undergo a major evolution, including de novo development of functional domains, e.g., those in the GP signal peptide and C-terminal portion but probably many more. These deficiencies may therefore provide the molecular basis for the relatively stable, attenuated phenotype observed in this study. Alternatively and not mutually exclusively, INDG- or NJG-mediated cell tropism in the infected central nervous system or the reported differences in the humoral and cellular immune response ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>], see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) or both could account for the lack of disease in rLCMV/INDG or rLCMV/NJG i.c. infected mice. Preliminary results support, however, the notion that the cell tropism of LCMV-ARM and of rLCMV/INDG in the acutely infected central nervous system are largely identical (DM and DDP, unpublished data). It rather appears that a lower viral burden in the rLCMV/INDG-infected central nervous system shifts virus-host balance in favor of the rLCMV/INDG-infected host (similarly to LCMV-ARM infection in immune mice, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Although control of rLCMV/INDG and rLCMV/NJG is unaffected in B cell–deficient mice ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>] and AB and DDP, unpublished data), the rapid and strong induction of nAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) is likely to contribute to the efficient elimination of these viruses. Increased susceptibility to the host's innate immune defense represents an alternative and not mutually exclusive explanation that is currently under investigation (AB, DM, and DDP, unpublished data).</p><p>A number of recombinant vector systems have been developed as potential LFV vaccines ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b018">18</xref>], see introduction section). The attenuated Junin virus variant Candid #1 is, however, the only arenavirus vaccine ever in clinical use. It has successfully been administered to agricultural workers at immediate risk of contracting Junin virus, the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b025">25</xref>]. Concerns about its phenotypic stability and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b026">26</xref>] render it, however, inappropriate for mass vaccinations. Accordingly, strategies like recombinant vector systems and DNA vaccination may be the methods of choice to protect entire populations at only low risk or at unpredictable risk (e.g., bioterrorist attacks), because these vaccination protocols can be tuned for an optimal safety profile. In highly affected populations (see above), efficacy and safety may be balanced differently. Moreover, logistic constraints in Third World countries where LFV and other arenaviruses are endemic will not allow for regular booster immunizations. Under such conditions, not only the efficacy but also the longevity of vaccine protection becomes a primary criterion that is commonly best fulfilled by live-attenuated vaccines. Hence the development of recombinant vaccine vectors but also of live-attenuated vaccines should be pursued both in parallel and as complementary strategies for different needs in different areas of the world.</p><p>For arenavirus family members other than LCMV, genetically engineered infectious viruses have not been reported so far. The approach outlined here and in recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b052">52</xref>] should be applicable to all other arenaviruses including the high-risk pathogens. Thereby, attenuated viruses could be tailored for the purpose of vaccination and, if needed, could be adapted upon testing in animal models including nonhuman primates. This should allow for the rationale optimization of an LFV vaccine strain to be used in endemic areas or in cases of imminent bioterrorist attacks. Based on the well-established phenomenon of heterologous cell-mediated immunity between different Old World arenaviruses ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b024">24</xref>], see introduction section), rLCMV/INDG and rLCMV/NJG themselves should also be considered for testing as LFV vaccines. Cell-mediated immunity to the viral NP is protective in the guinea pig model and, at a challenge dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU, protection was also observed in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b016">16</xref>]. This is a likely dose scenario for accidental exposure to persistently infected Mastomys urine (~10<sup>3</sup> PFU/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b053">53</xref>]). When a challenge dose of 10<sup>4</sup> PFU was given to primates, LFV-GP–specific T cell immunity seemed of superior protective capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b016">16</xref>]. These differences may be due to epitope dominance in the specific monkeys tested, something that is primarily related to the individual's MHC haplotype and less to the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b054">54</xref>]. In support of this notion, studies on human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity to LFV have documented strong NP, as well as GP, reactivity, and epitope-specific responses were found to correlate with the individual's MHC haplotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b056">56</xref>]. Moreover, immune responses to subdominant viral epitopes can also be protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b057">57</xref>]. Thus, arenaviruses with foreign GPs inducing potent cell-mediated immunity against NP, but not GP, and depending on the haplotype, potentially also against Z and L, should in principle have the capacity to protect. In any case, however, GP-specific immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b023">23</xref>] would be beneficial, also with regard to a potential additive effect of GP-specific neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b011">11</xref>]. As an alternative attractive possibility, rLCMV/INDG or rLCMV/NJG or both in a sequential order (see later) could therefore be used to prevent potential side effects of a subsequent immunization with wild-type arenaviruses like LCMV, MV, or reassortants that are known to confer efficient long-term protection against LF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b022">22</xref>].

As a further analogy to LCMV infection of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b036">36</xref>], LFV in humans and nonhuman primates seems primarily controlled by cellular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b022">22</xref>] rather than humoral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b012">12</xref>] immunity, and hence a vaccine should induce long-lived memory CTLs. We cannot exclude, however, that mechanisms of viral interference, either directly or via the activation of innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b061">61</xref>], may have contributed to the protective effects observed very early after vaccination, i.e., on day 3 (compare <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020051-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the ability of rLCMV/INDG and rLCMV/NJG to elicit long-lived cell-mediated immunity have not yet been elucidated. It seems likely, though, that their noncytolytic behavior facilitates prolonged antigen presentation by infected dendritic cells, similar to the human yellow fever vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b062">62</xref>]. Still, immune protection could likely be optimized by prime-boost regimens. After immunization with an engineered virus like rLCMV/INDG, however, the induction of nAbs to the respective GP ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b031">31</xref>], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020051-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) would likely interfere with efficient boosting. The sequential application of different serotypes like rLCMV/INDG and rLCMV/NJG should circumvent this problem, and VSV-GPs offer excellent tools for this purpose, also because the vast majority of the human population lacks preexisting humoral immunity to VSV. In rural areas where logistical constraints represent a major limitation, recombinant expression of a viral GP from an unrelated human pathogen would offer the additional advantage of simultaneously protecting not only against arenaviral disease but also against an unrelated third party virus with similar distribution (e.g., LFV and yellow fever virus in the case of West Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020051-b013">13</xref>]).</p><p>Taken together, the experiments presented herein demonstrate that the reverse genetic engineering of stably attenuated live arenavirus vaccines is feasible.
