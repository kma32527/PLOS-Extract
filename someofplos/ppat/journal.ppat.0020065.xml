Although all age groups are susceptible, it is most severe in infants too young to be protected by currently available vaccines. To induce strong protective immunity in neonates, we have developed BPZE1, a live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bordetella pertussis</named-content> strain to be given as a single-dose nasal vaccine in early life. BPZE1 was developed by the genetic inactivation or removal of three major toxins. In mice, BPZE1 was highly attenuated, yet able to colonize the respiratory tract and to induce strong protective immunity after a single nasal administration. Protection against <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> was comparable to that induced by two injections of acellular vaccine (aPV) in adult mice, but was significantly better than two administrations of aPV in infant mice. Moreover, BPZE1 protected against <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bordetella parapertussis</named-content> infection, whereas aPV did not.

A new strategy to induce strong protective immunity in neonates is to mimic as closely as possible natural infection without inducing the disease, by the use of a live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> strain to be given as a single-dose nasal vaccine.

The success of these vaccines has led to the opinion that the disease is essentially under control, although worldwide 200,000 to 400,000 pertussis-linked deaths are still recorded annually, and the disease still ranks sixth among the causes of mortality due to infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b001">1</xref>]. Although mostly prevalent in developing countries, the disease is also re-emerging in the developed world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b003">3</xref>], including the United States, where the incidence has increased nearly 10-fold over the last 20 y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b004">4</xref>]. Unexpectedly, the epidemiology of pertussis has changed in countries with high vaccine coverage, where cases of adolescent and adult pertussis are increasingly frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b005">5</xref>]. This is probably due to progressive waning of vaccine-mediated immunity during adolescence. Often atypical and therefore difficult to diagnose, pertussis is generally not life-threatening in adults and in many cases remains unnoticed. However, infected adults constitute an important reservoir for transmission of the disease to very young children, too young to be fully vaccinated, and therefore at risk to develop severe disease associated with high mortality rates.</p><p>Pertussis vaccination usually begins at 2 mo of age, and optimal protection requires at least three immunizations. Generally, the three doses are given at 1- to 2-mo intervals, implying that optimal protection is only achieved at the age of 6 mo. To reduce the incidence of pertussis in the very young and most vulnerable age groups, early immunization, possibly at birth, would thus be highly desirable. However, numerous studies in humans and in animal models have suggested that the neonatal immune system is too immature to effectively induce vaccine-mediated protective immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b007">7</xref>]. The IFN-γ production especially, which is indicative of a Th1 response that is essential to the development of protective immunity to pertussis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b008">8</xref>], appears to be significantly reduced in human newborns, compared to older children or adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b009">9</xref>]. This is also reflected by the fact that significant amounts of antigen-specific IFN-γ are only produced after several months (≥6 mo) in children vaccinated with pertussis vaccines, especially with acellular vaccines (aPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b010">10</xref>].</p><p>Natural infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bordetella pertussis</named-content> has long been considered to induce strong and long-lasting immunity that wanes later than vaccine-induced immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b011">11</xref>]. Furthermore, infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> induces measurable antigen-specific Th1-type immune responses even in very young children (as young as 1 mo of age) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b012">12</xref>]. These observations suggest that live vaccines applicable by the nasal route, in order to mimic as closely as possible natural infection, may be attractive alternatives over the currently available vaccines.</p><p>In this report, we describe the development of such a live vaccine candidate through genetic attenuation of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> to diminish pathogenicity while maintaining the ability to colonize and induce protective immunity. This vaccine candidate was found to induce protection in infant mice after a single intranasal administration that is superior to the protection provided by the current aPV. In addition, it provided protection against infection with <italic>Bordetella parapertussis,</italic> which was not seen after vaccination with aPV.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> BPZE1</title><p>Recent advances in the understanding of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> virulence at the molecular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b013">13</xref>] have allowed us to rationally design a strategy for attenuation by removing or altering genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of whooping cough.

TCT is a breakdown product of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, which generally internalize it into the cytosol by the AmpG transporter protein to be re-utilized during cell wall biosynthesis. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> AmpG is inefficient in the internalization of peptidoglycan breakdown products.

However, it is also one of the major protective antigens, which has prompted us to replace the natural <italic>ptx</italic> genes by a mutated version coding for an enzymatically inactive toxin. This was achieved by replacing Arg-9 by Lys, and Glu-129 by Gly in S1, two key residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis, respectively. Allelic exchange was used to first delete the <italic>ptx</italic> operon, and then to insert the mutated version. The presence of the relevant toxin analogs in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> culture supernatants was detected by immunoblot analysis, although the mutant strain consistently produced slightly lower levels of anti-PTX antibody reactive material than the parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020065-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Finally, allelic exchange was used to remove the <italic>dnt</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020065-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

The fact that natural <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> infection, even very early in life, is able to induce a strong and long-lasting Th1 response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b012">12</xref>] prompted us to develop a live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> vaccine strain to be given by the nasal route as an alternative over the currently available vaccines.</p><p>On the basis of experimental infections of primates, Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b026">26</xref>] in 1962 had already come to the conclusion that ultimate protection against whooping cough probably best follows a live <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> inoculation. In veterinary medicine, attenuated <italic>Bordetella</italic> strains have been used to vaccinate against bordetellosis in dogs and piglets. A live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bordetella bronchiseptica</named-content> strain has been shown to provide strong protection against kennel cough in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b027">27</xref>] after nasal administration. This protection was seen as early as 48 h after vaccination. Intranasal vaccination with live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> has also been shown to protect against atrophic rhinitis in 2-d-old piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b028">28</xref>], indicating that in a live attenuated form, <italic>Bordetella</italic> vaccines can be highly active in newborn animals.</p><p>Previous attempts to genetically attenuate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> as a live vaccine candidate have met with rather limited success. Based on a strategy used for the successful attenuation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> vaccine strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b029">29</xref>], Roberts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b030">30</xref>] have deleted the <italic>aroA</italic> gene of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content>. The <italic>aroA</italic> mutant was indeed highly attenuated, but it had also lost its capacity to colonize the respiratory tract of the intranasally vaccinated animals, and induced protective immunity only after repeated administrations of high doses. We took advantage of the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> virulence and developed the highly attenuated strain BPZE1. This strain contains genetic alterations leading to the absence or inactivation of three major toxins, PTX, TCT, and DNT. In contrast to the <italic>aroA</italic> mutant, this strain was able to colonize the mouse respiratory tract and to provide full protection after a single intranasal administration. The protection in adult mice was indistinguishable from that induced by two administrations of 1/5 of a human dose of aPV. An important difference, however, was seen in infant mice, in which a single administration of BPZE1 fully protected, whereas aPV only offered partial protection. In the context of the difficulties to induce protection in infants early in life with the currently available vaccines, these results provide hope for the development of novel vaccination strategies that may be used in the very young children, possibly at birth. In addition, BPZE1 protected against <italic>B. parapertussis,</italic> whereas aPV did not. Therefore the use of BPZE1 should also have an impact on the incidence of whooping cough caused by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. parapertussis</named-content> in infants, provided that potential programmatic obstacles to replace the current vaccines with a live attenuated strain can be overcome.</p><p>Although the recent replacement of first generation, whole-cell vaccines by new aPV in many countries has significantly reduced the systemic adverse reactions observed with whole-cell vaccines, it has not abolished the need for repeated vaccination to achieve protection. This makes it unlikely to obtain protection in very young children (&lt;6 mo) that present the highest risk to develop severe disease. In addition, the wide-spread use of aPV has revealed new, unforeseen problems. Repeated administration of aPV may cause extensive swelling at the site of injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b031">31</xref>]. In approximately 5% of the cases, this swelling involves almost the entire limb and lasts for more than a week. Although the mechanism of this swelling has not been characterized yet, it has been proposed to be due to an Arthus hypersensitivity reaction caused by high antibody levels induced by the primary immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b032">32</xref>]. However, it could also be related to the Th2 skewing of the immune response, as, compared to whole-cell vaccines, aPV administration induces more Th2-type cytokines in vaccinated children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b010">10</xref>] and causes a delay in the Th1 development (F. Mascart, M. Hainaut, A. Peltier, V. Verscheure, J. Levy, and C. Locht, unpublished data). Delayed maturation of Th1 function has been associated with a risk for atopy in genetically pre-disposed individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b033">33</xref>]. The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Compared to aPV, the immune response to BPZE1 administration is less biased towards the Th2 arm, and since BPZE1 is administered mucosally, no swelling reaction can occur.</p><p>The use of live attenuated bacteria as vaccines raises the issue of their biosafety. As such, they fall under the directives and guidelines for genetically modified organisms susceptible to be released into the environment. These guidelines and directives describe several objectives that have to be met, including hazard identification and environmental risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b034">34</xref>]. Potential pathogenicity needs to be carefully considered, especially in immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with HIV. The natural biology of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> is particularly interesting in that regard. Although pertussis in HIV-infected subjects has been described occasionally, it is rather rare in AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b035">35</xref>]. In its genetically attenuated form, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> would therefore not be expected to cause major problems in HIV-infected children, especially if severe AIDS is an exclusion criterion, as it is for many vaccines. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> colonization is strictly limited to the respiratory epithelium, without extrapulmonary dissemination of the bacteria, which naturally excludes systemic bacteremia of the BPZE1 vaccine strain. If nevertheless unforeseeable safety problems occurred, the vaccine strain can be eliminated early following vaccination by the use of macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycine, to which essentially all <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> isolates are sensitive.</p><p>A further concern, as for any live vaccine, is the potential release of the vaccine strain into the environment, and the consequences of such a release. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> is predominantly a human pathogen, and there is no known animal vector or reservoir. Moreover, unlike <italic>B. bronchiseptica,</italic> survival of wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> in the environment is extremely limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b036">36</xref>]. Pertussis is usually spread by coughing individuals, and there appears to be limited asymptomatic carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b037">37</xref>]. Coughing cannot be assessed in the mouse models used in this study. However, due to the nature of the genetic alterations in BPZE1, in particular the strong reduction of TCT and the genetic inactivation of PTX, this strain would not be expected to induce coughing. Active PTX has been shown to be required for cough induction in a coughing rat model, although the mechanism is not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b038">38</xref>]. If the vaccine strain were nevertheless to be transmitted to non-vaccinated individuals, this would at worst result in increased vaccine coverage. The consequences of each of these potential hazards can thus be graded as negligible and can easily and rapidly be controlled by antibiotic treatment if necessary.</p><p>Advantages of the use of BPZE1 include the relatively low production costs, making it especially attractive for developing countries, its needle-free, easy, and safe mode of administration, and its potential to induce mucosal immunity in addition to systemic immunity. Although, surprisingly, the role of mucosal immunity against pertussis has not been much addressed, the fact that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> is a strictly mucosal pathogen, makes it likely that mucosal immune responses may contribute significantly to protection. None of the currently available vaccines induces any significant mucosal response.</p><p>The use of live attenuated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> for mucosal vaccination offers yet another advantage. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> can be used for the presentation of heterologous antigens to the respiratory mucosa (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b039">39</xref>]) The use of BPZE1 as a heterologous expression platform may thus be helpful for the generation of multivalent vaccines against a variety of respiratory pathogens. However, since intranasal delivery of BPZE1 also induces strong systemic immune responses, as shown here by both the high levels of anti-FHA antibodies and of antigen-specific IFN-γ production, it may also be used for the production of antigens to which systemic immune responses are desired.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Bordetella</italic> strains and growth conditions.</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> strains used in this study are all derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. pertussis</named-content> BPSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020065-b040">40</xref>], and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. parapertussis</named-content> is a streptomycin-resistant derivative of strain 12822 (kindly provided by Dr. N.
