The toxin acts by first docking onto specific proteins, called receptors, located on the host cell surface, and it is then taken up into cells where it can act on its cellular substrates. There are two known receptors for the toxin, anthrax toxin receptors 1 and 2 (ANTXR1 and ANTXR2). However, the physiological importance of each receptor in host organisms is not yet understood. To address this issue directly, the authors designed a form of the toxin which binds specifically to ANTXR2 but not to ANTXR1. They show that this ANTXR2-specific form of the toxin is capable of killing rats following intravenous injection. These studies provide direct evidence for the physiological importance of ANTXR2 in anthrax toxin action in a model host organism.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors acknowledge support for this work from National Institutes of Health grant AI56013.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Scobie HM, Wigelsworth DJ, Marlett JM, Thomas D, Rainey GJA, et al.

Anthrax toxin is an AB-type toxin, with a single receptor-binding B-moiety, protective antigen (PA), and two catalytic A-moieties, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). LF is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family (all MKKs except MEK5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b004">4</xref>], whereas EF is a calmodulin and calcium–dependent adenylate cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b006">6</xref>]. LF and PA combine to form lethal toxin, and EF and PA combine to form edema toxin. These toxins are responsible for disabling host innate and adaptive immune responses, causing vascular leakage, and leading to the death of animals and cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b016">16</xref>].</p><p>Following binding of PA to cell surface receptors and internalization of toxin complexes, EF and LF are translocated into the cytoplasm through a heptamerized PA pore that forms at endosomal low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b020">20</xref>].

We also show that a single region of nonconserved receptor residues that bind PA domain 2 is responsible for the differential abilities of ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 to bind D683 mutant forms of PA.

To test the dependence of ANTXR2-PA binding on PA D683, this residue was replaced with either an asparagine or a lysine.

Additionally, replacement of ANTXR1 residues 154 to 159 with the corresponding ANTXR2 residues gave rise to a recombinant receptor that could support PA<sup>D683N</sup>-mediated intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PA<sup>D683K</sup> Supports LF-Mediated Intoxication in Rats</title><p>To address the possible role of ANTXR2 in lethal toxin killing of Fischer 344 rats, we first confirmed that D683 mutant forms of PA can interact with rat ANTXR2 (rANTXR2) but not rat ANTXR1. To this end, we attempted to isolate a full-length rat ANTXR1 cDNA clone but were not successful. However, the rat ANTXR1 I domain differs from that of its human counterpart by only two amino acids (residues K72 and R136 of the human protein are, in the rat protein, arginine and serine, respectively). Therefore, we constructed a rat version of the ANTXR1-EGFP protein (designated as ANTXR1<sup>R72,S136</sup>-EGFP by replacing these two human-specific residues with those of rat ANTXR1. Also, cDNAs encoding the rANTXR2 open reading frame were isolated from rat liver and brain tissue RNAs; both cDNAs had an identical DNA sequence. Comparison with the human ANTXR2 (hANTXR2) revealed that the I domains of these proteins differ by ten amino acid acids, two of which are PA-contact residues: Arg111 and Ser113 in hANTXR2 are alanine and glutamine in rANTXR2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020111-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). CHO-R1.1 cells engineered to express rANTXR2-EGFP were susceptible to PA<sup>D683K</sup>-dependent killing, albeit slightly less efficiently than the killing observed with wild-type PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g004">4</xref>B). By contrast, cells engineered to express either hANTXR1-EGFP or ANTXR1<sup>R72,S136</sup>-EGFP were resistant to PA<sup>D683K</sup>-dependent killing. Taken together, these observations confirm that PA<sup>D683K</sup> interacts specifically with ANTXR2, both in humans and in rats.</p><fig id="ppat-0020111-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020111.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>PA<sup>D683K</sup> Supports Lethal Toxin-Mediated Killing of Rats via rANTXR2</title><p>(A) Triplicate samples of CHO-R1.1 cells transiently expressing the different receptor-EGFP proteins were incubated with 10<sup>−10</sup> M LF<sub>N</sub>-DTA and with either 10<sup>−8</sup> M wild-type PA or 10<sup>−7</sup> M PA<sup>D683K</sup> or without PA.

This several-fold decrease in the efficacy of PA<sup>D683K</sup> was also apparent from comparing the mean TTD of two animals injected with 200 μg of this mutant protein and LF (TTD = 68.5 [±5.0] minutes compared to those of three animals in each group that received LF with either 20, 30, or 40 μg of wild-type PA [mean TTD = 60.3 ± 2.9; 57.0 ± 2.0; and 54.7 ± 1.5 minutes, respectively]).</p><p>To investigate the relative efficacy of PA<sup>D683K</sup> in more detail, a subsequent experiment was performed with rats injected with the same amount of LF and with either a fixed amount of PA<sup>D683K</sup> (100 μg) or varying amounts of wild-type PA (ranging from 10 to 40 μg). Rats injected with LF and 100 μg of PA<sup>D683K</sup> died on average approximately 67 min following toxin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). By comparison, rats injected with LF and either 20 μg of PA or 10 μg of PA died an average of approximately 64 and 89 min after toxin injection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The difference in TTD between the rats treated with 100 μg of PA<sup>D683K</sup> was statistically significant when compared with those injected with 10 μg of PA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) but not from those treated with 20 μg of PA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.104) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Based on these dosage effects, we conclude that PA<sup>D683K</sup> can mediate anthrax lethal toxin killing of rats, albeit with an approximately 5-fold reduced efficiency compared with wild-type PA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This report demonstrates that D683 mutant forms of PA bind selectively to ANTXR2 and that this selectivity is dependent on amino acid residues of ANTXR2 that contact domain 2 of PA. Moreover, we have shown that a D683K mutant form of PA is capable of mediating lethal toxin killing of rats, implicating an important physiological role for ANTXR2 in this process.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the ability of ANTXR2 to bind PA proteins with mutations at the D683 site maps to the receptor surface region containing residues G153 and L154 that engage PA domain 2. Replacing the ANTXR2 G153, which allows a polypeptide backbone turn, and L154, which participates in hydrophobic interactions with PA, with the negatively charged Glu and Asp residues from ANTXR1 resulted in resistance to cellular intoxication with PA<sup>D683N</sup>. By contrast, exchange of the HEDLFF<sup>154–159</sup> sequence from ANTXR1 for the corresponding DGLVPS<sup>152–157</sup> sequence from ANTXR2 conferred upon ANTXR1 the ability to support PA<sup>D683N</sup>-mediated intoxication.</p><p>Prior to this report it was unclear if ANTXR2 was important for lethal toxin killing in vivo<italic>.</italic> Our results showing that PA<sup>D683K</sup> supports lethal toxin-mediated killing of rats provides direct evidence for the physiological importance of this receptor in this rodent model system. There are several potential explanations for the reduced efficacy of PA<sup>D683K</sup> in vivo, compared to wild-type PA. First, this result could reflect the slightly reduced levels of PA<sup>D683K</sup> intoxication observed in cultured cells expressing rANTXR2 relative to those expressing hANTXR2. This difference may be due to the combined effects of residue differences at positions 111 and 113 of these proteins. The hANTXR2 R111 residue interacts with a negatively charged environment in PA domain 4, and the S113 residue makes H-bond contacts with PA domain 4 in the crystal structure (unpublished data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b032">32</xref>]. The rANTXR2 Ala and Gln residues at these respective locations may not be able to participate in these interactions. A second possibility is that cell type–specific differences downstream of initial PA binding might dictate different activities of PA proteins with altered residues at the D683 site. Indeed, we observed a 10-fold difference in intoxication activities of the PA<sup>D683N</sup> and PA<sup>D683K</sup> proteins despite similar ANTXR2 binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020111-g002">2</xref>E). Third, the reduced activity of the PA<sup>D683K</sup> protein in vivo might be indicative of a role for ANTXR1 in intoxication of rats by wild-type lethal toxin.</p><p>The PA<sup>D683K</sup> protein is the first engineered toxin that can discriminate between the two anthrax toxin receptors, binding specifically to ANTXR2. This ANTXR2-specific form of PA can now be used to study the role of ANTXR2 in mediating the effects of lethal toxin in other cell types, and it can also be engineered into the bacterium to probe the importance of this receptor for various aspects of anthrax disease pathogenesis following infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. anthracis</named-content> spores.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>DNA constructs and cell lines.</title><p>The ANTXR2-EGFP, ANTXR1-EGFP, and sANTXR2-mycHis fusion constructs have already been described (CMG2<sup>489</sup>-EGFP, ATR/TEM8 sv2-EGFP, and sCMG2-mycHis, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020111-b038">38</xref>].
