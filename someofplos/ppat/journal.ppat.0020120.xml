Glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major component of the capsule, is a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide that is shed during cryptococcosis and can persist in patients after successful antifungal therapy. Due to the importance of T cells in the anticryptococcal response, we studied the effect of GXM on the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to initiate a T-cell response. GXM inhibited the activation of cryptococcal mannoprotein–specific hybridoma T cells and the proliferation of OVA-specific OT-II T cells when murine bone marrow–derived DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells. Inhibition of OT-II T-cell proliferation was observed when either OVA protein or OVA<sub>323–339</sub> peptide was used as antigen, indicating GXM did not merely prevent antigen uptake or processing. We found that DCs internalize GXM progressively over time; however, the suppressive effect did not require DCs, as GXM directly inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3 antibody, concanavalin A, or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate/ionomycin. Analysis of T-cell viability revealed that the reduced proliferation in the presence of GXM was not the result of increased cell death. GXM isolated from each of the four major cryptococcal serotypes inhibited the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with tetanus toxoid. Thus, we have defined a new mechanism by which GXM can impart virulence: direct inhibition of T-cell proliferation. In patients with cryptococcosis, this could impair optimal cell-mediated immune responses, thereby contributing to the persistence of cryptococcal infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Infections due to the pathogenic yeast <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with impaired T-cell functions, particularly those with AIDS.

Because of the importance of T cells in the anticryptococcal response, the authors investigated the effect of GXM on the ability of dendritic cells to initiate a T-cell response. They found the polysaccharide was internalized by dendritic cells and inhibited antigen-specific T-cell responses. Furthermore, GXM had a direct, inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation, independent of the effect on dendritic cells. These findings may help explain the persistence of cryptococcal infections and suggest that GXM could be therapeutic in situations where suppression of T-cell responses is desired.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants R01 AI25780, R01 AI066087, and R01 AI37532 to SML.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Yauch LE, Lam JS, Levitz SM (2006) Direct inhibition of T-cell responses by the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan.

GXM is a large polysaccharide; a study of GXM from four cryptococcal strains concluded that the molecular size ranged from 1,700 to 7,000 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b004">4</xref>]. A second polysaccharide, galactoxylomannan (GalXM), is also present but at approximately 10% of the mass of GXM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b005">5</xref>].</p><p>Capsule is thought to contribute to the virulence of the yeast both by inhibiting phagocytosis and by being shed. In patients with cryptococcosis, GXM circulates in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at high concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b006">6</xref>] and can often be detected in body fluids for months to years after successful antifungal therapy ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b007">7</xref>] and unpublished data). GXM has a number of immunomodulatory properties, including downregulating proinflammatory cytokine secretion from human monocytes and inhibiting leukocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b008">8</xref>].</p><p>GXM in the brain of patients with cryptococcal meningitis is associated with macrophages/microglial cells, and it is possible that these cells serve as a reservoir for the polysaccharide once the organism is cleared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b010">10</xref>].

Because of the importance of DCs in orchestrating immune responses, numerous pathogens have evolved ways of interfering with their functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b017">17</xref>]. Few studies have examined the effects of GXM on DCs. While acapsular <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. neoformans</named-content> cells induced the activation and maturation of human monocyte–derived DCs (HDCs), encapsulated organisms did not. In addition, soluble GXM did not affect the expression of MHC class I, MHC class II, CD40, or CD86 on HDCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b018">18</xref>].</p><p>Given the importance of the CMI response in the defense against <italic>Cryptococcus,</italic> we hypothesized that the organism's major virulence factor, GXM, would interfere with the ability of DCs to activate T cells.

BMDCs were pretreated with varying concentrations of GXM before the addition of antigen, either whole OVA (contained in endotoxin-free egg white) or OVA<sub>323–339</sub> peptide. Naïve OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, purified from OT-II transgenic mice, were added and proliferation was measured. GXM at 30, 100, and 300 μg/ml significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by BMDC plus egg white, with GXM at 300 μg/ml inhibiting proliferation by almost 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Similar results were obtained when OVA contaminated with endotoxin was used as antigen (unpublished data). To determine if GXM was affecting antigen uptake and/or processing, we activated OT-II T cells with BMDC plus OVA<sub>323–339</sub> peptide. This peptide directly binds to MHC class II, thus bypassing the need for antigen uptake and processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b019">19</xref>]. GXM inhibited proliferation induced by the peptide to a similar extent as observed with egg white, indicating the mechanism of inhibition is not interference with antigen uptake or processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In support of this, inhibition of proliferation was similar whether GXM was added 2 h before or 2 h after egg white (unpublished data). Reduced T-cell proliferation could also be the result of impaired DC maturation, but we found GXM did not inhibit lipopolysaccharide- or tumor necrosis factor α–induced upregulation of MHC class II or CD86 on BMDC (unpublished data), suggesting GXM does not interfere with DC maturation.</p><fig id="ppat-0020120-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020120.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>GXM Inhibits the Proliferation of OVA-Specific T Cells</title><p>BMDCs were pretreated with GXM (30, 100, or 300 μg/ml) before the addition of egg white or OVA<sub>323–339</sub> peptide.

Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells were activated by BMMφ plus egg white, in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of GXM. While GXM at the lower concentrations tested (30 and 100 μg/ml) had no significant effect on T-cell proliferation, GXM at 300 μg/ml inhibited proliferation by 57 ± 9% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 2). Thus, GXM-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation is observed whether DCs or macrophages present the antigen.</p><p>GXM was present for the duration of the coculture in the T-cell proliferation experiments described above. Accordingly, although some GXM was undoubtedly taken up by the APCs, there was likely GXM present extracellularly in contact with the T cells. Therefore, we questioned whether intracellular GXM would be sufficient to impair the ability of BMDCs to activate T cells. To investigate this, BMDCs were incubated with GXM and then washed to remove any GXM not bound or internalized before the addition of antigen and T cells. Pulsing of BMDCs with 100 μg/ml GXM before the addition of egg white had no effect on subsequent T-cell proliferation, and pulsing with 300 μg/ml had a minimal, inhibitory effect on proliferation (unpublished data). Thus, GXM-pulsing of BMDCs slightly reduced T-cell proliferation but not to the extent observed when GXM was added directly to the cocultures, suggesting GXM was having a direct effect on T cells. To investigate direct effects of GXM on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we first demonstrated that GXM bound to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (unpublished data) and then used three stimuli that activate T cells independent of APC: concanavalin A (Con A), plate-bound anti-CD3ɛ antibody, and phorbol-12-myristate-13acetate (PMA)/ionomycin. GXM at 100 μg/ml added to anti-CD3ɛ–activated T cells modestly increased proliferation; however, higher concentrations of GXM (300 and 1,000 μg/ml) significantly inhibited proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g004">Figure 4</xref>). GXM at 100 μg/ml had no effect on Con A–mediated T-cell proliferation, yet 300 μg/ml GXM inhibited proliferation by 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We also found GXM inhibited the proliferation of PMA/ionomycin-activated T cells in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These data demonstrate that GXM has a direct, inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation. Moreover, inhibition is observed regardless of whether T cells are activated in a physiologic or pharmacologic manner.</p><fig id="ppat-0020120-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020120.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Effect of GXM on T-Cell Proliferation Induced by Anti-CD3, Con A, or PMA/Ionomycin</title><p>Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> murine T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3ɛ antibody, Con A, or PMA/ionomycin, in the presence or absence of GXM (100, 300, or 1,000 μg/ml).

Surface expression of CD69, which is an early activation antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b020">20</xref>], was evaluated. GXM did not affect the upregulation of CD69 on T cells activated with anti-CD3ɛ or BMDCs plus egg white (unpublished data). Similarly, GXM did not inhibit the upregulation of CD25 (unpublished data), which is the α-chain of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor and another activation marker of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>The decreased T-cell proliferation observed in the presence of GXM could be due to induction of necrosis or apoptosis. Therefore, we assessed the effect of GXM on T-cell viability by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. GXM at 300 μg/ml induced a small decrease in the percentage of live cells and a corresponding increase in the percentage of late apoptotic or dead cells when T cells were activated by anti-CD3ɛ or BMDCs plus egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The addition of 1,000 μg/ml GXM to anti-CD3ɛ–activated T cells also resulted in a minimal, statistically insignificant increase in the percentage of late apoptotic or dead cells (unpublished data). However, this effect of GXM on T-cell viability is minimal and does not appear to be sufficient to account for the impaired proliferative responses. The effect of GXM on viability was also examined by adding the polysaccharide to cell lines and measuring proliferation. GXM at 300 μg/ml had no significant effect on the incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine by a number of T cell lines and a B cell line, demonstrating that GXM is not directly cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020120-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

The presence of GXM resulted in reduced IL-2 levels when T cells were activated with anti-CD3ɛ or BMDCs plus egg white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020120-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, GXM had no significant effect on IL-10 or IFN-γ levels (unpublished data). Because IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor and is produced by activated T cells, the effect of GXM on IL-2 production was investigated further. Reduced levels of IL-2 in the presence of GXM could be due to a direct inhibition of IL-2 production or a result of fewer T cells due to an impaired proliferative response. To address the former possibility, we added exogenous IL-2 to T cells activated with anti-CD3ɛ.

While GXM is taken up by DCs, inhibition of T-cell responses occurs in an APC-independent manner. Thus, GXM-mediated inhibition is seen regardless of whether T cells are activated by APC plus antigen or directly by mitogens. Moreover, GXM inhibits both murine and human T-cell responses.</p><p>GXM inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by BMDCs presenting the immunodominant cryptococcal MP antigens. Assuming these effects occur in vivo during cryptococcosis, the anticryptococcal CMI response may be dampened once a cryptococcal infection gets firmly established and GXM titers rise. As GXM also impairs humoral immune responses and phagocytic defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b022">22</xref>], this could lead to a situation where the host is left without effective innate or acquired immunologic defenses. Indeed, prior to the introduction of effective antifungal drugs, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was nearly always fatal.</p><p>In addition to its effect on antigen-specific T-cell responses, GXM had a direct effect on primary, naïve T cells, as demonstrated by its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of T cells activated with anti-CD3ɛ or Con A. GXM also has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of Con A–activated rat spleen mononuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b023">23</xref>]. In those studies, the impaired proliferation may have been due to increased cell death, as GXM was found to induce apoptosis in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b024">24</xref>]. In contrast, the impaired proliferative responses we measured could not be attributed to GXM-mediated cytotoxicity, as the polysaccharide did not significantly affect T-cell viability.</p><p>GXM also inhibited the proliferation of T cells activated with the chemical mitogens PMA and ionomycin, indicating GXM interferes with T-cell signaling downstream of T-cell receptor activation. GXM did not inhibit the early activation of T cells, as measured by CD25 and CD69 expression. Similarly, <italic>Salmonella</italic> inhibits T-cell proliferation without inhibiting the upregulation of T-cell activation markers, including CD25 and CD69 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b025">25</xref>]. Additionally, HIV has been shown to inhibit CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell cycle progression without affecting the expression of early activation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>The presence of GXM resulted in less IL-2 detected in cultures of T cells activated with BMDC and egg white or anti-CD3ɛ. Likewise, GXM impaired the response of MP-specific T cells as measured by IL-2 production. However, exogenous IL-2 could not restore the proliferative response of T cells activated in the presence of a high concentration of GXM, and GXM did not inhibit IL-2 release by PHA-activated Jurkat cells. Although it is possible GXM exerts different effects on cell lines and primary T cells, these data indicate GXM impairs T-cell proliferation independently of inhibiting IL-2 production or IL-2 receptor expression. Taken together, our results suggest that GXM exerts its effect at a later stage of T-cell activation. In fact, GXM may have a direct, inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression in primary T cells, similar to the action of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Helicobacter pylori</named-content> vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, which inhibits IL-2–driven T-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>Studies from other laboratories have found that GXM induces the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10, from human monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b028">28</xref>], and identified a role for IL-10 in GXM-mediated immunosuppression in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b023">23</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b030">30</xref>]. However, we do not observe an induction of IL-10 by human monocytes or BMDCs incubated with GXM (unpublished data). Furthermore, GXM did not enhance IL-10 production from T cells activated with BMDCs plus egg white or anti-CD3ɛ. Thus, we conclude that GXM-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation in our studies likely is IL-10 independent.</p><p>In addition to the direct effect of GXM on T cells, we found DCs internalized the polysaccharide continuously over time, yet GXM-pulsed BMDCs were only minimally impaired in their ability to activate T cells. This is not surprising, as GXM treatment does not appear to inhibit BMDC maturation (unpublished data). Similarly, it was recently demonstrated that pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides are internalized by DCs yet do not inhibit LPS-induced maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b031">31</xref>]. Interference with antigen uptake or processing is also an unlikely mechanism for the inhibitory effect of GXM, as GXM effectively inhibited proliferation when T cells were activated with BMDCs plus OVA<sub>323–339</sub> peptide.</p><p>Importantly, the inhibitory effect of GXM on murine T cells was also observed using human cells. We show that GXM inhibited proliferation of PBMCs activated with tetanus toxoid in a dose-dependent manner. A recent study demonstrated the other capsular component of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, GalXM, inhibits human T-cell proliferation by inducing T-cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b032">32</xref>]. Consistent with our results, the researchers found a low concentration of GXM did not affect T-cell proliferation induced by PHA or anti-CD3. They did not examine the effects of higher concentrations of GXM, however.</p><p>Interestingly, our studies revealed that GXM isolated from all four cryptococcal serotypes inhibited proliferation of tetanus toxoid–activated PBMCs, although not to the same extent. GXM from the serotype D strain B3501 was less inhibitory than GXM from the other strains. Whether this is due to a size or structure difference is unknown. Differences in GXM structure affect virulence, inhibition of neutrophil migration, and tissue accumulation of GXM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b035">35</xref>]. GXM from B3501 is larger than GXM from H99 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b004">4</xref>]; however, the molecular sizes of GXM from strains Cn6, R265, and Cn18 are unknown. Our results suggest differences in virulence between cryptococcal strains may be due in part to the varying capacities of GXM to inhibit T-cell proliferation.</p><p>The concentrations of GXM we used that consistently inhibited T-cell proliferation (300 and 1,000 μg/ml) are high yet still biologically relevant. One study found 68% of AIDS patients with cryptococcosis had serum GXM titers of at least 1:1,024 (approximately 10 μg/ml), and 21% had titers of 1:10,000 or higher (approximately 100 μg/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b006">6</xref>]. In experimental cryptococcosis, serum GXM levels in the mg/ml range have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b036">36</xref>]. However, GXM concentrations in infected tissues, particularly at foci of infection, are undoubtedly much higher. Our findings suggest that such high concentrations of GXM could interfere with the generation of T-cell responses. In this regard, while the osmolarity of these high concentrations of GXM has not been determined, hyperosmotic stress has been reported to have direct effects on T-cell signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020120-b037">37</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our data reveal a novel inhibitory property of GXM. Inhibition of T-cell proliferation could have severe consequences during cryptococcosis due to the importance of T cells in the anticryptococcal response. Furthermore, the ability of GXM to persist in patients after successful antifungal therapy underscores how T-cell responses during subsequent infections or neoplasia may be affected as well. Finally, GXM, or products derived from GXM, could prove to be of therapeutic value in situations where suppression of T-cell responses is desired, such as transplantation or autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials.</title><p>All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, United States) unless otherwise specified.
