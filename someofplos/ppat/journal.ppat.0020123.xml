			</related-article><abstract><p>Many biological processes are controlled by intricate networks of transcriptional regulators. With the development of microarray technology, transcriptional changes can be examined at the whole-genome level. However, such analysis often lacks information on the hierarchical relationship between components of a given system. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is an inducible plant defense response involving a cascade of transcriptional events induced by salicylic acid through the transcription cofactor NPR1. To identify additional regulatory nodes in the SAR network, we performed microarray analysis on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing the NPR1-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion protein. Since nuclear translocation of NPR1-GR requires dexamethasone, we were able to control NPR1-dependent transcription and identify direct transcriptional targets of NPR1. We show that NPR1 directly upregulates the expression of eight <italic>WRKY</italic> transcription factor genes. This large family of 74 transcription factors has been implicated in various defense responses, but no specific WRKY factor has been placed in the SAR network. Identification of NPR1-regulated WRKY factors allowed us to perform in-depth genetic analysis on a small number of WRKY factors and test well-defined phenotypes of single and double mutants associated with NPR1. Among these WRKY factors we found both positive and negative regulators of SAR. This genomics-directed approach unambiguously positioned five WRKY factors in the complex transcriptional regulatory network of SAR. Our work not only discovered new transcription regulatory components in the signaling network of SAR but also demonstrated that functional studies of large gene families have to take into consideration sequence similarity as well as the expression patterns of the candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Many biological processes are controlled by intricate regulatory networks of gene expression. Identifying the regulatory nodes in these networks and understanding the hierarchical relationship between them are vital to our understanding of biological systems. However, this task is frequently hampered by the intrinsic complexity of these processes. Here, the authors used a controlled transcriptional profiling strategy to a plant immune response called systemic acquired resistance to study the transcriptional events one at a time. Systemic acquired resistance is activated through the induction of thousands of genes by the transcriptional regulator protein NPR1. The authors found that downstream of NPR1 are several regulatory nodes comprised of members from a large family of transcriptional factors. Disrupting these regulatory nodes compromised various functions assigned to NPR1, providing the information needed to construct a gene regulation network.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (MCB-0519898) and by the National Research Initiative of the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (grant number 2003-35301-13315) to XD.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Wang D, Amornsiripanitch N, Dong X (2006) A genomic approach to identify regulatory nodes in the transcriptional network of systemic acquired resistance in plants.

In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> the onset of SAR is preceded by an accumulation of the signaling molecule salicylic acid (SA). SA induces nuclear translocation of the transcription cofactor NPR1 to activate many genes required for disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b001">1</xref>]. NPR1 also negatively feedback-regulates SA synthesis to mitigate its cytotoxic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b002">2</xref>]. It is known that NPR1 controls the expression of antimicrobial pathogenesis-related genes (<italic>PR</italic> genes) by interacting with TGA transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b005">5</xref>]. A microarray experiment showed that NPR1 also directly upregulates the protein secretory pathway. This is essential for SAR since disrupting this pathway diminished the secretion of PR proteins and resulted in reduced resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b006">6</xref>]. NPR1 likely regulates these secretion-related genes through a novel transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b006">6</xref>]. In addition to this unknown transcription factor and the TGAs, WRKY transcription factors have also been implicated in regulating the response against pathogen infection. Many <italic>WRKY</italic> genes are rapidly induced after treatment with elicitors associated with infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b009">9</xref>]. Moreover, genes induced during defense responses often contain WRKY transcription factor–binding sites, W boxes, in their promoter regions. For example, the promoter of an SA biosynthesis gene is enriched with W boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b010">10</xref>]. The expression of <italic>NPR1</italic> itself has been shown to be under the regulation of WRKY factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b011">11</xref>]. In a transcriptional profiling study, Maleck et al. discovered that W boxes are overrepresented in a cluster of genes sharing the induction pattern of <italic>PR-1,</italic> suggesting a role for WRKY factors in SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b012">12</xref>]. Ectopic expression studies have shed some light on the functions of WRKY genes. Plants overexpressing <italic>WRKY70</italic> have heightened resistance toward two bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b013">13</xref>]. Likewise, overexpressing <italic>WRKY18</italic> resulted in gain of <italic>PR</italic> gene expression and resistance in a developmentally regulated manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b014">14</xref>]. Transiently overexpressed <italic>WRKY29,</italic> a target of a MAPK cascade activated by bacterial flagellin, also led to stronger resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b015">15</xref>]. However, data from overexpression studies need to be interpreted with caution. For example, since ectopically expressing several WRKY genes all resulted in a similar range of phenotypes, it is difficult to conclude functional specificity from these studies.</p><p>Typical of large gene families, phenotypic analysis of loss-of-function WRKY mutants has been hampered by functional redundancy. It has been reported that in a collection of more than 40 <italic>wrky</italic> knockout mutants, phenotypes were rarely observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b016">16</xref>]. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the wide range of defense responses in which WRKY factors participate. Therefore, to elucidate the function of specific WRKY genes, it is critical to identify a small number of candidates within a well-defined biological process.</p><p>In this study, we used a genomics-directed approach to identify those <italic>WRKY</italic> genes whose expression is directly regulated by NPR1. The small number of candidate genes allowed more informed construction of double mutants and focused examination of the mutants on NPR1-associated phenotypes. As a result, we were able to find new regulatory nodes (i.e., WRKY factors) in the complex transcriptional regulatory network of SAR.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Eight <italic>WRKY</italic> Genes as Direct Transcriptional Targets of NPR1</title><p>To dissect the transcriptional cascade leading to SAR, we performed a microarray experiment with the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (24,000 genes) to identify direct transcriptional targets of NPR1 using a previously described strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b006">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

Assuming the expression measurements of a gene have a normal distribution, the Bayesian <italic>t</italic> test models the variance as a function of the mean. For experiments with few replicates, the Bayesian <italic>t</italic> test shows better performance than the basic <italic>t</italic> test in simulated and biological datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b018">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the confidence value was set to six, and window size was 100.

Among the 64 genes, we found that the expression of <italic>WRKY54, WRKY38, WRKY59, WRKY18, WRKY70, WRKY66,</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> was reproducibly induced in two biological replicates. We also carried out a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b019">19</xref>] of the data. Using <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 as a cutoff, <italic>WRKY38, WRKY54, WRKY66,</italic> and <italic>WRKY58</italic> were the top candidates with the most fold changes.

Induction of the other two <italic>WRKY</italic> genes, <italic>WRKY59</italic> and <italic>WRKY66,</italic> also appeared to be abolished in <italic>npr1–1</italic> and <italic>tga2 tga3 tga5 tga6,</italic> but the background expression for these genes was too low in WT to calculate the fold induction (unpublished data).</p><fig id="ppat-0020123-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020123.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Differential Regulation of SAR by NPR1-Induced WRKY Factors</title><p>(A) A schematic representation of the strategy to identify NPR1 direct targets.

However, there has been no concrete genetic evidence to place specific WRKY factors in the SAR signaling network. By focusing on the first transcriptional step downstream of NPR1, we were able to identify a small number of WRKY factors sharing not only sequence homology but also similar expression patterns. Therefore, either individually or in combination, these WRKY factors are promising candidates for transcriptional regulators required for NPR1 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>WRKY18 Is a Positive Transcription Factor Required for Full Induction of SAR</title><p>We isolated T-DNA or transposon insertion lines in each of the NPR1-inducible <italic>WRKY</italic> genes, most of which disrupted the expression of their corresponding genes, as assayed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st002">Table S2</xref>).

Three biological replicates were collected for each timepoint/genotype combination. BTH treatment in WT triggered a robust change in the expression of thousands of genes. Using ANOVA, the expression of 6,525 genes was found to be altered in WT following BTH treatment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (after multiple testing correction using the method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg to assess false discovery rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b022">22</xref>]).

Genetic redundancy within such a large family of genes makes dissecting the function of individual <italic>WRKY</italic> genes a daunting task. Taking advantage of the fact that many <italic>WRKY</italic> genes are inducible, we focused on one step of a specific signal transduction event and identified eight WRKY factors as important transcriptional regulators of SAR downstream of NPR1. This approach also allowed us to test a well-defined set of phenotypes associated with NPR1 and to assign specific functions to these individual WRKY genes. As a result, we elucidated functions for five of the eight NPR1 direct targets in the model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B.</p><p>Our data established WRKY18 as a significant positive regulator of SAR. The partial loss of resistance in <italic>wrky18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the endogenous protein performs a subset of functions directed by NPR1. This has been clearly demonstrated by comparing the transcriptomes of <italic>wrky18</italic> and <italic>npr1</italic> with that of WT after induction with 60 μM BTH. The <italic>wrky18</italic> mutation affected the amplitude of gene expression triggered by BTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Because the <italic>WRKY18</italic> transcript levels remain high even beyond the 24-h induction period, this transcription factor may also be required to sustain SAR-related gene expression.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that WRKY18 physically interacts with two negative regulators of defense, WRKY40 and WRKY60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b027">27</xref>]. It is possible that during SAR, WRKY18 releases the inhibitory effects of WRKY40 and WRKY60 to induce gene expression. Unfortunately, under the experimental conditions used in this recent report, where 10-fold more pathogens were used, the WT plants developed disease symptoms, and the defect caused by <italic>wrky18</italic> on basal resistance was masked. SAR was not tested on <italic>wrky18.</italic> The same authors showed that overexpression of <italic>WRKY18</italic> led to enhanced resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b014">14</xref>], consistent with our finding that WRKY18 alone is a positive regulator of defense.</p><p>Activation of SAR is a costly process involving dramatic induction of more than 1,000 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st003">Table S3</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b028">28</xref>]). Therefore, SAR should only be activated when the benefit of resistance outweighs the costs. WRKY58 appears to be a negative regulator that functions at a suboptimal level of BTH to prevent spurious induction of SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The stunted growth of the <italic>wrky58</italic> mutant plants is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>Characterization of both <italic>wrky70</italic> and the <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> mutants in our study provided new insights into another function of NPR1, namely the ability to curtail excessive SA accumulation. Hyperaccumulation of the <italic>ICS1</italic> transcript and SA observed in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that in WT plants, SA biosynthesis is actively repressed by low levels of WRKY70 and WRKY54. Because WRKY70 and WRKY54 are both NPR1 targets, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they are also involved in shutting down SA biosynthesis once the pathogen challenge subsides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The observation that free SA levels in the <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> double mutant were further elevated in response to pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) suggests that induction of SA biosynthesis involves a positive regulator. However, this regulatory gene is unlikely to be among the NPR1 targets examined in this study since SA biosynthesis occurs prior to activation of NPR1.</p><p>In an earlier study, it was reported that reducing <italic>WRKY70</italic> expression by an antisense construct did not change SA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b020">20</xref>]. It is possible that in addition to <italic>WRKY70,</italic> a related <italic>WRKY</italic> gene required for activating SA biosynthesis was also silenced. This suggests that this unknown positive regulator may be another WRKY factor. The presence of multiple W boxes in the promoter of the SA biosynthesis gene <italic>ICS1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b010">10</xref>] is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>Unlike many reported SA-overaccumulating mutants, <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> did not exhibit constitutive resistance to pathogens. In fact, this double mutant may have an EDS phenotype (unpublished data). We believe that WRKY70 and WRKY54 play dual roles during SAR: both as negative regulators of SA synthesis and as positive regulators of SA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Supporting evidence came from a report where <italic>WRKY70</italic>-overexpressing plants showed constitutive resistance to two bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b020">20</xref>]. If the sole function of WRKY70 were to repress SA biosynthesis, one would expect compromised resistance in plants with elevated <italic>WRKY70</italic> expression. Finally, our characterization of the <italic>wrky53 wrky70</italic> double mutant suggests that WRKY53 also plays a positive role in activating defense responses, as this double mutant showed an EDS phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>In conclusion, our genomics-directed genetic studies of <italic>WRKY</italic> genes led to unambiguous placement of specific WRKY factors in the intricate signaling network induced by SA.
