We show by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence that the majority of ookinetes are killed in the extracellular space. Dead or dying ookinetes are surrounded by a polymerized actin zone formed within the basal cytoplasm of adjacent host epithelial cells. In refractory strain mosquitoes, we found that formation of this zone is strongly linked to prophenoloxidase activation leading to melanization. Furthermore, we identify two factors controlling both phenomena: the transmembrane receptor frizzled-2 and the guanosine triphosphate–binding protein cell division cycle 42. However, the disruption of actin polymerization and melanization by double-stranded RNA inhibition did not affect ookinete survival.

Most parasites are destroyed by host responses in the midgut, and in parasite-resistant refractory strains of mosquito the mortality can reach 100%. This midgut “bottleneck” represents an appealing target for reducing malaria transmission by the genetic control of wild mosquitoes. However, the killing mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, electron microscopical analyses followed the entire midgut invasion process in mosquitoes to identify the major site(s) and ultrastructural features of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> killing. The authors found that invasion can be divided into two steps: a swift passage through a midgut cell, followed by establishment of the parasite in the basal extracellular space, where it becomes an important target for destruction by soluble immunity factors. In refractory mosquitoes, dead parasites are associated with the formation of organelle-free zones of actin in adjacent midgut cells, and melanin deposition on the parasite surface. The authors identify two genes, called <italic>frizzled-2</italic> and <italic>cell division cycle 42,</italic> that control these phenomena. Actin zone formation and melanization are generally thought to be killing mechanisms; however, the authors show by gene silencing that neither is lethal to <italic>Plasmodium.</italic> Instead, these mechanisms may represent a form of mosquito wound-healing response that is triggered by the presence of a moribund parasite.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was financially supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (UPR 9022), the Institut National de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM “Avenir” to EAL), the Fondation Schlumberger (FSER fellowships to EAL, SHS, and MMAW) and the European Commission FP6 (Networks of Excellence “BioMalPar” to EAL and JAH).

Within <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, the only natural vectors of human malaria, immune responses to the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite are highly species and strain specific. However, two universal bottlenecks stand out: parasites suffer very heavy losses as they traverse the epithelia of the midgut and as they journey from the midgut to the salivary glands. The attrition of ookinetes in the mosquito midgut can therefore serve as an excellent model for the study of host–parasite interactions.</p><p>The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporogonic cycle is initiated when gametocytes are ingested by the mosquito during a blood meal. Gametocytes swiftly give rise to gametes, which fertilize in the midgut lumen. The zygotes thus formed develop into motile, banana-shaped ookinetes, which invade and traverse the midgut epithelium approximately 24 h after blood ingestion (depending on the host–parasite species combination). During this trip the majority of ookinetes are destroyed by host responses even in susceptible mosquito strains, but a few surviving ookinetes reach the basal side of the midgut and transform into oocysts, which mature over the next 10–12 d to release thousands of sporozoites into the mosquito hemocoel. Sporozoites then journey through the hemolymph (blood) and invade the salivary glands. Successful salivary gland sporozoites are finally transmitted to a new vertebrate host via an infective bite.</p><p>In general terms, mosquitoes are able to mount efficient cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, and are equipped with an array of antimicrobial molecules, coagulation factors, opsonins, and recognition factors (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b002">2</xref>]). Although the mechanisms of anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> defense are still poorly understood, the characterization of the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b003">3</xref>] has provided powerful new tools for functional analysis. Recent research has highlighted a role for a complement-related thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) in ookinete lysis and subsequent melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b004">4</xref>]. However, the exact mode of TEP1-mediated killing is yet to be determined and probably involves further downstream factors. An additional molecule shown to be induced by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection is leucine-rich repeat immune protein 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b005">5</xref>], whose silencing leads to a phenotype similar to that of TEP1. Depletion of the hemolymph-derived C-type lectin 4 and of serine protease inhibitor (SRPN) 2 provokes spontaneous melanization of ookinetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b005">5</xref>] in non-melanizing mosquito strains. This suggests that these molecules control the early stages of prophenoloxidase (PPO) activation, which leads to ookinete melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>Genetic variability within a single mosquito species leads to substantial differences in individuals' permissiveness towards malaria parasites, and this has allowed laboratory selection and study of highly refractory mosquito strains (discussed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b009">9</xref>]). From <italic>A. gambiae,</italic> the most important malaria vector of sub-Saharan Africa, the L3–5 refractory strain has been selected. In this strain, ookinete development is completely terminated and accompanied by subsequent melanization of the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b010">10</xref>]. The parental G3 strain, from which L3–5 was derived, is considered “susceptible” since approximately 20% of invading ookinetes survive to the oocyst stage in the absence of melanization. Knockdown of <italic>TEP1</italic> or <italic>leucine-rich repeat immune protein 1</italic> by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) completely abolishes melanotic refractoriness in the refractory L3–5 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b005">5</xref>] and leads to hyper-parasitization in the susceptible G3 strain. All of the above immune factors are soluble and secreted by the hemocytes (blood cells) in the hemocoel, and as there is no direct contact between the hemocytes and the ookinetes, these factors have to pass through the midgut basal lamina to interact with the parasites located in the basal labyrinth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b004">4</xref>] (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b011">11</xref>]).</p><p>Anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> responses may also be mediated by midgut factors. SRPN6 is produced by midgut epithelial cells in response to malaria infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b012">12</xref>]. The dsRNA knockdown of <italic>SRPN6</italic> results in a complex phenotype: it temporarily slows down ookinete killing in L3–5 mosquitoes, whilst simultaneously enhancing melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the transcriptional responses of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> midgut epithelium to <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> infection involve extensive regulation of genes controlling actin and microtubule cytoskeleton remodeling, of which some appear to modestly impair ookinete survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>Early studies have reported organelle-free cellular zones formed by midgut epithelial cells at their point of contact with invading ookinetes. This event was first described by Vernick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b014">14</xref>] in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. gallinaceum</named-content> infections of a refractory <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> strain, and has very occasionally been seen in a fully susceptible strain, Fam5. Vernick et al. observed a finely fibrillar zone protruding from the epithelial cell basal labyrinth that encircled dead ookinetes. These organelle-free, actin-rich cytoplasmic formations, for which we propose the term “organelle-free actin zone” (AZ), have since been noted by other authors investigating different host–parasite species combinations (e.g., the “purse-string” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b016">16</xref>]; the “lamellipodial hood” or “collar” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b017">17</xref>]; and the “actin cone” or “ring” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b018">18</xref>]). AZ-like structures are generally assumed to be involved in parasite killing or a consequence of an intracellular parasite exiting a damaged midgut cell, but a functional role in parasite killing has not been formally demonstrated.</p><p>We are interested in determining the predominant mode of ookinete killing in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content>–<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> infection model, and in redressing a paucity of electron microscope studies in this host–parasite species combination. Here, we aim to identify the precise location of dead ookinetes and to estimate the relative numbers of ookinetes that die in each compartment. In so doing, we hope to establish whether parasites are killed via exposure to soluble hemocyte-derived immunity factors in the extracellular milieu, or by midgut cell-mediated killing responses, or a combination of both. There is also a very clear need to resolve the functional significance of the AZ in terms of ookinete killing and its relationship with melanization. To address these points, we have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in combination with RNA interference (RNAi)–dependent gene silencing, and have investigated AZ/ookinete co-localization, the composition of the AZ, its control by TEP1 or proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, and its potential role in parasite killing.</p><p>We show that the majority of ookinetes are killed by lysis in the extracellular space, rather than succumbing to intracellular killing. Moreover, in the refractory strain, we noted that the majority of dead and dying ookinetes were surrounded by melanin and a zone of polymerized actin within the adjacent midgut cells (the AZ). We show that both features are linked and dependent on TEP1 activity. We identified two genes controlling actin polymerization and melanization, <italic>frizzled-2 (Fz2)</italic> and <italic>cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42).</italic> Silencing of both genes by RNAi did not affect parasite survival, demonstrating that AZ formation and melanization do not constitute the ookinete killing mechanism. Actin polymerization and PPO activation are both processes reminiscent of wound healing in other organisms (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b020">20</xref>]). We propose that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection induces a wound-healing response in <italic>A. gambiae,</italic> which includes actin polymerization and PPO activation. However, these responses do not account for major parasite losses during invasion of the midgut.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ookinete Killing Is Predominantly Extracellular</title><p>Two major mechanisms have been described to account for ookinete killing in the mosquito midgut epithelium: the first involves destruction of intracellular parasites in apoptotic cells of the infected midgut (the “time bomb” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b025">25</xref>]); in the second, ookinetes are proposed to be lysed in intercellular or extracellular spaces by soluble factors secreted from hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b005">5</xref>].

We examined ultra-thin midgut sections by TEM from both susceptible (G3) and refractory (L3–5) mosquito strains between 18 and 48 hours post-infection (hpi). An important overall observation was that the great majority (at least 80%) of ookinetes, particularly dead ones, were located outside the midgut epithelial cells in the intercellular or extracellular spaces of the epithelium at the level of the basal labyrinth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">2</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-0020133-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020133.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>TEM Images of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> Ookinete Invasion of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> Midgut</title><p>(A) Transient intracellular stage.

Ookinete invasion of the midgut epithelium occurred between 18 and 33 hpi and involved a complex route, beginning at the apical (microvillous) surface and ending at the membranous labyrinth beneath the basal lamina (hemocoel side) where the oocyst developed. Ookinetes were found in intra-, inter-, and extracellular locations within the midgut epithelium (not necessarily representing consecutive steps), but predominantly in the extracellular compartment. We observed that in this infection system, the invasion of the midgut was often complete before full polymerization of the peritrophic matrix. Of note, peritrophic matrix development is significantly retarded at the relatively low temperature (20.5 °C) necessary for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>Only 11% of the ookinetes in susceptible mosquitoes (15 out of 137) and none (out of 93) in refractory mosquitoes were judged to be intracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), indicating either that this phase is extremely transient or that only a minority of ookinetes invade the cytoplasm of midgut cells. Intracellular parasites are characterized by the absence of the midgut epithelial membrane covering the double parasite pellicle membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), signifying that ookinetes are in direct contact with the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells.

The time-points of midgut dissections were sufficiently early to detect intracellular phases of invasion, because ookinetes were still observed in the midgut lumen approaching the microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).</p><p>The vast majority of ookinetes in both mosquito strains were observed to be outside the midgut cells, but in extremely intimate contact with the midgut cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figure 1</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">1</xref>E), based on the observation of several sections. A triple membranous layer surrounding the ookinete is indicative of an inter- or extracellular location—that is, the outer membrane is contributed by the host midgut cell, and the inner two compose the pellicle membrane complex of the parasite. Importantly, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> ookinetes were extracellular (55.5% in G3 and 71% in L3–5) or intercellular (23% in G3 and 25% in L3–5) during the time of peak parasite death (24–33 hpi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>Apoptotic and necrotic cells were occasionally observed in both uninfected (not shown) and infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figure 1</xref>G) midguts, and healthy adjacent midgut cells extended filamentous cytoplasmic regions towards the dying cells. These extensions were organelle free and resembled the crawling lamellipodia or actin aggregates (described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b018">18</xref>]) that have been implicated in repair of the midgut epithelium. These zones often exhibited extensive membrane ruffling. Intercellular and extracellular ookinetes were sometimes found near extruding apoptotic midgut cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g001">Figure 1</xref>G), which did not appear to contain intracellular ookinetes.

The fine structure of the AZ was identical in L3–5 and G3 mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). However, there were important differences between the strains in terms of zone thickness, frequency, and association with dead ookinetes. Few ookinetes in G3 mosquitoes displayed an AZ, and when they did, the AZ was usually thin (&lt;200 nm) and surrounded both live (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">2</xref>B) and dead, lysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) ookinetes. However, melanization did not occur. In contrast, AZs were more frequently observed in L3–5 mosquito midguts, and formed exclusively around dead or dying ookinetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">2</xref>E). The zones were normally much thicker (&gt;500 nm) and always associated with melanization in this strain. Approximately 63% of all dead ookinetes within L3–5 midguts were surrounded by an AZ, compared with 53% of the dead parasites in G3 midguts, as judged by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Additionally, all of the dead ookinetes visible in our TEM study occurred in the extracellular or intercellular spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>H).

We found that the AZ occurs only in the most basal region of the midgut, where the parasite is almost invariably extracellular. The triple membrane arrangement around the parasite (including both the apical and basal regions of the ookinete) indicated that the AZ did not form as a parasite exited a damaged midgut cell, but rather surrounded an extracellular parasite. The AZ did not usually cover the entire ookinete surface, and its extent and location on the ookinete surface varied (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g003">3</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-0020133-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0020133.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Biochemical Composition and Characteristics of the AZ</title><p>Confocal sections and 3-D reconstructions of <italic>P. berghei-</italic>infected midgut tissues.</p><p>(A–D) Ookinetes in susceptible (G3) mosquitoes, fixed at 28 hpi and showing ookinetes without associated AZs (A and B) and with AZs (C).

The AZ was not stained by an antibody raised against non-polymerized or globular forms of α-actin, nor by anti-β-tubulin. Both antibodies nevertheless recognized ookinete proteins at sites corresponding to microtubule and cytoskeleton assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g003">Figure 3</xref>). However, polymerized or filamentous actin, as detected by the dye phalloidin, specifically stained the AZ (and midgut muscle fibers) in L3–5 and G3 mosquitoes, and did not stain the parasites.

These images also demonstrate that the AZ is often associated with shape constrictions of the parasite and can limit the dispersal of melanin pigment so that it appears concentrated at one end of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g003">Figure 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g003">3</xref>F). Ookinetes are known to be melanized first at their apical tips closest to the basal lamina, reflecting the hemocoelic origin of the PPO cascade precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b006">6</xref>]. Typically, melanin was deposited in the confined spaces between the AZ membrane and the ookinete in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g003">3</xref>F). In some rare cases, however, a triple layer was observed, consisting of first an AZ, then a melanin, and finally a second AZ layer (not shown). The association of the AZ with melanization and dead parasites led us to suspect that AZ formation could be a refractory killing mechanism, a hypothesis also suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b017">17</xref>].

Not surprisingly, the majority (84.9%) of ookinetes in refractory L3–5 mosquitoes were already dead by 28 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), and by 48 hpi, killing was almost total (99.5%), compared with just 13.4% at 24 hpi and 26.5% at 48 hpi in susceptible G3 mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In the G3 strain, only a small minority of parasites were surrounded by a phalloidin-stained AZ (1.8% at 24 hpi and 5.8% at 48 hpi overall). In contrast, in the L3–5 strain a phalloidin-positive AZ surrounded 41.2% and 22.3% of ookinetes at 24 hpi and 48 hpi, respectively. The relative weakness of the phalloidin staining in G3 mosquitoes meant that fewer dead parasites could be detected in association with the AZ than were observed by TEM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Melanization was absent in G3 mosquito midguts, but it was the predominant feature associated with ookinetes in L3–5 midguts (62.2% of all parasites at 28 hpi and 86.3% by 48 hpi were melanized). Furthermore, in this strain, we noted that the formation of the AZ was invariably accompanied by the appearance of melanin. These results strongly suggest that AZ formation in refractory insects is linked to, and possibly a consequence of, melanization. Of note, however, is that in the L3–5 strain, approximately one in four of all ookinetes at 28 hpi, and one in eight at 48 hpi, were dead but showed no evidence of melanization or a surrounding AZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g004">Figure 4</xref>B; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020133-g003">Figure 3</xref>I). We next investigated whether TEP1 activity, which is important for ookinete killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b004">4</xref>], could be correlated with formation of the AZ.

The above results show that TEP1 activity is required for AZ formation and ookinete melanization in addition to being required for ookinete killing. Two hypotheses can explain these observations. First, TEP1 could control ookinete killing directly by activating AZ formation and melanization. Alternatively, melanization and AZ formation might be triggered later by the death of parasites killed by TEP1-dependent mechanisms. Therefore, to determine whether formation of the AZ is lethal to ookinetes, we used dsRNA knockdown to disrupt actin polymerization (and thereby formation of the AZ), and gauged its effect on ookinete survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Knockdown of <italic>Fz2</italic> and <italic>Cdc42</italic> Reduces the Formation of the AZ and Melanization</title><p>To disrupt actin polymerization, we selected to knock down the genes <italic>Fz2</italic> and <italic>Cdc42,</italic> which both control cytoskeletal rearrangements.

Our TEM microscope studies consistently demonstrated that the ookinetes are predominantly located in the extracellular space, where they are exposed to hemocyte-derived soluble immunity factors, rather than in intracellular locations. We hypothesize that intracellular invasion is minimized to a very transient phase, and is localized to the most apical part of a single midgut cell at the microvillous (luminal) side of the epithelium and close to the cell junction. Thereafter, the ookinete rapidly exits the cell from the basal side, or moves laterally towards the basal lamina through the narrow intercellular space. Ookinetes finally reside in an extracellular space of the membranous labyrinth, next to the basal lamina. Significantly, dead ookinetes are found consistently in this compartment, and we conclude that the major site of ookinete killing is the extracellular space, where killing is mediated by hemocyte-derived soluble factors. The dead ookinetes are surrounded by a zone of polymerized actin (the AZ), which is formed in adjacent host epithelial cells. We used a combination of confocal fluorescent microscopy and TEM with RNAi technology to demonstrate that formation of the AZ structure is triggered specifically by the presence of a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> ookinete (a dead one in refractory mosquitoes) at the basal side of the midgut, and in the absence of apparent epithelial damage, as judged by TEM.</p><p>We further demonstrated that formation of the AZ is dependent on <italic>TEP1, Fz2,</italic> and <italic>Cdc42</italic>. We were interested in the possibility that formation of the AZ could be an ookinete killing mechanism in refractory mosquitoes. However, RNAi knockdown experiments, where we partially abolished the AZ and melanization, clearly established that in contrast to TEP1, Fz2 and Cdc42 do not induce killing of parasites. Our results separate the mechanisms of parasite killing from subsequent reactions manifested by AZ formation and melanization.</p><p>We propose that, in response to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, the mosquito mounts a form of wound-healing response that is directed towards a dead or dying ookinete. Classical midgut tissue repair/healing processes and AZ formation probably respond to a common basic stimulus (i.e., abnormal or damaged tissue), but in the case of AZ formation, it is a moribund parasite that provides this signal. The AZ reaction is characterized by actin polymerization and PPO activation, which is characterized by melanization in refractory mosquitoes.</p><p>We have now identified a component of the AZ as polymerized actin and shown that the presence of the AZ and melanin is a predominant feature associated with dead ookinetes in refractory mosquitoes. In our <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content>–<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> infection model, the AZ is morphologically distinct from other zones of polymerized actin that occur throughout the midgut, which assist the expulsion of dead epithelial cells and repair the remaining tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b018">18</xref>]. In contrast to this tissue repair process, the AZ is specifically provoked in the presence of a parasite, is only formed by the most basal part of the midgut cell, does not appear to facilitate cell expulsion, and is linked in an unknown way to melanization in refractory mosquitoes. All the midgut cells in contact with the ookinete contribute to the AZ, and all the cells appear to be healthy. Apoptosis and the extrusion of infected cells was also minimal in our study, suggesting that intracellular modes of ookinete killing are less prevalent in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. gambiae</named-content> infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. berghei</named-content> than in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. stephensi</named-content> infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b025">25</xref>]. However, it would be inappropriate to make direct comparisons between analyses involving different host–parasite species combinations. In our study, ookinetes did not undergo phagocytosis in the midgut. Midgut cells are non-phagocytic; furthermore, our TEM observations of ookinete phagocytosis by cultured mosquito cells in vitro were very distinct structurally from anything seen by us in the midgut (S. Shiao, unpublished data).</p><p>In our study, dsRNA knockdown of <italic>Cdc42</italic> and <italic>Fz2</italic> decreased AZ formation in refractory mosquitoes. Unexpectedly, melanization was also impaired, in terms of both intensity and the total number of melanized parasites. This strongly suggests a link between the AZ and melanization. The exact relationship between the AZ and melanization is complex and may also involve other factors, because a thinner AZ can form around a small percentage of non-melanized ookinetes in susceptible mosquitoes. In some arthropods the upstream phenoloxidase component of the melanization cascade can aid wound healing by cross-linking clot fibers, possibly via transglutaminase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b030">30</xref>]. Should this reaction occur in G3 mosquitoes, it would not result in easily detectable melanin, which is in contrast to the L3–5 strain, where production of melanin is overtly exaggerated and demonstrable with the tools used in our study. It would be interesting in this respect to determine whether, in susceptible G3 strain mosquitoes, the strength of AZ formation could be increased by the knockdowns of <italic>C-type lectin 4, SRPN2,</italic> or <italic>SRPN6,</italic> which lead to massive spontaneous melanization reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b031">31</xref>]. Furthermore, these knockdowns and double knockdowns of <italic>Fz2</italic>/<italic>SRPN6</italic> and <italic>Cdc42</italic>/<italic>SRPN6</italic> in L3–5 mosquitoes would provide more insight into the importance of melanization in AZ formation.</p><p>The role of Cdc42 in AZ actin polymerization in L3–5 mosquitoes was not unexpected, because in other animals this cytoplasmic Rho family guanosine triphosphate–binding protein controls a wide array of cellular processes, including filopodium formation (via activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, profilin, the Arp2/3 complex, and finally, actin nucleation; reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b033">33</xref>]). To our knowledge, however, this is the first study to implicate <italic>Fz2</italic> in the control of actin polymerization in adult insects, and <italic>Fz2</italic> and <italic>Cdc42</italic> in the melanization response. Frizzled proteins are seven-pass transmembrane cell surface receptors that mediate the Wnt protein signaling necessary for development and establishing cell polarity in several embryonic tissues in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> including the midgut epithelium and the developing primordium of the adult wing (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b036">36</xref>]). Many of these processes require coordination or remodeling of the cytoskeleton, especially at the apical side of polarized cells.</p><p>The double knockdown of <italic>Fz2/Cdc42</italic> did not significantly alter the single knockdown phenotype, implying that both molecules could be part of the same biochemical process, possibly with Fz2 acting as a transmembrane receptor upstream of the cytoplasmic Cdc42. Alternatively, the knockdowns were not sufficiently complete to allow us to detect a difference in the phenotype. The current data do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. Clearly, the parasites did not utilize host actin polymerization or Cdc42 activities to achieve intracellular invasion, a mode of invasion recruited by certain bacteria (e.g., <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Listeria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020133-b039">39</xref>]).
