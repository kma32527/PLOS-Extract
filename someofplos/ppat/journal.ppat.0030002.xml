				<article-title>Neutralizing Antibody Fails to Impact the Course of Ebola Virus Infection in Monkeys</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract><p>Ebola viruses are highly lethal human pathogens that have received considerable attention in recent years due to an increasing re-emergence in Central Africa and a potential for use as a biological weapon. There is no vaccine or treatment licensed for human use. In the past, however, important advances have been made in developing preventive vaccines that are protective in animal models. In this regard, we showed that a single injection of a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein completely protected rodents and nonhuman primates from lethal Ebola challenge. In contrast, progress in developing therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infections has been much slower and there is clearly an urgent need to develop effective post-exposure strategies to respond to future outbreaks and acts of bioterrorism, as well as to treat laboratory exposures. Here we tested the efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus-based Ebola vaccine vector in post-exposure treatment in three relevant animal models. In the guinea pig and mouse models it was possible to protect 50% and 100% of the animals, respectively, following treatment as late as 24 h after lethal challenge. More important, four out of eight rhesus macaques were protected if treated 20 to 30 min following an otherwise uniformly lethal infection. Currently, this approach provides the most effective post-exposure treatment strategy for Ebola infections and is particularly suited for use in accidentally exposed individuals and in the control of secondary transmission during naturally occurring outbreaks or deliberate release.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Being highly pathogenic for humans and monkeys and the subject of former weapons programs makes Ebola virus one of the most feared pathogens worldwide today. Due to a lack of licensed pre- and post-exposure intervention, our current response depends on rapid diagnostics, proper isolation procedures, and supportive care of case patients. Consequently, the development of more specific countermeasures is of high priority for the preparedness of many nations. In this study, we investigated an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, which had previously demonstrated convincing efficacy as a vaccine against Ebola infections in rodents and monkeys, for its potential use in the treatment of an Ebola virus infection. Surprisingly, treatment of guinea pigs and mice as late as 24 h after lethal Ebola virus infection resulted in 50% and 100% survival, respectively. More important, 50% of rhesus macaques (4/8) were protected if treated 20 to 30 min after Ebola virus infection. Currently, this approach provides the most effective treatment strategy for Ebola infections and seems particularly suited for the use in accidental exposures and the control of human-to-human transmission during outbreaks.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work on filoviruses at the National Microbiology Laboratory was supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, a grant awarded to HF from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP-43921), and a grant awarded to SMJ from Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Research and Technology Initiative (CRTI).

In addition to the sporadic outbreaks that have occurred in humans in Central Africa since 1976 and caused more than 1,800 human infections with a lethality rate ranging from 53% to 90%, Ebola virus (EBOV) has also decimated populations of wild apes in this same region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b004">4</xref>]. At this time, there is no preventive vaccine or post-exposure treatment option available for human use.</p><p>Much remains to be learned about these highly virulent viruses; however, important advances have been made over the last decade in understanding how filoviruses cause disease and in developing preventive vaccines that are protective in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b005">5</xref>]. For example, a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vaccine completely protected nonhuman primates from uniformly lethal ZEBOV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b007">7</xref>]. More recently, we generated live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) expressing the transmembrane glycoproteins (GP) of ZEBOV (VSVŒîG/ZEBOVGP) and MARV (VSVŒîG/MARVGP) and the glycoprotein precursor of Lassa virus (VSVŒîG/LASVGPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b008">8</xref>] and showed that these completely protected cynomolgus macaques against lethal challenge with the corresponding filoviruses and arenavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b010">10</xref>]. Progress in developing therapeutic interventions against the filoviruses has been much slower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b005">5</xref>]. Limited success was achieved in using an anticoagulant to treat EBOV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b011">11</xref>], and very recently the VSV-based MARV vaccine platform (VSVŒîG/MARVGP) demonstrated astonishing efficacy in post-exposure treatment of MARV-infected macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b012">12</xref>]. Other than that, no post-exposure modality has been able to protect nonhuman primates against lethal filovirus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>There is clearly an urgent need to develop filovirus-specific effective post-exposure strategies to respond to future outbreaks in Central Africa, to counter acts of bioterrorism, and to treat laboratory exposures such as the recent EBOV exposures that occurred in the United States and Russian laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b016">16</xref>]. Post-exposure vaccine treatment is successful in preventing or modifying viral diseases such as rabies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b018">18</xref>], hepatitis B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b019">19</xref>], and smallpox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b021">21</xref>] in humans, as well as MARV HF in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b012">12</xref>]. However, the faster disease course and higher lethality of ZEBOV in human and nonhuman primates may limit the success of a similar approach for EBOV HF. Here, we show remarkable efficacy of the VSV-based EBOV vaccine platform in the post-exposure treatment of rodents and nonhuman primates infected with ZEBOV. Currently, this is the most promising post-exposure treatment strategy for EBOV HF and is particularly suited for use in accidentally exposed individuals and in the control of transmission in the event of natural or deliberate outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Vaccine Vectors and ZEBOV Challenge Viruses</title><p>The recombinant VSV expressing the GPs of ZEBOV (strain Mayinga), MARV (strain Musoke), or Lassa virus (strain Josiah) were generated as described recently using the infectious clone for the VSV, Indiana serotype (kindly provided by J.

Far less progress has been made in developing treatment interventions for EBOV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b014">14</xref>]. Thus, there is clearly a need to develop effective strategies to respond to future EBOV outbreaks in Africa and to counter acts of bioterrorism using EBOV. Additionally, the potential EBOV exposure involving a researcher at a United States Army laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b016">16</xref>] and the unfortunate death of a Russian scientist after an accidental exposure to EBOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b015">15</xref>], underscore the need for medical countermeasures for post-exposure prophylaxis. Recently, a post-exposure strategy to mitigate the coagulation disorders that typify filoviral infections improved survival from 0% to 33% in the rhesus macaque model of ZEBOV HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b011">11</xref>]. Here, we show a significant advance in treating EBOV infections.</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the VSV-based EBOV vaccine vector in post-exposure treatment in three relevant animal models. In the mouse model it was possible to protect all animals following challenge with treatment as late as 24 h post infection. It is known from previous data that treatments and vaccines given to mice are more effective than seen in guinea pigs and nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b013">13</xref>]. However, in this case it was possible to protect over 50% of guinea pigs and 50% of nonhuman primates from uniformly lethal ZEBOV challenge. It should be noted that mice received about 10 or 100 times more vaccine per weight than guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, respectively. Thus, it is possible that further optimization of dosing strategies could improve the results.</p><p>The rhesus macaques that survived infection all controlled the virus within the first 6 d of infection. The data clearly show that moderate or high-level viraemia on day 6 invariably resulted in a fatal outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030002-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In the current study, we can conclude that neutralizing antibodies were not essential for infection control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030002-g003">Figure 3</xref>) since they were not detected until after the animals had cleared the EBOV infection. Circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were reduced in number in all animals regardless of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030002-t001">Table 1</xref>); this indicates that the initial control of infection may not require classical T-cell responses. The time course for EBOV HF in rhesus macaques is very short (‚àº8 d) and therefore, CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-cell responses are very unlikely to be involved in the control of the infection because the cell numbers of specific responding cells could not have peaked until after the infection was controlled. The primary immune correlate of protection seems to be the rapid development of non-neutralizing antibody that was only seen in the protected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030002-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This, coupled with the NK-cell increase in the VSVŒîG/ZEBOVGP-treated animals, may have resulted in significantly enhanced killing of virus-infected primary target cells and, consequently, elimination of the ZEBOV infection. An important role of NK cells for protection has also been described for immunization with virus-like particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b029">29</xref>].</p><p>Clearly, the adaptive response is essential to promote survival as animals immunized with the control VSV-based vaccines succumbed to the ZEBOV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030002-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030002-t001">Table 1</xref>). Both control animals died on day 8, which is the historical mean for rhesus monkeys infected by the same route and dose with this seed stock (historical <italic>n</italic> = 23). However, other mechanisms probably contribute as well. Recently, Noble and colleagues described a new paradigm for an interfering vaccine in which one of the antiviral mechanisms of action is intracellular interference with the replication of the lethal wild-type virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b030">30</xref>]. In the current study, the VSV vectors exploit the EBOV GP, which largely determines host cell tropism and mediates viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b031">31</xref>]. We have demonstrated that the VSV vectors expressing the ZEBOV GP will infect the same cells as wild-type ZEBOV in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b008">8</xref>]. Also, the VSVŒîG/ZEBOVGP vectors replicate significantly faster than wild-type ZEBOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b008">8</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that these vectors compete with ZEBOV through viral interference. Clearly, even mild to moderate inhibition of ZEBOV replication may delay the course of infection and tip the balance in the favor of the host.</p><p>VSV has been shown to be a potent inducer of the innate and adaptive immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b032">32</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b034">34</xref>]. In contrast, EBOV has acquired mechanisms to counteract the innate immune responses of the host at different levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b035">35</xref>]. The virion protein (VP) 35 of ZEBOV functions as an inhibitor of type I interferon production by blocking the activation of IRF-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b036">36</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b038">38</xref>]. In addition to VP35, the ZEBOV protein VP24 functions as an inhibitor of type I interferon signaling by blocking nuclear accumulation of activated STAT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b039">39</xref>]. Recently, it was suggested that VP24 blocks the downstream signaling cascades activated by type I interferon by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b040">40</xref>]. Therefore, treatment with the VSV vectors might induce or boost the innate immune response in the host, and thus, counteract the immune inhibitory effect of EBOV. In this case, the host will mount a nonspecific innate immune response allowing for time to develop a specific adaptive response that can overcome the EBOV infection and again tip the balance in favor of survival of the host.</p><p>In a historical context, it is important to note that the mechanism for post-exposure protection of humans against smallpox and rabies are also not fully understood. For post-exposure treatment of rabies, levels of neutralizing antibodies have been used as a measure of protection. However, several studies of HIV-infected patients with likely or proven exposure to rabies showed that these patients failed to develop neutralizing antibodies after post-exposure rabies vaccination, yet there were no reports of death of these patients attributed to rabies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b042">42</xref>]. Moreover, studies in mice suggest that cell-mediated immunity may play an essential role in post-exposure protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b043">43</xref>]. In the case of smallpox, post-exposure protection is presumed to be due in part to differences in the route of exposure and growth kinetics of the wild-type variola virus versus the vaccinia vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b020">20</xref>]. Briefly, infection with variola usually starts in the upper and lower respiratory tract with subsequent spread to lymphoid tissues. Thus, the natural variola infection proceeds much slower than post-exposure i.m. vaccinia vaccination, which bypasses the respiratory tract infection. In addition, it appears that vaccinia has a shorter incubation period than variola virus resulting in a more rapid development of cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibody. However, a recent study using monkeypox in the macaque model demonstrated better results with antiviral therapy than post-exposure vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b044">44</xref>].</p><p>Post-exposure treatment with the VSV-based MARV vaccine vector against MARV challenge was more potent and resulted in complete survival, no disease, and undetectable viraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b012">12</xref>]. The development of symptoms and viraemia in MARV-infected rhesus monkeys is delayed compared with ZEBOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b045">45</xref>], which may explain the difference in efficacy in post-exposure treatment with the VSV-based vectors. The efficacy of the VSV-based EBOV vector in post-exposure treatment might be increased by a higher treatment dose or multiple treatments over a longer period of time as is being done in post-exposure treatment of rabies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b046">46</xref>]. Alternatively, combination therapy should be considered to increase therapeutic efficacy. In the case of EBOV, post-exposure treatment with the VSV-based EBOV vector could be combined with the previously published post-exposure strategy to mitigate the coagulation disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030002-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the VSV-based ZEBOV vaccine currently provides the most effective and promising single treatment strategy for EBOV HF. It is likely that the mechanism of protection by the VSV-based vaccine is multifactorial; while NK cells and antibody responses appear to be important to survival, viral interference and innate immune response are almost certainly essential in delaying the progression of the ZEBOV infection and extending the window for the adaptive response to become functional.</p><p>Post-exposure treatment is particularly suited for use in accidentally exposed individuals and in the control of secondary transmission during naturally occurring outbreaks or deliberate releases. Our results also suggest that this VSV platform might be even more beneficial as a fast-acting single-shot preventive vaccine. Finally, this system also provides an excellent opportunity to study the fundamental mechanisms that lead to such devastating disease following infection with ZEBOV.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="ppat-0030002-sg001" mimetype="image/tiff" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030002.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Weight Loss of Mice and Guinea Pigs Given Post-Exposure Treatment for ZEBOV Infection</p><p>(A) Mice (groups of five animals) were infected with 1,000 LD<sub>50</sub> of MA-ZEBOV by i.p. injection.
