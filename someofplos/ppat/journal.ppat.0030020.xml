Although high-resolution structural snapshots of viral fusion proteins in their prefusion and postfusion conformations are available, it has been difficult to define intermediate structures of the fusion pathway because of their transient nature. Flaviviruses possess a class II viral fusion protein (E) mediating fusion at acidic pH that is converted from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure during the fusion process. Here we show for tick-borne encephalitis virus that exposure of virions to alkaline instead of acidic pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH, however, leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. Thus, the use of nonphysiological conditions allows a dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and the identification of two separate steps, in which membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events provides important new insights for understanding the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The fusion of cellular lipid membranes is an essential process in all forms of life. Such membranes are also part of a specific structural class of viruses—so-called enveloped viruses—that include influenza virus, HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, yellow fever virus, and many others. The fusion of the viral with a cellular membrane is a key step in the life cycle of these viruses and allows the delivery of their genetic information into cells. This entry step is controlled by specific proteins at the viral surface that are primed to undergo dramatic structural changes and thus drive membrane fusion. An interference with this process can be a powerful means for inhibiting virus replication and fusion inhibitors have recently become a valuable addition to the armamentarium of anti-HIV treatments. In the present study, we identified an intermediate of the fusion pathway of flaviviruses, which comprise mosquito- and tick-transmitted viruses such as yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. This work has generated further insights into the mechanism of flavivirus membrane fusion and can thus provide new leads for the development of antiviral agents against these important human pathogens.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (“Fonds zur Foerderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung”), FWF project number P16535-B09.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Stiasny K, Kössl C, Lepault J, Rey FA, Heinz FX (2007) Characterization of a structural intermediate of flavivirus membrane fusion.

Many enveloped viruses use only a single protein to mediate the fusion of their membrane with a cellular membrane during virus entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b004">4</xref>], which makes them a particularly interesting system for understanding the membrane fusion process in mechanistic terms. A common property of viral fusion proteins is their presence at the surface of mature virions in a metastable conformation that, when exposed to an appropriate trigger (receptor interactions, acidic pH, or a combination of both), undergoes structural rearrangements to drive the merger of the viral membrane with a membrane of the target cell (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b003">3</xref>]). In the course of these conformational changes, the fusion proteins expose a segment of the polypeptide chain (“fusion peptide” [FP]) that inserts into the cellular membrane to initiate the fusion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>Distinct structural classes of viral fusion proteins have been identified, displaying radically different architectures and organizations on the virion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b006">6</xref>]. Class I proteins, which form trimeric spikes, are found in orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses. The class II proteins of flaviviruses and alphaviruses lie tangentially to the viral membrane and form an icosahedral oligomeric network at the virion surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b008">8</xref>]. A third category of fusion proteins with features of both class I and class II has been recently described for vesicular stomatitis and herpes simplex 1 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b010">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite the altogether different architecture of fusion protein classes, certain similarities in their overall postfusion conformation suggest that the corresponding fusion processes are mechanistically related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b012">12</xref>]. A key feature in this context is the formation of a “hairpin”-like trimeric postfusion structure, bringing into contact the C-terminal membrane anchor with the target-membrane inserted FP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b012">12</xref>]. The available crystal structures of the prefusion and postfusion conformations represent only snapshots at the start and at the end of a process that proceeds through a set of intermediate states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b013">13</xref>]. A better understanding of the membrane fusion reaction demands the characterization of the postulated intermediates. Such intermediates have been identified for class I fusion proteins by the use of specific fusion inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b020">20</xref>], by using modified recombinant forms of the fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b024">24</xref>], or by the sequential application of different triggers (avian sarcoma and leukosis retroviruses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b026">26</xref>]. In the case of the class II alphavirus fusion protein E1, it was possible to stabilize an intermediate trimeric core by the addition of one of its domains in soluble form, which prevents the formation of the final postfusion hairpin-like structure and thus inhibits fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we use tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus as a model to dissect the class II flavivirus membrane fusion pathway and the associated structural rearrangements of the envelope protein E. We found a monomeric conformation of E that can be postulated as a transient intermediate of the fusion pathway. TBE virus is a member of the flavivirus genus (family Flaviviridae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b028">28</xref>], which encompasses a number of other important human pathogens such as yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Mature flavivirus particles are characterized by an external icosahedral glycoprotein cage formed by 90 dimers of E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>D) that completely cover the viral membrane and mediate both receptor-binding and membrane fusion. The crystal structures of the E ectodomain (termed “sE”) were determined for TBE and dengue viruses in both their prefusion and postfusion conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b036">36</xref>]. In the prefusion form, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>B, the three domains of sE are aligned along a rod-like molecule, with the C terminus and the FP lying at the two distal ends of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b036">36</xref>]. In full-length E, the sE segment connects to the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) segments via an element of about 50 amino acids (called “stem”) that contains two α-helices, H1 and H2, which are peripherally attached to the viral membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b037">37</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The internal FP loop—located at the tip of domain (D)II—is buried at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>B). Dissociation of the E dimer into monomers, with concomitant exposure of the FP to allow its interaction with target membranes, occurs by breaking of the intradimeric and interdimeric contacts at the virion surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b039">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Under physiological conditions, this process is triggered by the acidic pH in endosomes during receptor-mediated endocytosis and rapidly followed by E trimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b040">40</xref>]. The structure of sE in the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) shows that DIII is displaced from its original location and thus becomes positioned at the side of DI with its C terminus pointing toward the FP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>G, and 1H). This movement results in the formation of a hairpin structure, suggesting that in the full-length postfusion form of E, the TM segments and the FP are juxtaposed in the fused membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).</p><fig id="ppat-0030020-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030020.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Summary of the Structural Organization and Different Conformations of the Flavivirus Envelope Protein E</title><p>(A) Schematic top view of the organization of the sE protein dimer as present at the surface of mature virions, color-coded according to the three domains (DI, DII, and DIII).

Thus, E dimer dissociation with concomitant glycoprotein cage disassembly, allowing interactions of monomeric pre-hairpin intermediates with target membranes, can be induced without the subsequent E trimerization and completion of the fusion process. The monomeric conformation of E is obtained by exposing TBE virions to alkaline pH instead of the physiological acidic pH. Full fusion, however, can be induced by subsequent exposure to acidic pH, leading to hairpin formation and E trimerization, which drive the merger of the two lipid bilayers. The demonstration of a membrane-inserted prehairpin intermediate has important implications for the existing models of class II viral membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of Alkaline pH on the Virion Envelope Organization</title><p>In addition to the physiological trigger, the fusogenic conformational change of a number of class I membrane fusion proteins can be induced by alternative treatments such as slightly denaturing conditions (exposure to elevated temperature or urea). This is the case for the influenza virus hemagglutinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b041">41</xref>] and the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b043">43</xref>] and retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b044">44</xref>]. With TBE virus, in contrast, similar treatments had no functional effect and led to E protein denaturation only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b045">45</xref>]. In a further attempt to identify alternative triggers and structural intermediates of flavivirus fusion, we investigated the effect of alkaline pH on the envelope organization and fusion-related processes of TBE virus. Purified virus samples in a pH 8.0 buffer were exposed to pH 10.0 and 5.4, respectively, solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to rate-zonal centrifugation, in order to compare the oligomeric state of E in these preparations. As expected, solubilization in Triton X-100 yielded E protein dimers at pH 8.0 and trimers at pH 5.4, whereas at pH 10.0, only E monomers were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), indicating that alkaline pH causes a considerable weakening of the interaction forces of the E dimer.

In addition to its fusion activity, the other entry functions of E in virions are apparently preserved or can be completely restored after alkaline pH treatment.

For class I viral fusion, such intermediates have been described both at the structural level in relation to the fusion protein (“prehairpin intermediates”) and at the mechanistic level in relation to the merger of the membranes (“hemifusion”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b013">13</xref>]. Their identification was certainly facilitated by the fact that the conformational transitions and concomitantly the class I–mediated fusion process are quite slow (half-life of several minutes) and therefore provides a long window of opportunities for the interaction of inhibitors with structural fusion intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b050">50</xref>]. The fusion machinery of flaviviruses, in contrast, is extremely fast (half-life of about 2 s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b051">51</xref>], and the trapping of intermediates or the inhibition of fusion by similar principles has not yet been described. As shown in our study, however, it is possible to separate the flavivirus fusion process into two discrete stages by the application of alkaline pH, which triggers only the formation of a prehairpin intermediate and its interaction with target membranes but not hairpin formation and membrane fusion.</p><p>The smooth icosahedral glycoprotein cage of mature virions is sensitive to the environmental pH being stable in a limited pH range and opens up when exposed to either an alkaline or acidic milieu. Such “opening up” of the cage appears to be caused by simultaneous dissociation of the 90 E dimers that at neutral pH are interlocked in a “herringbone” pattern at the virus surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). As suggested by solubilization and sedimentation analyses and the rough contour of alkaline pH–treated virions in electron micrographs, alkaline pH treatment results in E monomers protruding from the surface and thus exposing their FP loops at the distal tip. Such a pattern is likely to allow an efficient multivalent interaction of the FP with the target membrane. Indeed, the high avidity of the interaction resulting from multiple E protomers is reflected in the capacity of the particles to coflotate with liposomes, whereas the same test using isolated sE dimers exposed to alkaline pH results in no detectable binding to membranes (unpublished data). This difference could be due to the lack of the stem-anchor region in sE, but inhibition studies with an FP-specific monoclonal antibody support the interpretation that the observed virion–liposome interactions at alkaline pH are indeed mediated by the FP loop, analogous to the interactions observed when E dimers dissociate under physiological conditions at acidic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b039">39</xref>].</p><p>What is the likely conformation of the E monomers at the virus surface upon dimer dissociation? The “hinge” region between DI and DII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>B) has been reported to allow different angles between these two domains in different crystal structures of the dengue virus E protein, depending on the crystal packing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b036">36</xref>]. A slight bend between DI and DII is apparently needed in the sE dimer for the FP to fit in a pocket between DI and DIII in the partner subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>B). Structural studies on the homologous protein from Semliki Forest virus, which has been crystallized as a monomer, suggest that in the “relaxed” form, i.e., in the absence of oligomeric interactions, the molecule forms a straight rod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b052">52</xref>]. It is therefore likely that the sE segment also forms a straight rod in the monomeric form and that the flexibility at the connection between DIII and H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) is sufficient for E to project from the virion surface.</p><p>There is experimental evidence that intermediates of the E dimer–trimer transition interact with target membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b039">39</xref>], but it was not clear whether trimerization can occur before DIII relocation and hairpin formation. Inspection of the postfusion trimer shows that the most important trimer contacts are provided by (i) the AB loop in DI in a conformation that is only generated after displacement of DIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>G) and (ii) interactions of the external surface of DI with relocated DIII, which functions as an external clamp for stabilizing the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">1</xref>H). These structural considerations together with our experimental data thus favor the conclusion that the initial target membrane binding is mediated by multiple copies of monomeric E intermediates in their prehairpin conformation and that DIII relocation and trimerization are concomitant. Although alkaline pH treatment leads to E dimer dissociation and thus generates monomeric intermediates, it apparently does not disrupt the intramolecular DI–DIII interactions required for DIII relocation. Based on the presence of two strictly conserved histidine residues at the DI–DIII contact site (His146 in DI and His323 in DIII), we had postulated previously that protonation of these side chains by acidic pH may be important for the destabilization of the DI–DIII interactions in the protomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b033">33</xref>]. The observed inhibition of dengue virus fusion by soluble DIII present during the low pH treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b027">27</xref>] can be explained by the fact that exogenous DIII is unconstrained and can bind and stabilize an intermediate form of E before the endogenous DIII can reach its correct location to form a hairpin. In electron micrographs taken at acidic pH, the virus particles display thick knob-like radial projections consistent with the structure of E trimers in their postfusion conformation. This suggests that the E protomers not interacting with the target membrane trimerize and insert their FPs into the viral membrane through the relocation of DIII and concomitant placement of the stem into lateral grooves (as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030020-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).</p><p>The formation of a monomeric prehairpin intermediate suggests a new possibility: because only a subset of the E protomers can reach and interact with the target membrane, it cannot be ruled out that their subsequent trimerization may lead to “mixed trimers,” with individual subunits inserted into the target and others into the viral membrane. Such mixed trimers would have an even stronger destabilizing effect on the two membranes, greatly favoring the generation of a hemifusion stalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b053">53</xref>] and the subsequent completion of the membrane fusion reaction.</p><p>In the case of flaviviruses, the involvement of a monomeric intermediate was anticipated because membrane fusion requires a rearrangement of E dimers into trimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b053">53</xref>]. Similarly, trimerization and hairpin formation of the related class II fusion protein E1 of alphaviruses also requires the prior dissociation into a monomeric form, in this case from its heterodimeric partner E2 in mature virions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b054">54</xref>]).

Even in the case of class I fusion proteins, in which the oligomeric state is trimeric in both conformations, there are important differences in the trimer interfaces of their prefusion and postfusion forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b058">58</xref>], and a putative transient dissociation of the prefusion trimer cannot be ruled out.

The cross-linked virions were then concentrated by pelleting in a Ti90 rotor (Beckman) at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended, solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 5% polyacrylamide gels according to Maizel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b062">62</xref>]. Staining was performed with Coomassie blue R-250.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Coflotation of virions with liposomes.</title><p>Virions were mixed with liposomes at a ratio of 1 μg of virus to 100 nmol of lipid. The virus–liposome mixture was incubated for 10 min at a virus concentration of 45 μg/ml and 37 °C at alkaline pH (pH 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, and 10.5) and adjusted to 20% (w/w) sucrose in CAPS buffer (50 mM CAPS, 100 mM NaCl) at the corresponding pH in a final volume of 2 ml as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b039">39</xref>]. For controls, the virions were incubated in the presence of liposomes at pH 5.4 (positive control) or pH 8.0 (negative control). The 2-ml virus–liposome mixture was then applied to a 50% cushion and overlaid with 1 ml of 5% (w/w) sucrose. Centrifugation was carried out for 1.5 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 55 rotor, and fractions were collected by upward displacement.

A drop of the virus or virus–liposome suspensions was deposited on an air-glow discharged carbon-coated grid. The drop was blotted with filter paper, and the grid was washed with a 2% phosphotungstic acid solution adjusted to pH 6.0 (sample acidic pH) or 8.0 (samples at pH 8.0 and 10.0). The grids were observed in a CM12 electron microscope (Philips, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.philips.nl" xlink:type="simple">http://www.philips.nl</ext-link>) operated at 80 kV, and the micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO163 image plates developed for 5 min in D19.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Fusion assay.</title><p>Fusion of pyrene-labeled virions with liposomes was measured by monitoring the decrease in pyrene excimer fluorescence caused by the dilution of pyrene-labeled phospholipids in the viral membrane into the unlabeled liposome membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030020-b060">60</xref>].
