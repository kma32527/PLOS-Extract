AnTx is composed of three proteins: protective antigen (PA), edema factor, and lethal factor (LF). PA is not toxic but serves to bind cells and translocate the toxic edema factor or LF moieties to the cytosol. Recently, the low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein LRP6 has been reported to mediate internalization and lethality of AnTx. Based on its similarity to LRP6, we hypothesized that LRP5 may also play a role in cellular uptake of AnTx. We assayed PA-dependent uptake of anthrax LF or a cytotoxic LF fusion protein (FP59) in cells and mice harboring targeted deletions of <italic>Lrp5</italic> or <italic>Lrp6</italic>. Unexpectedly, we observed that uptake was unaltered in the presence or absence of either Lrp5 or Lrp6 expression. Moreover, we observed efficient PA-mediated uptake into anthrax toxin receptor (ANTXR)–deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (PR230) that had been stably engineered to express either human <italic>ANTXR1</italic> or human <italic>ANTXR2</italic> in the presence or absence of siRNA specific for LRP5 or LRP6. Our results demonstrate that neither LRP5 nor LRP6 is necessary for PA-mediated internalization or lethality of anthrax lethal toxin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The effects of many pathogenic bacteria are caused by the toxins they release. The toxin released by bacteria that cause anthrax is particularly fascinating since it is made of three different proteins: edema factor, lethal factor, and protective antigen (PA). On their own, each of these proteins is harmless, but when combined, they are deadly. This is because edema factor and lethal factor can exert their poisonous effects only after they have been moved into cells by PA. Determining exactly how PA does this is seen as a critical step in developing medicines that will fight anthrax. That is why a recent report suggesting that LRP6, an outer cell protein, was needed for PA to move the other toxin proteins into cells, was greeted with such interest. However, we now show that mice or cells lacking LRP6, or a related protein called LRP5, are still susceptible to anthrax toxin. The discovery that PA can move lethal factor and edema factor into cells without the help of LRP6 presents a significant challenge to the previously published model. These findings will help focus the efforts of scientists working on new ways to treat anthrax.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Young JJ, Bromberg-White JL, Zylstra C, Church JT, Boguslawski E, et al.

Early work with animal models for anthrax established a central role for an exotoxin (anthrax toxin [AnTx]) in its pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b002">2</xref>]. AnTx is comprised of three proteins: protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF). PA, by itself, is not toxic. Instead, it serves to translocate EF or LF to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b006">6</xref>]. LF is a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-metalloprotease which specifically cleaves the NH<sub>2</sub>-termini of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs) 1–4, 6, and 7, but not MKK 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b010">10</xref>], resulting in their inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b012">12</xref>]. Combinations of PA plus EF or LF are respectively referred to as edema toxin or lethal toxin (LeTx) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b013">13</xref>]. In vitro, treatment of some murine macrophage–derived cell lines with LeTx causes abrupt cell death by lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b014">14</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030027-sv001">Video S1</xref>).</p><p>Two cell surface receptors for PA (anthrax toxin receptor [ANTXR] 1 and 2) have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b016">16</xref>]. Following binding to ANTXR, PA is cleaved by cell surface–associated furin, removing a 20-kDa fragment and leaving a 63-kDa fragment attached to the receptor. This step is necessary to reveal a binding site for EF or LF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b017">17</xref>], as well as to remove steric hindrances to its subsequent oligomerization into a heptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b019">19</xref>].

LRP6 and the closely related LRP5 are grouped together as a distinct subfamily of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor–like proteins, based upon their common distinctive extracellular structure consisting of four repeats of a prototypic YWTD β-propeller-EGF-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b025">25</xref>].

These observations formed the basis for their conclusion that LRP6 was essential for PA-dependent uptake into cells.

To knock down <italic>Lrp</italic> expression in these cells, we tested three siRNA for <italic>Lrp5</italic> and three siRNA for <italic>Lrp6</italic>. Although these siRNAs were designed to inhibit mouse mRNA, we expect that hamster sequences will be highly homologous, if not identical; the hamster mRNA sequence obtained for regions of Lrp5 and Lrp6 that we used to design our PCR primers were 91%–95% identical to those published for mice (unpublished data). Using real-time PCR, we established that <italic>Lrp5</italic>-siRNA2 and <italic>Lrp5</italic>-siRNA3 were most effective in reducing <italic>Lrp5</italic> expression, and <italic>Lrp6</italic>-siRNA1 was most effective for reducing <italic>Lrp6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

Antibodies against Lrp6 did not work well in immunoblots (unpublished data), so we indirectly assayed Lrp6 protein expression by assaying the ability of siRNA-treated cells to bind the Lrp6 ligand DKK-1. Whereas treatment of PR230-CHO cells with Lrp6 siRNA-1 caused a clear reduction in DKK-1 binding, treatment with control siRNA did not cause any discernable loss of DKK-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>D).

Before it can do this, PA must bind a cell surface receptor. Cell surface receptors for PA (ANTXRs) have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b016">16</xref>]. The first receptor identified (ANTXR1) was a splice variant (sv2) of TEM8, a protein of unknown function that is up-regulated in colorectal cancer endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b047">47</xref>]. Young and colleagues now report that of three TEM8 splice variants tested, two (sv1 and sv2) function as an ANTXR, while the third (sv3) does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b016">16</xref>]. sv1 and sv2 differ only in the length of their cytoplasmic tails, but analysis of ANTXR1 deletion mutants indicates that this tail is dispensable for receptor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b045">45</xref>]. More recently, Scobie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b016">16</xref>] identified a second receptor (ANTXR2) encoded by capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2). As this name suggests, ANTXR2 is a protein which is up-regulated during endothelial cell morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b048">48</xref>]. Both ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 are ubiquitously expressed, making it likely that the participation of each is relevant to the pathology of anthrax.</p><p>Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>] made a well-reasoned argument that LRP6 is essential for PA-dependent internalization of AnTx. Based on their initial findings, we further tested the requirement for not only Lrp6, but also Lrp5, in PA-dependent uptake of FP59 or LF. However, our results have directed us to the opinion that neither Lrp5 nor Lrp6 is essential for PA-dependent uptake into cells. This position is supported by three independent and compelling lines of evidence. First, mice with targeted deletions of <italic>Lrp5</italic> or <italic>Lrp6</italic> are as sensitive as wild-type mice to intravenous injections of anthrax LeTx. Second, wild-type MEFs and MEFs lacking expression of <italic>Lrp5</italic> or <italic>Lrp6</italic> are equally capable of internalizing either FP59 or LF in a PA-dependent fashion. Finally, knockdown of <italic>Lrp5</italic> or <italic>Lrp6</italic> with siRNA neither alters the sensitivity of CHO cells expressing ANTXR1 or ANTXR2 to FP59 nor prevents NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal proteolysis of MEK1 by LF. Thus, the available evidence does not support the hypothesis that either LRP5 or LRP6 plays an essential role in PA-mediated uptake.</p><p>We propose several alternative explanations for the discrepancy between our results and those of Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>First, LRP6 may function in a species-specific fashion. Though Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>] presented data from both human M2182 prostate carcinoma cells and mouse RAW264.7 macrophages, the protection conferred by siRNA in the latter was only modest (an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase in the IC<sub>50</sub>) when compared to that in the former (&gt;100-fold increase in the IC<sub>50</sub>). Perhaps RAW264.7 cells, as well as MEF and CHO cells, express a splice variant of <italic>Lrp6</italic> that is resistant to siRNA treatment? This seems unlikely given the highly conserved nature of <italic>LRP6;</italic> LRP6 and Lrp6 share 97% protein sequence identity<italic>.</italic> Moreover, though the Ensembl browser (version 41, October 2006; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>) does predict a novel splice variant of human, but not mouse <italic>Lrp5</italic> containing an additional exon (2 base pair [bp]) between exons 13 and 14, splice variants of <italic>Lrp6</italic> have been not been characterized or predicted based on human or mouse genomic sequence. Alternatively, perhaps human ANTXRs are uniquely dependent upon LRP6 function. However, the CHO cells we used in this study expressed only human ANTXR1 or ANTXR2. Since these cells were equally sensitive to AnTx in the presence or absence of siRNA specific for Lrp5 or Lrp6, this indicates that 1) human ANTXR can bind and internalize AnTx in the absence of (human) LRP5 or LRP6, and 2) human ANTXRs do not have a general requirement for (murine) Lrp5 or Lrp6 in their function.</p><p>Second, LRP6 may function in a cell-specific manner. We cannot exclude this possibility. However, Lrp6 function is compromised even in heterozygous null mice since heterozygous expression genetically enhances a Wnt mutant phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b028">28</xref>]. Therefore, we argue that if LRP6 does function in a cell-specific manner, it is unlikely that sensitive cell types will play a significant role in the pathology of anthrax LeTx since heterozygous knockout mice are as sensitive to LeTx as their wild-type counterparts are. Thus, targeting of LRP6 will not likely prove useful in protecting against the effects of accumulated toxin during the late stages of anthrax disease when antibacterial methods normally are no longer of therapeutic value.</p><p>Third, LRP6 may function in a receptor-specific fashion. In support of this, our PCR analysis of the MEFs used in our study and the M2182 and RAW264.7 cells used by Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>] indicate these cell types differentially express <italic>ANTXR</italic>1 and <italic>ANTXR</italic>2. Despite this, knockdown of either <italic>Lrp5</italic> or <italic>Lrp6</italic> by siRNA failed to protect CHO cells expressing one or the other receptor from PA-mediated entry of FP59 or LF. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that LRP5 or LRP6 functions in a receptor-specific fashion.</p><p>Fourth, it is possible that LRP5 and LRP6 are functionally redundant with regard to PA-mediated uptake. However, we observed that mouse and hamster cells deficient for both <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> expression are as sensitive to PA-mediated uptake as are control cells expressing both <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic>. Further, since real-time PCR analysis of CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030027-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and M2182 cells (unpublished data) indicates that both cell types express <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6,</italic> the insensitivity of M2182 cells to PA-mediated toxicity following <italic>Lrp6</italic> knockdown is not likely explained by a deficiency in <italic>Lrp5</italic> expression. Finally, though the organization of the extracellular domains of LRP5 and LRP6 are similar to each other, they are markedly different from that of other LDL receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b049">49</xref>]. So while we cannot exclude the possibility that LRP6 is functionally redundant with another LDL receptor, this possibility is remote.</p><p>Finally, the antisense screen used by Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>] identified a human EST (image clone 285207) corresponding to an intronic region between exons 21 and 22 of <italic>Lrp6</italic>. Although the clone harboring this EST showed decreased levels of Lrp6 protein, the lack of a direct relationship between the EST and its apparent target <italic>Lrp6</italic> mRNA raises concerns regarding its specificity. Indeed, Wei and colleagues also reported that the same EST matches a sequence of the non-coding strand of an intron of a <italic>Bcl-2</italic>-like gene <italic>(Bcl2L14)</italic>. In contrast, for the <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> knockout mice used in this study, we can be reasonably assured that only <italic>Lrp5</italic> or <italic>Lrp6</italic> are targeted for inactivation, based on the original Southern blotting of mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) clones. Moreover, we may be reasonably assured that functional Lrp5 or Lrp6 is not expressed in these mice or cells derived from these mice. To generate <italic>Lrp5</italic> null mice, part of exon 1, including the signal peptide ATG, was replaced with an IRES-β-galactosidase reporter and MC1-neomycin phosphotransferase selection cassette. Thus, despite the fact that <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are viable, functional LRP5 cannot be expressed. To generate <italic>Lrp6</italic> null mice, a large insertion containing the splice acceptor of the mouse engrailed 2 gene, the transmembrane domain of rat CD4, and the β-galactosidase-neo reporter was inserted between exons 5 and 6. This insertion is therefore expected to generate a fusion construct encoding the first 457 of 1,370 extracellular domain amino acids of Lrp6, corresponding to the first YWTD β-propeller domain and an epidermal growth factor–like repeat of the extracellular domain. Significantly, this protein lacks the intracellular domain that Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>] determined was essential for Lrp6 function in AnTx uptake.</p><p>In conclusion, using three independent approaches, we have failed to find evidence to support the hypothesis that either LRP5 or LRP6 plays an essential role in PA-mediated uptake. The more likely explanations for the discrepancies between these reports is that either the EST identified by Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b022">22</xref>] is not specific for <italic>LRP6,</italic> or the role of LRP6 in PA-mediated uptake is cell-type specific. However, our results should not be interpreted as an indication that an association of ANTXR with PA is sufficient for cellular internalization. Indirect evidence suggests that other membrane-associated proteins may also play a role in AnTx uptake. By chemically cross-linking associated surface proteins, Escuyer and Collier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b050">50</xref>] estimated the molecular weight of PA complexed with its receptor at approximately 170 kDa. Since the molecular weights of activated PA, ANTXR1 sv1, ANTXR1 sv2, and ANTXR2 are 63 kDa, 63 kDa, 41 kDa, and 43 kDa, respectively, this indicates that either PA does not bind ANTXR in a 1:1 ratio, or other as yet unidentified proteins are present in this complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Lrp5</italic>- and <italic>Lrp6</italic>-deficient mice.</title><p><italic>Lrp5</italic>-deficient mice were generated as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030027-b042">42</xref>]. <italic>Lrp6</italic>-deficient mice (a gift of W.

RT-PCR of <italic>ANTXR2</italic> was carried out as described above except that the following primers were used: mouse mANTXR2 F and mANTXR2 R to detect a 364-bp fragment, and human hANTXR2 F and hANTXR2 R to detect a 344-bp fragment. PCR products were visualized by SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) in 1.0% agarose gels. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p><p>RT-PCR of <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> from CHO cells was carried out essentially as described. The following primers were used: Lrp5 bp336 F and Lrp5 bp895 R (to detect a 559-bp fragment), Lrp5 bp2230 F and Lrp5 bp2699 R (to detect a 469-bp fragment), and ham Lrp6 F and ham Lrp6 R. Samples were amplified for 36 cycles (94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C (or 55 °C for Lrp6) for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min). PCR products were visualized by SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) in 1.0% agarose gels. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. These partial sequences were used later to generate primers for real-time PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Inhibition of Lrp5 and Lrp6 expression.</title><p>To inhibit <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> gene expression in CHO cells and MEFs, we utilized Stealth RNAi to knock down mouse <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> (Invitrogen). Stealth RNAi low GC and medium GC duplexes were used as negative controls for <italic>Lrp6</italic> and <italic>Lrp5,</italic> respectively. Cells were transfected at 30% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) with a final concentration of 40 nM siRNA. After 48 h incubation, cells were treated with culture medium containing PA plus FP59 at the concentrations indicated for 3 h, after which the toxin-containing medium was removed, fresh medium added, and cells were incubated for an additional 16 h at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay as described above. Additionally, to analyze the effect of siRNA treatment on the function of LeTx, treated cells were subjected to LeTx (0.1 μg/ml PA and 0.01 μg/ml LF) or LF alone (0.01 μg/ml LF) for 4 h, after which cells were either collected for analysis of MEK cleavage or for verification of mRNA knockdown.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Real-time PCR of Lrp5 and Lrp6.</title><p>To analyze Lrp5 or Lrp6 mRNA levels after siRNA treatment, quantitative real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.appliedbiosystems.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.appliedbiosystems.com</ext-link>) and detected using the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System. Analysis of the level of 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) in each sample was performed as an internal loading control. Primers and probes were designed based on partial mRNA sequence for hamster Lrp5 and Lrp6 using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out under the following conditions: 2× Master Mix without UNG (1× final concentration), 40× MultiScribe and RNase Inhibitor Mix (0.25 U/uL and 0.4 U/uL, respectively, final concentration), 200 nM (Lrp5/6) or 50 nM (18S rRNA) forward (ham F) and reverse (ham R) primers, 100 nM (Lrp5/6) or 50 nM (18S rRNA) TAMRA probe, and 100 ng (Lrp5/6) or 10 ng (18S rRNA) of total RNA. The reverse-transcription step was performed at 48 °C for 30 min, after which PCR was performed at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Standard curves were performed for each gene to be analyzed, and used to determine the relative value of mRNA per gene. The value of Lrp5 or Lrp6 mRNA was normalized to endogenous 18S rRNA and expressed in terms of a fold-change over the negative control. All samples were run in triplicate for each reaction, and all experiments were performed and analyzed a total of three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>DKK-1 binding assays.</title><p>Cells were seeded on chambered glass slides (Lab Tek II; Nalge Nunc International, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nalgenunc.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nalgenunc.com</ext-link>) and siRNA transfections were performed on PR230-CHO cells as described above. After 48 h siRNA treatment, the slides were placed on ice and the chambers washed with ice-cold culture medium. Following this, cells were incubated with ice-cold culture medium supplemented with 100 pM His-tagged DKK-1 (R&amp;D Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rndsystems.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.rndsystems.com</ext-link>) or culture medium alone for 2 h.

A FITC-conjugated anti-His antibody (Invitrogen, 1:1000) was used to detect DKK-1. Cells were then washed twice with PBS + 0.1% Triton-X100, mounted, and imaged using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope and Zeiss image acquisition software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zeiss.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.zeiss.com</ext-link>).
