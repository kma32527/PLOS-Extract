Here, molecular diagnostic tools were employed for high-throughput surveillance of migratory birds, as an alternative to classical labor-intensive methods of virus isolation in eggs. This study included 36,809 samples from 323 bird species belonging to 18 orders, of which only 25 species of three orders were positive for influenza A virus. Information on species, locations, and timing is provided for all samples tested. Seven previously unknown host species for avian influenza virus were identified: barnacle goose, bean goose, brent goose, pink-footed goose, bewick's swan, common gull, and guillemot. Dabbling ducks were more frequently infected than other ducks and Anseriformes; this distinction was probably related to bird behavior rather than population sizes. Waders did not appear to play a role in the epidemiology of avian influenza in Europe, in contrast to the Americas. The high virus prevalence in ducks in Europe in spring as compared with North America could explain the differences in virus–host ecology between these continents. Most influenza A virus subtypes were detected in ducks, but H13 and H16 subtypes were detected primarily in gulls. Viruses of subtype H6 were more promiscuous in host range than other subtypes. Temporal and spatial variation in influenza virus prevalence in wild birds was observed, with influenza A virus prevalence varying by sampling location; this is probably related to migration patterns from northeast to southwest and a higher prevalence farther north along the flyways. We discuss the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza A virus in wild birds in relation to host ecology and compare our results with published studies. These data are useful for designing new surveillance programs and are particularly relevant due to increased interest in avian influenza in wild birds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Significant gaps in our knowledge of the ecology of avian influenza in wild migratory birds have become apparent during recent outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, in particular in relation to the risk of virus spread by wild birds.

Influenza A viruses of all hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes (H1–H16 and N1–N9) and most HA/NA combinations have been identified in the wild bird reservoir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b004">4</xref>]. Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are distributed globally, except for the most arid regions of the world, and represent an almost global coverage of influenza A virus host species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b002">2</xref>]. In birds, influenza viruses preferentially infect cells lining the intestinal tract and are excreted in high concentrations in their feces. Transmission is thought to be achieved primarily via the fecal–oral route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>], which likely represents an efficient way to transmit viruses between waterfowl, by shedding the virus via feces into the surface water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of avian influenza A viruses in their natural hosts depends on geographical location, seasonality, and species. For instance, the prevalence of avian influenza A viruses in ducks in North America varies from less than 1% during spring migration to 30% prior to and during fall migration, but large variations in virus prevalence have been observed in different surveillance studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b005">5</xref>]. The peak in prevalence during fall migration is believed to be related to the large number of young immunologically naïve birds of that breeding season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b007">7</xref>]. Although extensive data exist on surveillance studies of influenza A viruses in ducks and shorebirds in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b005">5</xref>], limited up-to-date information is available for Eurasia, Africa, South America, and Oceania, and only for limited numbers of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b011">11</xref>]. Because of the apparent species-specific niches of certain HA subtypes such as H13 and the recently discovered H16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b014">14</xref>], as yet unidentified influenza A viruses may exist in nature. Information about influenza A viruses in Eurasia and North America is of particular interest because the influenza A viruses found in Eurasian wild birds are genetically distinct from those of wild birds in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b002">2</xref>]. The direct zoonotic potential of several Eurasian lineage avian influenza A viruses is currently the cause of serious concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b018">18</xref>]. The increasing problems with outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the potential spread of HPAI H5N1 by wild birds over large geographic areas, and the threat certain avian influenza A viruses pose to public and animal health emphasize the need for more information on the ecology of avian influenza A viruses circulating in the wild bird reservoir. Our current knowledge of the epidemiology of avian influenza A viruses, virus ecology in relation to host ecology, the temporal and spatial patterns of avian influenza A viruses in their natural hosts, the role of potential new hosts in the influenza A virus ecology, and the interaction between wild birds and poultry are still very limited.</p><p>Traditionally, influenza A virus surveillance studies in wild birds have been performed by direct virus isolation from fecal samples or cloacal swabs in embryonated hen's eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b019">19</xref>]. This method is labor intensive due to the handling time of each of the individual samples, and is quite sensitive to laboratory contaminations, in particular if blind passage is used routinely during virus isolation attempts. Currently this diagnostic method is being replaced in many laboratories by molecular diagnostic tests, such as conventional or real-time RT-PCR methods targeting highly conserved gene segments of the influenza A virus. Such molecular methods allow the rapid identification of influenza A virus positive specimens from large collections of samples, which can then be used for targeted virus isolation attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b022">22</xref>]. In this study, we present data on the prevalence of influenza A viruses from our ongoing wild bird surveillance studies. From 1998 to 2006, we screened more than 36,000 samples collected from 323 bird species using molecular diagnostics. The sample collection includes many bird species reported to be permissive to avian influenza A virus in earlier influenza A virus surveillance studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b011">11</xref>]. To obtain more detailed information on potential host species, large numbers of samples of birds from different bird families and geographical locations were included. This was done in part because earlier studies relied solely on virus isolation in embryonated hen's eggs as a screening method for investigating whether molecular detection methods would yield different results. Of all samples, 90% were from The Netherlands and Sweden, 4.5% from elsewhere in Northern Europe (seven countries, multiple sites), and 5.5% from other parts of the world, including Africa (Nigeria, Ghana), North America (United States, Canada), South America (Argentina), Asia (Kazakhstan, South Korea), the Arctic (Norway, Iceland), and the Antarctic Peninsula. All samples were taken from healthy birds. We used this data to describe temporal and spatial patterns in influenza A virus prevalence in different wild migratory bird species.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Avian Influenza A Virus Surveillance in Wild Birds</title><p>From 1998 to 2006 we sampled 36,809 birds belonging to 323 species of 18 orders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030061-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Despite the introduction of the molecular tests and the wide range of bird species tested, only a few “new” influenza A virus hosts were identified: barnacle, bean, brent, and pink-footed goose, bewick's swan, common gull, and guillemot. It is thus reassuring that the use of classical methods for virus detection in numerous surveillance studies has not resulted in an apparent biased detection toward viruses that can be isolated easily in embryonated hens' eggs; therefore, it remains a viable approach for virus detection. However, in our hands, virus detection by RT-PCR was more sensitive than using classical tests, since viruses were isolated from only one-third of the RT-PCR positive samples. Even under ideal conditions of transport, storage, and processing, not all RT-PCR positive samples yielded virus isolates.</p><p>We confirmed the high virus prevalence of dabbling ducks in fall as observed in previous studies in the Northern Hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>]. Our data indicate that timing relative to migration, instead of the absolute time point, is a determinant of virus prevalence. High virus prevalence early in fall migration likely declines gradually as the migration proceeds, thus forming a north–south gradient of virus prevalence even within single species. This explains prevalence differences in earlier surveillance studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b005">5</xref>]. Influenza A virus prevalence was generally higher in juvenile ducks as compared with adults, as reported for North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b007">7</xref>]. The estimated yearly turnover of mallards in Northern Europe is roughly one-third; 56% of the juvenile mallards die during their first year and the mortality in adult birds is ∼40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b024">24</xref>]. Thus, one-third of the mallard population consists of juvenile birds, which are immunologically naïve and therefore probably more susceptible to influenza A virus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>The influenza A virus prevalence in mallards was comparable to that of other dabbling ducks. Viruses were also detected in ducks belonging to other guilds, but the prevalence was lower. Influenza A virus was detected in 811 of 13,297 dabbling ducks, but in only six of 440 other ducks (Pearson χ<sup>2</sup>-test, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; 0.001). Analysis of 7,130 samples from 11 goose and swan species revealed that virus prevalence was also low, ranging from 0.7% to 2.4%. Several factors could contribute to the high virus prevalence in dabbling ducks as compared with other species. The dabbling behavior itself is likely an important factor; virus excreted in surface waters via feces may efficiently transmit viruses to other ducks that feed on the same waters. Influenza A virus can remain infectious for prolonged periods in surface water depending on temperature, salinity, and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b025">25</xref>]. The prolonged presence of influenza A viruses in surface water may enable the spread of viruses in different host sub-populations that otherwise would be separated in time and space. In contrast, diving ducks forage deeper under the surface and more often in marine habitats, and most goose and swan species graze in pastures and agricultural fields. Such differences in feeding behavior could lead to less-efficient virus transmission and thus account for the differences in prevalence. Population size and age structure could be additional important factors enabling the annual co-circulation of multiple virus subtypes within the same (meta-) populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b026">26</xref>]. The dabbling duck populations are estimated at between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 in Northern Europe alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b027">27</xref>]. Mallards are the most abundant species, followed by Eurasian wigeon and common teal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b027">27</xref>]. We observed the highest virus prevalence in two of these species: mallards and common teals. The population estimates for goose species in Northern Europe are significantly lower as compared with the dabbling ducks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b027">27</xref>]. The smaller population sizes could limit in general the potential of perpetuation of influenza A virus in these species and in particular the continuous co-circulation of multiple virus subtypes. When we plotted the influenza A virus prevalence in duck, goose, and gull species as a function of population size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030061-g005">Figure 5</xref>), population size did not appear to be the main correlate of virus prevalence (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0001). The relative clustering of the data points from the duck, goose, and gull species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030061-g005">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that other factors (taxonomy, behavior, etc.) could determine virus prevalence.</p><fig id="ppat-0030061-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030061.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Relation between Influenza A Virus Prevalence in Avian Hosts and Their Population Sizes</title><p>Species were categorized in dabbling ducks (blue diamonds; mallard [population 5,000,000; prevalence 7.3%], Eurasian wigeon [1,250,000; 3%], common teal [400,000; 6.4%], northern pintail [60,000; 2.9%], gadwall [30,000; 2.7%], and northern shoveler [40,000; 3.7%]); geese (red squares; white-fronted goose [600,000; 2.1%], barnacle goose [176,000; 0.7%], greylag goose [200,000; 2.4%], brent goose [300,000; 1%], bean goose [80,000; 0.6%], and pink-footed goose [34,000; 2.1%]); and gulls (yellow triangles; black-headed gull [2,000,000, 0.9%], common gull [500,000, 0.9%], and herring gull [800,000, 0.7%]).

Behavioral factors influencing influenza A virus ecology in gulls could include colony breeding, gregariousness during migration and wintering, feeding patterns, and the mixing of different populations of birds. From our data, it appears that virus prevalence in gulls peaks shortly after they have left their breeding grounds.</p><p>Surveillance studies performed along the East Coast of North America suggested a distinct role for wader species in the perpetuation and maintenance of certain influenza A virus subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b012">12</xref>]. It was suggested that different families of wetland birds are involved in perpetuating influenza viruses and that waders may carry the virus north to the duck breeding grounds in spring. We detected influenza A virus in one shorebird sample obtained from Delaware Bay (United States) and one from South Korea. The differences in prevalence between our American wader data and those described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b012">12</xref>] could be due to sampled species, sampling procedures, and timing. Within our European surveillance study, not a single influenza A virus was detected in waders. Although the majority of our wader samples were collected during fall migration, a reasonable sample size was collected during spring migration. Thus, there is no evidence that waders play a role in the perpetuation of influenza A virus in Europe. The recently intensified surveillance in waders, including serological data collection, may allow a definitive conclusion about their role in the influenza virus ecology in Europe.</p><p>Although historically influenza A viruses have been obtained from more than 105 species of 26 different families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b002">2</xref>], we did not detect significant influenza virus prevalence in species other than those belonging to the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. We therefore suggest that although multiple bird species can be infected, their contribution to the overall virus ecology could be limited; infections of these hosts, although potentially with high peak prevalence, may be only transient.</p><p>Influenza A virus subtypes H1–H12 were isolated frequently from mallards, and several of these subtypes were also detected in Eurasian wigeons, common teals, gadwalls, and northern shovelers. The absence of subtypes H14 and H15 in our collection was probably due to the geographical separation of virus hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b029">29</xref>]. Because all HA subtypes isolated from Anseriformes were also isolated from mallards, it is likely that mallards play a pivotal role in the perpetuation of influenza A virus subtypes H1–H12 in Europe. Subtypes H5 and H7 were rarely detected in longitudinal studies of ducks in Canada, whereas in this European study, they represent 7.5% and 11.1% of viruses obtained from ducks. The most common virus subtypes in Europe—H3, H4, H6—were also common subtypes in Canada.</p><p>The predominant isolation of H13 and H16 viruses from gull species confirms the common notion that these viruses belong to the influenza A virus “gull lineage.” H13 and H16 viruses are genetically distinct from viruses from other hosts and seem to have adapted to replication in gull hosts in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b012">12</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, viruses of the H6 subtype seem to have a broader host range compared with that of other virus subtypes in our study. Of the influenza viruses obtained from birds other than dabbling ducks and gulls, 79% were H6 viruses. H6 viruses were isolated from gulls, auks, swans, and geese. The relative abundance of this subtype in ducks does not explain the large variety of species from which these viruses were isolated; H4 and H7 viruses were also detected frequently in ducks, but rarely in other birds. H6 viruses have been transmitted from wild birds to poultry on several occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b031">31</xref>], providing further evidence for the ability of these viruses to be transmitted between different bird species.</p><p>HPAI H5N1 viruses have caused large-scale outbreaks in poultry in Southeast Asia since 1997 and have also been transmitted to a variety of mammalian species, including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b032">32</xref>] . Until 2005, wild migratory birds probably did not play a significant role in the epidemiology and spread of HPAI H5N1, although the virus was detected sporadically in wild birds. A large-scale outbreak in wild migratory birds occurred in April–June 2005 at Lake Qinghai in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b035">35</xref>], after which the HPAI H5N1 virus rapidly spread westward across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Since then, affected wild birds have been reported in several countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b036">36</xref>], but even in areas with significant outbreaks in poultry, the virus prevalence in wild birds is low and their role in spreading the disease is unclear. It is likely that the influenza A surveillance studies in wild birds such as those presented here could provide “early warning” signals for the introduction of HPAI H5N1 into new regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030061-b037">37</xref>]. The current increased interest in influenza virus surveillance in wild and domestic birds provides a unique opportunity to increase our understanding not only of HPAI epidemiology but also of the ecology of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in their natural hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Specimens.</title><p>Birds were trapped by expert ornithologists using duck decoys, duck traps, wader funnel traps, mist nets, clap nets, cannon nets, or Helgoland traps.
