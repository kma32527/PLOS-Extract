These mutants had a marked change in colony morphology and generated a new polar lipid. Complementation with multi-copy <italic>M. tuberculosis lsr2</italic> (Rv3597c) returned P<italic><sub>iniBAC</sub></italic> expression to baseline, reversed the observed morphological and lipid changes, and repressed P<italic><sub>iniBAC</sub></italic> induction by EMB to below that of the control <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. smegmatis</named-content> strain. Microarray analysis of an <italic>lsr2</italic> knockout confirmed upregulation of <italic>M. smegmatis iniA</italic> and demonstrated upregulation of genes involved in cell wall and metabolic functions. Fully 121 of 584 genes induced by EMB treatment in wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. smegmatis</named-content> were upregulated (“hyperinduced”) to even higher levels by EMB in the <italic>M. smegmatis lsr2</italic> knockout.

In <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> overexpression of <italic>lsr2</italic> repressed INH-mediated induction of all three <italic>iniBAC</italic> genes, as well as another annotated pump, <italic>efpA</italic>. The low molecular weight and basic properties of Lsr2 (pI 10.69) suggested that it was a histone-like protein, although it did not exhibit sequence homology with other proteins in this class. Consistent with other histone-like proteins, Lsr2 bound DNA with a preference for circular DNA, forming large oligomers, inhibited DNase I activity, and introduced a modest degree of supercoiling into relaxed plasmids. Lsr2 also inhibited in vitro transcription and topoisomerase I activity. Lsr2 represents a novel class of histone-like proteins that inhibit a wide variety of DNA-interacting enzymes. Lsr2 appears to regulate several important pathways in mycobacteria by preferentially binding to AT-rich sequences, including genes induced by antibiotics and those associated with inducible multi-drug tolerance. An improved understanding of the role of <italic>lsr2</italic> may provide important insights into the mechanisms of action of antibiotics and the way that mycobacteria adapt to stresses such as antibiotic treatment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Understanding the cellular processes stimulated when <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> is treated with antibiotics may provide clues as to why months of therapy and use of several drugs simultaneously are required to prevent antibiotic resistance.

Our study of the regulation of antibiotic-induced genes, including <italic>iniBAC,</italic> in two mycobacterial species revealed that a small protein called Lsr2 controls <italic>iniBAC</italic> and other antibiotic-induced genes, especially ones related to the cell wall. Lsr2 binds to DNA in a relatively non-specific manner and appears to inhibit certain enzymes that must interact with DNA as part of their function. These properties differentiate Lsr2 from classical regulators of gene expression that bind to specific DNA sequences, and suggest that Lsr2 is a novel histone-like protein. These proteins regulate genes by changing the way DNA is shaped, and, indeed, we found that Lsr2 can change the shape of DNA by introducing a small number of coils into its structure. Our results suggest that Lsr2 is a major regulator of antibiotic-induced responses in mycobacteria.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by US National Institutes of Health grant AI43268.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Colangeli R, Helb D, Vilchèze C, Hazbón MH, Lee CG, et al (2007) Transcriptional regulation of multi-drug tolerance and antibiotic-induced responses by the histone-like protein Lsr2 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content>.

Several broad categories of genes are induced by antibiotics, including a number involved in stress responses and others linked to specific metabolic pathways that are inhibited by antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b001">1</xref>]. The functional roles of antibiotic-induced transcriptional changes are poorly understood. Some changes are likely to be adaptive in that they induce antimicrobial tolerance or are important for intrinsic drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b005">5</xref>]. Other changes are likely to be detrimental to the cell and may be ultimately linked to cell death. An improved understanding of the functional role of antibiotic-induced genes may be gained by studying the factors that regulate their expression. Histone-like proteins are reasonable candidates for regulators of antibiotic responses in bacteria because they assist in the control of stationary and exponential phase cell growth and regulate genes that respond to environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b007">7</xref>]. Whether histone-like proteins influence the transcriptional response to antibiotics is not known.</p><p>The <italic>M. tuberculosis iniBAC</italic> operon (<italic>iniB</italic> or Rv0341, <italic>iniA</italic> or Rv0342, and <italic>iniC</italic> or Rv0343) encodes an important example of antibiotic-regulated genes. This operon is specifically induced by antibiotics such as isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol (EMB) that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b002">2</xref>], but it is not induced by other stresses, such as hydrogen peroxide and heat shock, or by factors such as lysozyme that digest the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b008">8</xref>]. It has recently been demonstrated that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. bovis</named-content> BCG strains overexpressing <italic>M. tuberculosis iniA</italic> grow and survive longer than control strains upon exposure to inhibitory concentrations of either INH or EMB, a condition analogous to classical antibiotic tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>The goal of the current study was to identify genes required for transcriptional repression of the <italic>iniBAC</italic> promoter (P<italic><sub>iniBAC</sub></italic>) and to determine whether this regulatory pathway is part of a broader regulatory network in mycobacteria.

However, no consensus sequences were identified in alignments of up to 400 bp upstream of the 15 most strongly induced genes. In contrast, these regions were found to be unusually adenine-thymine (AT)–rich (43.2% AT compared to a mean of 32.6% AT in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. smegmatis</named-content> genome). Mapping the induced and repressed genes over the entire chromosome revealed a number of chromosomal regions with large clusters of highly upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030087-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The upregulated genes within each cluster did not appear to comprise single operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030087-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). As with the 20 most highly induced genes, the regions 400 bp upstream of the upregulated genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030087-g004">Figure 4</xref>C were unusually AT-rich (41.4% AT for region 1 and 40.5% AT for region 2). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>lsr2</italic> encodes a protein with relatively non-specific rather than sequence-specific DNA-binding properties that preferentially binds to AT-rich sequences in a manner similar to that of some other histone-like proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>Our reporter studies had shown that the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content> P<italic><sub>iniBAC</sub></italic> was upregulated by <italic>lsr2</italic> disruption in NJS20.1, induced by EMB in NJS20, and hyperinduced by EMB in NJS20.1.

A similar observation has been made previously by Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b009">9</xref>]. Colony morphology is often associated with a change in the cell wall structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b018">18</xref>].

The apolar and polar lipids from wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. smegmatis</named-content> and NJS20.1 were extracted and analyzed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional TLC. In contrast to the previous observations in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b009">9</xref>], no difference was observed in the apolar fractions of the two strains (unpublished data). However, a new spot was observed in the polar fractions of NJT20.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030087-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Similar results were noted after [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate labeling of actively dividing cells. These experiments suggest that this new compound is a glycolipid because it was visualized with orcinol, a reagent for detecting glycolipids, and the compound migrated like a glycolipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the compound integrated [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate, indicating that it contains fatty acids. Transposon mutants may be complicated by polar effects, although this phenomenon can usually be controlled for by complementation experiments. We considered the possibility that the discrepancy between our results and those of Chen et al. could have been due to differences in the location of the transposon insertion.

Lsr2 was inactivated in each sample by treatment with protease K followed by boiling in SDS prior to analysis by gel electrophoresis to prevent a confounding gel shift of the Lsr2-treated DNA. We found that DNase I digested ΦX174 DNA into small fragments averaging less than 100 bp in size in the absence of Lsr2 pretreatment (longer periods of DNase I digestion completely digested the DNA). In contrast, DNase I activity was substantially inhibited by pretreatment with Lsr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030087-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Lsr2 pretreatment followed by digestion with 0.02 unit of DNase I produced a wide range of DNA fragments ranging from approximately 150 bp to the size of the supercoiled vector. Lsr2 pretreatment also conferred some protection against the activity of the higher concentration of DNase I, resulting in DNA fragments with an average size of approximately 150 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030087-g010">Figure 10</xref>), while this same concentration of DNase I completely digested the DNA sample in the absence of Lsr2 pretreatment (unpublished data).

We showed that Lsr2 forms large multimeric complexes with DNA (with a preference to supercoiled forms), protects against DNase I treatment, and introduces a modest degree of supercoiling into relaxed plasmids, properties consistent with histone-like proteins. Lsr2 also appears to inhibit in vitro transcription and topoisomerase I. Co-elution studies did not detect any interactions between Lsr2 and DNase, suggesting that Lsr2 exerts its suppressive effect by interacting with DNA rather than by directly inhibiting proteins. Given the other similarities of Lsr2 to histone-like proteins, it is likely that Lsr2 inhibits RNA polymerase and topoisomerase activity by causing topological changes to the DNA targeted by these enzymes. This inhibition may be related to the ability of Lsr2 to form large oligomeric complexes with DNA. It is possible that the activity of Lsr2 is modulated in vivo by other cellular proteins and by local variations in chromosomal sequences; however, this remains to be determined. A PSI-BLAST analysis of the Lsr2 sequence reveals a nuclease motif, which is consistent with the weak nuclease activity that was noted in some of our experiments and may be related to its function. The Lsr2 sequence is unique, exhibiting no significant similarities to any histone-like protein. Thus, Lsr2 represents a novel class of histone-like proteins.</p><p>Our discovery that Lsr2 is involved in regulating a subset of INH- and EMB-inducible genes suggests at least one significant function.

Studies of cellular responses to antibiotics may be crucial to understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria survive or die in the presence of antibiotics.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b014">14</xref>] contained insertions at the extreme 3-prime end of the gene where the transposon would be unlikely to affect functional capacity. If confirmed by future studies, the finding that this gene is essential is consistent with our hypothesis that <italic>lsr2</italic> regulates important cellular pathways in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. tuberculosis</named-content>.</p><p>The <italic>lsr2</italic> gene has been found to be essential for biofilm formation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. smegmatis</named-content>. This study also showed that an <italic>M. smegmatis lsr2</italic> transposon mutant had altered colony morphology and contained two previously unidentified apolar lipids that were novel mycolate-containing compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030087-b009">9</xref>]. We found the same altered colony morphology but did not detect any novel apolar lipids in our analysis of the <italic>M. smegmatis (lsr2::Tn5370)</italic> strain NJS20.1 or in the Δ <italic>lsr2</italic> strain NJS22. However, we did detect a new compound, possibly a glycolipid, in the polar fraction of both NJS20.1 and NJS22. The dissimilarity between these two lipid analyses could be due to a difference in the way the strains were grown or harvested for the TLC analysis. Despite the apparent contradiction between the two studies, both investigations suggest that <italic>lsr2</italic> is involved in regulating a wide range of cellular processes.</p><p>In summary, <italic>lsr2</italic> encodes a histone-like DNA-binding protein that appears to be essential for controlling responses to certain types of antibiotic stress. Lsr2 has also been linked to other types of stress responses and other cellular functions in mycobacteria. An improved understanding of the role of <italic>lsr2</italic> and of the stress responses associated with this gene may provide important insights into the mechanisms of action of antibiotics and the way that mycobacteria adapt to certain types of stresses such as antibiotic treatment.
