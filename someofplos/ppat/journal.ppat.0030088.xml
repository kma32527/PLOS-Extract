Human cyclophilin A (CypA), also known as peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA), is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein (by convention, we refer to the protein as CypA and the gene as <italic>PPIA</italic>). CypA has long been known for its incorporation into HIV-1 virions and its important role in facilitating HIV-1 replication in host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b002">2</xref>]. CypA is a member of the cyclophilin family, members of which all possess peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase activity. Peptidyl prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerases (<italic>PPIA</italic>ses) catalyze the <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds and are believed to be involved in protein folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b003">3</xref>]. The incorporation of CypA into the HIV-1 virion capsid is mediated through the direct binding between prolyl peptide bond located in a proline-rich loop of the fourth and fifth helices of the HIV-1 capsid and the active sites of CypA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b005">5</xref>]. Disruption of CypA incorporation, either by HIV-1 Gag mutations or by cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressive drug that prevents HIV-1 Gag binding to CypA, leads to an attenuation of HIV-1 infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b006">6</xref>]. Braaten and Luban found that HIV-1 replication was decreased in CypA-null human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in which the gene encoding CypA <italic>(PPIA)</italic> was deleted through homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b007">7</xref>]. CypA is therefore an important host factor that regulates HIV-1 replication.</p><p>Recently, the role of CypA in HIV-1 has gained even greater attention with the discovery of a fusion protein of CypA and TRIM5Î±, a host restriction factor against HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b008">8</xref>], which confers HIV-1 resistance in owl monkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b009">9</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b011">11</xref>]. Both TRIM5Î± and CypA recognize and act on the capsid of HIV-1, but apparently confer opposite effects. TRIM5Î± restricts HIV-1 by promoting premature disassembly of HIV-1 capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b012">12</xref>], while CypA increases viral infectivity by facilitating proper uncoating. Although the interaction between CypA and TRIM5Î± is still unclear, it appears that the modulation of HIV-1 infectivity by CypA is independent of TRIM5Î± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b013">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b015">15</xref>]. It has been postulated that binding of CypA to capsid protects HIV-1 from an unknown restriction factor in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>The study of the influence of human gene variation on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and progression is an approach that may reveal the in vivo host factor HIV-1 interactions and their epidemiologic importance at the population level. With this approach we have identified several AIDS-modifying variants in genes <italic>TRIM5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b016">16</xref>], <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b017">17</xref>], and <italic>CUL5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b018">18</xref>] that encode human innate HIV-1 restriction factors or related proteins. In a recent study performed in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a variant of <italic>PPIA</italic> was implicated as a potential factor affecting HIV-1 disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b019">19</xref>]. As CypA is an essential human protein for completion of the HIV-1 life cycle, we have assessed the influence of genetic variation in the <italic>PPIA</italic> gene on HIV-1 infection and disease progression in five United Statesâ€“based HIV-1 natural history cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Description of <italic>PPIA</italic> Variations</title><p>The <italic>PPIA</italic> gene is approximately 7 kb in length, consisting of five exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Using <italic>PPIA</italic>-specific primers we resequenced virtually the entire <italic>PPIA</italic> gene to screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 92 European Americans (EA) and 92 African Americans (AA). Seven polymorphisms were discovered: three in the putative promoter region, one in the 5â€² UTR, one in the 3â€² UTR, one in intron 4, and one in the second Alu repeat region upstream of the putative promoter. No SNPs were found in the coding regions. These SNPs and four additional SNPs available from dbSNP database located in regions not detected by our sequencing were selected for genotyping in the AIDS cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030088-t001">Table 1</xref>). SNP1 genotypes deviated from the frequencies expected under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), probably due to its location in the Alu repetitive element; thus, SNP1 was excluded in the analysis. SNP2 was also excluded from analysis due to its rarity.

This effect was revealed for CD4 cell depletion or for AIDS progression, reflecting early or late stage of disease progression, in AA and EA, respectively. The racial difference in the strength or timing of the effects may be due to interactions with other sequence variations that are distributed differently in two populations or to immunologic and viral variables. We further found that both SNPs had differential binding efficiency to nuclear proteins in the gel shift experiment. These findings suggest that the functional promoter SNP3/SNP4 influences HIV-1 disease progression.</p><p><italic>PPIA</italic> in human encodes a 165-amino acid protein that is highly conserved across species, with 100% and 96% sequence identity to rhesus monkey and mouse, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of <italic>PPIA</italic> is 98% identical between human and chimpanzee. No variation in the coding sequence of human <italic>PPIA</italic> was found in this study or in the dbSNP database. This suggests that differential genetic impact of <italic>PPIA</italic> SNPs and haplotypes on infection and progression are likely due to regulatory region variation affecting protein levels. The regulation and promoter function of human <italic>PPIA</italic> is still undefined. <italic>PPIA</italic> is highly expressed in almost all cell types and is considered a housekeeping gene. Sequence analysis revealed that <italic>PPIA</italic> promoter contains a TATA box and two SP1 binding sites and is highly GC-rich (~70%) with overrepresented CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b024">24</xref>]. In this study, we identified two SNPs, each located in two additional SP1 binding elements. SP1 is generally believed to function as a transactivating factor for many housekeeping genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b025">25</xref>]. These two SNP changes, SNP3G and SNP4G, always occurring together through LD, had opposite effects on the nuclear protein binding. Assuming the predicted stronger SP1 binding effect of SNP4 is dominant over the weaker SP1 binding of SNP3, a higher <italic>PPIA</italic> gene expression would be predicted. This would be consistent with more rapid disease course as observed in this study.</p><p>Based on our analyses of eight SNPs covering the entire gene region of <italic>PPIA</italic> and their haplotypes, we found that the <italic>PPIA</italic> disease-modifying effects were most likely afforded by promoter SNP3 or SNP4 and the associations with the downstream SNPs 7â€“11 were largely due to tracking of these two SNPs through LD. In a previous report, Bleiber et al. studied the ex vivo HIV-1 infectivity in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy individuals carrying the SNP4 and SNP5 alleles (named as <italic>PPIA</italic>-1604 and <italic>PPIA</italic>-1650, respectively, in the Bleiber's report), as well as their impact on the CD4 gradient (from CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts 500/mm<sup>3</sup> to 200/mm<sup>3</sup>) among SPs enrolled in the Swiss HIV cohort, largely comprised of Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b019">19</xref>]. In the ex vivo experiment, both SNPs showed nonsignificant tendencies toward greater HIV-1 replication, with the effects of SNP5 being more pronounced. In the population study, both SNPs were associated with faster CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion in a model also containing two other candidate genes (model 2); with the SNP5 of <italic>PPIA</italic> effect again being more pronounced. Thus, the detrimental effect of SNP4 observed from these two studies is largely consistent. In contrast, no evidence supporting a role of SNP5 in AIDS progression was found, although the SNP5 G allele was carried significantly less often in HREU than in SC but was similarly distributed in SC and SN. Thus, the role of CypA polymorphism in HIV-1 infection remains inconclusive and warrants further investigation. Taken together, the association and functional results from these two studies point to a role of <italic>PPIA</italic> genetic variation in HIV-1/AIDS. In future studies, it may be informative to determine the mechanism of association between <italic>PPIA</italic> variants and host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or disease progression in view of the interaction between CypA and the capsid domain of the Gag polyprotein.</p><p>Population-based genetic association studies provide a powerful approach to uncovering host genes that confer disease susceptibility or resistance. This approach has led to identification of various genetic factors that affect HIV-1/AIDS, and has provided unique insights into the host HIV-1 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b027">27</xref>]. The successful identification of true genetic associations requires a large sample size (to minimize the type II error), replication in independent studies (to ward off type I error), and plausible functional evidence (to infer causal relationship). In this study, the plausible genetic-modifying role of <italic>PPIA</italic> is supported by replication in two independent ethnic groups and the demonstration that SNPs 3 and 4 are each associated with altered binding affinities to transcription factors. Moreover, the previous independent study also provides supportive association and functional evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b019">19</xref>].</p><p>Our comprehensive analysis of nearly all variant alleles and their haplotypes in the <italic>PPIA</italic> gene is, in essence, equivalent to a gene-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b028">28</xref>]. A major problem facing genetic association studies is the difficulty in replication, particularly for single SNP associations. One reason for failure to replicate previous studies is due to potential differences in allele frequencies and LD structure across populations. Gene-based replication has recently been advocated as a gold standard for replication studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b028">28</xref>]. The entire gene with prior SNP association is considered the functional unit and is examined for association with effectively all genetic variation in the gene. Nonreplication due to population differences may be minimized as local allele frequencies and LD structure from study populations are considered with this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b028">28</xref>]. Thus, our comprehensive survey of <italic>PPIA</italic> genetic variation and LD structure may facilitate future comparisons of replication studies using a gene-based approach.</p><p>In summary, through genetic epidemiological and functional approaches, we have identified two promoter SNPs in <italic>PPIA</italic> as potential genetic modifiers of HIV-1 disease progression. Our findings corroborate the notion that genetic variation of <italic>PPIA</italic> influences AIDS pathogenesis and provide in vivo evidence that CypA is a critical host protein in interaction with HIV-1. Manipulation of <italic>PPIA</italic> may be considered as a plausible option for anti-HIV-1 therapeutic development as previously explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030088-b029">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study participants.</title><p>Study participants were enrolled in five United Statesâ€“based natural history HIV/AIDS cohorts.
