Completion of its diploid genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b004">4</xref>] now provides a foundation for studies on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> biology and pathogenesis, and offers new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Critical to such activities, however, remains the task of functionally annotating the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genome. To date, genomic studies reveal significant differences in genomic organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b005">5</xref>] and gene essentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>] between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>. In part, these differences reflect their evolutionary divergence and distinct lifestyle as an opportunistic fungal pathogen versus a saprophytic yeast, respectively. Unlike <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> a major impediment to large-scale genetic analyses in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is the limited ability to perform classical genetic screens, due to its natural diploid state and lack of an easily manipulated sexual cycle. Thus, alternative genetic strategies are required.</p><p>The phenomenon of haploinsufficiency (HI)—that is, growth phenotypes associated with the loss of function (e.g., deletion) of one allele in a diploid—is widespread amongst eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b007">7</xref>] and has been effectively applied in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to screen for genes involved in filamentous growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b008">8</xref>]. HI has been studied extensively in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and offers a way to exploit the diploidy of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content>. While only ∼3% of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> genome displays HI under the standard growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b009">9</xref>], chemically induced HI is more specific. It has been shown in an assay termed the fitness test (also referred to as haploinsufficient phenotype assay) that target-specific inhibitory molecules typically induce a growth disadvantage (i.e., hypersensitivity) of heterozygous deletion strains corresponding to the drug targets and/or other mechanism of action (MOA)–related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b014">14</xref>]. If this specificity is also prevalent in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> chemically induced HI by mechanistically characterized inhibitors could be used to identify essential cellular processes and genetic interactions relevant to this pathogen. Conversely, when a novel inhibitory compound is tested, the response (hypersensitivity and resistance; i.e., haploinsufficiency and haploproficiency, respectively) of specific heterozygous strains may provide phenotypic information reflecting the MOA of the compound.</p><p>Here, we report on the application of chemically induced HI on a genomic scale in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content>. Drawing from analogous studies performed in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> we term this assay the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> fitness test, or CaFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We systematically constructed 2,868 heterozygous deletion strains in which two unique barcodes were introduced in the up- and downstream regions of the deleted allele. Gene-specific barcodes differentiate heterozygotes from one another and enable their multiplex screening for HI growth phenotypes when challenged with antifungal agents. To readout growth changes resulting from drug treatment, each unique tag is amplified by PCR using common flanking primer sequences, labeled, and hybridized to a DNA microarray that identifies all barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Statistical analyses enable identification of strains significantly affected in growth rate. With a CaFT of ∼45% genome coverage, we have examined mechanistically diverse inhibitory compounds with three objectives: 1) to determine and validate the prevalence and specificity of chemically induced HI in the pathogen, 2) to provide experimental data to functionally annotate genes and their genetic interactions involved in the cellular processes inhibited by these compounds, and 3) to establish the utility of the CaFT in MOA studies of inhibitory compounds for antifungal drug discovery.</p><fig id="ppat-0030092-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030092.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>An Overview of the CaFT</title><p>Individual heterozygous deletion strains contain two unique barcodes, up-tags (red) and down-tags (blue), flanked by two pairs of common primer sequences (black for all the up-tags, grey for all the down-tags) at the deleted allele.

Approximately 29% of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genes used are essential for viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>], and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-st001">Table S1</xref> lists all genes examined in this study. Heterozygous deletion strains were constructed using previously described PCR methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>]. A pool containing equal proportions of all 2,868 strains was prepared and aliquots frozen, with thawed aliquots used to perform all the CaFT experiments described. To identify specific haploinsufficiency and/or haploproficiency, a normalized <italic>z</italic>-score was used to assess the response of individual strains to inhibitory compounds (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). For each strain, the normalized <italic>z</italic>-scores of both barcodes are determined by 1) the average (“historical”) behavior of this strain, as determined by each barcode, in a set of reference experiments with chemically diverse compounds (i.e., barcode-specific error modeling), and 2) the overall responsiveness of all the strains in a given experiment. Since the up- and down-barcodes are analyzed separately, individual strains are independently appraised twice in each experiment. A positive normalized <italic>z</italic>-score indicates a relative decrease in abundance in the compound-treated culture (i.e., insufficiency or hypersensitivity) and a negative normalized <italic>z</italic>-score indicates a relative increase (i.e., proficiency or resistance). To fully examine the effects elicited by any compound, experiments were performed at multiple sub-lethal inhibitory concentrations (ICs). A series of known antifungal agents with well-characterized MOAs were tested to validate the CaFT. Several of these compounds have been previously examined in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> fitness test (ScFT), and they enable classification of functionally orthologous genes between organisms.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>CaFT Profiling of Inhibitors of Ergosterol Biosynthesis</title><p>The CaFT strain pool includes heterozygotes for all but three genes involved in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

In the yeast, the movement of nuclei to the bud neck before mitosis and the subsequent separation of nuclei depend on cytoplasmic microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b040">40</xref>]. In the wild-type cells, these events occur in a highly coordinated cell cycle–dependent manner such that the large-budded cells are almost never observed without the nucleus at, or extended through, the bud neck. As nuclear migration defects associated with microtubule perturbation can readily be visualized by DAPI staining of DNA, we examined the terminal phenotypes associated with a <italic>TUB1</italic> conditional shut-off strain and compared them with those observed in the wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells chemically inhibited with benomyl, nocodazole, and representative compounds from each sub-class (ECC85, ECC248, and ECC275). One hour after <italic>TUB1</italic> repression, cell division and nuclear migration were largely arrested in the majority of the cells examined, as large-budded cells were predominantly observed, with nuclear staining being restricted to the mother cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). To visualize microtubules, a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> strain carrying a Tub1p-GFP fusion (under the <italic>TUB1</italic> promoter, otherwise indistinguishable from the wild-type parental strain) was used to compare the effects of known microtubule inhibitors versus these ECC compounds. In the mock-treated (1% DMSO) cells, two distinct sub-cellular microtubule structures were observed depending on the cell cycle: the mitotic spindles (visualized in the large-budded cells) and the spindle-pole bodies (visualized prominently in the small-budded cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). As expected, benomyl and nocodazole ablated the mitotic spindles, resulting in patches or aggregates of tubulin. Defects in nuclear division and G2 cell cycle arrest, as well as a more pronounced filamentous growth, were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">8</xref>D). These results are in agreement with the previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b042">42</xref>] and establish a strong phenotypic correlation between genetic depletion and chemical inhibition of the tubulin function. The defects caused by ECC85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>E), ECC248 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>F), and ECC275 (unpublished data) were similar to those, described above, seen for cells treated with nocodazole, benomyl, or genetically depleted for <italic>TUB1</italic>. However, cells treated with the control compounds fluconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>G) and amphotericin B (unpublished data) lacked microtubule and/or cell cycle defects. To address whether the representative compounds of each ECC sub-class directly inhibit microtubule polymerization, their effects on in vitro bovine microtubule polymerization were examined. ECC85, ECC248, and ECC275 each displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of microtubule polymerization. Moreover, the IC50 (of V<sub>max</sub>) of ECC85 and ECC248 was approximately three times lower that of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg010">Figure S10</xref>).

However, the differences in lifestyles and the functional disconcordance at the genomic level between yeast and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b008">8</xref>], combined with the extensive genome sequence information across the fungal kingdom that is now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b048">48</xref>], provide a timely opportunity to develop fungal genomics tools for basic and applied research in this field. The CaFT, based on the chemically induced responses of heterozygous deletion strains, exploits the diploid nature of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> and provides a global genetic strategy to directly perform such studies in this pathogen.</p><p>The genetic basis of the fitness test is the consequence of heterozygosity in the presence of an inhibitory compound, and hence its readout is based on observable phenotypes and is often concise. As first reported in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b013">13</xref>], chemically induced HI is largely restricted to the target and to other genes whose functions are genetically associated with the target and/or MOA of the inhibitor. This is in stark contrast with results of expression profiling of inhibitory compounds. Examination of the transcriptional responses of either <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to azoles revealed nearly 300 significantly responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b050">50</xref>]. Although many genes in the ergosterol pathway are included in these complex profiles, there is a lack of clear quantitative correlation between the level of responsiveness and their biological relevance to the primary MOA of azoles. The CaFT profiles of fluconazole, however, contain only five significant responsive genes corresponding to the target (Erg11p), its accessory factor (Ncp1p), the principal efflux pump (Cdr1p), and two additional factors involved in drug uptake (Pdr17p and Erg6p, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For most reference compounds examined, significantly responsive strains identified in the CaFT were validated independently, suggesting a low rate of false positives and the effectiveness of the statistical analyses employed.</p><p>Enzyme inhibitors such as azoles, terbinafine, dyclonine, tunicamycin, aureobasidin A, glucan synthase inhibitors, and brefeldin A all induce significant and specific hypersensitivity of heterozygotes corresponding to their targets (including co-factors and regulatory subunits) in the CaFT. Thus, a compelling indication of MOA is generally achieved. Cerulenin is an exception to this trend, as its known target, <italic>FAS2,</italic> showed no HI. Instead, the heterozygote for the other subunit of the FAS complex, <italic>FAS1,</italic> was noticeably hypersensitive. These results are consistent with the Fas1p-dependent stoichiometric regulation of the FAS complex demonstrated in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b020">20</xref>]. We speculate that a <italic>FAS1</italic> strain is specifically hypersensitive to cerulenin because only in this strain is the overall level of the FAS complex compromised, whereas Fas2p levels in the <italic>FAS2</italic> heterozygote are likely upregulated by normal levels of Fas1p to restore the wild-type levels of the FAS complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g003">Figure 3</xref>C for details).</p><p>Inhibitors of protein complexes, such as cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), roridin A, and verrucarin A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg008">Figure S8</xref>), typically produced CaFT profiles reflecting a rich diversity of biologically relevant responses of strains that corroborate their known MOAs. Despite this, discerning the specific subunit targeted within a complex is problematic, as multiple components of the complex are routinely observed as chemically haploinsufficient. Thus, CaFT profiling only yielded a general classification of MOA (ARP2/3-based cortical actin assembly and eIF3-directed translation, respectively), and further studies would be required to refine their molecular targets. Radicicol provides another cogent example of the limitation of the CaFT, in that its well-characterized target (Hsp90p) was unresponsive to drug treatment as a heterozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Instead, strains for its co-chaperones were identified as radicicol sensitive. These results are consistent with the observations that, in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> the activity of Hsp90p is regulated at the post-transcriptional level; that is, it is activated by its co-chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b029">29</xref>]. Similar regulatory control of Hsp90p in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> would account for our observations.</p><p>Mechanistic insights of fitness test profiling can also be extended to nucleoside and base analogs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b013">13</xref>] and this study). For example, both ScFT and CaFT profiling reinforce that ribosomal RNAs are likely the primary target on which the toxicity of 5-FU and 5-FC is exerted. It is unclear whether rRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis is affected largely due to the relative abundance of rRNAs over other RNAs, or if these compounds exert a more specific mechanism targeting rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Ribosomal RNAs are post-transcriptionally modified and contain a disproportionately high number of pseudouridines, an essential modification produced by isomerization of uridine via base rotation and subsequent linking of uracil to the sugar moiety at the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b034">34</xref>]. Thus, rather than a bulk flow MOA for their preferential rRNA effects, a more specific ribosomal biogenesis defect may result from the incorporation of 5-fluorinated uridine into rRNAs, thus effectively blocking this base rotation for the formation of pseudouridine. Consistent with this view, 6-AU, which is able to undergo base rotation, did not yield a CaFT profile indicative of an rRNA processing MOA.</p><p>CaFT profiles often contain additional responsive genes, some of which illuminate drug uptake and efflux mechanisms that play important roles in acquired and inherent resistance to antifungal drugs such as azoles and 5-FC. For example, <italic>CDR1</italic> displays chemically induced HI against all the azoles we examined, as well as other predicted efflux substrates, including brefeldin A, as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b021">21</xref>], radicicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), PF1163A, and latrunculin A (unpublished data). Interestingly, the CaFT also identifies heterozygotes with a selective growth advantage (haploproficiency) in the presence of inhibitory compounds. This is best illustrated by the identification of the well-characterized resistance mechanisms for 5-FC/5-FU in the CaFT. Heterozygosity of the two genes involved in drug uptake <italic>(FCY2)</italic> and metabolic conversion <italic>(FUR1)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b037">37</xref>] result in haploproficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg009">S9</xref>). A similar role was established for the uptake of tubercidin by Nnt1p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). Other responsive genes may underscore their genetic interactions with the drug targets; for example, the dependence of mitotic checkpoint regulation and spindle pole body assembly on microtubule integrity (nocodazole, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; ECC85, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), and a possible stress response associated with tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). Several inhibitors (radicicol, terbinafine, tunicamycin, aureobasidin A, and cytochalasin D) also induce hypersensitivity of heterozygotes whose biological relevance to the targets is unclear. Such hypersensitive strains may reflect potential synthetic interactions between chemical inhibition of the drug target and heterozygosity of the second gene. Alternatively, chemically induced HI in some cases may reflect potential secondary targets of these compounds, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>In this study, over 100 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genes have been classified according to their chemically induced HI with the ∼20 types of inhibitors tested. Although some of these genes have been experimentally characterized in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> most are annotated solely by their similarity to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> orthologs. Their phenotypes in response to selected inhibitors provide a first level of functional annotation. This is best exemplified by screening brefeldin A, which binds to the interface of two proteins (ARF and GEF), both of which are members of conserved protein families in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content>. CaFT profiling identified the functional pair that is most susceptible to brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). The CaFT is, however, currently biased against the identification of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> specific genes for two reasons: 1) only ∼3% of the genes represented in this pilot study are <italic>Candida</italic>-specific (as defined by their absence of clear homologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae, A. fumigatus, S. pombe,</italic> or the human genes, using a BLAST cutoff of 1 × 10<sup>−20</sup>), and 2) the selected probe inhibitors have intrinsic activity against both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and <italic>C. albicans,</italic> and are mechanistically conserved. It is therefore not surprising that the majority of genes identified in this study are conserved. Notwithstanding these restrictions, Nnt1p, a nucleoside transporter absent in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> was identified as required for the uptake of tubercidin in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg009">Figure S9</xref>), suggesting that expanding genomic coverage in the CaFT and screening more diverse inhibitory compounds will likely uncover specific features of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> biology.</p><p>Other potential limitations to the CaFT include: 1) The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> diploid genome contains allelic polymorphisms, some of which may inactivate genes and confound their identity as haplo-responsive strains. However, as summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-st002">Table S2</xref>, failure to detect hypersensitivity of strains for target genes (e.g., <italic>FAS2, HSP90</italic>) was not due to allelic differences, which is only rarely observed amongst 69 other genes pertinent to the CaFT profiles reported here. Although eight of these genes possess some allelic differences, they result in only one or two conservative amino acid change(s) in their corresponding proteins. 2) The inherent HI under the standard growth conditions, as demonstrated by <italic>TIF35</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg008">Figure S8</xref>), may obscure chemically induced HI. However, severe intrinsic HI is rarely observed. Other heterozygotes with modest growth defects (e.g., <italic>FAS1, TUB1</italic>) are not problematic to assay in the fitness test format. 3) The detection of strain responses in the CaFT relies solely on robust hybridization signals of error-free barcodes. The introduction of double barcodes significantly reduces the occurrence of unassayable strains (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b014">14</xref>]). Barcodes of such strains can be sequenced and microarrays redesigned with fully complementary oligonucleotides (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b051">51</xref>]), or such strains can be simply reconstructed with new barcodes. 4) In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> it is known that deletion strains can become aneuploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b052">52</xref>]. Our strain stocks are stored with minimal manipulation, and the strain pool is preserved in aliquots. All the CaFT experiments were performed with aliquots from the same preparation. Although the problem of aneuploidy has not been examined in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> our standard practices should minimize its occurrence.</p><p>We have also explored the CaFT assay as an approach to predicting the MOA of novel antifungal compounds. To this end, a collection of structurally related synthetic compounds with antifungal activity but unknown MOA were examined. Their profiles were highly related to known microtubule inhibitors and highlighted by marked hypersensitivity of the <italic>TUB1</italic> heterozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g007">7</xref>). Subtle differences in CaFT profiles between these compounds were observed, most notably the hypersensitivity of <italic>BUB1</italic> and <italic>ESP1</italic> to one compound (ECC220), as well as a potential secondary effect on cortical actin by a second compound (ECC275). These differences may reflect different structure–activity relationships and/or off-target effects between structurally related compounds, as similarly demonstrated between fenpropomorph and related compounds in the ScFT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b011">11</xref>]. The primary MOA of these ECC compounds as microtubule inhibitors was verified genetically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and biochemically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030092-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). First, the representative ECC compounds phenocopy the genetic depletion and the chemical inhibition of <italic>TUB1;</italic> that is, they promote pronounced cell cycle arrest and nuclear migration defects at early time points and a subsequent pseudohyphal morphology at later time points, as reported with nocodazole-treated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b041">41</xref>]. Second, Tub1p-GFP sub-cellular structure studies reveal that these ECC compounds, nocodazole, and benomyl all similarly disrupt microtubule structures. Third, these ECC compounds inhibit in vitro microtubule polymerization, indicating their primary MOA as microtubule inhibitors.</p><p>CaFT screening of inhibitory compounds, combined with recent target validation strategies in both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b053">53</xref>] and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. fumigatus</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b054">54</xref>], may provide several significant advantages to antifungal drug discovery. The CaFT facilitates a reverse genetic approach; that is, it links traits (responses to inhibitory compounds) to preexisting mutations (heterozygous deletion strains), potentially on a global scale and within the major fungal pathogen. Drug resistance mechanisms can be identified early and in parallel to MOA determination of potential antifungal agents. Drug targets are identified empirically and are biased towards those with intrinsic susceptibility to chemical inhibition. Moreover, only subsequent to the identification of a target–inhibitor interaction is target validation in key fungal pathogens required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b054">54</xref>]. In this way, compound–target pairs may be efficiently prioritized as antifungal drug leads according to their chemical attributes, MOA, and target validation information. In summary, an assayable and comprehensive target set screened across broad chemical diversity may offer a new opportunity to identify antifungal agents that are both mechanistically and structurally novel.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genome annotation.</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genome sequence at 10.9X coverage was determined by the Stanford Genome Technology Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-sequence.stanford.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/</ext-link>).

This configuration provided two very powerful features to these double-barcoded heterozygote strains: 1) it enables PCR amplification of large numbers of distinct up- or down-tags using two sets of common PCR primers, and 2) it allows the identification of each heterozygote strain (and the corresponding gene) via the identities (i.e., the sequences) of a unique pair of up- and down-tags. More specifically, PCR amplification of a deletion cassette containing a <italic>HIS3</italic> auxotrophic marker was performed using 99-nucleotide (nt) oligos containing 1) 5′ sequence of 43 nt directing homologous recombination at the 5′ or 3′ of the target gene, 2) internal strain-identifying unique 20-nt barcodes and flanking common primer sequences for the ultimate PCR amplification of the barcodes in the fitness test assay, and 3) 18 nt of 3′ sequence, which anneals to the 5′ or 3′ of the <italic>CaHIS3</italic> gene and facilitates PCR amplification of the disruption cassette for transformation. Transformants were genotyped for correct integration into the target locus by PCR to confirm the expected 5′ and 3′ junctions. Genes chosen for disruption were selected based on prior knowledge that their closest homolog is 1) known to be essential in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> 2) a member of a gene family known to display a growth phenotype when deleted in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> or 3) conserved in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. fumigatus</named-content> or other fungal organisms. In total, this procedure was applied to 2,868 distinct genes, which represented approximately 45% of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genome. They included all the experimentally demonstrated essential genes we reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b006">6</xref>]. These 2,868 heterozygote strains were cultured individually and manually mixed in approximately equal proportions to generate a pool of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> strains, aliquots of which were frozen and used in all the experiments.

These microarrays contain DNA oligos identical to the up- or down-tags, with each oligonucleotide duplicated side by side. Each array contains 16 sub-arrays (of 16 × 24 spots), for a total of 3,072 duplicated features, corresponding to all the strains in the CaFT pool, and various controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>The CaFT experiments and data analysis.</title><p>For each compound tested, a prior IC curve was determined using the CaFT strain pool (with an initial OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.025) in liquid RPMI medium (in 96-well format), grown at 30 °C for 15 h. Based on the IC curve, 5-ml cultures of the CaFT pool (with the initial OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.025) were treated with the selected compound at multiple concentrations, together with mocks. After 15 h of growth at 30 °C, the fitness (F) values of compound-treated cultures were determined, F = OD<sub>(compound-treated)</sub> / OD<sub>(mock)</sub>; that is, the inverse of IC. Cultures of desired F values were selected and diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.05 with the medium containing the compound at the original concentrations. After another 23 h of growth, all cultures were collected and cell pellets frozen. Following extraction (MasterPure Yeast DNA Purification Kit; Epicentre, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epibio.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.epibio.com/</ext-link>), genomic DNA preparations from compound-treated and mock cultures were PCR amplified with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled common primers. Labeled tags from compound-treated and mock cultures were mixed and hybridized against the corresponding DNA microarray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030092-g001">Figure 1</xref>). (The up- and down-tags were amplified and hybridized separately.) The intensities of signal were obtained for each barcode of compound-treated and mock cultures from a single DNA microarray. They were first converted to a log<sub>2</sub> scale before further analysis. For each tag, the log-fold-dropout (LFD) was computed as the average differences between the mock and the compound-treated. Following the compilation of results for 57 diverse compounds (referred to as the reference set), a statistical profile was computed for each tag by modeling the distribution of LFD as a mixture of a normal component (random variation of the tag when the strain growth is not preferentially affected by the compound) and a uniform distribution (representing unusual LFDs for a given tag). This model was optimized using the EM algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b058">58</xref>], and the parameters of the normal component were stored as a model of the intrinsic variability of a given tag through the complete experiment. For any tag in any given experiment, the computed LFDs are converted to a <italic>z</italic>-score by using the parameters of the corresponding tag profile. To facilitate the comparison of experiments with different LFDs distribution, we applied a multiplicative correction factor to the LFDs that corresponds to 1/<italic>σ<sub>z</sub></italic>, where <italic>σ<sub>z</sub></italic> is the standard deviation of the <italic>z</italic>-scores for that experiment. The <italic>z</italic>-scores were then recomputed from these normalized LFDs and are referred to as normalized <italic>z</italic>-scores. To avoid result overinterpretation, the <italic>z</italic>-scores are not converted to <italic>p</italic>-values and are considered the final quantitative result of the experiment. This approach has the advantage of accounting for the nonspecific sensitivity of some tags/strains to chemical insults and for unexpectedly variable tags/strains, and thus greatly reduces the frequency of false positives. Contrary to other approaches (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030092-b059">59</xref>]), our analyses do not rely on a correlation between signal variability and signal strength, but rather are modeled on a tag-by-tag basis, taking advantage of multiple experiments as pseudo-replicates, and rely on the EM algorithm to identify outliers. We hold that using a set of compound-treated cultures to establish a statistical model is a superior approach to using a set of replicated mock cultures since the latter would not model nonspecific responses to variations such as growth conditions and chemical insult (e.g., broadly hypersensitive stains).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> spot tests.</title><p>Individual heterozygous strains were first grown in liquid medium (without compound) to OD<sub>600</sub> ∼2.
