This is mainly due to the lack of tools for genetic manipulations of pathogenic species. In this study, we characterized a mutant obtained by insertion of the transposon <italic>Himar1</italic> into a gene encoding a putative lipoprotein, Loa22, which has a predicted OmpA domain based on sequence identity. The resulting mutant did not express Loa22 and was attenuated in virulence in the guinea pig and hamster models of leptospirosis, whereas the genetically complemented strain was restored in Loa22 expression and virulence. Our results show that Loa22 was expressed during host infection and exposed on the cell surface.

This disease, which is considered the most geographically widespread zoonosis, has emerged as a major public health problem in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b003">3</xref>]. Numerous mammalian species, including rodents, excrete the pathogen in their urine and serve as reservoirs for transmission. Humans are usually infected through contact with contaminated water or soil. Leptospirosis imparts its greatest burden on poor rural farming and urban slum populations in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b003">3</xref>]. More than 500,000 cases of severe leptospirosis occur each year, with a mortality rate of 5% to 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b004">4</xref>]. Little is understood of <italic>Leptospira</italic> pathogenesis, which in turn has hampered the identification of new intervention strategies.</p><p>Leptospires are highly motile bacteria that are able to penetrate skin and mucous membranes and rapidly disseminate to other tissues shortly after infection. In susceptible hosts such as humans, systemic infection produces severe multi-organ manifestations, including jaundice, acute renal failure, and severe hemorrhage in the lungs and other organs. However, in animal reservoirs such as the domestic rat, infection produces chronic and persistent asymptomatic carriage in the renal tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>The virulence mechanisms, and more generally the fundamental understanding of the biology of the causative agents of leptospirosis, remain largely unknown. To date, only a few proteins have been identified as putative virulence factors. Pathogenic leptospires have been shown to express adhesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b006">6</xref>], hemolysins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b007">7</xref>], and many lipoproteins prominent in leptospires and other spirochetes that could play a role in host–cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b008">8</xref>]. The recent completion of the genome sequence of pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b011">11</xref>] has provided a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. However, to date, the role of putative virulence factors that were identified in the genome sequence remains speculative. The lack of genetic tools to manipulate pathogenic <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Leptospira</named-content> spp. has prevented testing of Koch's molecular postulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b012">12</xref>] and researchers have been unable to elucidate the role of these determinants in virulence.</p><p>We recently provided evidence of gene transfer in <italic>L. interrogans,</italic> which involved the transposition of a transposon of eukaryotic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b013">13</xref>]. This advance has now made it possible to apply genetic approaches to the identification of virulence determinants and vaccine candidates in pathogenic <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Leptospira</named-content> spp. In this study, we characterized a mutant of the pathogen <italic>L. interrogans,</italic> which we obtained by random transposon mutagenesis. This mutant exhibited transposon insertion in a gene, <italic>loa22,</italic> which was described by Koizumi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b014">14</xref>] as encoding for a lipoprotein (Loa22) of 22 kDa with a C-terminal OmpA domain. Previous studies suggested that this protein may play an important role in infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b017">17</xref>]. Herein, we show that the mutant <italic>loa22</italic><sup>−</sup> strain is avirulent in animal models, therefore demonstrating that Loa22 is essential for in vivo infection of pathogenic leptospires.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Disruption and Complementation of <italic>loa22</italic> in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> Serovar Lai</title><p>Plasmid pMSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b013">13</xref>] was used to deliver the spectinomycin-resistant <italic>Himar1</italic> transposon into <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> serovar Lai strain Lai.

According to SpLip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b018">18</xref>], an algorithm for the prediction of spirochetal lipoproteins, Loa22 is a possible lipoprotein with an atypical Leu residue prior to Cys or a probable lipoprotein with a cleavage site between residues 20 and 21, as indicated by the LipoP algorithm for lipoprotein prediction in Gram-negative eubacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b019">19</xref>].

These <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> putative proteins, including Loa22, share between 46% and 59% sequence similarity in their C-terminal domain, but they have significant amino acid sequence heterogeneity in their N-terminal domains.</p><p>Because there is no replicative plasmid vector available for pathogenic <italic>Leptospira,</italic> we reintroduced the wild-type copy of the gene encoding Loa22 into the spectinomycin-resistant mutant strain by using a kanamycin-resistant transposon carrying <italic>loa22</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030097-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

One such determinant, <italic>loa22,</italic> is up-regulated during host infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b017">17</xref>] and encodes a lipoprotein with an OmpA domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b014">14</xref>] that is strongly recognized by sera from human leptospirosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, Loa22 is conserved among pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b016">16</xref>], suggesting that it may play a specific role in disease pathogenesis. However, its role has not been elucidated until now, because targeted mutagenesis was not previously feasible in pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Recently, we showed that the <italic>Himar1 mariner</italic> transposon permits random mutagenesis in the pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b013">13</xref>]. In search of mutants that might be affected in virulence, we identified an <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> mutant exhibiting <italic>Himar1</italic> insertion into <italic>loa22</italic>. By analysis of the <italic>loa22<sup>−</sup></italic> strain, we now show that Loa22 is required for virulence of the pathogen within animal models and fulfills the molecular Koch's postulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b012">12</xref>] as a virulence factor.</p><p>Complementation of the virulence phenotype of the <italic>loa22<sup>−</sup></italic> strain by chromosome insertion of <italic>loa22</italic> demonstrated that the virulence defect was due to the inactivation of <italic>loa22</italic> and not to a second-site mutation. Transcriptional data and sequence analysis of the transposon insertion sites in the mutant and complemented strains further confirm that <italic>Himar1</italic> insertion did not affect another gene that could be involved in virulence (unpublished data). The parental and mutant strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> showed similar cell morphology and growth characteristics in vitro, which demonstrates that <italic>loa22</italic> is not essential for in vitro growth. Although there was no statistical difference in death rates among animals challenged with wild-type and complemented strains, infections with the complemented strain did not cause death in all animals. The inability to restore complete virulence (100% lethality) in the complemented strain did not appear to be due to instability of the construct, because the complemented strain resulted from chromosome insertion. The complemented strain that was re-isolated from animals expressed Loa22. In addition, infection with another strain, TK1, for which the <italic>loa22</italic> gene was complemented at another chromosomal site, caused death rates in guinea pigs (six of eight guinea pigs; challenge dose: 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/ml ), which was not significantly different from results obtained for infections with the TK2 strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030097-t001">Table 1</xref>). The complemented strains were subjected to more in vitro passages than the wild-type strain due to electroporation-mediated transformation followed by plating onto solid medium. Leptospires are known to lose their virulence phenotype with prolonged in vitro culture passages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b021">21</xref>], although the mechanism for this loss is not well understood. It is also possible that the complemented <italic>loa22</italic> gene did not attain the optimal level of expression required for the virulence phenotype.</p><p>Infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> produces a lethal infection in the standard hamster and guinea pig model and mimics the clinical presentation of severe leptospirosis in humans (i.e., jaundice and pulmonary hemorrhage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b003">3</xref>]. Loss of <italic>loa22</italic> attenuated the ability of leptospires to cause clinical disease in addition to death in guinea pigs and hamsters. Consistent with the lack of disease manifestations, mildly abnormal or no pathologic changes were observed in tissues of guinea pigs infected with the <italic>loa22<sup>−</sup></italic> strain. Although the <italic>loa22</italic><sup>−</sup> strain was recovered by culture isolation from blood on post-challenge day 3 and in kidneys of guinea pigs during the 21-d post-inoculation period, immunohistochemical analysis did not detect leptospires in these tissues, suggesting that loss of the <italic>loa22</italic> genotype reduced the pathogen burden in tissues during infection. The lack of tissue pathology observed in <italic>loa22</italic><sup>−</sup>-infected animals presumably reflects decreased inflammation elicited by lower numbers of leptospires. Loa22 may influence one of several virulence steps during infection, such as the ability to disseminate throughout the host after inoculation, adhere to host cells, and establish persistent infection, which may, in turn, explain the finding that mutant <italic>loa22</italic><sup>−</sup> strain did not achieve sufficient numbers in tissues to produce disease manifestations and pathology. The standard inoculation method used in animal models of leptospirosis—intraperitoneal injection—may not reflect conditions encountered during natural infection, because leptospires enter the host by penetrating breaks in the skin or traversing the mucosal membranes. Further studies that use subconjunctival or subcutaneous challenge routes will need to be performed to determine whether Loa22 plays a role in the initial steps of infection.</p><p>The process of host infection by pathogens is usually complex and multifactorial. We observed that loss of <italic>loa22</italic> genotype was associated with complete loss of virulence in the guinea pig model, as indicated by the inability to induce death in these animals. In hamsters, infection with the mutant <italic>loa22<sup>−</sup></italic> strain was associated with significantly reduced death rates (10% versus 100%, mutant versus wild-type strain, respectively) but did not lead to complete loss in the ability to produce a lethal infection. The observed differences may reflect intrinsic differences in susceptibility of the two animal models to infection with the strain <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> serovar Lai, which was used in this study.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that Loa22 is exposed on the surface of <italic>L. interrogans,</italic> confirming the localization of the protein to the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b014">14</xref>]. The structure of Loa22 is composed of a C-terminal OmpA domain of approximately 110 amino acids. This OmpA domain refers to the C terminus of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> OmpA, a major outer membrane protein of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. Orthologs of the OmpA domain are found in proteins from a wide range of bacterial species. Predictions for the structure of this C-terminal OmpA domain have ranged from that of a globular domain containing a predicted peptidoglycan-associating motif that is located in the periplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b023">23</xref>], to a domain containing a significant proportion of anti-parallel β sheets that are associated with the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b025">25</xref>]. The N-terminal domain of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> OmpA was crystallized as a β-barrel–structured porin, which is believed to be inserted into the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b026">26</xref>]. However, this N-terminal region has no significant sequence similarity to Loa22. Because there is no sequence similarity between Loa22 and other OmpA-like proteins in this N-terminal region, these proteins may be structurally distinct.</p><p>The role of Loa22 during pathogenesis remains to be determined. The OmpA protein of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and other Gram-negative bacteria are believed to play a multifunctional role in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, OmpA has been shown to be an adhesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b029">29</xref>] and to induce cytokine production by dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b031">31</xref>].

Furthermore, the lipopeptide moieties of spirochetes are potent mediators of the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b008">8</xref>]. Loa22, which has a lipobox sequence, may therefore induce severe disease manifestations by eliciting the host immunopathogenic responses.</p><p>Proteins of the OmpA family have been proposed to play a role in the stabilization of the envelope structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b023">23</xref>]. Loa22 , which includes a predicted peptidoglycan-associating motif in its C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b014">14</xref>], may form a bridge linking the protoplasmic cylinder, including the peptidoglycan layer, and the outer membrane. Although the <italic>loa22<sup>−</sup></italic> strain was recovered from the animal, we cannot rule out that the absence of this protein in the membrane may affect several steps in host infection, such as the stability of the outer membrane, survival of the leptospiral pathogen in vivo, and the ability to penetrate tissues during dissemination or adhere during colonization.</p><p>In conclusion, this study identified the first virulence factor, to our knowledge, in pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> and will form the basis for further investigation of the role that Loa22 plays in leptospiral pathogenesis. Furthermore, Loa22 is expressed on the leptospiral surface, suggesting that immunization with this protein may elicit bacteriocidal or pathogenesis-blocking immune responses. Bacterin-based vaccines have been used in some countries but they present a number of disadvantages, including adverse reactions, short duration of efficacy, and lack of protection against serovars not included in the vaccine preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b003">3</xref>]. A better understanding of the role of Loa22 may facilitate identification of defined and more effective subunit vaccine candidates for leptospirosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. interrogans</named-content> serovar Lai strain Lai 56601 (gift from the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, ICDC China CDC) and other <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains were grown at 30 °C in EMJH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030097-b033">33</xref>] liquid medium or on 1% agar plates. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.
