Vpu binds CD4 and simultaneously recruits the βTrCP subunit of the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS<sub>52</sub>GXXS<sub>56</sub> motif. In this process, Vpu was found to escape degradation, while inhibiting the degradation of βTrCP natural targets such as β-catenin and IκBα. We further addressed this Vpu inhibitory function with respect to the degradation of Emi1 and Cdc25A, two βTrCP substrates involved in cell-cycle progression. In the course of these experiments, we underscored the importance of a novel phosphorylation site in Vpu. We show that, especially in cells arrested in early mitosis, Vpu undergoes phosphorylation of the serine 61 residue, which lies adjacent to the βTrCP-binding motif. This phosphorylation event triggers Vpu degradation by a βTrCP-independent process. Mutation of Vpu S61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the half-life of the protein and significantly increases the release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells. However, the S61 determinant of regulated Vpu turnover is highly conserved within HIV-1 isolates. Altogether, our results highlight a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or as a substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of the Vpu degradation determinant, despite its negative effect on virion release, argues for a role in overall HIV-1 fitness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>In addition to the structural and catalytic proteins characteristic of retroviruses, HIV-1 encodes auxiliary proteins that govern virus-host interaction. One such auxiliary protein termed Vpu both enhances virion release from human cells and the degradation of CD4, the cellular surface receptor of HIV-1. The latter activity relies on a strategy frequently used by pathogens, i.e., the hijacking of the protein degradation machinery. This process involves the ubiquitin ligases that ensure the selection of the protein subsequently degraded. Vpu interacts both with an ubiquitin ligase and CD4, bridging the latter to the degradation machinery. Here, we show that in addition to subverting one particular ubiquitin ligase to trigger CD4 degradation, Vpu is itself recognized in a phosphorylation-dependent manner by a distinct ubiquitin ligase and degraded. Mutations of Vpu that confer resistance to this degradation process enhance viral particle release, whereas the determinant of Vpu turnover is paradoxically well conserved among HIV-1 isolates. These results suggest that the virus is constrained to limit its own production for long-term persistence.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Mairie de Paris, ANRS, Sidaction and Fondation de France.

This process is regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases that ensure the rate-limiting step of substrate selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b001">1</xref>]. So far, three classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been defined, based on the presence of a HECT, a Ring-H2-finger, and U-box domain, respectively. Within the Ring-H2-finger family are the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box proteins and the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome complexes, which are both involved in cell-cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b002">2</xref>]. The Skp1-Cullin1-F-box proteins display a modular organization consisting of constant core subunits (Skp1, Cullin1, Rbx1/Roc1) associated with a variable component, the F-box protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b004">4</xref>]. The F-box protein binds Skp1 through its F-box motif and recruits the substrate through a second domain. More than 70 F-box proteins have been identified in humans, each member being responsible for the degradation of a specific subset of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b005">5</xref>]. In most cases, the binding of the F-box protein requires specific phosphorylation of the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b006">6</xref>]. For example, βTrCP requires phosphorylation of the serine residues present in the consensus motif DSGΦXS, which is found in most βTrCP substrates. Phosphorylation of the βTrCP recognition motif itself is often controlled by prior phosphorylation events of the substrate protein, which allows a very tight control of the degradation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>Viruses have developed multiple ways to subvert cell signaling pathways to replicate, disseminate, and escape from the host immune system. The diversion of the ubiquitin-mediated degradation machinery represents one such strategy, which has been first documented for the human papillomavirus E6 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b008">8</xref>]. Our earlier study of the human HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) provided the first example reported for HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b009">9</xref>], and there is now a growing list of proteins from various viruses that are reported to induce the degradation of cellular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>Vpu is a small integral membrane protein encoded by HIV-1 and a subset of related simian immunodeficiency viruses and has no homolog in the less pathogenic HIV-2 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b013">13</xref>]. Recent studies in macaques using simian-HIV strains have shown that Vpu plays an active role in the pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b014">14</xref>]. Vpu performs two major functions in HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b015">15</xref>]. First, Vpu enhances the release of retroviral particles from most human cells, including lymphocytes and primary macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b022">22</xref>]. This activity of Vpu, which is not observed in simian cells, is suspected to reflect its ability to counteract a host cell restriction factor specific for human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b025">25</xref>] and may depend on Vpu binding to the host channel TASK-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b026">26</xref>]. Second, Vpu induces the degradation of the CD4 viral receptor and therefore participates in the general downregulation of CD4 expression during the course of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b027">27</xref>]. Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation is thought to prevent CD4-Env binding in the endoplasmic reticulum in order to facilitate proper Env assembly into virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b029">29</xref>]. We earlier reported the cloning and the characterization of βTrCP as a Vpu cell partner that the viral protein connects to CD4 to induce its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b009">9</xref>]. Interaction between βTrCP and Vpu, which controls the subsequent CD4 degradation, depends on the phosphorylation of serines 52 and 56 of Vpu within its DSGΦXS βTrCP recognition motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b030">30</xref>]. In addition, the sequestration of βTrCP by Vpu has been shown to induce the stabilization of the βTrCP substrates, β-catenin and IκBα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b032">32</xref>].</p><p>We and others have previously observed that Vpu remains stable during the course of CD4 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b033">33</xref>]. Here we report the unexpected finding that Vpu is subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation in cells arrested in early mitosis by nocodazole. We further show that this degradation process requires phosphorylation of the serine 61 residue adjacent to the βTrCP-binding motif. Therefore, differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or as a substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The controlled degradation of Vpu, which is not mediated by βTrCP, decreases the efficiency of Vpu-mediated release of HIV-1 virions. It may thus contribute to the balance between efficient HIV-1 dissemination and preservation of the reservoir of infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Vpu Stabilizes Cdc25A but Has No Effect on Emi1, Despite That Both Cellular Proteins Are βTrCP Substrates Involved in Cell-Cycle Progression</title><p>It has been well documented that sequestration of βTrCP by Vpu strongly inhibits the degradation of β-catenin and IκBα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b032">32</xref>]. We investigated whether Vpu also inhibited the degradation of the cell-cycle regulators, Cdc25A and Emi1, whose degradation occurs via a βTrCP-dependent pathway in the S and pro-metaphase steps of the cell cycle, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b037">37</xref>]. In a first set of experiments, we used an expression construct encoding Vpu fused at its carboxyterminus to a HA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag that provided more sensitive and specific detection than the untagged viral protein chimera. This protein is fully functional regarding the two activities of Vpu, enhancement of particles release and CD4 degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030104-sg001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030104-sd001">Text S1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, Myc-Emi1 was readily degraded in Hela cells arrested in early mitosis by nocodazole treatment as compared to asynchronous cells (anti-Myc panel, compare lane 3 to 7). Coexpression of Vpu did not increase the expression of Myc-Emi1 in nonsynchronized cells nor did it restore a detectable level of Myc-Emi1 in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, anti-Myc panel, compare lane 3 to 4 and lane 7 to 8). In contrast, Vpu increased the expression of endogenous β-catenin used as a control (compare lane 1 to 2 and lane 5 to 6). Confirming the lack of effect of Vpu on Emi1 accumulation, Vpu was unable to significantly stabilize endogenous Emi1, either in asynchronous or in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, anti-Emi1 panel, compare lane 1 to 3 or lane 2 to 4). Whether this lack of effect was specific for Emi1 was addressed by monitoring the accumulation of Cdc25A under the same experimental conditions. Cd525A accumulated in cells arrested in early mitosis by nocodazole treatment, as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b035">35</xref>], and Vpu expression further increased this accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, anti-Cdc25A panel, compare lane 1 to 2 and lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these results indicate that Vpu differentially affects βTrCP-mediated degradation events, which occur at different phases of the cell cycle. As a possible explanation for these intriguing observations, the amount of Vpu itself varied depending on cycle progression since expression of Vpu was reduced in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, anti-HA panel, compare lane 2 to 6 and lane 4 to 8 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g001">Figure 1</xref>B compare lane 3 to 4).</p><fig id="ppat-0030104-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030104.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Vpu Is Degraded in Nocodazole-Treated Cells</title><p>(A) Vpu does not affect Emi1 expression.

However, we observed in the present study that inhibition of proteasome activity by MG132 strongly increased the amount of Vpu in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, compare lane 4 to 6). Vpu expression was not affected by a shorter treatment with nocodazole used to disrupt the microtubule network without arresting cells in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lane 1 to 3). The efficiency of this short nocodazole treatment was checked by immunofluroescence using anti-α-tubulin antibodies (unpublished data). Vpu was previously shown to reside in the reticulum and the Golgi compartments and more recently in the recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b038">38</xref>]. Since Golgi compartments undergo a profound redistribution during mitosis, we next asked whether decreased Vpu expression merely resulted from this disassembly process. Vpu amounts remained unchanged following treatment with brefeldin A, which promoted Golgi disassembly, as checked by immunofluorescence with an anti-rab6 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lane 1 to 4; unpublished data). Altogether, these results suggest that the mitotic arrest triggered by nocodazole, rather than an indirect effect induced by microtubules or Golgi-targeting drugs, was responsible for Vpu-induced degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Furthermore, Vpu-HA-GFP was not detectable in mitotic cells by fluorescence microscopy, in contrast to the control RE-GFP protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030104-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-0030104-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030104.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Vpu Degradation in Nocodazole-Treated Cells Is Independent of the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> Activity</title><p>(A) Vpu degradation occurs via the proteasome pathway.</p><p>HeLa cells either mock-transfected (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or expressing Vpu-HA-GFP (lanes 2, 4, and 6) were left untreated or treated for 18 h with nocodazole (lanes 3–6).

We therefore investigated whether this mutation affected the other known Vpu activity, namely, the enhancement of viral particle release that we assayed by monitoring the extracellular content in mature p24 capsid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, HIV-1 encoding the S61 Vpu mutant was released much more abundantly from HeLa cells than the wild-type virus. As reported previously, S52A and S56A mutations of Vpu had no effect on virus release whereas the virus NL4–3ΔVpu was less efficiently released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Quantitative analysis of the ratio of released capsid protein over total amount of capsid indicated that the S61Q Vpu mutant increased the viral release process rather than the expression of the viral capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). To assess the specificity of these effects with respect to the human-restricted activity of Vpu, we further studied HIV-1 particle release from African green monkey Cos 7 cells, where Vpu has been shown to be dispensable for efficient virion release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b024">24</xref>].

To our surprise, Emi1 escaped the Vpu-mediated stabilization observed for the constitutively degraded βTrCP substrate, β-catenin, and for the cell-cycle regulator Cdc25A, normally degraded during the S phase. This paradox may be reconciled by our further demonstration of a regulated degradation process of Vpu itself, which predominantly occurs in early mitosis. Indeed, one simple explanation is that the pool of Vpu drops before the cell cycle reaches the phase where Emi1 degradation takes place, namely at the G2-M transition. Another nonexclusive possibility is the existence of a βTrCP pool dedicated to Emi1 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b039">39</xref>], which is nonaccessible to Vpu.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Vpu as an Adaptor or a Substrate of E3 Ubiquitin Ligases</title><p>We have shown that the phosphorylation of Vpu serine 61, which lies adjacent to the βTrCP recognition motif, is the triggering event for subsequent Vpu degradation. Accordingly, mutation of Vpu serine 61 into a non-phosphorylable residue stabilized Vpu, expressed either alone or in the context of the HIV-1. Two lines of evidence indicate that Vpu degradation occurs via a βTrCP-independent pathway: (i) The Vpu mutant, which fails to recruit βTrCP due to substitutions in its binding motif, was degraded in mitosis-arrested cells to the same extent as the wild-type protein; (ii) conversely, the S61 Vpu mutant, which still binds βTrCP, showed a much slower turnover than the wild-type protein. In turn, this implies that Vpu is recognized as a substrate by an E3 ubiquitin ligase other than βTrCP, as illustrated in the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Vpu has been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase II on serine 52 and serine 56 of the βTrCP-binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b040">40</xref>]. As a result, Vpu binds βTrCP and acts as an adaptor between the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> and CD4, leading to the degradation of the HIV-1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b009">9</xref>]. In contrast, the new phosphorylation event underscored here, which takes place on the serine 61, creates a binding site for an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which in turn targets Vpu for proteasome-mediated degradation. Phosphorylation of the serine 61 residue does not depend on prior phosphorylation of the βTrCP-binding motif since it still occurs when residues 52 and 56 are mutated. However, binding to the two E3 ubiquitin ligases might be mutually exclusive, considering the proximity between their respective binding sites. How the viral protein escapes the degradation via the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase while it is recognized as a substrate by a second ubiquitin ligase remains an open question. It should be emphasized that such an issue holds for other viral proteins that subvert E3 ubiquitin ligases. For example, HPV E6 and E7 proteins show the same dual fate as Vpu: they act as adaptors of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to direct the abnormal degradation of a cellular protein for the benefit of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b011">11</xref>] and as substrates of a probably distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b044">44</xref>]. In the same line, the HIV-1 Vpr protein, which recruits the DDB1-Cul4A E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce cell-cycle arrest as shown in our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b045">45</xref>], appears to be stabilized when incorporated in this complex (unpublished data).</p><fig id="ppat-0030104-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030104.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model for Vpu Degradation</title><p>(A) Vpu as an adaptor of the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> complex or as a substrate targeted to the proteasome via a βTrCP-independent pathway. Vpu is constitutively phosphorylated on the serine 52 and 56 residues present in the βTrCP-binding site. Phosphorylation of these serines is essential for Vpu binding to βTrCP and for CD4 degradation. By bridging βTrCP, a subunit of the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> complex to CD4, Vpu induces proteasome-mediated degradation of CD4. In this case, Vpu acts as an adaptor of the βTrCP complex, now able to target CD4. Here, we underscore an additional phosphorylation event taking place at the S61 residue. This phosphorylation site is critical for Vpu turnover and for the control of virus release. In this other setting, Vpu behaves as a substrate of an E3 ubiquitin ligase distinct from the βTrCP complex.</p><p>(B) The determinant of regulated Vpu turnover is highly conserved within HIV-1 isolates. Among the Vpu sequences from 100 strains of HIV-1 group M analyzed by McCormick-Davis and coworkers (2000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b046">46</xref>], 77% show a serine residue, either at position 61 or at position 64, i.e., 4 and 7 residues downstream of the βTrCP-binding motif (in the rectangle). In addition, this serine is always preceded by the EI or EL di-residue. Only six representative Vpu sequences have been chosen in our alignment to highlight this conservation. “−”, aa identical to HIVHXB2 and “.”, gaps introduced for optimal alignment of sequences.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030104.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Limiting the Release of Viral Particles</title><p>We show here that the slower turnover of Vpu resulting from S61 substitution increases the release of HIV-1 virions, hence suggesting a selective advantage. This prompted us to examine the degree of conservation of the corresponding Vpu residue among HIV-1 isolates. To address this point, we took advantage of the previous analysis performed by McCormick-Davis and coworkers (2000) on the Vpu sequences from 100 strains of HIV-1 group M from diverse geographical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b046">46</xref>]. Remarkably, 77% of these strains showed a serine residue, either at position 61 or at position 64, i.e., 4 and 7 residues downstream of the βTrCP-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030104-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and unpublished data). Of note, this spacing difference corresponds to one helix turn, which suggests that the relevant serine residue is presented on the same face of the Vpu α-helix. This indicates that within the M group of HIV-1, the evolutionary trend is toward the conservation of a regulated Vpu degradation process. HIV-1 replicates in both quiescent and dividing cells. In the latter, it might be advantageous for the virus to fine-tune virion production according to cell-cycle progression. This may in turn reflect that long-term persistence of the virus requires the optimal balance between efficient viral production and host cell viability. In light of our present study, the regulated degradation process of Vpu is expected to be lost in the viral strains naturally mutated at the relevant phosphorylation site. Whether these strains show higher pathogenicity will be interesting to address for our better understanding of the constraints that govern the relation between HIV-1 and the human organism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid constructs.</title><p>pcDNA3 Vpu-HA-GFP and Vpu2/6-HA-GFP were described in Besnard-Guerin et al., 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030104-b032">32</xref>].

Therefore, about 50% of the cells expressing Vpu are CD4-negative (see histogram). After transfection of Vpu2/6-HA-GFP, 49% (46.2 + 2.8) of the cells do express Vpu; 2.8% of them are CD4-negative (FACS panel, right).
