While the sequence of V3 is variable, its length is highly conserved. Structural studies indicate that V3 length may be important for interactions with the extracellular loops of the coreceptor. Consistent with this view, genetic truncation of the V3 loop is typically associated with loss of Env function. We removed approximately one-half of the V3 loop from three different HIV-1 strains, and found that only the Env protein from the R5X4 strain R3A retained some fusion activity. Loss of V1/V2 (ΔV1/V2) was well tolerated by this virus. Passaging of virus with the truncated V3 loop resulted in the derivation of a virus strain that replicated with wild-type kinetics. This virus, termed TA1, retained the V3 loop truncation and acquired several adaptive changes in gp120 and gp41. TA1 could use CCR5 but not CXCR4 to infect cells, and was extremely sensitive to neutralization by HIV-1 positive human sera, and by antibodies to the CD4 binding site and to CD4-induced epitopes in the bridging sheet region of gp120. In addition, TA1 was completely resistant to CCR5 inhibitors, and was more dependent upon the N-terminal domain of CCR5, a region of the receptor that is thought to contact the bridging sheet of gp120 and the base of the V3 loop, and whose conformation may not be greatly affected by CCR5 inhibitors. These studies suggest that the V3 loop protects HIV from neutralization by antibodies prevalent in infected humans, that CCR5 inhibitors likely act by disrupting interactions between the V3 loop and the coreceptor, and that altered use of CCR5 by HIV-1 associated with increased sensitivity to changes in the N-terminal domain can be linked to high levels of resistance to these antiviral compounds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The envelope protein of HIV-1 is responsible for binding virus to the surface of cells and mediating viral entry. Viral entry can be prevented by neutralizing antibodies that bind to envelope, and by small molecule inhibitors that bind to viral receptors on the cell surface, such as CCR5. HIV may acquire resistance to these small molecule inhibitors, several of which are being used in clinical trials to treat HIV-infected individuals, through resistance mechanisms that are not well understood. In addition, broadly neutralizing antibodies are rare—the envelope protein possesses structural features that limit antibody binding. We made a partial deletion in a region of envelope that interacts with viral receptors, and which is also widely believed to act as a shield against neutralizing antibodies. Normally, an envelope with such a modification would have total loss of function. However, by passaging virus with the partially deleted envelope in vitro, the envelope acquired adaptive mutations that restored function. Virus with the adapted envelope was highly sensitive to neutralizing antibodies and so may serve as a platform for immunization. This envelope also exhibited complete resistance to small molecule inhibitors that bind to the viral receptor CCR5, and lends insight into a mechanism of drug resistance by which the virus interacts with viral receptors on the cell surface in a novel manner.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by US National Institutes of Health grants R37 AI457800 (JAH), R01 AI040880 (RWD), R01 AI041356 (LS), and T32 AI007632.

Structural features that contribute to immune evasion include an extensive array of N-linked carbohydrate structures that are relatively non-immunogenic, conformational flexibility, and the presence of surface-exposed variable loops that can undergo extensive antigenic variation and still shield more conserved regions of Env that are involved in receptor binding (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b001">1</xref>]). The V1/V2 variable loop region varies greatly in both amino acid sequence and length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b005">5</xref>]. Functionally, V1/V2 appears to play a minor role in governing interactions between Env and coreceptors, and its genetic ablation in both HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus is sometimes tolerated without a significant loss of Env function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b009">9</xref>]. However, genetic removal of the V1/V2 loop is associated with enhanced neutralization of virus by antibodies to the CD4 binding site as well as by antibodies to CD4-induced epitopes that overlap with the conserved coreceptor binding site in the bridging sheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b009">9</xref>], a four-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet formed during CD4 binding that connects the inner and outer domains of the gp120 core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the V1/V2 region, the V3 loop plays an important functional role in viral entry, being the primary determinant of whether CCR5 (R5), CXCR4 (X4), or both CCR5 and CXCR4 (R5X4) can be used as coreceptors to initiate infection (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b012">12</xref>]). Although the precise mechanism by which the V3 loop governs coreceptor interactions is not clear, sequence motifs commonly associated with CXCR4 usage, including the presence of basic residues at positions 11 and 25 within the V3 loop, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b014">14</xref>]. In addition to sequence motifs, the overall length of the V3 loop is likely to be important, as most V3 sequences are 34 or 35 residues in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b016">16</xref>]. Structural studies have shown that following CD4 binding, the V3 loop protrudes from the gp120 core by 30 Å, with this length likely enabling it to interact with the viral coreceptor following CD4 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b017">17</xref>]. The V3 loop is also a target for neutralizing antibodies, and like the V1/V2 region plays a role as an immunological shield, protecting conserved regions in Env that would otherwise be a target for more broadly neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b019">19</xref>]. Indeed, genetic truncation of the V3 loop is associated with enhanced binding of antibodies to the CD4 binding site as well as to CD4-induced epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>Given the functional importance of the V3 loop, it is not surprising that its genetic ablation is usually associated with loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b023">23</xref>]. Recently, we have been able to remove both the V1/V2 region and the V3 loop from a CD4-independent HIV-2 Env through a step-wise process of mutation followed by adaptation, obtaining a replication competent virus (G. Lin, A. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, B. Haggarty, J. Romano, K. McGeehan, et al., unpublished data). In this study, we sought to develop fully functional HIV-1 Envs bearing significant deletions in the V3 loop to probe the role of this domain in protecting virus from neutralization and in coreceptor interactions. We found that one of three HIV-1 Env proteins tested, the R5X4 Env R3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b025">25</xref>], could tolerate loss of 15 residues from the distal portion of its V3 loop. Our results show not only that the V3 loop plays an important role in protecting HIV-1 from neutralization, but that altered use of CCR5 by the in vitro–adapted virus results in high levels of resistance to small molecule CCR5 inhibitors, several of which are under clinical development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Derivation of a Replication Competent HIV-1 Strain Containing a 15–Amino Acid Deletion within Its V3 Loop</title><p>To produce a replication competent HIV-1 strain lacking much of its V3 loop, we kept the following principles in mind. First, the effects of deletions within the V1/V2 region on Env function are context dependent. In some instances, significant deletions within this region do not affect Env function, whereas in other instances Env function is diminished or lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b009">9</xref>]. We reasoned that this might also hold true for truncations within the V3 loop. Therefore, we introduced V3 loop deletions into three different, primary HIV-1 strains: the R5X4 strains R3A and DH12, and the X4 strain TYBE. Second, while previous studies have shown that genetic ablation of the V3 loop typically abrogates Env function, in one instance removal of three amino acids from each arm of the V3 stem from an R5X4 virus resulted in a virus that lost the ability to use CCR5, but could still mediate infection of cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b026">26</xref>]. In another study, 23 residues were removed from the center of the 35 amino acid–long V3 loop in the lab-adapted X4 virus strain HXBc2, resulting in an Env protein that could mediate entry into Jurkat cells approximately 10-fold less efficiently than the wild-type (WT) virus Env protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b022">22</xref>]. Finally, we have been able to derive a replication competent HIV-2 from a lab-adapted strain via a process of partial V3 loop deletions followed by viral adaptation in vitro (G. Lin, A. Bertolotti-Ciarlet, B. Haggarty, J. Romano, K. McGeehan, et al., unpublished data). Therefore, we introduced different sized deletions in the V3 loop of each virus strain. Specifically, we removed nine, 15, or 21 residues from the center of the 35 amino acid–long V3 loop, replacing the deleted region with a GAG linker sequence. Equivalent portions in each arm of the V3 loop stem were retained, and this information was used to describe each mutant: ΔV3(12,12) contains the first and last 12 residues of the V3 loop (excluding the Cys residues that mark the beginning and end of the V3 loop) separated by a GAG sequence, ΔV3(9,9) retains the first and last nine residues of the V3 loop separated by a GAG sequence, and ΔV3(6,6) the first and last six residues of the V3 loop separated by a GAG sequence.</p><p>Envs containing V3 loop deletions were tested for their ability to mediate cell–cell fusion. We reasoned that Envs unable to mediate cell–cell fusion would also not function in the context of viral infection. To do this, Envs were transiently expressed in quail QT6 cells that were then mixed with QT6 cells expressing CD4 alone, CD4 and CCR5, or CD4 and CXCR4. In this assay, fusion between effector and target cells results in the production of readily quantifiable luciferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b027">27</xref>]. We found that DH12 and TYBE Env proteins were rendered non-functional by even the smallest of the V3 loop deletions in this assay (unpublished data). We also found that these Envs lost fusion activity when their V1/V2 loops were removed. In contrast, HIV-1 R3A ΔV3(9,9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) was able to support cell fusion at levels that were approximately 25% of the WT protein, but only with cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, the ability to utilize CXCR4 appeared to be lost as a result of this V3 loop truncation. Larger deletions in the V3 loop were not tolerated. In contrast, removal of the entire V1/V2 loop from R3A had little effect on membrane fusion activity, and actually enhanced fusion on cells expressing CCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These results confirm that deletion of the V1/V2 loop on Env function is context dependent, and that significant deletions within the V3 loop can sometimes be tolerated.</p><fig id="ppat-0030117-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030117.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>HIV-1 Env Constructs and the Effects of Env Variable Loop Deletions on Fusion Activity</title><p>(A) A schematic representation of the R3A, ΔV1/V2 (deletion of residues 126–196, but retains the cysteines at the base of the loops), ΔV3(9,9), and TA1 constructs is shown.

Since virus attachment to target cells is often rate-limiting for viral infection in vitro, plasmid DNA was electroporated into SupT1.CCR5.DCSIGNR cells, which stably express CXCR4, CCR5, and the C-type lectin DC-SIGNR. DC-SIGNR mediates efficient attachment of HIV to the cell surface, and thus can boost infection efficiency by accelerating the rate-limiting step of virus attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b028">28</xref>]. Cells were electroporated twice, then passaged for an additional 7 wk with regular addition of fresh SupT1.CCR5.DCSIGNR cells. After 8 wk of coculture, a spreading infection was established, with over 80% of the cells positive for p24 by immunofluorescence. After 11 subsequent cell-free passages, we compared the replication kinetics of the viral swarm with WT R3A virus on SupT1.CCR5.DCSIGNR cells, and found that the passaged virus replicated with WT kinetics. Thus, we concluded that partial deletion of the V3 loop followed by cell passaging resulted in the acquisition of compensatory mutations that restored Env function to near WT levels, as judged by replication efficiency on SupT1.CCR5.DCSIGNR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g002">Figure 2</xref> and unpublished data). Virus with the ΔV1/V2 Env replicated somewhat more slowly than R3A.

In TA1, there were two additional conservative amino acid mutations, R254K in conserved region 2 (C2), and T342A in C3 that resulted in the loss of a second N-linked glycosylation site.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Tropism of a Virus Bearing a V3 Loop Deletion</title><p>Because extensive cell passaging was required to derive virus that could replicate well despite losing much of its V3 loop, it was possible that the adaptation process may have altered viral tropism, and that TA1 might be uniquely adapted to grow on SupT1.CCR5.DCSIGNR cells. We found that in contrast to the WT R3A virus, the TA1 virus was unable to infect cell lines that expressed only CD4 and CXCR4, including SupT1, MT-2, Molt-4 clone 8, and U87.CD4.CXCR4, which is consistent with the failure of TA1 Env to mediate fusion with quail cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030117-t001">Table 1</xref>). TA1 was able to mediate infection of cell lines expressing CD4 and CCR5, including SupT1.CCR5 cells lacking DC-SIGNR, Jurkat.tat.CCR5, and U87.CD4.CCR5. We were unable to detect a productive infection in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) or CD4+ T cells with TA1, whereas the R3A virus can use CCR5 or CXCR4 to enter MDMs, and uses CXCR4 as the preferred coreceptor for entry into CD4+ T cells (Yanji Yi, personal communication).</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="ppat-0030117-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030117.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Tropism of Viruses with or without Variable Loop Deletions</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030117.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><hr/>Cell Type</td><td colspan="4"><hr/>Env</td></tr><tr><td><hr/>R3A</td><td><hr/>TA1</td><td><hr/>&Delta;V1/V2</td><td><hr/>&Delta;V3(9,9)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SupT1<sup>a</sup></td><td>&plus;&plus;&plus;<sup> b</sup></td><td>&minus;</td><td>&plus;&plus;&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>MT-2<sup>a</sup></td><td>&plus;&plus;&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>Molt-4 clone 8<sup>a</sup></td><td>&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>U87.CD4.CXCR4</td><td>&plus;&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&plus;&plus;&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>SupT1.CCR5.DCSIGNR<sup>a</sup></td><td>&plus;&plus;</td><td>&plus;&plus;</td><td>&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>Jurkat.tat.CCR5<sup>a</sup></td><td>&plus;&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>CEM.CCR5<sup>a</sup></td><td>&plus;&plus;</td><td>&plus;<sup>c</sup></td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr><tr><td>U87.CD4.CCR5</td><td>&plus;&plus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td><td>&minus;</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p><sup>a</sup>Cell lines express endogenous CXCR4.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><p><sup>b</sup>Increase in RT value over background (day 0); &plus; &equals; 1 log, &plus;&plus; &equals; 2 logs, &plus;&plus;&plus; &equals; 3 logs. &minus; indicates no increase in value over background.</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><p><sup>c</sup>Increase in RT value only after 14 d in culture.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap><p>Although the ΔV1/V2 Env could mediate fusion with quail QT6 cells expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4, infection with ΔV1/V2-pseudotyped virus or replication competent virus was cell line–dependent.

In contrast, virions bearing the ΔV1/V2 Env were efficiently neutralized by three of the four HIV-positive human sera samples, while virions bearing the TA1 Env were the most neutralization sensitive of all, being efficiently neutralized by all human sera samples tested. To determine if the sensitivity of TA1 virions to neutralization was due to truncation of the V3 loop or due to the presence of the adaptive mutations, we compared the sensitivity of TA1 virions to those bearing the unadapted ΔV3(9,9) truncation. However, since ΔV3(9,9) virions entered cells inefficiently, the viral inoculum had to be increased 5-fold to obtain a sufficiently high signal.

This CXCR4- dependent entry could be efficiently blocked by the small molecule inhibitor AMD3100 (unpublished data). Thus, a high concentration of AMD3100 was included to suppress this background level of infection when the sensitivity of R3A virions to CCR5 inhibitors was being determined.</p><p>Virus pseudotypes bearing the ΔV1/V2 Env protein used CCR5 to enter 293.CD4.CCR5 cells, and were 5- to 10-fold more sensitive than the parental R3A to inhibition by the panel of CCR5 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">5</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">5</xref>F). In contrast, TA1 virus pseudotypes were completely resistant to the CCR5 inhibitors. Infection was not observed in the absence of CCR5, confirming that TA1 infection was CCR5-dependent (unpublished data). Interestingly, infection was consistently enhanced in the presence of high levels of AD101, though not by aplaviroc. A small degree of enhancement was also observed when very high levels of CMPD167 were used. These results suggest that TA1 utilizes the AD101-bound conformation of CCR5 more efficiently than CCR5 that is not bound to this allosteric inhibitor. We also performed cell–cell fusion assays (in the absence of AMD3100) and found that TA1-mediated cell–cell fusion could only be reduced by 50% at very high levels of aplaviroc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Fusion mediated by the parental ΔV3(9,9) Env was also resistant to CCR5 inhibitors, indicating that truncation of the V3 loop alone imparted resistance to this class of entry inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">5</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030117-g005">5</xref>G).

If so, TA1 may interact with CCR5 differently than the parental R3A Env. A model for Env–CCR5 interactions is that the V3 loop interacts with the extracellular loops (ECLs) of the receptor, particularly ECL2, while the amino terminal domain of CCR5 interacts with the bridging sheet and base of the V3 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b037">37</xref>].

However, TA1 entry was much more sensitive to changes at the extreme amino terminus of CCR5, particularly D2A and Y3A, confirming the results of the neutralization assay with CTC5, whose epitope overlaps these amino acids.

The V3 loop is the major determinant of coreceptor choice, with changes in specific residues being associated with alterations in viral tropism at the level of CCR5 and CXCR4 recognition, as well as with viral sensitivity to chemokines and entry inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b046">46</xref>]. In addition, it is a target for neutralizing antibodies, and may help to shield the conserved domains on the gp120 core from what would otherwise be broadly neutralizing antibodies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b047">47</xref>]). Structurally, the V3 loop exhibits little variation in length, with the vast majority of isolates containing V3 loops that contain 34 or 35 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b016">16</xref>]. This conservation of length may be related to the requirement that the V3 loop engage CCR5 or CXCR4 only after Env has bound CD4, which might position gp120 a defined distance from the cell surface and, as a result, from the coreceptors to which it must bind. The highly conserved length of the V3 loop stands in marked contrast to the V1/V2 and V4 variable loops, which exhibit extensive sequence and length variation and play a subsidiary role in viral entry.</p><p>In light of these constraints, it is perhaps not surprising that truncations in the V3 loop are associated with either lost or significantly reduced Env function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b026">26</xref>]. In this report, we introduced significant V3 loop truncations into three HIV-1 Env proteins, of which only one (R3A) retained functional competence. Until a larger number of Envs are examined, it is not possible to predict whether any given virus will be able to tolerate significant deletions within the V3 loop. R3A was derived from an HIV-positive individual who progressed to AIDS rapidly, with syncytium-inducing viruses being detected early after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b048">48</xref>]. Virus bearing the R3A Env is dual-tropic and is unusually cytopathic in human fetal thymus organ cultures and in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b050">50</xref>]. R3A can also mediate fusion with SupT1 cells very efficiently, with this property being due at least in part to the V1/V2 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b024">24</xref>]. Perhaps because of its highly fusogenic nature, R3A was better able to tolerate a significant deletion within its V3 loop.</p><p>Truncation of the V3 loop on R3A was associated with markedly enhanced sensitivity of virus to neutralization by MAbs directed to the bridging sheet and CD4 binding site (but not to other epitopes), as well as to neutralization by HIV-positive human sera samples that were otherwise unable to neutralize the parental virus with an intact V3 loop. These findings are reminiscent of observations that CD4-independent HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus strains are highly neutralization sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b053">53</xref>]. CD4-independent viruses are thought to exist in a conformation that resembles the CD4-bound conformation. As a result, MAbs to the bridging sheet can bind to these viruses in the absence of CD4, resulting in efficient neutralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b034">34</xref>]. The fact that CD4-independent viruses are easily neutralized by HIV-positive human sera suggests that antibodies to the bridging sheet are generated during the course of viral infection, but cannot bind to and neutralize WT virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b052">52</xref>]. Our results support the widely accepted view that the V3 loop plays an important role in protecting this conserved domain from antibody recognition. However, TA1 is CD4-dependent. Thus, upon truncation of the V3 loop, it is possible that antibodies to the bridging sheet or other conserved domains on the gp120 core can bind to Env after the virus has bound CD4 at the cell surface, which suggests that the V3 loop may function in part as a steric shield, protecting conserved domains in gp120 from circulating antibodies even after the virus has engaged CD4.</p><p>The most striking result of our study was that the TA1 virus was completely resistant to three different CCR5 inhibitors. In contrast, the use of CCR5 by the parental R3A Env could be efficiently blocked by CCR5 inhibitors, while the ΔV1/V2 virus exhibited enhanced sensitivity to these compounds. We hypothesize that loss of the V1/V2 region is associated with reduced affinity for CCR5, as this could account not only for the fact that the ΔV1/V2 virus is more sensitive than R3A to CCR5 inhibitors, but that it exhibits enhanced sensitivity for enfuvirtide as well. The antiviral activity of enfuvirtide is subject to kinetic constraints, as the binding site for this drug in the HR1 region of gp41 becomes available only after Env has engaged CD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b054">54</xref>]. Thus, there is a kinetic window between CD4 binding and membrane fusion during which Env is sensitive to enfuvirtide. All other things being equal, reduced affinity for coreceptor slows membrane fusion kinetics, prolongs the exposure of the enfuvirtide binding site, and enhances sensitivity to enfuvirtide. In addition, reduction in CCR5 affinity in genetically similar Envs increases sensitivity to CCR5 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b055">55</xref>].</p><p>High-level resistance of HIV-1 isolates to CCR5 inhibitors is unusual, though there is baseline variability in the sensitivity of R5 Env and R5X4 Envs to these antiviral compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b058">58</xref>]. When resistance is selected for in vitro, it has often been associated with continued use of CCR5 by the adapted virus rather than a “coreceptor switch” in which the ability to use CXCR4 is acquired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b059">59</xref>].

Whether this entails recognition of altered CCR5 conformations or regions of CCR5 that are not conformationally altered by the drug, increased affinity for CCR5, or a combination of mechanisms, is not clear.</p><p>How might the complete resistance of TA1 to multiple CCR5 inhibitors be explained, and could this provide insight into how HIV acquires resistance to these antiviral agents in vivo? It is evident that virus bearing the TA1 Env requires CCR5 to infect cells. Thus, its resistance to CCR5 inhibitors cannot be ascribed to the use of CXCR4 or alternative coreceptors. Rather, TA1 continues to use CCR5 efficiently, even in the face of very high concentrations of potent CCR5 inhibitors, which indicates that TA1 recognizes the drug-bound conformation of CCR5. In fact, TA1 may recognize the drug-bound conformation of CCR5 more efficiently than the unbound receptor, as we consistently observed enhanced fusion and infection of CCR5-positive cells by TA1 in the presence of high concentrations of the CCR5 inhibitor AD101 and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of CMPD167 and aplaviroc. A variety of studies suggest that the V3 loop contacts the extracellular loops of CCR5, with the second extracellular loop being particularly important for coreceptor function (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b063">63</xref>]). CCR5 inhibitors are thought to bind to a hydrophobic cavity formed by the first, second, third, and seventh transmembrane domain helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b064">64</xref>], and may disrupt subsequent binding by MAbs that recognize epitopes in the second extracellular loop of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b061">61</xref>]. Thus, CCR5 inhibitors may alter the conformation of the extracellular loops of the receptor, preventing interactions with the V3 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030117-b065">65</xref>]. Our results indicate that, faced with the loss of the V3 loop, the TA1 virus acquired adaptive changes that enhanced its ability to interact with the N-terminal domain of CCR5, a region of the receptor that is thought to contact the bridging sheet of gp120 and the base of the V3 loop and whose conformation may not be greatly affected by CCR5 inhibitors. If such a “shift” in how Env recognizes CCR5 is typically associated with inhibitor resistance, then the identification of inhibitors that perturb the amino terminal domain of CCR5 may prove to be useful antiviral agents, with viruses such as TA1 being receptor ligands that can be used to identify such compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells.</title><p>QT6, 293T/17, and 293.CD4.CCR5 cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM), plus 0.3 mg/ml G418 and 0.2 mg/ml zeomycin where appropriate.
