Here, we report that differential interactions between dendritic cells (DCs) and virus are critical in determining resistance versus susceptibility in the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus–induced demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. This virus induces a chronic demyelinating disease in susceptible mice, whereas the virus is completely cleared in resistant strains of mice. DCs from susceptible mice are more permissive to viral infection, resulting in severe deficiencies in development, expansion, and function, in contrast to DCs from resistant mice. Although protective prior to viral infection, higher levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and IFN-γ produced by virus-infected DCs from susceptible mice further contribute to the differential inhibition of DC development and function. An increased DC number and/or acquired resistance of DCs to viral infection render susceptible mice resistant to viral persistence and disease progression. Thus, the differential permissiveness of DCs to infectious agents and its subsequent functional and developmental deficiencies determine the outcome of infection- associated diseases. Therefore, arming DCs against viral infection–induced functional decline may provide a useful intervention for chronic infection-associated diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Many chronic viral diseases are associated with prolonged viral persistence levels, which vary from one individual to another. However, the mechanisms of differential susceptibility to persistent viral infections are unknown. Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces a chronic demyelinating disease similar to multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms of differential susceptibility to chronic viral persistence in the central nervous system following infection with TMEV. Our results indicate that differential interactions between virus and dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the induction of anti-viral immunity, are critical in determining resistance or susceptibility to virus-induced chronic demyelinating disease. DCs from susceptible mice are much more permissive to viral infection, resulting in severe deficiencies in their development, expansion, and function, whereas DCs from resistant mice are not permissive. Consequently, the DCs in susceptible mice are responsible for poor anti-viral T cell activation, permitting viral persistence and disease development in the host. Interestingly, the administration of additional DCs or pre-activated virus-resistant DCs enables susceptible mice to resist persistent viral infection and disease development. This knowledge may be useful in devising effective means to induce strong anti-viral immune responses, thereby protecting the host from virus-associated chronic diseases caused by persistent viral infection.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the US National Institutes of Health grants NS-28752 and NS-33008 and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society grant RG3126-A4.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hou W, So EY, Kim BS (2007) Role of dendritic cells in differential susceptibility to viral demyelinating disease.

Several genes involved in innate and adaptive immune responses are known to be associated with such differential susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b002">2</xref>]. Consequently, different levels and types of immune responses to causative antigens are often correlated with susceptibility/resistance to diseases. However, the underlying immune mechanisms are largely unknown. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in the determination of resistance versus susceptibility is a crucial step towards better disease control. Recent studies have indicated that dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in the induction and maintenance of strong immunity to infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b003">3</xref>]. Thus, it is conceivable that the differential responsiveness of DCs to an identical pathogen in resistant and susceptible individuals may lead to disparate levels of protective and/or pathogenic immunity, resulting in differential susceptibility to virus-associated diseases. In this study, we examine this possibility using the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)–induced demyelinating disease model for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p>TMEV is a picornavirus that causes chronic demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS) of susceptible mice, such as SJL/J (SJL), following the establishment of persistent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b004">4</xref>]. This demyelinating disease has immune parameters and histopathology similar to those of chronic progressive MS and thus is extensively studied as an infectious model for MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b004">4</xref>]. However, susceptibility to persistent infection and demyelination varies among inbred strains of mice. For example, in contrast to susceptible SJL mice, resistant strains of mice such as C57BL/6 (B6) are able to completely clear the virus and do not develop late chronic demyelinating disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b006">6</xref>]. Many previous studies have indicated that TMEV clearance from the CNS is mainly mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b009">9</xref>], although such T cells may also be pathogenic, particularly during chronic demyelinating disease. The anti-viral CTL response in resistant mice is significantly more rapid and intense compared to that of susceptible mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b011">11</xref>], suggesting that this response is critical in preventing the establishment of viral persistence. Similarly, the level of virus capsid–specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response following viral infection in resistant mice is significantly higher than that in susceptible mice, despite the higher level of overall CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in the CNS of susceptible mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b012">12</xref>]. These results demonstrate that lower levels of initial anti-viral T cell response in susceptible mice may consequently allow the virus to establish chronic persistence. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms involved in such differential levels of anti-viral immune responses between susceptible and resistant mice are not fully understood.</p><p>DCs play a central role in the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses to infectious agents, including bacteria and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b003">3</xref>]. They are distributed in the skin, mucosa, and in lymphoid organs, where they efficiently take up diverse microbial antigens, then process and present them as major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–peptide complexes to T cells. Following the recognition of pathogens, DCs undergo a series of activation processes. Once activated, DCs migrate into the T cell zone of lymphoid organs, where antigen-specific immune cells can be primed. Migration coincides with a maturation process that results in morphological, phenotypic, and functional changes. Moreover, activated DCs have the capacity to recruit and/or activate cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b003">3</xref>]. However, DC function and its consequent adaptive immune response depend largely upon the interaction between DCs and microbial signals, which can enhance or impair DC function via Toll-like receptors, c-type lectins, CD40, cytokine receptors, or other pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, several research groups have recently shown the presence of DCs in the meninges and choroid plexus of healthy rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b016">16</xref>]. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that local antigen-presenting cells (APCs), possibly DCs, can activate naïve T cells that enter the inflamed CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b017">17</xref>]. It has also been noted that the DCs associated with CNS vessels are sufficient to prime myelin-reactive T cells in vivo, resulting in CNS inflammation and clinical disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b018">18</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that neurotropic TMEV evades immune recognition and establishes latency by subverting DC function in susceptible strains of mice, but not in resistant mice. In this study, we address the role of DC responses in viral persistence and its consequent demyelinating disease in prototypically susceptible SJL and resistant B6 mice. We sought to answer the following questions: First, is the level of viral infection/replication in DCs from susceptible mice greater than that of resistant mice? Second, are DC differentiation and activation/maturation preferentially impaired in susceptible mice? If this is the case, what are the major mechanisms involved in these differential DC responses following viral infection? Finally, can an increased DC number and/or acquired resistance to viral infection rescue susceptible mice from chronic viral persistence and from developing demyelinating disease?</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Enhanced TMEV Replication in DCs from Susceptible Mice Blocks DC Maturation</title><p>There are significant differences in persistent viral infection and its consequent demyelinating disease between SJL and B6 mice. To examine whether these differences may be associated with differential susceptibility of DCs to TMEV infection, bone marrow (BM) DCs were studied for expression of TMEV antigens and virus production. TMEV was able to bind equally well to DCs from either susceptible SJL or resistant B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated TMEV failed to bind DCs from SJL and B6 mice, which is consistent with the abrogation of receptor-mediated binding of other picornaviruses by UV inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b019">19</xref>]. These findings suggest that the binding of TMEV to DCs is not due to non-specific stickiness. In addition, TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells were detected by 6 h post-infection in the SJL DCs, but not at 1 h post-infection, suggesting that new protein synthesis was required for the detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast to SJL DC cells, DC cells from B6 mice were far less susceptible to infection, and the virus yield in single-step growth curves from B6 cultures was approximately one log lower than that from SJL cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, right panel). Differences in DC viral infection between SJL and B6 mice were evident throughout several days of culturing BM cells (BMCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), despite comparable levels of CD11c in both SJL and B6 DCs (unpublished data). Even on the peak day, day 6, the level of viral infection in SJL DCs was significantly greater (&gt;3-fold) than that of B6 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). It was clear in these experiments that the cells producing viral proteins were CD11c<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), suggesting that DCs produce the majority of infectious virus. In fact, assessment of viral production from isolated CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>−</sup> cells following viral infection confirmed that the great majority of BMCs producing virus proteins (&gt;95%) are CD11c<sup>+</sup> and the rest (&lt;5%) are CD11c<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg001">S1</xref>B). Furthermore, the level of infectious virus produced by CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells is over 40-fold higher than that produced by CD11c<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg001">S1</xref>C).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, the TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells in either SJL or B6 cultures were MHC class II<sup>low</sup>, CD86<sup>low</sup>, and CCR7<sup>low</sup>, molecules whose expression is enhanced only during DC maturation. Interestingly, when compared to mock-infected cells, lower levels of expression of MHC class II, CD86, or CCR7 were also observed in infected SJL cultures, even in cells that were not TMEV<sup>+</sup>. For example, 64% of mock-infected cells expressed MHC class II while only 22% of the TMEV<sup>−</sup> cells in the SJL cultures expressed the molecule. This suggests that the maturation of uninfected DCs is altered in the SJL cultures, possibly indirectly via soluble factors produced by virus-infected cells. This potential bystander effect will be discussed further in the next section. In contrast, infected B6 DC cultures did not show dramatic reductions in their maturation-associated markers. These data strongly suggest that TMEV preferentially replicates in immature DCs and that, in the case of SJL DCs, arrests their maturation.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that resistance to persistent TMEV infection in the B6 strain is attributed to the expression of the H-2D<sup>b</sup> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b020">20</xref>], DCs from B10 (H-2<sup>b</sup>) and B10.S (H-2<sup>s</sup>) mice, which are relatively resistant to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease compared to susceptible SJL (H-2<sup>s</sup>) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b021">21</xref>], were also examined. Interestingly, our results show that BM DCs from resistant B10 (H-2<sup>b</sup>) and B10.S (H-2<sup>s</sup>) are similarly resistant to viral infection compared to susceptible SJL (H-2<sup>s</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, these results strongly suggest that differences in viral infection/replication levels in DCs do not reflect the H-2 differences, and that differential susceptibility of DCs correlates closely with susceptibility to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cytokines Produced by TMEV-Infected DCs Affect DC Activation</title><p>To investigate the potential mechanisms for bystander inhibition of DC maturation, cytokines produced in infected DC cultures were examined after 5 d of culture. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, infected cultures produced higher levels of IL-12p40, IL-6, and interferon (IFN)-α than mock-infected controls. Differences in TNF-α and IL-10 were not observed. Interestingly, infected SJL DCs produced significantly more IL-6 and IFN-α than the B6 counterparts. Infection of SJL DCs induced the expression of mRNAs of several IFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) with fairly rapid kinetics (8 h post-infection), suggesting that these are direct consequences of the infection. These included type I IFNs (IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α6, IFN-α7, IFN-α9, IFN-α11, IFN-αb, and IFN-β), and a type II IFN (IFN-γ). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figure 2</xref>B shows representative examples.

When SJL DCs were pretreated with IFN-α , IFN-β, or IFN-γ for 18 h, then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for the final 6 h of culture, DCs produced dramatically less IL-12p40, IL-6, and TNF-α.

In contrast, TMEV does not efficiently infect DCs that have been activated by LPS, a TLR4 ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). A variety of TLR ligands, including viral components, are known to induce activation, maturation, and/or cytokine production in DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b003">3</xref>]. Pretreatment of DCs with LPS greatly reduces the numbers of TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells in the culture, but treatment of DCs with LPS after infection has no effect. The addition of LPS at the time of infection had only a partial effect. The reduced infection in cells pretreated with LPS was correlated with restored DC cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). DCs induced by LPS produce the cytokines IL-12p40, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10. TMEV preinfection significantly blocked the ability of these cells to produce IL-12p40, IL-6, and TNF-α in response to LPS. In contrast, when DCs were treated first with LPS, cytokine production was not inhibited by the TMEV infection. These results suggest that LPS pretreatment results in inhibition of viral replication and restoration of cytokine production. These patterns were similar in DCs of both SJL and B6 mice, although the levels of viral infection remain higher in SJL DCs compared to B6 DCs. Interestingly, a different pattern was found again with IL-10, and infected SJL DCs produced significantly higher levels of this cytokine in response to LPS.</p><fig id="ppat-0030124-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030124.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Viral Infection in DCs Pretreated with LPS or IFNs</title><p>(A) LPS was added 6 h before infection (pre-LPS), simultaneously (sim-LPS), or 18 h after infection (post-LPS).

The IFNs produced by infected cells can reduce DC maturation, even in the uninfected cells in the culture, which explains the apparent bystander effect seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>D. In addition, the IFNs not only blocked DC maturation, but they also prevented viral infection in pretreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Furthermore, antibodies to IFNs were actually able to increase the numbers of TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells in DC cultures (unpublished data). These results are consistent with the possibility that the inhibitory effect of LPS on TMEV infection is mediated by IFNs produced by LPS-treated DCs. It is, therefore, important to note that TMEV-infected SJL DCs produce higher levels of IFNs than infected B6 cells. Even though more virus is produced in the initial infection of SJL DCs, the increased levels of IFNs produced would limit the spread of the infection to neighboring cells. This idea was confirmed by experiments in which supernatants from virus-infected cultures were used to pretreat DC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Pretreatment of fresh DC cells with cell-free culture media from SJL-infected cells dramatically reduced the numbers of TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells in the new cultures. When DC cells from IFN-α/β receptor knockout (IFN-α/βR) animals were infected with TMEV, the culture supernatants did not effectively block a subsequent infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, right panel), suggesting that the supernatants inhibit viral infection mainly in a type I IFN–dependent manner. In addition, LPS pretreatment failed to inhibit TMEV replication in IFN-α/βR-deficient DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), indicating the involvement of type I IFNs in the resistance of normal DCs acquired by pretreatment with LPS. However, IFN-α/βR-deficient DCs remained partially resistant to viral infection following pretreatment with infected culture supernatants, strongly suggesting that there is a cytokine(s) blocking in a type I IFN–independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>TMEV Infection Preferentially Inhibits SJL DC Expansion In Vitro</title><p>Since an adequate number of DCs is necessary to elicit strong innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses, a substantial reduction of DCs resulting from viral infection may allow viruses to evade immune recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b022">22</xref>]. To test the possibility that TMEV infection inhibits DC expansion from hematopoietic progenitors, BMCs that were cultured for 3 d in the presence of granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were infected with TMEV, and the rate of DC expansion was subsequently assessed.

To evaluate this possibility, we examined the levels of BMC apoptosis at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. The proportions of Annexin V–positive cells undergoing apoptosis were significantly higher in TMEV-infected SJL BMCs compared to those in B6 BMCs during the culture periods (shown at 24 h post-infection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">Figure 4</xref>C; unpublished data). Thus, SJL DCs are substantially more susceptible not only to viral infection but also to virus-induced apoptosis, and this certainly contributes to the failure of DC expansion from hematopoietic progenitors. The preferential apoptosis of SJL DCs may also contribute to the drastic inhibition of SJL DC expansion. However, not all infected DCs are undergoing apoptosis. As shown in the bottom experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, when cells infected for 24 h were isolated into apoptotic (Annexin V–positive) and non-apoptotic fractions, a significant number of Annexin V–negative, TMEV<sup>+</sup> cells were found to be present (22% in SJL versus 5% in B6). It is conceivable that these cells may also be deficient in their expansion. This possibility was confirmed by measuring the loss of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester stain 3 d after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). DCs from SJL mice showed poor proliferation (30% in infected cultures versus 90% in control cultures). In contrast, DCs from B6 mice (73%) showed significant loss of staining intensity, consistent with ongoing cell divisions.</p><p>The arrest of DC precursors following infection in SJL cultures is likely to reflect the increased production of IFNs, which is known to block DC expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b023">23</xref>]. Indeed, when IFN-blocking antibody was included in CFSE experiments, the proliferation of infected SJL DCs was enhanced (unpublished data). It was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>D that culture supernatants from TMEV-infected DCs produced cytokines that blocked further infection, but only when cells from IFNα/βR-sufficient mice were used.

The inhibition was dose dependent and the activity of supernatants from infected SJL cells was significantly higher than that of supernatants from infected B6 cells. Type I and II IFNs also similarly reduced cellular expansions. Experiments with IFN-α/βR-deficient DCs indicated that type I IFNs and other inhibitory cytokines, most likely IFN-γ, were responsible for the arresting activity of SJL supernatants (unpublished data). Taken together, these results indicate that BMCs from susceptible SJL mice, but not from resistant B6 mice, are highly permissive to viral infection, leading to virus-induced apoptosis and the production of high levels of regulatory cytokines, including type I IFNs, IFN-γ, and perhaps IL-6, resulting in growth arrest of BMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Lower DC Numbers Are Present in TMEV-Infected Susceptible SJL Mice</title><p>To examine the effects of TMEV infection on SJL and B6 DCs in vivo, phenotypic and functional alterations in DCs from BM, spleen, and CNS of infected mice were analyzed.

Thus, we examined the properties of DCs in the CNS, the virus target organ following TMEV infection. The number of infiltrating CD45<sup>hi</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs in the CNS of infected B6 mice was significantly higher (&gt;2-fold) than that of SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

In contrast, splenic CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC levels were lower in SJL mice compared to B6 mice, suggesting a differential distribution of this DC population between resistant and susceptible mice, which may have a role in local immunity to viral infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). Since TNF-α and/or IL-12 are important cytokines in the migration, accumulation, and activation of DCs involved in the elicitation of anti-viral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b003">3</xref>], these cytokines were examined at 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Very low levels of these cytokines were observed in unstimulated DCs from the CNS of TMEV-infected mice.

Consequently, susceptible mice exhibit severely reduced levels of functionally mature DCs for T cell activation, resulting in poor anti-viral T cell responses, and perhaps, preferential non-protective or pathogenic T cell responses. Adoptive transfer of LPS-pre-activated syngeneic DCs, which are resistant to viral infection, renders susceptible mice resistant to viral-induced demyelinating disease by elevating protective T cell responses.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030124.g008" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>It has recently been shown that generation of the anti-TMEV CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in the CNS requires a BM-derived APC population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b029">29</xref>]. Similarly, induction of the T cell response is impaired by DCs infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, a member of the Picornaviridae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b030">30</xref>]. In addition, the altered expression of accessory molecules on DCs upon interaction with human rhinovirus leads to down-modulation of adaptive immune responses during viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b031">31</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that DCs from SJL mice, but not B6 mice, are extremely permissive to TMEV infection/replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030124-sg002">S2</xref>). The differential susceptibility of DCs to TMEV infection between B6 and SJL mice may not be restricted to this cell type; similar differential susceptibilities to viral infection were also observed in macrophages (unpublished data). Since these cell types are the major TMEV reservoir in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b032">32</xref>], the differential susceptibility of these cells may also contribute to viral persistence in these mice. Nevertheless, resistance of DCs from viral infection appears to be particularly important in facilitating strong anti-viral immunity, leading to viral clearance and protection from developing demyelinating disease.</p><p>Furthermore, as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g008">Figure 8</xref>, our results highlight a series of DC alterations that together may lead to the reduced immune response and viral persistence in susceptible SJL mice, whereas such alterations are not apparent in resistant B6 mice. First, TMEV preferentially infects immature DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figure 1</xref>), blocking their differentiation and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A subset of the infected DCs undergoes apoptosis, but many arrest and fail to expand and mature. These infected DCs may also contribute to disease pathogenesis by altering the profile of cytokines produced and consequently by stimulating T cell subsets that deviate from those stimulated by intact DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g006">6</xref>). In addition, the infected DCs from SJL mice produce cytokines that lead to bystander effects, inhibiting DC expansion and maturation in response to other stimuli such as LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g005">5</xref>).</p><p>TMEV-infected SJL DCs produce significantly higher levels of a variety of type I IFNs and type II IFN-γ compared to B6 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The presence of type I or II IFNs provides protection against TMEV replication, but only when cells are exposed to IFNs prior to viral infection, indicating a transient nature of protection by IFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The resistance of TMEV to type I IFNs once infection is established is similar to previous observations in simian virus 40, respiratory syncytial virus, dengue virus type 2, and bovine viral diarrhea virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b037">37</xref>]. Thus, IFNs may not only limit the extent of TMEV infection but also provide the opportunity for these viruses to establish persistent infection. In addition, these cytokines also inhibit the production of IL-12p40, IL-6, and TNF-α by DCs in response to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results are consistent with the previous report that type I IFNs can negatively regulate IL-12 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b038">38</xref>]. It is interesting to note that IFN-γ can also negatively regulate the production of these inflammatory cytokines as well as DC expansion from BM precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">4</xref>). The potent inhibition of DC expansion and function by IFN-γ was unexpected, as this cytokine is essential for strong anti-viral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b008">8</xref>]. As far as we know, this novel inhibitory mechanism of IFN-γ on DC function and differentiation has not been previously described.</p><p>Notably, the signal pathways involved in the negative regulation by type I and II IFNs may be different since IFN-γ, but not IFN-α/β, displays enhanced IL-10 induction in DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). It has been previously reported that IFN-γ can play a negative regulatory role on DC migration and Ag-specific T cell priming in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b039">39</xref>]. Since IFN-γ is the major cytokine produced by NK/NKT cells during early innate responses and by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during adaptive immune responses following viral infection, IFN-γ may play an important regulatory role by switching DCs on and off for further T cell activation. However, many studies have also indicated that type I and II IFNs play an important role in enhancing DC function in adaptive T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b038">38</xref>]. Therefore, it appears paradoxical that type I and II IFNs can confer DCs with viral resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>), yet these cytokines can also inhibit DC differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">4</xref>), which are critical for strong adaptive T cell responses. Our results here strongly suggest that the level of stimulation, duration of stimulation, and timing of exposure to these cytokines following viral infection affect the fate of DC expansion and function.</p><p>TMEV infection preferentially abrogates not only maturation and cytokine production by DCs infected with the virus (producing viral proteins), but also bystander DCs (not producing viral proteins) from susceptible SJL mice in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">3</xref>). This bystander inhibition is most likely mediated by type I and II IFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g004">4</xref>). Similar deficiencies in DC function are likewise observed in both CNS-associated and splenic DCs from virus-infected susceptible SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the T cell stimulatory function of either virus-infected BM DCs or splenic DCs from virus-infected mice is severely compromised, particularly in susceptible SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Two recent studies using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and measles virus have demonstrated that these viral infections prohibit the expansion of DCs in the spleens of mice treated with Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b040">40</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that inhibition of DC expansion or function may be a common tactic used by various viruses to evade anti-viral T cell responses for the establishment of chronic viral persistence.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that significantly higher levels of IL-10 are induced by LPS stimulation in virus-infected SJL DCs than in B6 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>). IL-10 production is not inhibited after TMEV infection, unlike that of other cytokines, such as IL-12 or TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g003">Figure 3</xref>). High levels of IL-10 may favor Th2 development by TMEV-infected SJL DCs, in contrast to the Th1 development promoted by uninfected DCs or virus-infected B6 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, levels of IFN-γ-producing TMEV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are significantly lower, and levels of IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are significantly higher in SJL mice compared to those in B6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b012">12</xref>]. Thus, higher IL-10 levels in susceptible SJL mice may promote viral persistence and preferentially elicit regulatory T cells, which further suppress anti-viral responses. Consistent with this notion, HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived DCs do not undergo maturation, but can elicit IL-10 production and T cell regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b041">41</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-10 may also directly induce immunosuppression, facilitating viral persistence in vivo as recently shown in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b043">43</xref>]. Alternatively, it is possible that TMEV-induced type I IFNs in DCs exert a regulatory role in Th1/2 development; one study showed that exposure to IFN-β during DC-mediated stimulation of naïve Th cells inhibits Th1 cell polarization and promotes the generation of an IL-10-secreting T cell subset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030124-b044">44</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that the alteration of IL-10 production is an immune evasion mechanism frequently used by many different pathogenic viruses. Susceptibility to this alteration may also be a critical factor for chronic viral persistence leading to various inflammatory diseases.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that DCs from susceptible SJL mice are considerably more permissive to initial viral infection and replication compared to DCs from resistant B6 mice. In addition, TMEV infection preferentially inhibits maturation, activation, and T cell–stimulating function of DCs from susceptible SJL mice in a bystander fashion. The impaired function and reduced number of DCs are likely to add to the poor anti-viral T responses observed in virus-infected susceptible mice, contributing to establishment of persistent infection. It is quite striking to note that such deficiencies and/or abnormalities of DC function are not apparent after TMEV infection in resistant B6 mice. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of DCs, particularly pre-activated DCs resistant to viral infection, results in the effective clearance of viral persistence and protection from the development of demyelinating disease in susceptible SJL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030124-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, the differential responses of DCs to infectious agents may determine the outcome of diseases associated with chronic infections. Our results strongly suggest that increasing DC populations in the target organs and arming them against infections may provide a useful intervention for acute or chronic infection-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice.</title><p>Female SJL, B6, and BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.harlan.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.harlan.com/</ext-link>).
