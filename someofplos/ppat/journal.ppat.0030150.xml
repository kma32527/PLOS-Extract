During their life cycle, these protozoan parasites cycle between the bloodstream of mammals and tsetse flies. Their two main developmental stages are the bloodstream form and the procyclic form in the tsetse fly. Bloodstream trypanosomes thwart their host's immune response by periodically switching their major surface protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). When bloodstream trypanosomes are ingested by a tsetse fly, they must quickly shed the VSG and replace it with an unrelated invariant protein more suited to their survival as procyclic organisms in the fly midgut. Here, we examine the mechanisms used by trypanosomes to remove the VSG during their differentiation from bloodstream to procyclic form in culture. We deleted the genes for one of the trypanosome's protease enzymes from the trypanosome genome and found that bloodstream trypanosomes could still differentiate to the procyclic form, but VSG removal was diminished. Deleting the genes for a phospholipase enzyme had a similar effect—they could still differentiate but VSG removal was impaired. When the genes for both the protease and the phospholipase were deleted, bloodstream trypanosomes could not differentiate to the procyclic form, they retained about 60% of the VSG on their surface, and they died in the differentiation medium. These results highlight the synergistic roles of these two enzymes in the differentiation process.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 AI059451, R01 AI045540, and T32 AI007511, and Veterans Affairs grants 059 and 069.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Grandgenett PM, Otsu K, Wilson HR, Wilson ME, Donelson JE (2007) A function for a specific zinc metalloprotease of African trypanosomes.

Its life cycle consists of several developmental stages in its tsetse fly vector and mammalian host. In the midgut of the tsetse fly, the parasites proliferate as an extracellular procyclic (PRO) form, which have procyclin as their major surface protein. After further development and migration to the tsetse fly's salivary glands, the infective trypanosomes are transmitted to the mammalian host during a blood meal and differentiate into the bloodstream form (BSF) that is also maintained extracellularly in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b001">1</xref>]. In a process called antigenic variation, BSF trypanosomes evade the host immune system by sequentially expressing different variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) on their surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b002">2</xref>]. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> life cycle is completed when another tsetse fly ingests the parasites with its blood meal.</p><p>BSF trypanosomes proliferate as long, slender organisms and convert to non-proliferative, short, stumpy organisms that are pre-adapted for differentiation to the PRO form in the tsetse fly midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b004">4</xref>]. A distinguishing feature of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> life cycle is the rapid shedding of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked VSG coat during differentiation from short, stumpy BSF to PRO form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b005">5</xref>]. Several reports examining this differentiation in vitro have identified two forms of VSG present in the culture medium within hours of the initiation of differentiation; one is full-length VSG protein that is cleaved from the cell surface by a GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), and the other is a truncated VSG fragment released by a protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b006">6</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that GPI-PLC can act on surface molecules during the short, stumpy stage and that shedding of VSG during differentiation is also inhibited by peptidomimetic metalloprotease inhibitors, indicating a zinc metalloprotease is involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>The parasitic protozoa <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Leishmania</named-content> spp., which are evolutionarily related to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content>, occur as an extracellular form in their sand fly vector and an intracellular form in their mammalian hosts' macrophages. All <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Leishmania</named-content> spp. contain a major surface zinc metalloprotease (MSP, also called GP63 or leishmanolysin), which has been studied extensively and shown to (i) provide resistance to complement-mediated lysis before <italic>Leishmania</italic> entry into the macrophage, (ii) participate in attachment and entry into the macrophage, and (iii) support survival in the macrophage after entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b009">9</xref>]. We previously reported that the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> genome contains multiple genes encoding homologs of <italic>Leishmania</italic> MSP, which have about 33% overall identity to one another and to <italic>Leishmania</italic> MSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b010">10</xref>]. These <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> genes can be grouped into three gene families (<italic>TbMSP-A</italic>, <italic>TbMSP-B</italic>, and <italic>TbMSP-C</italic>) on the basis of their different 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and their differential expression during the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> life cycle. BSF cells have mRNAs from all three gene families, whereas PRO cells have detectable mRNA from only <italic>TbMSP-B</italic>. In a previous study, we and the laboratory of Jay Bangs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison used RNA interference (RNAi) to demonstrate that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> major surface protease-B (TbMSP-B) can release a recombinant VSG from a transgenic PRO cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b010">10</xref>]. It has also been shown that when inhibitors of transcription and translation are present during in vitro differentiation from BSF to PRO cells, VSG shedding is incomplete and much of it remains cell-associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b011">11</xref>]. These results suggest that TbMSP-B might be the protease involved in releasing the VSG during differentiation from short, stumpy BSF to PRO cells.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that TbMSP-B is a surface-localized zinc metalloprotease that is expressed predominantly in differentiating BSF-to-PRO cells and in established PRO cells. When all eight genes in the <italic>TbMSP-B</italic> family were deleted from the diploid BSF genome (B <sup>−/−</sup> cells), a delayed release of VSG occurred during BSF-to-PRO differentiation in vitro, but cell proliferation during differentiation was unaffected. Likewise, when the two GPI-PLC genes were deleted from the diploid BSF genome (PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells), delayed VSG release during differentiation was also observed and cell proliferation rate was unaffected. However, when all of the genes of both the <italic>TbMSP-B</italic> and <italic>GPI-PLC</italic> families were deleted in the same BSF cell line (B<sup> −/−</sup>, PLC <sup>−/−</sup>), these cells were incapable of dividing in the differentiation medium, they had an altered morphology compared to either wild-type (WT) or single gene family-deleted cells (B <sup>−/−</sup> and PLC <sup>−/−</sup>), and they exhibited a synergistic increase in VSG levels 96 h after differentiation initiation. Therefore, both TbMSP-B and GPI-PLC function in removal of VSG from the cell surface during differentiation of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. brucei</named-content> BSF cells to the PRO form.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Membrane Association and Surface Labeling of TbMSP-B</title><p><italic>Leishmania</italic> MSP is GPI-anchored on the extracellular <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigote surface, where it participates in several functions associated with <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival in its host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b009">9</xref>]. To determine the corresponding cellular location of TbMSP-B, we first examined its amino acid sequence using the computer algorithm at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/gpi/gpi_prediction.html" xlink:type="simple">http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/gpi/gpi_prediction.html</ext-link>, which predicted that nascent TbMSP-B has an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (residues 1–30) and a C-terminal cleavage site for the addition of a GPI anchor at residue 530. The C-terminal sequence is positioned in front of a stretch of seven amino acids that constitute a hydrophilic spacer region, followed by a C-terminal hydrophobic region of 15 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b012">12</xref>]. The presence of these N- and C-terminal hydrophobic sequences stimulated additional experiments to determine if TbMSP-B is membrane-associated and possibly located on the cell surface.</p><p>Triton (TX)-114 extraction experiments were used to see if TbMSP-B fractionates as an integral membrane protein, as expected from its predicted GPI anchor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows a schematic representation of the TX-114 extraction protocol used to separate the hydrophilic (aqueous phases) proteins from the integral membrane proteins (detergent phase).

To ensure complete separation, these phases were again extracted with TX-114 and additional aqueous and detergent phases were isolated (Aq1–2, D2, and Aq2).

PRO cells without the integrated plasmid and PRO cells bearing the integrated pLEW82/TbMSP-B expression plasmid were grown in the absence (− Tet) or presence (+ Tet) of tetracycline and extracted with TX-114, and the aqueous and detergent phases were analyzed for the presence of TbMSP-B and HSP-70. Endogenous TbMSP-B was found exclusively in the detergent fractions of PRO cells and the uninduced overexpression PRO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 4 and 8 respectively), indicating it is a membrane protein. When the pLEW82/TbMSP-B cell line was tetracycline-induced to overexpress the protein, TbMSP-B was found predominantly in the detergent phase. Although a small percentage was present in the intermediate Aq1 fraction, it did not appear in the fully extracted Aq1–2 fraction, indicating it is not a soluble cytosolic or peripheral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 9–12). The smaller additional bands observed in lane 12 are likely degradation products of the highly synthesized protein. To verify the expected partitioning of cytosolic and membrane proteins in the procedure, the same phases were probed with antiserum directed against heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The presence of HSP-70 in the Aq1 and Aq1–2 phases shows that cytosolic proteins were separated from membrane proteins in the experiment and that TbMSP-B is a membrane protein.</p><p>After multiple inconclusive attempts to determine the location of TbMSP-B using immunofluorescence microscopy, likely due to inability of our antisera to recognize the native protein during microscopy, we adopted the biochemical approach of utilizing biotin surface labeling to see if TbMSP-B is present on the cell surface. The general strategy for the biotin labeling/immunoprecipitation experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. PRO cells were biotin-labeled, followed by immunoprecipitation with antiserum directed against the protein of interest and separation of the immunoprecipitated protein (pellet [P]) from the unbound proteins (supernatant [S]). PRO cells bearing stably integrated pLEW82/TbMSP-B were biotin-labeled after the culture had been split and grown either in the absence or presence of 1 μg tetracycline/ml medium for 24 h. The biotin-labeled cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified TbMSP-B antiserum and separated into pellet and supernatant fractions. Western blot analysis using a streptavidin-HRP antiserum to detect biotin-labeled proteins revealed that TbMSP-B in uninduced cells, i.e., likely the native TbMSP-B protein, was biotin-labeled during the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). It also showed that the additional TbMSP-B expressed in the presence of tetracycline was likewise accessible to biotin labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, + Tet). To control for the possibility that all cellular proteins were biotin-labeled, and not only the surface proteins, PRO cells were biotin-labeled as before and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with HSP-70 antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and BiP antiserum (not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2, show the pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions from the biotin labeling/immunoprecipitation procedure in which the western blot was incubated with the streptavidin-HRP antibody. No biotin-labeled HSP-70 protein migrating at 70 kDa (and no BiP; not shown) was detected in either the P or S fractions, confirming that cytosolic proteins were not biotin labeled. The smeared band of protein below 48 kDa in lane 2 is likely the abundant biotin-labeled EP-procyclin that did not bind to the HSP-70 antiserum. The other weak band at 63 kDa could be endogenous TbMSP-B, while the distinct, weak band at 82 kDa represents an unidentified biotin-labeled protein. The presence of HSP-70 in each fraction was verified by performing a western blot of the fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 3 and 4). HSP-70 protein was identified in the pellet fraction (P) with an approximate size of 70 kDa along with a strong band of IgG molecules (55 kDa) carried through during the immunoprecipitation process. Thus, both endogenous and overexpressed TbMSP-B is accessible to surface biotinylation of live PRO cells.</p><fig id="ppat-0030150-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030150.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>TbMSP-B Can Be Surface Biotinylated</title><p>(A) Summary of the biotinylation and immunoprecipitation protocol used to detect proteins on the surface of PRO cells that are labeled with biotin.

The differential expression of TbMSP-B is consistent with its involvement in VSG loss during differentiation. It is not expressed to an appreciable extent in long, slender or short, stumpy BSF cells, but it appears a few hours after the start of differentiation and remains present in established PRO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). TbMSP-B is also localized on the cell surface in PRO cells as determined by biotin-labeling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Since we were unable to successfully use immunolocalization with the anti-TbMSP-B serum to determine the exact location of TbMSP-B, its site on the cell surface remains under investigation, but several possibilities exist. It could be located in the flagellar pocket during differentiation, as suggested by Ziegelbauer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b006">6</xref>], positioning it for access to the continually endocytosed and recycled VSG protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b023">23</xref>].

Interestingly, TbMSP-B could cleave a casein substrate in the zymogram gel, but did not yield a proteolytic band in a gelatin zymogram gel, as does <italic>Leishmania</italic> MSP.

This 37-kDa VSG fragment did not react with anti-CRD antibody and therefore likely represents the N-terminal portion of the protein.

The exact site of its VSG221 cleavage remains to be determined. One cleavage constraint is that TbMSP-B and the VSG are both GPI-anchored to the membrane, so the catalytic site of TbMSP-B may have access to only certain segments of the VSG in vivo.

The VSG levels in extracts after 96 h of differentiation were not additive in this doubly deleted cell line; instead, TbMSP-B and GPI-PLC appear to act synergistically. At 96 h post-differentiation, the B <sup>−/−</sup> and PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells have 5% and 16% of the VSG remaining, whereas the B <sup>−/−</sup> PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells have 60% remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Currently there is no reason to expect that these two proteins interact in a cooperative manner during differentiation, but both can act to remove the VSG in a step essential for completion of the life cycle. When additional localization studies on TbMSP-B and GPI-PLC can be conducted, the proximity of these two proteins can be addressed.</p><p>Virtually no change occurs in the amount of VSG in extracts of B <sup>−/−</sup> PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells between 48 and 96 h of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g007">Figure 7</xref>); it remains at about 60%.

We have not examined these B <sup>−/−</sup> PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells further to see whether, in addition to the acquisition of EP-procyclin, they have undergone the metabolic changes associated with differentiation to PRO cells. However, it is likely these cells cannot cope with the massive amount of EP-procyclin being made at a time when they are unable to eliminate 60% of their VSG to make room for the EP-procyclin on the surface. The result is that the cells shut down cell division, yet remain viable in the PRO medium for several days. Eventually, the cells die (not shown).</p><p>Another point is that even in the absence of TbMSP-B and GPI-PLC, about 40% of the VSG is lost by 48 h of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Some of this VSG loss is likely due to degradation and/or internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b023">23</xref>], but some may also be due to other unknown cellular components that might contribute to VSG loss. Consistent with this possibility is the fact that the medium of B <sup>−/−</sup> PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells contains full-length, or nearly full-length, VSG molecules of about 48 kDa that do not have the CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and thus are not the result of cleavages by TbMSP-B and GPI-PLC. We investigated whether cysteine proteases might contribute to this 40% loss, as was suggested by another report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b022">22</xref>]. We confirmed that indeed inhibitors of cysteine proteases prevent loss of some VSG from differentiating WT cells either directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g011">Figure 11</xref>A), but they did not interfere with that 40% loss of VSG from differentiating B <sup>−/−</sup> PLC <sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030150-g011">Figure 11</xref>B).

Thus, we conclude that TbMSP-B and GPI-PLC are clearly involved in the cellular strategy for removing VSG quickly during BSF-to-PRO differentiation, but the trypanosome may have additional specific mechanisms designed to achieve full VSG release in a timely manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b007">7</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Trypanosome strains and culture conditions.</title><p>The <italic>T. brucei</italic> BSF “single marker” (SM) trypanosome cell line (T7RNAPol TetR NEO) and the PRO 29–13 cell line (T7RNAPol NEO TetR HYG) were gifts from G.

In addition to the antiserum directed against recombinant TbMSP-B, other antisera used in the western blots were directed against HSP-70 and BiP (both kind gifts from Jay Bangs, University of Wisconsin-Madison), VSG221 (the kind gift of George Cross), EP-procyclin and GPEET-procyclin (both kind gifts from Terry Pearson, University of Victoria), the CRD of the GPI anchor (the kind gift of Paul Englund, Johns Hopkins University), and α-tubulin (AB-1, Oncogene). Secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were used to detect proteins via chemiluminescence. Media supernatants were collected from cell cultures as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b007">7</xref>]. Briefly, cell cultures were centrifuged for 2 min to pellet cells and the supernatant was added in a 10:1 ratio to a solution containing 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. A 100x protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) was added to 1x final concentration and samples frozen at −20 °C until used. Samples were then analyzed by western blot as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Preparation and affinity purification of anti-TbMSP-B antiserum.</title><p>The TbMSP-B coding sequence from nucleotides 157 through 1125 was PCR-amplified from plasmid pLEW82/TbMSP-B using primers designed with a BamHI site in the 5′ primer and an XhoI site in the 3′ primer. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1-Topo (Invitrogen) and excised using BamHI and XhoI. The purified TbMSP-B coding sequence was then subcloned into purified BamHI/XhoI-digested pET32A plasmid (Novagen). The pET32A/TbMSP-B plasmid was transformed into <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> DE3 cells (Novagen) and induced to overexpress the pET32A/TbMSP-B chimeric protein with 1 mM IPTG as per the Novagen pET System Manual. The pET32A/TbMSP-B fusion protein was insoluble in DE3 cells and localized to inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were isolated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b033">33</xref>] and injected into a New Zealand White rabbit at 2 mg/injection, supplemented with Freud's Complete Adjuvant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b034">34</xref>]. Two additional booster injections were made at 4 wk and 6 wk before complete collection of antisera.</p><p>Affinity purification of the anti-TbMSP-B antiserum was performed using HIS-purified pET32A/TbMSP-B fusion protein. The fusion protein was isolated using a Novagen HIS-Bind Kit. The HIS-purified protein was electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. A strip of membrane corresponding to the size of pET32A/TbMSP-B fusion protein was cut from the membrane and used in the affinity purification. The PVDF strip with the bound fusion protein was incubated with the rabbit anti-TbMSP-B serum and washed first in 500 mM NaCl/50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), followed by washes in 100 ml NaCl/50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Antibody bound to the membrane was removed with 50 mM glycine (pH 2.5) at 4 °C and brought back to pH 7.4 with 2 M Tris-HCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b035">35</xref>].

Whole cells were lysed in a non-reducing, denaturing sample buffer and passaged through a 27-gauge needle three times prior to running on a Bio-Rad 12% casein zymogram gel at 4 °C. The zymogram gel was subsequently washed twice in 2% TX-100, rinsed briefly in double-deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, and washed once in Bio-Rad Zymogram development buffer, followed by incubation in development buffer at 37 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030150-b036">36</xref>].
