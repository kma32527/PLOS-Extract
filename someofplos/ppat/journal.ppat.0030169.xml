To investigate whether receptor biology could influence immune responses to gp120, we studied its interaction with human, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) in vitro. Gp120 from the HIV-1 strain JR-FL induced IL-10 expression in MDDCs from 62% of donors, via a mannose C-type lectin receptor(s) (MCLR). Gp120 from the strain LAI was also an IL-10 inducer, but gp120 from the strain KNH1144 was not. The mannose-binding protein cyanovirin-N, the 2G12 mAb to a mannose-dependent gp120 epitope, and MCLR-specific mAbs inhibited IL-10 expression, as did enzymatic removal of gp120 mannose moieties, whereas inhibitors of signaling via CD4, CCR5, or CXCR4 were ineffective. Gp120-stimulated IL-10 production correlated with DC-SIGN expression on the cells, and involved the ERK signaling pathway. Gp120-treated MDDCs also responded poorly to maturation stimuli by up-regulating activation markers inefficiently and stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation only weakly. These adverse reactions to gp120 were MCLR-dependent but independent of IL-10 production. Since such mechanisms might suppress immune responses to Env-containing vaccines, demannosylation may be a way to improve the immunogenicity of gp120 or gp140 proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate immune responses to pathogens or vaccine antigens. The HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein is an antigen that is a focus of vaccine design strategies. We have studied how gp120 proteins interact with DCs in cell culture. Certain gp120s stimulate DCs from some, but not all, human donors to produce IL-10, a cytokine that is generally immunosuppressive. In addition, whether or not the DCs produce IL-10, their ability to mature properly when activated is impaired by gp120—the gp120-treated DCs have a reduced ability to stimulate T cell growth when the two cell types are cultured together. These various effects of gp120 are caused by its binding to cell surface receptors of the mannose C-type lectin receptor family, including (but probably not exclusively) one called DC-SIGN. Gp120 binds to these receptors via mannose residues that are present on some of the glycan structures that overlay much of its protein surface. Removing the mannoses by digesting gp120 with a suitable enzyme prevents IL-10 induction and impairment of DC maturation, as does the use of inhibitors of the binding of gp120 to DC-SIGN and similar receptors. This work could help with the design of better HIV-1 vaccines.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> RWS is a recipient of an Anton Meelmeijer fellowship and a VENI fellowship from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Chemical Sciences.

Usually, the Env glycoproteins are presented as adjuvanted, soluble proteins after production in vitro as recombinant proteins, but they can also be expressed in vivo from delivery systems based on DNA or live recombinant viruses (e.g., poxvirus or adenovirus vectors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b004">4</xref>]. Different configurations of Env glycoproteins have been studied as vaccine antigens, initially the surface glycoprotein gp120; more recently, soluble oligomeric gp140 proteins based broadly on the native gp120-gp41 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>Irrespective of how HIV-1 Env glycoproteins have been presented and in whatever configuration, the induction of broadly active NAbs has proven problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b001">1</xref>]. One generally accepted problem is the evolution of the native Env complex into a configuration that limits the exposure of the few neutralization sites that are present. The potential solution is to further understand the structure of the complex, then to engineer antigens that are better able to present relevant NAb epitopes to the immune system; attempts to do this are in progress in many laboratories worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b001">1</xref>]. Here, however, we focus on what we consider to be another factor hindering NAb induction: the limited immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env proteins in general.</p><p>Although antibody responses to HIV-1 Env can clearly be induced in infected or vaccinated humans and animals, these proteins are not particularly immunogenic. Thus, gp120 or gp140 proteins are typically administered at 100–500 μg per dose, and the binding antibody titers raised against them can be highly variable; some humans and animals respond fairly well, others only poorly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b009">9</xref>]. Anti-Env antibody titers also decay rather rapidly (half-lives are typically in the range 30–50 d) and frequent boosting is required to maintain them. Few directly comparative studies have ever been performed, but the limited information available supports the contention that Env is an unusually problematic immunogen compared to most other vaccine antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b010">10</xref>] (S. Plotkin and B. Graham, personal communication).</p><p>The immune responses to HIV-1 Env vaccine antigens are T<sub>H</sub>2-polarized to an extent that is unusual even for a soluble protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b012">12</xref>]. The same T<sub>H</sub>2 bias can also be observed during HIV-1 infection, although this is a much more complex and controversial situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b015">15</xref>]. The nature of the immune response to gp120 may be attributable to the fundamental properties of this unusual protein. One feature that distinguishes gp120 from many other vaccine immunogens is its biological activity; gp120 can bind to several cell surface receptors: CD4, CCR5, CXCR4, and several mannose C-type lectin receptors (MCLR) including but not limited to DC-SIGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b002">2</xref>]. In vitro, one consequence of gp120 binding to such receptors is the transduction of intracellular signals that can have many different, but generally adverse, effects on the various target cells. Although the gp120 concentrations used to elicit such signals (μg/ml range) are usually grossly in excess of what could be present in serum during HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b016">16</xref>], they are compatible with what is used for immunization (several hundred μg of protein delivered in a few ml into a localized tissue site) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b009">9</xref>]. We therefore considered it possible that gp120 immunization could trigger signals affecting how an immune response develops. For example, one cellular response to gp120 in vitro is the induction of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b024">24</xref>]. Here, we have studied what happens when gp120 interacts with human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) in vitro. We show that a consequence of JR-FL gp120 binding to these cells from ∼50% of donors is the induction of IL-10. Moreover, gp120-treated MDDCs impair the proliferation of co-cultured CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and reduce their expression of IL-12. These responses are also a consequence of the mannose-dependent interaction of gp120 with an MCLR, although they are not obligatorily linked to IL-10 expression. The various outcomes of gp120-MCLR interactions are prevented by enzymatic removal of gp120 mannoses, a method that may improve the immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env proteins and some other vaccine-relevant immunogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>HIV-1 gp120 Induces MDDCs to Produce IL-10</title><p>We investigated how gp120 affected MDDC maturation and cytokine secretion, and MDDC-T cell interactions in view of the key role dendritic cells (DCs) play in antigen capture, processing, and presentation.

We were particularly interested to ascertain whether gp120 induced IL-10 expression in MDDCs, in view of the immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 and its role in T<sub>H</sub>2-polarization of responses to gp120 in immunized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b011">11</xref>], and the induction of IL-10 by gp120 in human monocyte/macrophages in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b024">24</xref>]. We therefore used MDDCs that were immature at the start of the experiment (iMDDCs), to enable us to monitor the subsequent maturation process. However, in some studies, we investigated the effects of gp120 on MDDC that were simultaneously induced to mature by other stimuli, notably lipopolysaccharide (LPS).</p><p>iMDDCs from a day-6 culture were washed thoroughly to prevent further stimulation with IL-4 and GM-CSF, then incubated for two further days with or without CHO-cell expressed, JR-FL (R5) gp120 (the 3 μg/ml; 25 nM concentration was based on titrations in pilot studies; see below). In the absence of any stimulus, the cells produced little IL-10 (mean 11 ± 2.5 pg/ml at 24 h, <italic>n</italic> = 71 and 28 ± 3.8 pg/ml at 48 h, <italic>n</italic> = 52) and no detectable IL-12p70 over a 48-h period starting on day 6. The addition of JR-FL gp120 triggered significant IL-10 secretion from MDDCs from a subset of the 71 blood donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus, 24 h later, IL-10 production was increased by &gt;5-fold in MDDCs from 62% (44/71) donors, with the median increase being 8.5-fold (median control value: 7.5 pg/ml; median + gp120, 64 pg/ml). Similar responses were observed at 48 h (median control value: 17 pg/ml; + gp120, 98 pg/ml). The IL-10 increases triggered by gp120 were significant at both 24 h and 48 h (Mann-Whitney U test, one tail, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). However, MDDCs from 38% of the donors did not respond to gp120 (IL-10 increases of &lt;5-fold).</p><fig id="ppat-0030169-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030169.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>HIV-1 gp120 Induces IL-10 Secretion from MDDCs in a Donor- and Concentration-Dependent Manner</title><p>(A) MDDCs from different human donors were cultured in GM-CSF + IL-4 for 6 d and then incubated for 24 h (<italic>n</italic> = 71 donors) with or without JR-FL gp120 (3 μg/ml) before measurement of IL-10 production by ELISA.

The IL-10 responses to TNIL + LPS and to gp120 did not correlate (at 24 h, <italic>n</italic> = 71, <italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.0007 and at 48 h, <italic>n</italic> = 12, <italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.006, respectively). The time courses of the IL-10 responses to JR-FL gp120, at both the mRNA and protein levels, and to TNIL + LPS at the mRNA level, are shown as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030169-sg002">Figure S2</xref>.</p><p>The donor-dependent variation in the IL-10 response to gp120 could be explained by genetic or epigenetic factors. As a first step to determining which applied, we performed experiments on MDDCs from 11 repeat donors, at two time points, 1–3 months apart. An IL-10 response to gp120 was observed in MDDCs from four of the 11 donors at both time points, whereas there was no response at either time point from cells of the other seven donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The consistency of the response pattern is more suggestive of a genetic or a constant epigenetic determinant than of a variable epigenetic factor such as, for example, an inter-current infection.</p><p>IL-10 secretion by MDDCs from responsive donors was dependent on the concentration and the identity of the gp120 protein used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The optimal response to JR-FL gp120 occurred at 3 μg/ml, whereas the dose-response curve for LAI gp120 was slightly different, IL-10 secretion being greatest at 10 μg/ml, the highest concentration tested. However, when MDDCs from the same donors were exposed to gp120 from the subtype A virus KNH1144, there was no IL-10 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Furthermore, when MDDCs from five donors were tested comparatively, the same three that responded to JR-FL gp120 also did so to LAI gp120, and to similar extents, whereas MDDCs from all five donors responded to TNIL + LPS by producing high levels of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Hence both viral and host genetics may influence whether MDDCs produce IL-10 after exposure to gp120. We determined the viability of iMDDCs and mature MDDCs (mMDDCs) exposed for 48 h to the three different gp120s by staining with 7 amino-actinomycin D. Spontaneous cell death in cultures from different donors varied from 2%–3% in iMDDCs and 3%–12% in mMDDCs.

We also tested several additional gp120 proteins of different genotypes and expressed in different cell types (including insect cells) that we obtained from commercial sources and academic collaborators. In general, the degree of LPS contamination in these preparations was too high for the results to be interpretable, since LPS is itself a highly efficient inducer of IL-10 from MDDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>HIV-1 gp120 Stimulates IL-10 Production by MDDCs through a Mannose-Dependent Interaction</title><p>To determine which gp120 receptors on iMDDCs were responsible for activating IL-10 expression, we incubated either gp120 or the cells with ligands that should block known gp120-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g002">Figures 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030169-sg003">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030169-sg004">S4</xref>).

The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was inactive against IL-10 induction by gp120 from the X4 virus, LAI, so CXCR4 is also uninvolved (unpublished data).

However, combining gp120 with mannans did not further elevate IL-10 levels, suggesting that both of these mannose-containing ligands bind to, and saturate, the same MCLR(s). To explore which MCLR(s) might be involved, we used mAbs specific to DC-SIGN and the mannose receptor (MR). The anti-DC-SIGN mAb AZN-D1 completely blocks the binding of mannosylated gp120 to DC-SIGN in an ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

When the anti-DC-SIGN and anti-MR mAbs AZN-D1 and Clone 15–2 were each pre-incubated with iMDDCs, AZN-D1 partially (∼50%) reduced gp120-mediated IL-10 induction whereas Clone 15–2 was not inhibitory; adding the two mAbs together completely abolished the IL-10 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

Reducing SDS-PAGE gel analysis showed the demannosylated JR-FL gp120 (D-gp120) was slightly smaller than mock-treated gp120 (M-gp120; processed without the enzyme) and had lost its 2G12 epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; compare lanes marked + and −).

An interaction between the mannose moieties on gp120 and an MCLR(s) can therefore trigger IL-10 production from MDDCs from a significant proportion of human donors. The lack of effect of HA, which does not bind to DC-SIGN, compared to gp120 is consistent with the outcome of comparative immunization studies with these two viral receptor-binding glycoproteins in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b011">11</xref>].</p><p>The blocking effect of the anti-DC-SIGN and anti-MR mAb combination implicated these MCLRs as likely mediators of the IL-10 response to gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Because this response is donor-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), we measured DC-SIGN and MR expression on day-6 iMDDCs (the time of addition of gp120) from nine donors, as well as the expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86. DC-SIGN levels varied by 18-fold among these nine donors, MR by 3.3-fold (in studies of other sets of donors, we have found that the expression levels of both these receptors can vary by about an order of magnitude; unpublished data).

Since KNH1144 gp120 does not induce IL-10 secretion from MDDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), this experiment corroborates the finding that the anti-proliferative effect is independent of IL-10 from MDDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). It also confirms that KNH1144 gp120 is biologically active in the MDDC system despite its inability to induce IL-10 expression.</p><p>We measured the concentrations of both IL-10 and IL-12p70 in the various MDDC-T-cell co-cultures on day 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). IL-10 concentrations varied by &lt;5-fold overall, the co-cultures with MDDCs exposed to M-gp120 + TNIL + LPS containing the highest level (280 ± 45 pg/ml). The IL-10 response to M-gp120 + TNIL + LPS was significantly higher than to D-gp120 + TNIL + LPS (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, <italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). IL-12p70 concentrations varied much more substantially. They were very low (&lt;10 pg/ml) in co-cultures containing MDDCs treated with M-gp120, D-gp120, or HA in the absence of TNIL + LPS. When TNIL + LPS was used to mature the MDDCs, IL-12p70 concentrations reached 200 ± 22 pg/ml. The inclusion of D-gp120 or HA caused a modest (∼2-fold) reduction, but when M-gp120 was used only baseline levels of IL-12p70 were produced (7.2 ± 1.7 pg/ml). The IL-12p70 response to M-gp120 + TNIL + LPS was significantly lower than to D-gp120 + TNIL + LPS (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, <italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0040). Thus, compared to the use of TNIL + LPS alone, exposure of the MDDCs also to M-gp120 caused a 76-fold increase in the IL-10/IL-12p70 ratio in the co-cultures, whereas the use of D-gp120 and HA caused only 2.4- and 1.3-fold increases, respectively. Moreover, the pattern of IL-12p70 responses in the various co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, lower panel) was similar to the pattern of T cell proliferation in the same cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030169-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). IL-4 was also measured, the concentrations ranging from 5–15 pg/ml in the different co-cultures, with no obvious pattern of response detectable (unpublished data).</p><p>In conclusion, MDDCs matured in the presence of gp120 are functionally impaired, irrespective of whether they secrete IL-10 soon after gp120 binds to MCLRs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We show here that exposure to HIV-1 gp120s can impair the maturation of human iMDDCs, triggering cells from some donors to secrete IL-10, a cytokine generally associated with immunosuppressive responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b023">23</xref>]. Irrespective of whether they secrete IL-10, the gp120-treated MDDCs mature inefficiently in response to conventional stimuli, and their abilities to stimulate the proliferation of T cells in co-cultures are impaired. The latter defect could be due to their reduced expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86 and hence a weakening of the co-stimulatory interactions with T cells that drive the latter's proliferation. The reduction in IL-12p70 levels (and a substantial increase in the IL-10/IL-12p70 ratio) in the co-cultures may also be relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b033">33</xref>].</p><p>These various effects are a consequence of an interaction between the mannose components of gp120 glycans and an MCLR(s), in that the enzymatic removal of mannoses from gp120 reduced or prevented their occurrence. We also probed the IL-10 response to gp120 using various blocking ligands. Thus, CV-N and the 2G12 mAb bind to gp120 mannoses, and each inhibited IL-10 induction, whereas inhibitors of gp120 binding to CD4, CCR5, or CXCR4 were ineffective. Furthermore, mannan, another MCLR ligand, activated IL-10 expression. Also relevant is that gp120 induces IL-10 expression in immunized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b011">11</xref>]: Gp120 cannot bind to murine CD4, CCR5, or CXCR4, or to the murine MCLR with the greatest sequence similarity to human DC-SIGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b034">34</xref>]. However, five murine DC-SIGN homologues have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b035">35</xref>], so it is possible that some of them do bind gp120. The influenza HA Env protein does not induce IL-10 expression either in the immunized mice or in our own in vitro experiments; HA binds the MR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b036">36</xref>] but not DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b037">37</xref>].</p><p>Several different MCLRs are known or potential binding sites for gp120 on DC, including DC-SIGN, langerin, and the MR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b038">38</xref>]. We found that mAbs to DC-SIGN and the MR together completely ablated the IL-10 response to gp120, while the anti-DC-SIGN mAb was partially inhibitory by itself. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the extent of IL-10 production and the level of DC-SIGN expression on the MDDCs. Together, these observations strongly suggest a role for DC-SIGN binding in the IL-10 response to gp120 but other MCLRs, particularly the MR, also seem likely to be involved.</p><p>M-gp120, but not its demannosylated derivative, activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 inhibited the IL-10 response to M-gp120. These findings imply that the gp120-MCLR interaction triggers the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and that this is necessary for activation of IL-10 expression. Whether the same pathway mediates the other MDDC responses to gp120 remains to be determined.</p><p>This conclusion is consistent with earlier reports on the role of the ERK1/2/MAP kinase pathways in the IL-10 response when DCs are activated by other stimuli, including TLR ligands and DC-SIGN-specific antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b032">32</xref>]. The binding of pathogens, including HIV-1, to DC-SIGN has also been shown to activate the Raf-1-acetylation-dependent signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b039">39</xref>]. The gp120-treated MDDC from about half the 71 donors we studied secreted elevated amounts of IL-10, and the response pattern was consistent when 11 donors were re-tested a month later. Hence, genetic or other invariable factors and not, for example, an inter-current infection seem most likely to determine whether a donor's MDDCs respond to gp120 in this way, or not. Complex host genetic factors influence IL-10 gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b042">42</xref>], suggesting one area for further study. The genetics of MCLR expression might also be relevant; different MCLRs might be involved to different extents on MDDCs from different donors. DC-SIGN expression varies considerably in rectal tissue samples from different individuals and has been associated with local increases in the IL-10/IL-12 ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b033">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, the IL-10 response to gp120 is only one marker for the adverse effect of this ligand on MDDCs; whether or not a donor's cells secreted IL-10 in response to gp120, they were functionally impaired, matured poorly, and were unable to efficiently stimulate T cell proliferation.</p><p>We also observed that both the concentration and the identity of the gp120 protein influenced the IL-10 response. Two of the three tested gp120s (JR-FL and LAI) triggered IL-10 release from MDDCs of responsive donors, whereas gp120 from KNH1144 did not. We do not yet know why KNH1144 differs from the other two gp120s in this regard. The most likely explanation is that there are subtle differences between the gp120s in exactly how they interact with one or more MCLR, and that the IL-10 response is particularly sensitive to a specific, but as yet uncharacterized, facet of these interactions. Differences in how diverse HIV-1 virions and gp120 proteins interact with DC-SIGN have been reported, although the variations in gp120 structure that affect the interaction have still to be fully defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b043">43</xref>] (M. Jansson, personal communication). A sequence alignment of the JR-FL, LAI, and KNH1144 gp120 proteins, with emphasis on the positions of N-linked glycans, suggests a number of potentially relevant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030169-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Since understanding the molecular basis for the lack of IL-10 induction might help in the design of new Env-based immunogens, mutagenesis studies that focus on the N-linked glycans of JR-FL and KNH1144 could be informative, as might the use of additional gp120s that vary in sequence and that are expressed in cell types that lead to differences in glycosylation patterns. It is important, however, that any such reagents be highly purified free of the LPS contaminants that are common in most commercial gp120 preparations and in some others made under non-GMP conditions. The same constraints apply to the use of inactivated HIV-1 virions. We have not yet tested virions, as the focus of the present study is on soluble Env proteins that are (or were) vaccine candidates. Moreover, virions contain several TLR activators that might induce different cytokine responses that complicate any analysis of the effects of the Env component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b046">46</xref>].</p><p>Several earlier studies have shown that gp120 and inactivated HIV-1 virions can have complex effects on MDDCs and their interactions with T cells and on cytokine secretion by both cell types in vitro. Thus, compared to LPS, R5, and X4 gp120s both stimulated much less IL-12 production from MDDCs, but without IL-10 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b019">19</xref>]. Just as we have observed, gp120-treatment impaired MDDC maturation in response to classical stimuli, reducing their ability to stimulate T cells, but unlike our results, CD80, CD83, and CD86 were up-regulated on the gp120-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b019">19</xref>]. In another study, exposure of MDDCs to X4 gp120 up-regulated CD80 and CD86 and down-regulated MR, with increased secretion of IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b047">47</xref>]. Various surface markers were also up-regulated on HIV-1-infected MDDCs, associated with an inability of the cells to secrete IL-12 in response to CD40L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b048">48</xref>]. The receptor interactions of gp120 most responsible for its various biological effects were not determined in these various studies. Gp120 is also known to stimulate IL-10 release from monocyte/macrophages in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b024">24</xref>]. There is one report that MDDCs undergoing continued stimulation with GM-CSF and IL-4 did not secrete IL-10 in response to gp120, although differences in the experimental conditions are probably responsible, and the donor- and gp120-dependent variation we now describe may also be relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b049">49</xref>].</p><p>Our observations are consistent with a mounting body of evidence on the biological effects of ligating MCLRs on DCs. Thus, HIV-1 BaL and a specific DC-SIGN mAb have recently been shown to activate Rho-GTPase-dependent signals via DC-SIGN that favor the formation of DC-T-cell synapses and HIV-1 infection of the T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b050">50</xref>]. The same signaling events also induced the ATF3 transcription factor that suppressed TLR-response genes, attenuating the LPS responses of the cells by reducing IL-12p70 secretion and down-modulating CD86 and HLA-DR. Thus, as we observed with gp120, the anti-DC-SIGN mAb induced a semi-immature state in the MDDCs, which failed to stimulate T cell proliferation effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b050">50</xref>]. Indeed, the binding of an antibody to DC-SIGN was previously found to activate ERK-1/2 but not p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b032">32</xref>], similar to what we have observed with gp120. Cross-linking the MR via a specific mAb can have a broadly similar effect on the MDDC phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b051">51</xref>]. It will be worth studying whether the downstream signals activated by the MCLR MAbs are also triggered by gp120. Of further note is that an allergenic glycoprotein from peanuts also induces ERK1/2 signaling in MDDCs via DC-SIGN, but up-regulates MHC and co-stimulatory molecules and thereby increases the ability of the MDDCs to activate T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b052">52</xref>]. Thus, there may be considerable subtleties to how different glycoproteins and mAbs bind to DC-SIGN and other MCLRs on the MDDC surface, and the intracellular consequences of these interactions. Most mAbs to DC-SIGN or the MR do not induce transmembrane signals, but some do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b051">51</xref>]; likewise, some gp120s induce IL-10 expression, others do not. One relevant point may relate to how an MCLR ligand is mannosylated: adding O-linked mannoses to ovalbumin increases lympho-proliferation in mixed BMDC-T-cell cultures while N-linked mannoses have the opposite effect, and mannosylated ovalbumin impaired IL-12p70 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b053">53</xref>]. Most mannose residues on gp120 are N-linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b054">54</xref>], but the relative amounts of N- and O-linked moieties could vary between strains and influence the overall signaling patterns that are activated. Other pathogens also use mannose moieties to suppress immune responses, again via binding to MCLRs. For example, the <italic>M.Tb</italic> cell wall component ManLAM binds to DC-SIGN at a similar site to gp120′s, induces IL-10 production, impairs DC maturation, and suppresses the host immune response to this pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b056">56</xref>]. Some lactobacilli do much the same, although without the involvement of mannose residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b057">57</xref>].</p><p>Although DC-SIGN, and MCLRs in general, are important sentinels for the presence of pathogens, some organisms may be able to subvert at least some of the natural functions of these receptors for their own purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b058">58</xref>]. DC-SIGN, in particular, may be considered as an unconventional PRR (pattern recognition receptor) that drives T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>reg</sub> responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b058">58</xref>]. Silencing SOCS-1 in DC has been shown to reduce the suppressive effect of gp120 on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b059">59</xref>]. Mice immunized with gp120-pulsed, SOCS-1-silenced DC produced higher and more sustained titers of anti-gp120 antibodies, and T<sub>H</sub>1-polarized cellular responses to gp120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b059">59</xref>]. Conversely, over-expressing SOCS-3 in murine DC increased IL-10 expression, and SOCS-3-transduced DC primed a T<sub>H</sub>2-dominant response when co-cultured with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b060">60</xref>]. Perhaps these observations are linked mechanistically to ours?</p><p>Caution must always be taken when extrapolating from cell culture systems to the more complex environment of tissues in vivo where the DC phenotype differs from the MDDCs we have used here and where gp120 concentrations are hard to estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b061">61</xref>]. We note, however, that DCs and T cells isolated from HIV-1-infected persons can have aberrant phenotypes that are broadly similar to those of the gp120-exposed MDDCs that we have studied in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b062">62</xref>]. In particular, elevated numbers of tolerogenic semi-mature DCs, and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, have been observed in lymph nodes of HIV-1-infected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b063">63</xref>]. Moreover, high levels of IL-10, accompanied by a reduction in IL-12, can be found in plasma during primary HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b064">64</xref>]. IL-10 can have a substantial effect on the course of viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b065">65</xref>]. Thus, blocking IL-10 signaling by antibodies to its receptor promotes the clearance of lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus and prevents the establishment of a persistent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b067">67</xref>]. Perhaps similar events are involved in persistent infection by HIV-1? Thus it is possible that, during primary infection, <italic>env</italic>-gene products could help suppress the development of anti-HIV-1 immune responses at this critical time, particularly as virion-associated gp120 is more efficient than free gp120 at inducing various signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b068">68</xref>]. If so, the retention of high mannose moieties on the Env complex would be yet another defense HIV-1 uses in its battle with host immunity. We previously noted that the presence of mannoses on Env is paradoxical because they might facilitate virion clearance from the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b025">25</xref>]: Counter-functions would justify their retention.</p><p>Our observations could help understand the outcome of immunizing with Env-based antigens, and perhaps why different individuals respond to these vaccines with Ab titers that can vary over a several-log range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b009">9</xref>]. When milligram amounts of gp120 are delivered in a bolus into tissues, local concentrations are likely to be high enough to affect the performance of various immune system cells, including DCs, during the earliest, formative stages of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b016">16</xref>]. In a comparative DNA and protein immunization study in mice, the antibody and cytokine responses to gp120 were strongly T<sub>H</sub>2-polarized, whereas responses to HA were T<sub>H</sub>1-biased. Furthermore, the T<sub>H</sub>2 bias of the anti-gp120 response did not occur in IL-10 knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b011">11</xref>]. Although T-helper phenotypes are more complex in humans than mice, the responses to gp120, during infection and after vaccination, do appear to be T<sub>H</sub>2-biased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b015">15</xref>].

Also, immunizing horses with insect cell–expressed Env proteins (which are enriched for high-mannose moieties) from Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) enhanced post-immunization infection with EIAV, whereas EIAV Env proteins expressed in mammalian cells induced protective responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b073">73</xref>]. Insect cell–expressed gp120 proteins were also comparatively poor immunogens in mice, because of a limited ability to induce T-helper responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b009">9</xref>].</p><p>Any vaccine-related, adverse influences of the high-mannose moieties on gp120 glycans could be overcome by treating gp120 with a mannosidase enzyme. We are now investigating whether this strategy improves the immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env proteins. Deleting a subset of N-linked glycans altered the IgG isotype profile of the antibody response to the HCV E1 protein in immunized mice and improved its immunogenicity overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030169-b074">74</xref>]. Of course, raising higher titers of antibodies and/or reducing the rate of decay of the antibody response to HIV-1 Env will achieve little if those antibodies are non-neutralizing. Our hope, however, is that a general increase in the immunogenicity of Env proteins could facilitate the development of otherwise sub-threshold NAb responses, and/or enable lower amounts of Env trimers to be used. Combining the mannose-removal technique with other strategies intended to increase the immunogenicity of NAb epitopes should also be possible. Several other vaccine antigens that are considered to be problematic from the immunogenicity perspective, such as RSV F, RSV G, CMV gB, and Ebola GP, are also highly glycosylated and/or can bind to MCLRs (S.
