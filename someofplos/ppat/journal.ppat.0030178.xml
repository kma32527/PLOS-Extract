However, neither of these cell types express signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (CD150), which has been identified as the receptor for wild-type MV. We have infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with a recombinant MV strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP); thus bringing together the optimal animal model for measles and a virus that can be detected with unprecedented sensitivity. Blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavages were collected every 3 d, and necropsies were performed upon euthanasia 9 or 15 d after infection. EGFP production by MV-infected cells was visualized macroscopically, in both living and sacrificed animals, and microscopically by confocal microscopy and FACS analysis. At the peak of viremia, EGFP fluorescence was detected in skin, respiratory and digestive tract, but most intensely in all lymphoid tissues. B- and T-lymphocytes expressing CD150 were the major target cells for MV infection. Highest percentages (up to 30%) of infected lymphocytes were detected in lymphoid tissues, and the virus preferentially targeted cells with a memory phenotype. Unexpectedly, circulating monocytes did not sustain productive MV infection. In peripheral tissues, large numbers of MV-infected CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC class-II<sup>+</sup> myeloid dendritic cells were detected in conjunction with infected T-lymphocytes, suggesting transmission of MV between these cell types. Fluorescent imaging of MV infection in non-human primates demonstrated a crucial role for lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of measles and measles-associated immunosuppression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Measles remains one of the most important causes of childhood mortality in developing countries. The virus is highly infectious and is spread via the respiratory route. According to textbook descriptions, measles virus first infects respiratory epithelial cells, followed by viremia mediated by infected monocytes. However, this order of events is inconsistent with current knowledge about receptor usage by measles virus strains. In this paper we have revisited the pathogenesis of measles by infecting non-human primates with a recombinant measles virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. An important advantage of this system is that infected cells become fluorescent and can be detected with high sensitivity in living animals as well as tissue samples. Strikingly, at the peak of virus replication all lymphoid tissues were strongly fluorescent, and up to 10% of T-lymphocytes and 30% of B-lymphocytes were infected. In peripheral tissues the virus predominantly infected lymphocytes and dendritic cells, although to a lesser extent respiratory epithelial cells were also infected. We hypothesize that measles virus, like human immunodeficiency virus, utilizes dendritic cells as a vehicle to establish infection of the lymphoid system and cause immunosuppression. This study reshapes our basic view of measles pathogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This study was financially supported by the VIRGO consortium, an innovative cluster approved by the Netherlands Genomics Initiative and partially funded by the Dutch Government (BSIK 03012).

Measles is associated with a profound but transient immunosuppression, and as a result, opportunistic infections may cause pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and otitis media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b004">4</xref>]. MV is a member of the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Morbillivirus</italic>, which are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of negative polarity. Morbilliviruses are among the most infectious viruses of mammals, and are predominantly transmitted via the respiratory route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>]. Surprisingly, little is known about the specific cells involved in virus transmission and dissemination throughout the body.</p><p>Classical textbook descriptions of measles pathogenesis suggest that MV initially infects epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, subsequently spreads to the regional lymph nodes, and is finally disseminated during a viremic phase mediated by infected monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b007">7</xref>]. However, epithelial cells and unstimulated monocytes do not express signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150), the receptor used by wild-type MV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b009">9</xref>], making this sequence of events unlikely. Moreover, wild-type MV does not readily infect monocytes or epithelial cell lines in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b012">12</xref>]. CD150 is expressed on subsets of thymocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and activated B- and T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b009">9</xref>]; therefore, these cells are the most likely primary target cells for MV infection.</p><p>It has been described that wild-type MV strains replicate efficiently in lymphocytes in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b013">13</xref>] and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b014">14</xref>], although it has taken until the early 1990s before lymphoid cells replaced Vero cells as the golden standard for isolation of wild-type MV from clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b015">15</xref>]. A decade ago it was shown that human DCs could be infected with wild-type MV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b018">18</xref>], which was shown to be mediated by CD150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b019">19</xref>]. Infected DCs produced infectious virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b017">17</xref>] and were able to transmit the virus upon in vivo inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b020">20</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies with an animal morbillivirus, canine distemper virus in ferrets, also showed a viral tropism that was compatible with CD150-expressing cells: the major infected cell populations were T-and B-lymphocytes and thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b022">22</xref>]. In this model, infection of macrophages or DCs could not be demonstrated. However, since infection with this ferret-adapted virus causes mainly neurological symptoms and is almost always fatal, it is difficult to extrapolate these data to measles in humans.</p><p>Humans are the only natural host for MV, although measles outbreaks have also occurred in captive non-human primates following contact with human patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b023">23</xref>]. The incubation time of measles is approximately 2 wk, which has made it difficult to investigate the early phases of MV infection in humans. Onset of the typical rash coincides with the appearance of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and T-lymphocytes, which correlate with a rapid decrease in viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>]. Although several small laboratory animal models for MV infection have been developed, none of these closely mimic the pathogenesis of measles in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b024">24</xref>]. Experimental infection of non-human primates, especially macaques, has proven crucial for studying the pathogenesis of MV infection. Both rhesus (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Macaca mulatta</named-content>) and cynomolgus (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Macaca fascicularis</named-content>) macaques are highly susceptible to MV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b026">26</xref>], although clinical signs such as rash and conjunctivitis may be more prominent in rhesus than in cynomolgus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b029">29</xref>].</p><p>A full-length anti-genomic clone (MV-IC323) was previously generated from a Japanese wild-type MV strain, and the resulting recombinant virus was shown to be virulent in macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b030">30</xref>]. The virus was shown to utilize CD150, but not CD46, as receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b031">31</xref>]. Subsequently, the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was inserted in this clone within an additional transcription unit upstream of the MV nucleocapsid gene. The resulting recombinant virus, MV-IC323-EGFP, displayed similar in vitro replication characteristics as its parental IC323 strain, and infected cells produced high amounts of EGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b031">31</xref>]. Morbillivirus genes are transcribed by a start-stop mechanism from a single promoter in the 3′ leader region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b004">4</xref>], resulting in the highest number of mRNAs being transcribed from promoter-proximal transcription units. Thus, in MV-IC323-EGFP-infected cells EGFP is the maximal virally expressed protein, and its amount is directly related to the level of virus replication. We therefore reasoned that experimental infection of macaques with MV-IC323-EGFP would provide an ideal opportunity to study measles pathogenesis at the cellular, tissue, and whole organism level.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MV-IC323-EGFP Causes Measles in Macaques</title><p>Three rhesus (#R1–3) and three cynomolgus macaques (#C1–3) were infected intra-tracheally with 10<sup>4</sup> cell culture infectious dose-50 of MV-IC323-EGFP. Two animals of each species were euthanized on day 9, the expected time of peak virus replication, and one on day 15, at which time no residual infectious MV was expected to be present. To assess the virulence of the recombinant virus in vivo, we performed virus isolations from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). MV-IC323-EGFP was isolated from BAL cells and PBMCs of all six animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g001">1</xref>B), and kinetics and peak levels of infected cells were similar to those described previously for wild-type MV infection in macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b033">33</xref>].

The recombinant virus proved to be virulent in macaques, allowing macroscopic and microscopic assessment of the course of measles. Lymphocytes expressing the MV receptor CD150 were found to be the major target cells for MV replication in vivo. In submucosal tissues we detected large numbers of MV-infected lymphocytes and DCs in aggregates of inflammatory cells. Finally, MV infection was also detected in the epithelia of mouth and trachea.</p><p>We identified CD150<sup>+</sup> B- and T-lymphocytes as major targets for MV infection in vivo. The preferential infection of lymphocytes expressing CD150, a T cell activation marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b036">36</xref>], suggests that MV targets activated rather than resting T-lymphocytes. Our in vivo data are in agreement with recently published results of ex vivo infection studies in human tonsillar tissue, demonstrating that wild-type MV strains predominantly infected human CD150<sup>+</sup> B- and T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b037">37</xref>].</p><p>In previous studies monocytes were postulated to be the key MV-infected cell population in peripheral blood of humans, based on the detection of MV RNA by RT-PCR in monocyte-enriched PBMC samples obtained from measles patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b005">5</xref>]. However, the samples used in those studies were collected after onset of rash, and these results may have reflected binding of opsonized virus particles to Fc-receptors rather than active virus replication. Our data are in accordance with the observation that non-activated human monocytes do not express CD150 and are only inefficiently infected in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b012">12</xref>]. MV-infection of human and non-human primate lymphocytes has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b040">40</xref>], but the data we collected in macaques are the first to show the kinetics and high frequency of MV-infected lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Estimations of MV-infected cells in PBMCs by an infectious center assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) or by EGFP detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggested that the latter method was one to two log values more sensitive. This clearly illustrates the strength of our model based on infection with an autofluorescent virus as compared to conventional pathogenesis studies.</p><p>MHC class II<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs in the dermis of the skin and the submucosa of respiratory and digestive tracts were identified as a second major target cell population for MV infection. Since DCs are known to express CD150 and can be infected with MV in vitro, a role for this cell population in the pathogenesis of measles had been hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b042">42</xref>]. Here we formally prove that this is indeed the case in macaques in vivo. Interestingly, infected DCs in our study were in many cases found in association with lymphoid tissue or aggregates of inflammatory cells near hair follicles and mucous glands. Theoretically DCs could also have become fluorescent by uptake of EGFP rather than by MV-infection. However, this is unlikely to result in high EGFP expression levels as those observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g006">6</xref>). We are currently undertaking additional studies to further characterize the phenotype and functionality of these infected DCs.</p><p>Our observation that high percentages of infected lymphocytes and DCs were detected in lymphoid tissues of infected macaques sheds new light on measles-associated immunosuppression. Measles causes lymphopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>], which has previously been attributed to apoptosis of uninfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b040">40</xref>]. Our data suggest that actual depletion of the many MV-infected lymphocytes may contribute significantly to the observed lymphopenia. In addition, MV was found to preferentially infect CD150<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes with a memory phenotype (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>). This is in accordance with data recently published by Condack et al<italic>.</italic>, describing the preferential MV-infection of human memory T-lymphocytes as compared to naive T-lymphocytes in ex vivo infection studies in human tonsillar tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b037">37</xref>]. Overall, these data strongly suggest that depletion of memory T- and B-lymphocytes as a direct consequence of MV infection may play an important role in immunosuppression. In addition, MV infection of DCs may lead to immune modulation as previously demonstrated in ex vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b043">43</xref>].</p><p>Levels of MV-infected cells varied substantially between individual animals. Whereas the viral load in PBMCs of animal #R3 resembled those detected in the other animals, the absolute percentages of EGFP-positive cells were much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This animal also had the lowest percentages of EGFP-positive cells in lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), and no EGFP expression was macroscopically detected in the skin. This variation in responses is likely related to the use of outbred non-SPF animals, and may reflect natural variations in the course of measles in humans, where children may develop either mild or more severe measles.</p><p>The case-fatality rate of measles in humans is approximately 0.01% in industrialized countries, but may be up to 10% in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b044">44</xref>]. The increased mortality may be explained by factors such as crowding, poor supportive care, and the high pressure of opportunistic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b045">45</xref>], which are often considered to be the ultimate cause of measles-associated mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>]. However, opportunistic infections may also influence the pathogenesis of measles by another mechanism. Our data demonstrate that CD150<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes are major targets for MV replication. Opportunistic pathogens may cause chronic immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b046">46</xref>], likely resulting in higher numbers of CD150<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in circulation and in lymphoid tissues. This suggests that chronic immune activation from high pathogen pressure may facilitate MV replication and spread, thus increasing the severity of MV infection.</p><p>Apart from MV infection of lymphocytes and DCs, we also detected MV infection in the squamous stratified epithelium of tongue and buccal mucosa and in the ciliated epithelium of the trachea. In these tissues infection was associated with syncytium formation. Since epithelial cells do not express CD150, these observations suggest the possibility of non-CD150–mediated MV infection and spread. In previous in vitro studies it was shown that MV could infect human primary small airway epithelial cells or lung carcinoma cells via a CD150- and CD46-independent mechanism, resulting in the formation of syncytia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b047">47</xref>]. It has been suggested that high local concentrations of virus would enable the virus to enter cells using low affinity receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b031">31</xref>]. However, the existence of an additional high affinity MV receptor cannot be excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b047">47</xref>].</p><p>On basis of our data we hypothesize that, upon natural MV infection, initial MV replication takes place in the tonsils. However, it remains unclear how the virus gains access to this organ. Given its high person-to-person transmissibility, the virus would need an easily accessible target cell in the upper respiratory or digestive tract that could “trap” the virus and subsequently transport it into lymphoid tissues. The observed substantial MV infection of DCs suggests that CD150<sup>+</sup> DCs may fulfill this role, as has also been suggested for HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b048">48</xref>]. Notably, DC-SIGN was recently identified as a new attachment receptor for MV, which could enhance viral transmission to CD150<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b049">49</xref>]. Whether this process takes place at the respiratory mucosa, in the tonsillar crypts, or elsewhere will need to be determined in future studies focusing on earlier time points after MV infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in non-human primates MV targets CD150<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and CD11c<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, and to a lesser extent epithelial cells. In contrast to previous studies in human measles patients, circulating monocytes in peripheral blood do not sustain productive MV infection in macaques. Although the experiments described here are based on a single recombinant MV strain, and important differences may exist between the course of MV infection in humans and macaques, these data warrant re-evaluation of the tropism of MV in humans. This non-human primate model provides new opportunities to address specific aspects of measles pathogenesis in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study design.</title><p>Three cynomolgus macaques (animals #C1–3) and three rhesus macaques (animals #R1–3) were infected by intra-tracheal inoculation with 10<sup>4</sup> cell culture infectious dose-50 of MV-IC323-EGFP diluted to a volume of 5 ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

Fusion protein–specific serum IgM and IgG antibody levels were determined by FACS-measured immunofluorescence as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b051">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Macroscopic detection of EGFP fluorescence.</title><p>For the purpose of detecting EGFP fluorescence inside a BSL-3 isolator cage or a laminar flow biosafety cabinet, a lamp was custom-made containing six 5-volt LEDs (Luxeon Lumileds, lambertian, cyan, peak emission 490–495 nm) mounted with D480/40 bandpass filters (Chroma) in a frame that allowed decontamination with 70% alcohol or fumigation with formaldehyde. Emitted fluorescence was visualized through the amber cover of a UV transilluminator (UVP) normally used for screening DNA gels.

Fluorescence was detected in a FACSCalibur, obtaining approximately 500,000 events to allow detection of low-frequent EGFP<sup>+</sup> subpopulations. Lymphoid tissues were minced, and single cell suspensions were prepared by using cell strainers with 100-μm pore size (BD Biosciences); these cells were directly used for FACS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Skin cultures.</title><p>Shaven skin sections were collected in PBS during necropsies and processed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b034">34</xref>] with adaptations. Briefly, tissues were incubated overnight in trypsin (0.05%), after which dermis and epidermis were mechanically separated. The two tissues were subsequently cultured for 2 d in complete medium to allow DCs to migrate out of the tissue. The single cell suspension that remained in the medium was used for FACS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Preparation of tissue samples for vibratome sectioning.</title><p>4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue samples were immersed in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 20 min and embedded in 5% (w/v) agarose (Type VII low gelling temperature, Sigma) in PBS. A vibratome (Leica Microsystems) was used to cut serial 100-μm sections into 0.2 M TRIS buffered saline. A number of tissue sections were counterstained by incubation for 60 s in propidium iodide.

Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in an appropriate primary antibody diluted in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) TX-100 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Monoclonal antibodies to CD20 (1:100, DAKO) and CD3 (1:100, DAKO) were used to detect B- and T-lymphocytes, respectively. CAM 5.2 was used to detect cells of an epithelial origin. After incubation in primary antibodies, tissue sections were rinsed three times in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) TX-100. Sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 or goat anti-mouse Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS with 0.1% TX-100 (v/v) and 1% (w/v) BSA.

Sections were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and specific antibody-antigen binding sites were detected using an Envision-Peroxidase system with DAB (DAKO) as substrate. Single and dual labeling immunofluorescence was performed using anti-EGFP and monoclonal antibodies to the DC marker CD11c (Novacastra), the macrophage cell marker Mac387 (Abcam), and the epithelial cell–specific marker CAM 5.2 (Becton-Dickinson). Antigen binding sites were detected with either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa 488 or 568 (Molecular Probes).
