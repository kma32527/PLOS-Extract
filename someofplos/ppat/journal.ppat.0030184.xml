The opportunistic fungal pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> is a common component of human intestinal flora. To gain insight into <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> colonization, genes expressed by fungi grown within a host were studied. The <italic>EFH1</italic> gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> in the intestinal tract. Counterintuitively, an <italic>efh1</italic> null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, a model of commensal colonization, whereas an <italic>EFH1</italic> overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and of the oral cavity of athymic mice, the latter situation modeling human mucosal candidiasis. When inoculated into the bloodstream of mice, both <italic>efh1</italic> null and <italic>EFH1</italic> overexpressing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, other mutants are attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation but exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. Finally, although expression of several genes is dependent on transcription factor Efg1p during laboratory growth, Efg1p-independent expression of these genes was observed during growth within the murine intestinal tract. These results show that expression of <italic>EFH1</italic> regulated the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Also, different genes are required in different host niches and the pathway(s) that regulates gene expression during host colonization can differ from well-characterized pathways used during laboratory growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Although the fungus <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> commonly colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract as a commensal, the organism is also an opportunistic pathogen, responsible for a wide range of infections in immunocompromised persons. While numerous studies of infection have been conducted, few studies have analyzed the commensal state. The studies described here analyze <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells colonizing the intestinal tract of immunocompetent mice in the absence of disease, a model for commensalism. Results showed that expression of the putative transcription factor Efh1p by cells colonizing the intestinal tract was relatively high, but paradoxically, expression of Efh1p was associated with lower colonization. Efh1p had no detectable effect on the ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to cause lethal disseminated infection in mice. In contrast, Rbt1p and Rbt4p, two proteins of poorly defined function required for normal disseminated infection, were not required for intestinal colonization. These results argue that the commensal state is distinct from the pathogenic state and that different factors are important in different states. Also, the regulation of expression of genes <italic>RBT1</italic>, <italic>RBT4</italic>, and <italic>ECE1</italic> during intestinal colonization differed from their well-characterized regulation during laboratory growth.

In humans, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> colonization of the oral cavity is detected in most infants by the age of one month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b001">1</xref>]. The majority of adults are detectably colonized in the intestinal tract by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b002">2</xref>]. Colonization is believed to persist for long periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b002">2</xref>], and in this situation, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is primarily nonpathogenic. However, if the host becomes immunocompromised, disease caused by dissemination of commensal organisms from the intestinal tract can occur. For example, disseminated candidiasis occurs in neutropenic patients, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida spp</named-content> are among the most common organisms isolated from the blood of hospitalized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b003">3</xref>]. In AIDS patients, oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is a common opportunistic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b004">4</xref>]. Despite the importance of commensal organisms as the source of infection, little is known about <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> factors that influence intestinal colonization.</p><p>A growing body of literature indicates that the interplay between commensal organisms and the host GI tract is characterized by reciprocal regulatory interactions. In addition to a role in nutrition, normal flora are required for proper development of the intestinal capillary network as well as Peyer's patches and other components of the intestinal immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b005">5</xref>]. Normal flora stimulate host toll-like receptors, and these interactions are important for regulation of the inflammatory response. In the absence of toll-like receptors, dysregulation of the inflammatory response with concomitant damage to the GI tract occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b006">6</xref>]. Thus, the flora make important contributions to the health of the host.</p><p>The host also influences its flora. Bulk movement of material through the GI tract regulates populations of commensal organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b007">7</xref>], and host secretions and immune effectors play key roles in regulating colonization and determining the composition of the flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b008">8</xref>]. Therefore, reciprocal interactions between the commensal flora and the host maintain the balance between overexuberant inflammation and uncontrolled growth of microorganisms.</p><p>To gain insight into the activities of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> that are important for host colonization or disease, studies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> gene expression during interaction with a host or host cells have been pursued. Microarray studies analyzing interactions between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> and cultured immune cells have detected dramatic changes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> metabolism and stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b011">11</xref>]. For example, genes encoding enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle are highly expressed in phagocytosed fungal cells, and isocitrate lyase is important for systemic virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b009">9</xref>]. A study of antigens expressed during oral infection revealed that components of a MAP kinase signal transduction pathway were expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b012">12</xref>]. In addition, the Not5 protein is expressed during oral infection and is required for systemic virulence. Recent analysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells invading host parenchymal tissue revealed changes in expression of numerous genes, demonstrating that invading cells experience metabolic changes and initiate responses to stresses such as iron limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>The goals of this study were to identify <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genes that were expressed during growth within a host and to compare the genetic requirements for infection and intestinal colonization. Therefore, genes expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells associated with oral infection or in cells growing in the intestinal tract were identified, and the ability of mutants lacking some of the genes to colonize the murine intestinal tract or to produce disease was characterized. Mutants lacking the <italic>EFH1</italic> gene, encoding a putative transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b014">14</xref>], colonized the intestinal tract at higher levels than wild-type (WT) organisms. Strains engineered to overexpress <italic>EFH1</italic> exhibited reduced levels of intestinal colonization and reduced colonization of the oral cavity of immunodeficient (athymic) mice. Therefore, <italic>EFH1</italic> is important for determining the population size of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> during colonization. Despite its importance during intestinal colonization, <italic>EFH1</italic> did not affect virulence in the disseminated infection model or cellular physiology under laboratory conditions. In contrast, <italic>RBT1</italic>, encoding a putative cell wall protein, and <italic>RBT4</italic>, encoding a possible secreted protein, are required for normal virulence in the disseminated infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b015">15</xref>] but are not required for normal intestinal colonization, despite their high expression during growth in the intestinal tract. Therefore, genes that influence commensal colonization can be distinct from genes that are required for virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> Gene Expression during Growth within an Immunosuppressed Mammalian Host</title><p>To initiate studies on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genes required for infection or colonization, preliminary microarray analysis of gene expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells recovered from sites of oral infection was performed. WT <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells were orally inoculated into germ-free newborn piglets as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b016">16</xref>]. Following immunosuppression with cyclosporine A and methylprednisolone for 7–10 d, the animals developed dramatic thrush and esosphagitis, and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> plaques were visible in the esophagus at necropsy. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells were scraped from the tongues of two immunosuppressed, gnotobiotic (IGB) piglets and from the esophagus of one of them and were used for microarray analysis as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Because the majority of spots exhibited poor hybridization with samples from the oral infections, a comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression could not be performed. However, there were several candidate genes more highly expressed in samples taken from infected piglets than in reference laboratory-grown cells.</p><p>To confirm that candidate genes from the microarray studies exhibited increased expression in mammalian hosts compared to log phase laboratory-grown cells, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed. For the analysis, RNA was prepared from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells scraped from the tongue, esophagus, or roof of the mouth of two IGB piglets or recovered from the contents of the large intestine of one IGB piglet. cDNA prepared from the RNA was used as the template for qRT-PCR amplification as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Results were normalized using <italic>C. albicans ACT1</italic> (encoding actin) and are shown relative to the reference sample of log phase, laboratory-grown cells that were used for the microarrays.</p><p>Seven genes that exhibited relatively high expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells recovered from the oral cavity or intestinal tract were identified, including <italic>EFH1</italic>, <italic>YHB5</italic>, and <italic>ECE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030184-t001">Table 1</xref>), which became the subjects of this study. <italic>EFH1</italic> encodes a paralog of the well-studied transcription factor Efg1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b017">17</xref>]. Efg1p regulates several morphological transitions as well as the expression of hyphal and virulence genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b021">21</xref>]. However, the absence of Efh1p does not lead to a pronounced phenotype during laboratory growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b014">14</xref>], and thus, its function is not understood. <italic>YHB5</italic> (orf19.3710) encodes a flavohemoglobin; its paralog, <italic>YHB1</italic>, is induced by growth in the presence of nitric oxide and is important for resistance to nitrosative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b023">23</xref>]. <italic>YHB5</italic>, by contrast, is not induced during laboratory growth in nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b022">22</xref>]. <italic>ECE1</italic>, a gene that influences adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b024">24</xref>], but whose function is poorly understood, is highly expressed by cells that are growing in the hyphal form (filamentous cells lacking constrictions at their septa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b025">25</xref>]. <italic>ECE1</italic> is also highly expressed during invasion of host tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b013">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="ppat-0030184-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030184.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Gene Designations</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030184.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Gene Name</td><td><hr/>ORF19 Designation</td><td><hr/>CYGD<sup>a</sup> Designation</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>EFH1</italic></td><td>Orf19.5498</td><td>CA2672</td></tr><tr><td><italic>YHB5</italic></td><td>Orf19.3710</td><td>CA3139</td></tr><tr><td><italic>SOD3</italic></td><td>Orf19.7111.1</td><td>CA5587</td></tr><tr><td><italic>ECE1</italic></td><td>Orf19.3374</td><td>CA1402</td></tr><tr><td><italic>RBT1</italic></td><td>Orf19.1327</td><td>CA2830</td></tr><tr><td><italic>RBT4</italic></td><td>Orf19.6202</td><td>CA0104</td></tr><tr><td><italic>TEF1</italic></td><td>Orf19.1435</td><td>CA0362</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p><sup>a</sup>Comprehensive Yeast Genome Database.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap><p>In addition<italic>,</italic> other genes expressed under laboratory conditions that resulted in increased <italic>ECE1</italic> or <italic>EFH1</italic> expression (hyphal growth and post-exponential phase, respectively) were analyzed. <italic>RBT1</italic> and <italic>RBT4</italic>, genes of poorly understood function that are expressed in hyphal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b015">15</xref>], and <italic>SOD3</italic> (orf19.7111.1), encoding a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase that is expressed in post-exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b026">26</xref>], were studied.

The host-growth genes differ in their importance for intestinal colonization and systemic virulence demonstrating that different factors control host-pathogen interactions in different sites. The genes <italic>RBT1</italic> and <italic>RBT4</italic> are required for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to cause lethal infection following intravenous inoculation and for invasive infection of the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b015">15</xref>]. However, these genes are not required for colonization of the intestinal tract. In contrast, the <italic>C. albicans EFH1</italic> gene regulates intestinal colonization but not systemic infection. Thus, some genes are required in one niche but not in another. Intestinal colonization is an essential stage in the life cycle of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> because the organism is not thought to have an environmental reservoir. Therefore, optimal intestinal colonization is crucial for survival of the organism, and it is not surprising that the organism possesses genes that regulate colonization in this niche.</p><p><italic>EFH1</italic> was relatively highly expressed by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells growing in the mammalian intestinal tract, but paradoxically, expression of <italic>EFH1</italic> was associated with lower colonization. Ectopic overexpression of <italic>EFH1</italic> resulted in very poor colonization; this latter finding probably reflects a true difference in colonization, because for in vitro–grown <italic>EFH1</italic> overexpressing cells, the ratio of DNA content (determined by qPCR) to CFUs (measured by plating) was less than 2-fold less than the ratio obtained for WT <italic>C. albicans</italic> (unpublished data). In this niche, therefore, expression of <italic>EFH1</italic> had a negative effect on population size. Expression of Efh1p may affect the interactions between colonizing <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> and the cells of the intestinal tract, resulting in changes such as altered adherence or altered signaling to the immune system. By reducing colonization, expression of <italic>EFH1</italic> may also reduce the likelihood of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> infection, favoring commensal colonization as opposed to candidiasis.</p><p>The effects of Efh1p on colonization are reversible, because expression of <italic>EFH1</italic> was regulated during growth within the host (lower expression in cells recovered from OPC lesions than in cells recovered from the intestinal tract). Therefore, the negative effects of Efh1p that reduce colonization are inactivated during oral infection. Since forced expression of <italic>EFH1</italic> reduced colonization of the oral cavity in an immunodeficient host, repression of <italic>EFH1</italic> expression during active infection may be an important step in the progression from benign colonizer to active invader on mucosal surfaces.</p><p>Since <italic>EFH1</italic> encodes a putative transcription factor, its effects on colonization are probably indirect. Most likely, deletion of <italic>EFH1</italic> alters the expression of other genes, some of which directly influence colonization. Under laboratory conditions, <italic>EFH1</italic> did not strongly affect the expression of the collection of genes studied in this report (unpublished data). However, in previous studies, a laboratory-grown <italic>EFH1</italic> overexpressing strain was shown to have altered expression of several cell surface proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b014">14</xref>], which may play roles in colonization.</p><p>The genes studied here were relatively poorly expressed in laboratory-grown log phase cells but showed expression in laboratory-grown post-exponential phase cells, suggesting that during growth within a host, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells express some features of post-exponential phase cells. Numerous bacterial genes that play important roles governing host-pathogen interactions are expressed in post-exponential phase. For example, expression of virulence factors by organisms such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacillus anthracis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b037">37</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b038">38</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Helicobacter pylori</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b039">39</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Legionella pneumophila</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b040">40</xref>], or <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b041">41</xref>] occurs in post-exponential phase. Therefore, expression of post-exponential phase genes during host interaction is a common theme for many bacterial pathogens and for the fungus <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content>.</p><p>In the laboratory, expression of <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>RBT1</italic>, and <italic>RBT4</italic> is linked to hyphal morphogenesis. However, in cells growing within the intestinal tract, expression of these genes does not depend on Efg1p and most likely occurs in yeast cells. <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>RBT1</italic>, and <italic>RBT4</italic> were also found to be expressed in <italic>efh1</italic> null mutants recovered from the cecum of mice (unpublished data). Therefore, the pathway(s) responsible for the expression of these genes during growth within the host is uncharacterized. Since the genes show relatively high expression during post-exponential phase in the laboratory, there may be a post-exponential phase regulator(s) that is responsible for their expression in the host. Several regulators required for normal viability in post-exponential phase have been recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030184-b042">42</xref>]. Deeper understanding of the biology of post-exponential phase cells may reveal <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> activities that are important for colonization and disease.</p><p>During colonization, the population size of a microorganism reflects a balance between external forces that limit the population, such as the effects of the host immune system, and intrinsic factors, such as the ability of the organism to increase in number. The ability of commensal <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> to regulate its own population size through reversible expression of a negative regulator of colonization adds another layer of regulation to the interactions that take place between host and colonizer.
