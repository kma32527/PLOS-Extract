We previously showed that the cellular transcription factor ZEB1 binds to a sequence element, ZV, located at nt −17 to −12 relative to the transcription initiation site of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> promoter, Zp, repressing transcription from Zp in a transient transfection assay. Here, we report the phenotype in the context of a whole EBV genome of a variant of EBV strain B95.8 containing a 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZV element of Zp that reduced, but did not eliminate, ZEB1 binding to Zp. Strikingly, epithelial 293 cells latently infected with the EBV ZV mutant spontaneously produced IE-, early-, and late-gene products and infectious virus, while wild-type (WT)-infected 293 cells did not and have never been reported to do so. Furthermore, treatment with the chemical inducers sodium butyrate and 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) led to an additional order-of-magnitude production of infectious virus in the ZV mutant–infected 293 cells, but still no virus in the WT-infected 293 cells. Similarly, ZV mutant–infected Burkitt's lymphoma BJAB cells accumulated at least 10-fold more EBV IE mRNAs than did WT-infected BJAB cells, with TPA or sodium butyrate treatment leading to an additional 5- to 10-fold accumulation of EBV IE mRNAs in the ZV mutant–infected cells. Thus, we conclude that ZEB1 binding to Zp plays a central role in regulating the latent-lytic switch in EBV-infected epithelial and B cells, suggesting ZEB1 as a target for lytic-induction therapies in EBV-associated malignancies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Ninety percent of people in the world become infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The virus can infect both epithelial and B cells, either making more virus and killing the cell or establishing a latent form of infection where it is stably maintained in the host. EBV infection is associated with the development of some types of cancer. We show here that a mere 2-bp substitution mutation in the silencer element, ZV, of the promoter of EBV's immediate-early <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene in the context of a whole EBV genome can lead to spontaneous reactivation of EBV out of latency into lytic replication, with production of infectious virus in some cells. The presence of the mutation also (i) made the virus more responsive to reactivation following treatment with chemical inducers, and (ii) disrupted binding of a cellular transcriptional repressor protein, ZEB1, to the BZLF1 promoter. Our work suggests a method to kill EBV-infected cancer cells by treating them with agents that lower the repressor activity of ZEB1. It also suggests one may be able to generate a vaccine against EBV infection using a constitutively lytic EBV strain made by knocking out the silencer elements of the BZLF1 promoter.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by United States Public Health Service grants AI107034 (to JEM) and CA14520 from the National Institutes of Health, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant (to UW Medical School), a Pardee Foundation grant (to JEM), and funds from the McArdle Laboratory and UW Medical School.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Yu X, Wang Z, Mertz JE (2007) ZEB1 regulates the latent-lytic switch in infection by Epstein-Barr virus.

It is a causative agent of or associated with infectious mononucleosis and several B-cell and epithelial-cell cancers including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some gastric carcinomas (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b001">1</xref>]). EBV can infect and immortalize primary B lymphocytes, leading to a latent form of infection in which its genome is maintained as an episome replicating via its viral origin of replication, <italic>ori-P</italic>, in synchrony with its host cell's DNA. EBV can also infect epithelial cells, leading to a latent or lytic form of infection depending upon the specific cell type and state of cellular differentiation. Only a few of the ∼100 genes in EBV are expressed during latency unless reactivation occurs, leading to lytic replication with production of infectious virus (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b002">2</xref>]).</p><p>Understanding regulation of the switch between latency and lytic replication is a central problem in herpes virology. EBV provides an excellent system to address this problem. Reactivation of EBV out of latency is usually initiated via activating expression of the immediate-early (IE) <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b003">3</xref>] which encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, Zta (also called Z, Zebra, and EB1), a member of the bZIP family of leucine-zipper transactivators. The activities of Zta include directly participating in EBV replication via binding to the viral DNA origin of lytic replication, <italic>ori-Lyt</italic>, down-regulating the latency-associated promoters Cp and Wp, and serving as a transcriptional transactivator of its own promoter, other IE and early (E) viral promoters including the <italic>BRLF1</italic> promoter, Rp, and several cellular promoters. The <italic>BRLF1</italic> gene encodes a second viral transactivator, Rta (also called R). Acting together, Zta and Rta play multiple roles in lytic replication of EBV. While highly quiescent during latency, expression of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> promoter, Zp, can be activated in some cells by treatment with various inducers including phorbol esters such as 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), calcium ionophores such as ionomycin, sodium butyrate, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and anti-immunoglobulins (anti-Igs) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b004">4</xref>]).</p><p>Transcription of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene can be initiated from either its proximal promoter, Zp, or the more distal promoter, Rp. However, most Zta protein is synthesized from mRNA initiated at Zp. The <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements of Zp sufficient for both basal and induced activity lie within the nucleotide (nt) −221 to +12 region relative to the promoter's transcription initiation site (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b005">5</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Four AT-rich motifs, named ZIA through ZID, can bind the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and the myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b007">7</xref>]. ZII is a CRE-like motif that binds CREB, ATF family members, C/EBPs, and the AP-1 family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b011">11</xref>]. ZIII contains multiple binding sites for the Zta protein itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b012">12</xref>].

Other silencing elements, termed ZIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b017">17</xref>] and HIα-HIδ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b015">15</xref>], lie within the nt −551 to −222 region of Zp. We have identified ZEB1 (also called δEF1, TCF8, AREB6, ZFHEP, NIL-2A, ZFHX1A, and BZP) as the main cellular factor in B-lymphocytes repressing transcription from Zp via binding the ZV element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b018">18</xref>].

Quite strikingly, this ZV mutant (mt) of EBV spontaneously reactivated out of latently infected human epithelial 293 cells into lytic replication with production of infectious virus under conditions in which its WT parental virus never does. Burkitt's lymphoma BJAB cells latently infected with the ZV mutant also exhibited spontaneous synthesis of Zta mRNA under culture conditions in which WT-infected BJAB cells did not. Furthermore, treatment of the ZV mutant-infected BJAB cells with TPA led to high-level synthesis of Zta and Rta mRNAs while these IE viral genes remained silent in the WT-infected BJAB cells. Others have previously reported that ZEB1 is also a transcriptional repressor of the cellular E-cadherin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b021">21</xref>], with reduction in E-cadherin expression linked to tumor invasion, metastasis, and unfavorable prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b022">22</xref>]. ZEB1 represses by functioning as a molecular beacon for recruitment to promoters of CoREST-CtBP co-repressor complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b023">23</xref>]. Taken together, we conclude that ZEB1 plays a central role in maintaining EBV infection in a latent form in both epithelial and B cells and, thus, is an excellent target for lytic-induction therapy for EBV-associated malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of Cell Lines Latently Infected with a ZV Mutant of EBV</title><p>Substitution mutations in the Zp ZV element of either (i) A to C at nt −12 or (ii) A to C at nt −12 plus T to C at nt −13 relative to the Zp transcription initiation site were shown previously to partially relieve both (i) binding of ZEB1 and (ii) repression of Zp by ZEB1 in transient transfection assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b018">18</xref>] and mini-EBV replicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b024">24</xref>]. To examine the role of the Zp ZV element in establishing and maintaining EBV in a latent form of infection, we introduced this −12C, −13C 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZV element (ZVmt) into an intact EBV genome using a bacmid, p2089. Plasmid p2089 contains a wild-type copy of the complete genome of the B95.8 strain of EBV along with a mini F plasmid and expression cassettes for hygromycin phosphotransferase, green fluorescence protein (GFP), and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b025">25</xref>]. The parental p2089-WT and two completely independent isolates of p2089-ZVmt were transfected in parallel into 293 cells, and the cells were grown thereafter in the presence of hygromycin. Numerous hygromycin-resistant, GFP-positive colonies were visible within 3–4 weeks after transfection with either p2089-WT or p2089-ZVmt. Independent clones of latently infected cells were grown out into cell lines. Virus stocks of WT and ZVmt EBV were generated by co-transfection of these cell lines with pCMV-BZLF1 and p2670, plasmids expressing the EBV-encoded proteins Zta and glycoprotein 110, respectively, to induce lytic replication and production of infectious virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b026">26</xref>]. The titers of these virus stocks were determined by a Raji cell assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b027">27</xref>]. Multiple independent cell lines containing p2089-WT or p2089-ZVmt which consistently yielded infectious virus with titers of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> green Raji units (GRUs) per ml of medium following induction were chosen for further analysis.</p><p>To determine whether extraneous mutations might have arisen during either construction of the mutant plasmid or establishment and passage of the cell lines, p2089 DNA was extracted from each cell line. First, the nt −600 to +500 region of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene in each plasmid was PCR-amplified and resequenced to make sure no extraneous mutations were present in the promoter region of this gene; only the expected −12C, −13C substitution mutations were observed. Second, Southern blot analyses of <italic>Bam</italic>HI-digested plasmid DNA were performed with a variety of EBV DNA probes; no gross alterations in the EBV genomes were observed (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; data not shown). The p2089 DNAs rescued from these cell lines were also digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI, <italic>Sal</italic>I, and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII restriction endonuclease; again, no differences were observed in any of the restriction fragment digestion patterns compared to those of the original p2089 DNA (data not shown). Third, we also constructed a WT revertant, p2089-ZVmtRev, by introducing back into p2089-ZVmt DNA the original −12A and −13T sequence of Zp and isolated and extensively characterized three independent 293 cell lines latently infected with p2089-ZVmtRev. The phenotype of this revertant was found to be indistinguishable from that of the original p2089-WT in all assays performed on the latently infected 293 cells (see below). Thus, the EBV genomes present in these cell lines probably do not differ in any significant way from the B95.8 strain of EBV except for the 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZV element of Zp.</p><fig id="ppat-0030194-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030194.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Presence of EBV DNA, mRNAs, and Proteins in the Latently Infected 293 Cell Lines Studied Here</title><p>(A) Southern blot analyses of the <italic>Bam</italic>HI DNA fragments B, K, R, and Z of the p2089 DNAs isolated from the indicated WT- and ZV mutant-infected 293 cell lines.

Two of the ZVmt-infected 293 cell lines were grown out from independent clones derived from cells transfected with one isolate of p2089-ZVmt DNA; the third was derived from cells transfected with p2089-ZVmt DNA obtained from a second, completely independent mutagenesis of p2089-WT DNA. Likewise, one of the three WT-infected 293 cell lines was the one originally described by Hammerschmidt and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b025">25</xref>]. The other two were independent clones isolated from 293 cells transfected by us with p2089-WT DNA processed in parallel with the p2089-ZVmt DNAs constructed here.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Spontaneous Reactivation of ZV Mutant EBV</title><p>293 cells latently infected with the B95.8 strain of EBV never spontaneously produce infectious virus because expression of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> and <italic>BRLF1</italic> genes is strongly repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b028">28</xref>] (M.

Only one laboratory has reported observing WT-infected 293 cells spontaneously producing EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b029">29</xref>]; even in this case, only 2% of over 250 clones examined produced any EBV, and the cells had been infected with the Akata strain of EBV, not the B95.8 strain. As expected, we, too, failed to detect expression of the EBV IE, E, or late (L) genes in any of our WT-infected 293 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">2</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g003">3</xref>). Strikingly, both Zta and Rta mRNAs were readily detected in all three ZVmt-infected 293 cell lines, present at levels at least 20-fold higher than in the WT-infected 293 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 4–6 vs. lanes 1–3). Immunoblot analyses confirmed expression of the IE genes, with each of the ZVmt-infected cell lines containing at least 30-fold more Zta, Rta, and BMRF1 protein than the WT- and ZVmtRev-infected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 5–7 vs. lanes 2–4 and lanes 8–10). BMRF1, an EBV E gene product, is only synthesized after Zta and Rta are present at sufficient levels to induce the later stages of the EBV lytic replication cycle. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that Zta, Rta, and BMRF1 proteins were abundantly present in approximately 3% of the cells adhering to the dishes in each of the these three ZVmt-infected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g003">Figure 3</xref>; data not shown). IFS also indicated the presence of gp350, a glycoprotein encoded by a late gene of EBV, in ∼1% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g003">Figure 3</xref>; data not shown). Likely, once any ZVmt-infected cell expressed Zta at a level detectable in our IFS assay, it was destined to proceed on through the entire EBV lytic cycle of replication, eventually dying, detaching from the dish, and, thus, no longer being measured in our assay; we observed only one-third as many gp350-positive cells as Zta-positive cells because the former had fewer hours remaining before they detached from the dish. Our finding 3% Zta-positive cells is not a measurement of the percent of these mutant-infected cells able to reactivate; rather, it indicates these cells were spontaneously reactivating at a rate of ∼1% per day if one assumes the time from reactivation of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> promoter to cell death was ∼3 days. In contrast, we failed to detect any Zta-, Rta-, BMRF1-, or gp350-positive cells in any of the three WT-infected and three ZVmtRev-infected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g003">Figure 3</xref>; data not shown). Thus, the 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZV element of Zp led to greatly increased expression of IE, E, and L genes of EBV in 293 cells.

Therefore, we conclude that presence of the 2-bp mutation in the Zp ZV element led not only to derepression of Zp, but also to the entire subsequent series of events in the EBV lytic replication cycle necessary for production of infectious virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Effects of Inducers on Reactivation Frequency</title><p>Transfection of cells with a Zta expression plasmid is the standard method for reactivating EBV-infected 293 cells into lytic replication for virus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b003">3</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Both the WT- and ZVmt-infected 293 cell lines produced infectious virus following exogenous addition of Rta (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, the virus titers obtained from the three ZVmt-infected cell lines were approximately 20-fold higher than they were from the three WT-infected cell lines. Immunoblot analysis indicated that these pEBV-RIE-transfected cells contained similar levels of Rta protein (data not shown).

Therefore, these two inducers synergized with the ZV mutation to yield a significantly higher frequency of reactivation of EBV than any of these three factors could accomplish by themselves or pairwise. Thus, TPA and sodium butyrate are probably primarily affecting positive and negative regulatory factors other than ZEB1 that also play roles in regulating Zp activity (e.g<italic>.</italic>, c-Jun, MEF2D). Reduction in ZEB1 binding to Zp, in combination with changes in these other regulators, is necessary to efficiently reactivate EBV to lytic replication in 293 cells.

The chromatin was sheared by sonication to fragments with an average length of ∼500 bp, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a ZEB1-specific antibody. DNA extracted from the precipitated chromatin was used as template for quantitative PCR amplification with a pair of primers specific for Zp.

Thus, we conclude that the ZV element of Zp is a functional ZEB1-binding site.

We show that a 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZV element can have dramatic effects on the EBV life cycle. While this particular ZV mutant established latency in epithelial 293 cells at a frequency similar to WT EBV, it was defective in maintaining this latency. All three of the ZV mutant-infected cell lines we examined in detail spontaneously synthesized Zta mRNA and protein at levels sufficient to reactivate the virus into its lytic cycle, with synthesis of Rta, early proteins including BMRF1, late proteins including gp350, linear viral genomes, and infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g004">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Strikingly, the ZV mutant-infected cell lines were also more susceptible to induction by either (i) over-expression of Rta, or (ii) treatment with TPA and sodium butyrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t002">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Quite likely, the phenotype of the ZEB1-binding site mutant would have been even more dramatic if the ZV element mutation had been combined with a ZV' element mutation to further reduce or completely eliminate ZEB1 binding to Zp. Furthermore, preliminary data indicate that the ZV mutant virus is at least an order-of-magnitude defective relative to WT EBV in establishing colonies of proliferating lymphocytic cells following infection of primary human B cells (Yu and Mertz, unpublished data). Thus, we conclude that the ZV element is a key component of Zp, playing a central role in regulating the switch in the EBV life cycle between latency and lytic replication.</p><p>We have recently published in collaboration with the Kenney laboratory that exogenous addition of ZEB1 represses Zp activity from both a Zp reporter plasmid and whole EBV genomes in gastric carcinoma ZEB1-negative AGS cells that are normally highly lytic for EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b038">38</xref>].

In addition, for efficient reactivation of EBV from latency into lytic replication, positive transcriptional regulatory factors (e.g<italic>.</italic>, ZII-binding proteins such as ATFs, CREBs, and AP-1) are required as well. Thus, while ZEB1 binding to Zp plays a central role in regulating EBV's switch between latency and lytic replication, it functions in coordination with other cellular regulators of Zp to determine whether the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene is expressed in a specific cell type under specific growth conditions. Consistent with this conclusion, we have recently published in collaboration with the Kenney laboratory data that indicate the following: (i) ZEB1 levels range from very high to moderate to absent among a variety of epithelial and B-cell types that are physiologically relevant to EBV; (ii) The correlation between ZEB1 abundance and whether infection by EBV is latent or lytic is fairly good, but far from perfect; and (iii) The abundance of activated c-Jun also contributes to how a cell responds to EBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b038">38</xref>]. In addition, loss of Zp repression via ZEB1 binding to the ZV/ZV' elements might also occur via changes in ZEB1 interactions with cellular co-regulators leading to ZEB1, itself, switching from a repressor binding CtBPs to an activator binding Smads, p300, and other co-activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b039">39</xref>].</p><p>Sodium butyrate inhibits the activity of histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs), leading to acetylation of histone proteins and, subsequently, promoters becoming more accessible to transcriptional activators and the cellular transcription machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b040">40</xref>]. TPA is a multi-functional inducer. It activates the cellular protein kinase C pathway in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b041">41</xref>], inducing phosphorylation of Zta protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b042">42</xref>] which can then activate Rp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b043">43</xref>] leading to synthesis of Rta protein and subsequent activation of Zp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b044">44</xref>]. Nevertheless, treatment of WT-infected 293 cell lines with TPA plus sodium butyrate fails to induce reactivation of EBV (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, identical treatment of the ZVmt-infected 293 cell lines led to a 10-fold increase in virus production above that observed spontaneously (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, high-affinity binding of ZEB1 to the ZV/ZV' elements of Zp directly over the transcription initiation site is sufficient to maintain repression of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression in 293 cells even when inducers make Zp much more accessible to its positive regulators. With the 2-bp mutation in the ZV element studied here partially alleviating binding of ZEB1 to Zp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the addition of these inducers increased the probability that transcription from Zp would reach the threshold level at which Zta protein was produced in sufficient quantity to irreversibly activate transcription from Zp and Rp, leading to full-blown reactivation with lytic replication.</p><p>Binding of ZEB1 to Zp was also found to be important in B cells. Zp expression was tightly repressed and not inducible by either TPA or sodium butyrate in the WT-infected B-lymphocytic BJAB cells. Only treatment of the WT-infected BJAB cells with both inducers in combination led to significant accumulation of Zta mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). On the other hand, Zp was spontaneously expressed in the ZV mutant-infected BJAB cells. Moreover, either TPA or sodium butyrate was sufficient to further activate Zp expression, with significant accumulation of Rta as well as Zta mRNA, presumably due to Zta protein activating Rp expression. Unfortunately, since BJAB cells do not support EBV late gene expression and viral DNA replication, up-regulation of Zp and Rp in the mutant-infected BJAB cells did not lead to production of infectious virus. Nevertheless, our recent preliminary finding that the ZV mutant virus is at least an order-of-magnitude defective relative to the parental WT EBV in establishing colonies of proliferating lymphocytic cells following infection of primary human B cells (Yu and Mertz, unpublished data) provides strong evidence that ZEB1 binding to the ZV element of Zp is, indeed, important for establishing a stable latent infection in B cells as well as epithelial cells.</p><p>We found that the ZV mutant exhibited only a 2- to 3-fold reduction in ZEB1 binding to Zp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g006">Figure 6</xref>), yet a 20-fold or more increase in accumulation of Zta mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g005">5</xref>). These two sets of data are quite compatible given the fact that a small initial increase in expression of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene in the context of cells infected with whole EBV genomes can lead to a large change in expression because Zta protein activates expression of the <italic>BRLF1</italic> gene, with the Rta protein then up-regulating <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression to high levels. These findings also provide an explanation for why we chronically observe a small percentage of the ZVmt-infected 293 cells to have spontaneously reactivated into full-blown EBV lytic replication while most of the cells in the population still score as Zta-negative in our IFS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030194-g003">Figure 3</xref>), i.e<italic>.</italic>, once a cell manages to synthesize Zta mRNA and protein above a critical threshold level, it irreversibly switches into the lytic cycle. On the other hand, transcription of Zp remains tightly repressed in the WT-infected 293 cells, with infectious virus never produced without exogenous addition of Zta or Rta (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030194-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Amon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b045">45</xref>] noted little difference by immunoblot analysis between wild-type and the 2-bp ZV mutant of Zp studied here in <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression before versus after anti-Ig induction in Akata cells. This seeming discrepancy with our results could be due to epigenetic (e.g., methylation status of Zp) or structural (e.g<italic>.</italic>, Zp's distance from <italic>OriP</italic>) differences between the p2089 bacmid used by us and the mini-EBV plasmid used in their study. Alternatively, their use of more sensitive assays (e.g., qRT-PCR, different method for extraction and detection of Zta protein) likely would have revealed that the ZV mutant actually did over-express Zp, leading to higher accumulation of Zta mRNA and protein at earlier times after anti-Ig induction, consistent with the large difference in Zp expression they had reported earlier between wild-type and the ZV mutant using a luciferase reporter assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b024">24</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we show that a mere 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZEB1-binding site in Zp in the context of a whole EBV genome can lead to expression of EBV IE, E, and L genes and production of infectious virus under conditions in which the B95.8 strain of WT EBV has never been observed to reactivate out of latency. Given this finding, we speculate that loss of ZEB1 binding to Zp as a repressor by (i) mutation of the ZV' as well as the ZV element of Zp, (ii) knock down of synthesis of ZEB1 in the host cell, or (iii) switching ZEB1 from a repressor to activator of transcription (e.g., via TGF-β signaling of Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b039">39</xref>]) could lead to efficient reactivation into lytic EBV replication in latently infected cells, especially if combined with loss as well of other repressors of <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression (e.g<italic>.</italic>, MEF2D, the ZIIR element-binding protein) and activation of transcriptional activators (e.g<italic>.</italic>, c-Jun). Thus, ZEB1 is a novel candidate target for lytic-induction therapies for some EBV-associated malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030194-b046">46</xref>]. In addition, an EBV strain containing mutations in the ZV/ZV' elements in combination with a mutation in another negative regulatory element of Zp (e.g<italic>.</italic>, ZIIR) may provide the basis for development of a constitutively lytic strain of EBV that could serve as a vaccine for immunization against EBV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and plasmids.</title><p>293, a human embryonic kidney cell line, was obtained from W.
