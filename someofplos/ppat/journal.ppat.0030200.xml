Here, we performed a mutation-based functional analysis of TRIM5α-mediated MLV restriction. Our results reveal that changes at tyrosine<sup>336</sup> of human TRIM5α, within the variable region 1 of its C-terminal PRYSPRY domain, can expand its activity to B-MLV and to the NB-tropic Moloney MLV. Conversely, we demonstrate that the escape of MLV from restriction by wild-type or mutant forms of huTRIM5α can be achieved through interdependent changes at positions 82, 109, 110, and 117 of the viral capsid. Together, our results support a model in which TRIM5α-mediated retroviral restriction results from the direct binding of the antiviral PRYSPRY domain to the viral capsid, and can be prevented by interferences exerted by critical residues on either one of these two partners.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Mammalian cells are endowed with intrinsic lines of defence against retroviruses, which notably contribute to limiting the cross-species transmission of these pathogens. TRIM5α is one such restriction factor, which acts by recognizing the capsid of incoming retroviruses through its C-terminal PRYSPRY domain. Human TRIM5α potently blocks the so-called N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MLV), but is ineffective against the closely related B-tropic and Moloney strains. In this study, we demonstrate that substitution of a single amino acid in the PRYSPRY domain of this protein expands its antiviral activity to these other MLV strains. Conversely, we show that protection of MLV from this restriction is governed by the negative influence of specific residues at a few critical positions of the retroviral capsid.

Correspondingly, a variety of host-encoded activities limit this process, behaving as the arms of a line of defence commonly called intrinsic immunity, which notably contributes to restricting the cross-species transmission of retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b001">1</xref>].</p><p>The product of the Friend virus susceptibility 1 (<italic>Fv1</italic>) gene, which shares similarity with the <italic>gag</italic> region of an endogenous retrovirus, conditions the susceptibility of various mouse strains to murine leukemia virus (MLV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b003">3</xref>]. N-tropic and B-tropic MLV strains replicate in Swiss/NIH and in Balb/c mice, respectively, reflecting the presence of either the <italic>n</italic> or the <italic>b</italic> allele of <italic>Fv1</italic> in the genome of these animals. A critical determinant of the differential sensitivity of MLV strains to Fv1 lies in amino acid 110 of the viral capsid (CA), which is an arginine in the prototypic N-tropic MLV and a glutamate in its B-tropic counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b005">5</xref>]. Moloney MLV (Mo-MLV) harbors an alanine at this position and escapes both Fv1<sup>n</sup> and Fv1<sup>b</sup>, hence is termed NB-tropic.</p><p>N-MLV is restricted too in some non-murine mammalian cells, including of human origin, which do not encode Fv1. Blockade is in these cases mediated by TRIM5α, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b010">10</xref>]. TRIM5α also prevents the cross-species transmission of primate lentiviruses. The orthologues present in Old World monkeys, including macaque rhesus, restrict human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and N-MLV, while those from New World monkeys, tend to restrict simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIV<sub>mac</sub>) and for some species N-MLV but not HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b013">13</xref>]. Human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α) blocks N-MLV, but is only weakly active against SIV<sub>mac</sub> and HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>All TRIM proteins contain a RING, a B-Box and a coiled-coil region, which together constitute the so-called RBCC domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b016">16</xref>]. TRIM5α further harbors at its C-terminus the PRYSPRY or B30.2 domain, responsible for the viral capsid-specific capture of restricted viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b019">19</xref>]. Sequence alignments of the PRYSPRY domains of various primate TRIM5α and other related TRIM proteins reveal 4 variable regions (V1, V2, V3 and V4), predicted to constitute surface-exposed loops based on the structure of the homologous domain of related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b023">23</xref>]. While V1, V2 and V3 were all found to contribute to the antiviral specificity of TRIM5α orthologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b011">11</xref>], V1 was shown to play a most critical role in this process. Within this loop, removing a positive charge at position 332 or substituting residues 335 to 340 by an eight amino acid rhesus sequence confers huTRIM5α with the ability to restrict HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b025">25</xref>]. Conversely, introducing residues 335–340 of huTRIM5α at the corresponding locus of rhesus monkey TRIM5α (rhTRIM5α) enhances the N-MLV blocking activity of the simian protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>The present study was designed to define further how TRIM5α recognizes retroviral capsids. Our results indicate that, if huTRIM5α efficiently restricts only N-MLV and not B-MLV or Mo-MLV, this is due to the negative influence of a key residue in V1. Conversely, MLV is capable of avoiding restriction via the interdependent influences of a cluster of amino acids exposed at the surface of its capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Single Amino Acid Substitution in huTRIM5α PRYSPRY Domain Extends Its Activity to B- and Mo-MLV</title><p>In order to characterize the interaction between huTRIM5α and its viral targets, we introduced amino acid changes in the central V1 region of its PRYSPRY domain.

Several reports have demonstrated that N-MLV blockade by huTRIM5α occurs at an early post-entry stage, before reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b027">27</xref>]. In contrast, the only restriction activity so far identified against B-MLV is mediated by Fv1<sup>n</sup>, which allows viral DNA synthesis to proceed but inhibits viral nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b029">29</xref>]. We thus infected MDTF cell lines expressing either wild-type or Y<sup>336</sup>A huTRIM5α, or control cells, with equal doses of N-, B- or Mo-MLV vectors and monitored the accumulation of reverse transcription products by PCR, using primers that amplified elongated minus-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). All three vectors yielded readily detectable reverse transcripts in control cells at 6 hours post-infection. Consistent with previous studies, N-MLV DNA levels were significantly reduced in the presence of wild-type huTRIM5α, whereas B-MLV escaped this effect. In contrast, both N- and B-MLV exhibited strikingly reduced amounts of reverse transcripts in cells expressing huTRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub>. With Mo-MLV, a slight decrease in viral DNA was noted in cells expressing this mutant at 8 hours post-infection, compared with control or wild-type huTRIM5α-expressing cells. This inhibition was more obvious when the analysis was repeated at 5 days post-infection, that is, upon scoring the ultimate proviral load of the cells, which correlated with the results of the FACS analyses performed at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g002">2</xref>C).

N-MLV restriction was unaffected by any of these changes. In contrast, variable degrees of B-MLV restriction were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Introduction of other small amino acids besides alanine (threonine, serine, cysteine and, to a lesser extent, proline), or removal of tyrosine<sup>336</sup>, also conferred a gain-of-function phenotype to huTRIM5α. One mutant, huTRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>K</sub>, even acquired the ability to block Mo-MLV with a good efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This did not simply reflect the presence of a positive charge at this position, because the Y<sup>336</sup>R mutation rendered huTRIM5α only weakly active against B-MLV and even less so against Mo-MLV, even though it might be due to its poor expression level. Notably, replacing tyrosine<sup>336</sup> with glutamate or phenylalanine did not broaden huTRIM5α restriction beyond N-MLV.

We thus asked whether a molecule carrying changes at both positions 332 and 336 restricts not only N- and B-MLV, but also HIV-1. For this, we generated MDTF cell lines expressing a series of huTRIM5α double mutants, using various combinations of substitutions and deletions previously noted as broadening the spectrum of activity of the protein towards either B-MLV (this work) or HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

These data confirmed that TRIM5α can be altered to act in a CA110-independent manner. However, in the context of Mo-MLV, this capsid residue plays a pivotal role. Mo-MLV could indeed escape all forms of TRIM5α-mediated blockade when alanine<sup>110</sup> of its capsid was changed to glutamate. Inversely, when arginine was introduced instead, Mo-MLV restriction by huTRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>K</sub> and huTRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub> was strengthened, and the virus became slightly sensitive to wild-type TRIM5α, as recently noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b033">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><fig id="ppat-0030200-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030200.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Context-Specific Influence of MLV Capsid Residue 110</title><p>MDTF cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant versions of huTRIM5α, or containing a control vector, were challenged with N-, B- or Mo-MLV-derived vectors packaged with wild-type or CA110-mutated capsids, as indicated.

The present study, which demonstrates that the consequences of mutations in the huTRIM5α PRYSPRY V1 can be counterbalanced by changes in the MLV capsid, and vice versa, lends strong credence to such a model.</p><p>This work stands out by its identification of a residue, tyrosine<sup>336</sup> of huTRIM5α, which limits the spectrum of MLV targets of this antiviral to the sole N-tropic MLV. A number of amino acid substitutions at this position, as well as a deletion of this residue, confer huTRIM5α with the additional ability to block B-MLV, and introduction of a lysine even expands restriction to Mo-MLV. Understanding fully the mechanism of this gain of function would require a determination of the tri-dimensional structure of the TRIM5α-capsid complex. In its absence, the crystal structures of the PRYSPRY domain of related proteins, PRYSPRY-19q13.4.1, GUSTAVUS and TRIM21, suggests that the V1 region of huTRIM5α could form a protruding loop with tyrosine<sup>336</sup> situated underneath and in direct contact (at a less than 4 Å distance) with residues in the V2 loop, which could limit the conformational flexibility of V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b022">22</xref>]. However, the PRYSPRY V1 loops of TRIM5α and these other proteins differ in length, precluding firm analogy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b023">23</xref>]. Alternatively, tyrosine<sup>336</sup> may prevent the docking of V1 into its putative capsid-binding site by steric hindrance. This would be consistent with the finding that changes that most effectively broaden the spectrum of action of huTRIM5α are the removal of this tyrosine or its substitution by small amino acids. However, the observation that Y<sup>336</sup>K further expands the restriction spectrum of huTRIM5α not only to B- but also to Mo-MLV suggests that this model may be overly simplistic. Arginine<sup>332</sup> of huTRIM5α was similarly found to interfere with ability of huTRIM5α to restrict HIV-1 and SIV<sub>mac</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b030">30</xref>]. In this case too, distinct amino acid changes differentially affected the strength with which either one of these two viruses was inhibited, suggesting that both positive and negative influences are at play. As well, our failure to generate a TRIM5α variant capable of blocking both N- and B-MLV on the one hand and HIV-1 on the other hand, by combining mutations at positions 332 and 336, points to more complex influences within V1 itself. <italic>cis</italic>-acting interferences have also been noted in Fv1, where the C-terminal part of Fv1<sup>b</sup> was shown to prevent this factor from blocking B-MLV, and where substitution of lysine<sup>358</sup> of Fv1<sup>n</sup> by alanine could extend the restriction spectrum of this antiviral to N-MLV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b036">36</xref>].</p><p>On the viral capsid side, our study indicates that at least four positions (CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117) interdependently condition MLV susceptibility to huTRIM5α, whether in its wild-type or mutant forms. The influence of each of these four residues varies according to both the virus involved and the sequence of the TRIM5α PRYSPRY V1 region. Here, all viruses tested escaped wild-type huTRIM5α if they harbored a glutamic acid at position 110 of capsid. As such, E<sup>110</sup> dominantly interfere with restriction. However, a recent study demonstrated that wild-type huTRIM5α could efficiently block an MLV retroviral vector packaged with a capsid derived from a primate endogenous retrovirus (PtERV) carrying a glutamic acid at this position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b037">37</xref>]. As well, we found here that the protective effect of E<sup>110</sup> could be abrogated by substitutions of Y<sup>336</sup> in huTRIM5α, in which case CA82 and CA117 became determinant. Indeed, with N- and B-MLV-derived viruses, an aspartate at CA82 additionally allowed escape from TRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub>, and a histidine at CA117 from TRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub> and TRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>K</sub>. When CA110 was occupied by an arginine, the picture was completely reversed, as this residue dominantly potentiates susceptibility. Finally, with an alanine at CA110, H<sup>117</sup> and D<sup>82</sup> induced escape from wild-type TRIM5α, albeit in a CA109-dependent fashion, yet viruses remained sensitive to Y<sup>336</sup>-mutated forms of the restriction factor.</p><p>A picture is thus emerging from these data, whereby CA110 plays the role of primary determinant of restriction, with CA82, CA109 and CA117 acting as secondary modulators in a V1-conditioned fashion. However, the restriction pattern obtained with derivatives of Mo-MLV, which differs from the N- and B-MLV strains used here at nine CA positions besides these four, does not fully fit with this model, indicating its modulation by at least some of these other CA residues. Notably, a recent study demonstrated the importance of CA214 in potentiating Fv1<sup>n</sup>-mediated restriction of Mo-MLV only when CA110 was occupied by a glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b033">33</xref>].</p><p>MLV CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117 were also demonstrated to exert combinatorial influences on Fv1-mediated restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b035">35</xref>]. In spite of this parallel, sequences leading to resistance or susceptibility to Fv1 and huTRIM5α are not identical. For instance, whereas Fv1<sup>b</sup> and huTRIM5α both potently restrict CA<sub>E</sub>110<sub>A</sub> B-MLV, an additional N<sup>82</sup>D mutation allows escape from huTRIM5α (this work) but not from Fv1<sup>b</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b035">35</xref>]. Also, huTRIM5α<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub>-mediated blockade of B-MLV is relieved by change at CA117, which was previously shown not to affect restriction by Fv1<sup>n</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b035">35</xref>].</p><p>The structure of the amino-terminal part of the N-MLV capsid in its hexameric state was resolved at a 2.5 Å resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b038">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>). A monomer consists of two-stranded β-hairpins followed by six α helices. Interestingly, CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117 are situated at the edge of a cavity formed by helices 4 to 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>). CA82 sits between helix 4 and 5 at the top of this pocket, across from CA109 and 110 on helix 6. CA117 is further down along the helix 6 side of the cavity. At least two scenarios can thus be envisioned for the binding of huTRIM5α to the MLV capsid. First, it might rely on the sum of individual interactions between TRIM5α residues, for instance in the PRYSPRY V1 loop, and capsid amino acids including 82, 109, 110 and 117. The non-essential nature of any of these four capsid positions for susceptibility or resistance to TRIM5α argues against this model, even though it is conceivable that the abrogation of some of these interactions might be compensated by the strengthening of others. In a second scenario, the TRIM5α-binding site would be located deeper in the pocket. This part of the protein is constituted by residues that are highly conserved, hence most probably play essential structural functions prohibiting mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b038">38</xref>]. Escape could then be achieved by mounting obstacles to TRIM5α penetration into this pocket through changes at the more flexible yet critically placed CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117 residues. By analogy, it is interesting to note that the cyclophilin-binding loop of the HIV-1 capsid, which has been postulated to interfere with the blockade of this virus by wild-type huTRIM5α, hangs over a very similar pocket formed by helices 4 to 7 of the structurally homologous lentiviral capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b039">39</xref>]. As such, this loop, whether bound to or modified by cyclophilin A (CypA), could function as a lid to prevent huTRIM5α from accessing its HIV-1 CA binding site. However, recent data, which indicate that the positive effects of CypA binding to CA on HIV-1 replication do not depend upon the presence of huTRIM5α suggest that a strict parallel cannot be established between restriction of MLV and HIV by the cellular antiviral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b042">42</xref>].</p><fig id="ppat-0030200-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0030200.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Highlighting of Functionally Critical Positions on the Structure of the MLV Capsid</title><p>Visualization of the previously defined structure of the N-terminal domain of the N-MLV capsid in its hexameric state, each monomer being given a different color.
