Nevertheless, accurate animal models of chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> infection are lacking. Transgenic mice constitutively expressing IL-10 in macrophages were infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetti</named-content> by intraperitoneal and intratracheal routes and infection was analyzed through real-time PCR and antibody production. Transgenic mice exhibited sustained tissue infection and strong antibody response in contrast to wild-type mice; thus, bacterial persistence was IL-10-dependent as in chronic Q fever. The number of granulomas was low in spleen and liver of transgenic mice infected through the intraperitoneal route, as in patients with chronic Q fever.

In vivo results emphasized macrophage data. In spleen and liver of transgenic mice infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> by the intraperitoneal route, the expression of arginase-1 was increased while microbicidal pathway consisting of IL-12p40, IL-23p19, and inducible NO synthase was depressed. The overexpression of IL-10 in macrophages prevents anti-infectious competence of host, including the ability to mount granulomatous response and microbicidal pathway in tissues.

This microbicidal response is based on inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which control the expression of cytokines and chemokines and the production of toxic metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b001">1</xref>]. The suppression of the microbicidal response due to genetic disorders leads to reactivation or chronic evolution of infections and to bacterial persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b002">2</xref>]. In addition, immunosuppressive treatments and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β may also disarm microbicidal responses and contribute to chronic evolution of bacterial infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>IL-10 is known to increase host susceptibility to numerous intracellular microorganisms and is involved in the persistence of bacteria such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bartonella quintana</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b004">4</xref>]. <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates in macrophages (Mφ) and is responsible for Q fever. The disease is characterized by a symptomatic primary infection in a minority of individuals, which may become chronic as culture-negative endocarditis in patients with valvular damage and immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b005">5</xref>]. The diagnosis of chronic Q fever is based on the presence of high titers of anti-<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> antibodies, and bacteriological methods are of interest to study cardiac valve specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b006">6</xref>]. In chronic Q fever, IL-10 is overproduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b007">7</xref>], and in patients with acute Q fever and valvulopathy, the risk to develop Q fever endocarditis is related to IL-10 overproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b008">8</xref>]. IL-10 interferes with Mφ activation through the inhibition of transcription of inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b009">9</xref>] and enables Mφ to support <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b010">10</xref>].

In transgenic mice that overproduce IL-10 in the T-cell compartment, BCG clearance is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b012">12</xref>], but this model is inappropriate for studies of Q fever pathogenesis because multiple phenotypes complicate the analysis of Mφ-bacterium interaction. Similarly, infection of IL-10-deficient mice is uninformative for studies of chronic infections because <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetti</named-content>–infected humans do not lack IL-10. A more robust model is described here that applies transgenic mice with constitutive overexpression of IL-10 in Mφ lineage (macIL-10tg mice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b013">13</xref>]. We report an efficient mouse model for chronic Q fever pathogenesis, which associates high levels of specific antibodies, sustained tissue infection, and reduced granuloma formation, as in human Q fever.

In macIL-10tg mice, granulomas were detected in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) at day 7 post-infection. However, they were no longer found at day 14 post-infection, in sharp contrast with wt mice.

When bone marrow–derived Mφ (BMDMφ) were incubated with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> organisms at a bacterium-to-cell ratio of 100:1, the initial uptake of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> was significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.006) impaired in transgenic Mφ. After establishment of the infection, the number of bacterial DNA copies decreased in wt Mφ whereas it significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) increased in transgenic Mφ at day 3 post-infection. It remained significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003) higher in transgenic Mφ than in wt Mφ at day 6 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). This difference may be related to impaired bacterial uptake by transgenic Mφ. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> uptake (about 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> DNA copies) was rendered similar in wt and transgenic Mφ by using different infective doses of organisms (25:1 and 200:1 bacterium-to-cell ratios for wt and transgenic Mφ, respectively). While wt Mφ cleared <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> organisms, transgenic Mφ allowed a moderate and transient replication of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> (unpublished data). The inability of transgenic Mφ to clear <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> was not restricted to bone marrow–derived Mφ since wt peritoneal Mφ cleared <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> whereas those of macIL-10tg mice remained infected until 9 d post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). It is noteworthy that the defective uptake of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> by transgenic BMDMφ was corrected in peritoneal transgenic Mφ. Thus, IL-10 impaired microbicidal activity of Mφ in keeping with previous data using exogenous IL-10 stimulation of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content>–infected Mφ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b009">9</xref>]. We wondered if IFN-γ pre-treatment of transgenic BMDMφ restored their microbicidal competence. IFN-γ had no effect on bacterial uptake by Mφ from wt mice (unpublished data) or macIL-10tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

In wt Mφ, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> stimulated the expression of transcripts for iNOS, TNF, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, and CXCL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) but did not stimulate arginase-1, MR, Ym1/2, and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

In transgenic mice infected for 14 d, the splenic expression of transcripts for CXCL-1, CXCL-2, and CXCL-16 was decreased whereas that of CXCL-9, CCL-2, and CCL-5 was unaffected, as compared to infected wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g005">Figure 5</xref>E).

The transcriptional pattern of spleen and liver chemokines found after 7 d of infection (unpublished data) was similar to that observed after 14 d.

The transcriptional pattern of molecules involved in the microbicidal machinery and M1/M2 polarization was similar in uninfected wt and transgenic mice (unpublished data).

The expression of MR was also markedly increased in spleen. Ym1/2 and TGF-β mRNA were also increased, but to a lesser extent.

Inflammation was observed at days 7 and 14 post-infection in wt and transgenic mice. Inflammatory infiltrates were largely confined within the walls of the alveoli. Infiltrates were often organized as granulomatous interstitial inflammation and consisted mainly of macrophages with few lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040023-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Granulomas of variable diameter scattered throughout the interalveolar walls of the lung parenchyma. However, the size of lung granulomas was lower in wt mice than in transgenic mice. The bronchoalveolar air spaces were relatively free of cellular exsudates, but some are filled with rare alveolar macrophages. Neither necrosis of the lining alveolar epithelium nor suppuration was observed. These findings are consistent with a mixed interstitial and mild alveolar mononuclear cell pneumonia. Finally, we studied the pulmonary localization of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> at day 7 post-infection. Organisms were seen as granular immunopositive material in few alveolar macrophages (unpublished data).

Mice are usually used as animal model for acute Q fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b015">15</xref>]. Different animal models of chronic Q fever are based on dramatic immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b017">17</xref>], but the chronic evolution of Q fever is not associated with severe immunosuppression but it requires IL-10 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b008">8</xref>]. In fact, an appropriate mouse model for the study of chronic Q fever is lacking. We wondered if the constitutive overexpression of IL-10 in the myeloid compartment from genetically modified mice would reproduce aspects of the human disease. When <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> was injected by the intraperitoneal route, organisms were rapidly cleared in wt mice while macIL-10tg mice maintained bacterial loads for at least 42 d. The sustained presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> in tissues was associated with high circulating levels of specific IgG as in Q fever endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b005">5</xref>]. The anti-<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> IgG2a were prominent in macIL-10tg mice (unpublished data), which is consistent with increased levels of IgG1 and IgG3 in human Q fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b018">18</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> persistence is also consistent with the role of IL-10 in latent tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b019">19</xref>].</p><p>As humans are most commonly infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> through inhalation of parturient secretions from infected animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b006">6</xref>], wt and transgenic mice were infected by the intratracheal route. The constitutive overexpression of IL-10 dramatically increased lung infection. The pulmonary lesions consisting of mixed interstitial and mild alveolar mononuclear cell pneumonia were previously published in a model of aerosol infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b020">20</xref>]; they were more pronounced in macIL-10tg mice than in wt mice. These results combined with a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b020">20</xref>] emphasized the role of the route of inoculation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> infection in mice as well as in humans.</p><p>The second important feature of chronic Q fever is the lack of granulomas that are replaced by mononuclear cell infiltrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b006">6</xref>]. In macIL-10tg mice, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> infection was associated with decreased formation of liver and splenic granulomas without alteration of their organization. This finding was specific since granuloma formation was normal in BCG-infected macIL-10tg mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b013">13</xref>]. The mechanism of defective microbicidal response to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> manifested as bacterial persistence and defective granuloma formation may involve innate and/or adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b021">21</xref>]. Specifically, the immune response in granulomas may be affected by defective recruitment of immune effectors and/or polarization of protective immune response toward non-microbicidal immune response. First, we recently reported that transendothelial migration of mononuclear cells is impaired in chronic Q fever; this deficiency is corrected when IL-10 is neutralized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b022">22</xref>]. However, we found that the transmigration of murine mononuclear cells was similar in wt and macIL-10tg mice (unpublished data). Second, we hypothesized that IL-10 overexpression may impair trafficking of immune cells, thus preventing cell recruitment in granulomas: it was not the case. The percentage of T cells, B cells, Mφ, and DC was similar in spleen and liver from uninfected wt and macIL-10tg mice, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b013">13</xref>]; only the percentage of NK cells was increased in the spleen of transgenic mice, which is consistent with the ability of IL-10 to stimulate NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b023">23</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> infection decreased the proportion of DC in transgenic mice. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> is known to impair in vitro activation and maturation of DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b024">24</xref>], but it seems unlikely that DC impairment is sufficient to prevent splenomegaly and granuloma formation in spleen and liver. These findings suggest that the recruitment of immune effectors was not significantly impaired in mice constitutively overexpressing IL-10. Rather, they suggest the recruitment of non-microbicidal immune cells into tissues, which may account for defective killing of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> and granuloma formation. This is supported by our in vitro findings with Mφ. Mφ from macIL-10tg mice allowed <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> replication whereas <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> was killed by wt Mφ. Impaired microbicidal competence was not corrected by IFN-γ. This finding may be critical to understand bacteria persistence in mice and humans despite an apparent efficient immune response. As microbicidal activity of Mφ is associated with transcriptional pattern of classical activation by cytokines and microbial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b025">25</xref>], we studied the transcriptional pattern of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content>-stimulated Mφ. While wt Mφ exhibited a classical inflammatory transcriptional pattern, Mφ from macIL-10tg mice exhibited a non-microbicidal pattern in which iNOS and inflammatory cytokines were not induced and arginase-1 and TGF-β were stimulated. The differential expression of arginase-1 and iNOS mRNA may correlate with the ability of Mφ to control <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> replication since previous reports have shown increased susceptibility of iNOS-deficient mice toward <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b026">26</xref>]. Similarly, the gradual decrease in iNOS expression is correlated with the transition from latent tuberculosis to progressive pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b027">27</xref>]. Hence, the balance between iNOS and arginase-1 may be essential to regulate inflammation and microbicidal response to infectious agression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b028">28</xref>]. The responses of host tissues to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> infection may also reflect Mφ polarization toward type 2 immune response. Indeed, the expression of CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CXCL16, and CCL-2 was reduced in liver from macIL-10tg mice, and it is established that CXCL-1, CXCL-2, and CCL-2 are regulated by IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b029">29</xref>]. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content>–infected transgenic mice, the expression of arginase-1, MR, Ym1/2, and TGF-β was increased in spleen, and to a lesser extent, in liver, whereas the expression of iNOS, IL-12, and IL-23 was down-modulated. The combination of high expression levels of arginase-1 and Ym-1 and low levels of iNOS in tissues is consistent with M-2 type phenotype described in Mφ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040023-b030">30</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, IL-10 was essential for sustained <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. burnetii</named-content> burden in tissues, high levels of Abs, and impaired granuloma formation, three characteristics of chronic Q fever. IL-10 affected tissue inflammatory gene expression and Mφ polarization and may contribute to defective granuloma formation.
