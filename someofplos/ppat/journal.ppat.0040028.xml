Chronic Meth abuse may be particularly devastating in individuals who engage in unprotected sex with multiple partners because it is associated with a 2-fold higher risk for obtaining HIV and associated secondary infections. We report the first specific evidence that Meth at pharmacological concentrations exerts a direct immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cells and macrophages. As a weak base, Meth collapses the pH gradient across acidic organelles, including lysosomes and associated autophagic organelles. This in turn inhibits receptor-mediated phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles, MHC class II antigen processing by the endosomal–lysosomal pathway, and antigen presentation to splenic T cells by dendritic cells. More importantly Meth facilitates intracellular replication and inhibits intracellular killing of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans,</italic> two major AIDS-related pathogens. Meth exerts previously unreported direct immunosuppressive effects that contribute to increased risk of infection and exacerbate AIDS pathology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>There is a new population of HIV+ men who are developing AIDS over months instead of years as typical. It has recently become popular among gay and bisexual men to consume very high levels of Meth. Unsafe sex together with Meth abuse has been suspected to lead to rapid disease progression. While studies show exacerbated AIDS symptoms and disease progression in HIV+ Meth abusers, the molecular mechanism is yet unknown. It was postulated, yet unproven, that the rapid disease progression might be due to a mutant “superstrain” of HIV that was extremely virulent. It was also assumed that the effects of the drug on behavior may lead to unsafe sex, although this would not explain the more rapid time course of the disease. We now demonstrate the first direct evidence that Meth is an immunosuppressive agent, and that the molecular mechanism of this immunosuppression is due to the collapse of acidic organelle pH in cells of the immune system, inhibiting the functions of antigen presentation, as well as phagocytosis. These effects compromise the immune response to opportunistic infections and HIV. These findings could have a major impact on public health, as there are over 35 million Meth abusers worldwide</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (DS), the Einstein/Montefiore Medical Center for AIDS Research (LS), National Institutes of Health (LS) and Irene Diamond Professorships in Immunology (LS).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Tallóczy Z, Martinez J, Joset D, Ray Y, Gácser A, et al.

Meth exacerbates AIDS pathology, including cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b006">6</xref>], and is strongly suspected to inhibit normal immunological response to secondary infections such as hepatitis C, which is prevalent in those who smoke or take Meth intranasally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b007">7</xref>]. It has recently been suggested that Meth could contribute to a particularly rapid progression of AIDS in individuals exposed to a strain of HIV that is resistant to drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b009">9</xref>]. Indeed, animal studies clearly demonstrate that Meth suppresses both innate and adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b011">11</xref>], enhances cytokine production in combination with HIV TAT protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b012">12</xref>], and alters gene expression in cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b013">13</xref>]. However, the molecular basis for Meth's immune suppression is unknown. Here we have examined the relationship between Meth and the impairment of specific immune cell functions.</p><p>In the clinical setting, Meth abusing individuals who present with opportunistic infections possess high blood and tissue levels of the drug. Meth is generally self-administered in this population in binges of 3–4 grams ingested over a six day interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b014">14</xref>], with an initial ingestion of ∼0.5 gram (Judith Rabkin, Columbia University, personal communication) and a total mean level of 2.2 grams ingested during the first day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b015">15</xref>]. Such high levels of administration result in a blood concentration of ∼10–50 μM Meth, and levels in the hundreds of micromolar range in organs including brain and the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b016">16</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).</p><p>Pathogens are processed and displayed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) for T cell recognition. Antigen presentation in tissue resident macrophages, as well as dendritic cells, involves fluid phase or receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by fusion of the phagosome with specialized lysosomes known as MHC class II compartments (MIIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b017">17</xref>]. The foreign antigens are partially degraded by lysosomal hydrolases and the resulting peptides are loaded on MHC class II molecules and transported to the cell membrane to be presented to T cells. Both pathogen transport to the MIIC and its degradation into immunogenic peptides are functions that require an acidic endosomal pH. Endogenous antigens and viruses can be delivered to the MIIC upon autophagosome fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b018">18</xref>]. Autophagy also mediates single-stranded RNA virus detection and consequent interferon-α release in plasmacytoid dendritic cells activating anti-viral cellular defense mechanisms in uninfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b019">19</xref>]. Further evidence shows the direct role of autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation in elimination of intracellular HSV-1 viral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b020">20</xref>] and that the HSV-1 has alternative methods to counteract cellular autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have identified a novel molecular mechanism that explains the immunosuppressive effects of Meth via the alkalization of acidic organelles in dendritic cells and macrophages that are critical for the immunological function of these APCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Estimates of Pharmacological Meth Levels in Humans</title><p>To model effects of Meth on the immune system, we estimated Meth levels in drug abusers. Meth is self-administered intravenously, by nasal inhalation, anally, and orally, in typical doses of 250–500 mg by occasional users to levels as high as 1 g by chronic abusers (personal communication, Perry N. Halkitis, New York University). Meth blood levels measured in individuals detained by police in California were 2.0 μM on average but as high as 11.1 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b022">22</xref>]. Controlled studies indicate that a single 260 mg dose reaches a level of 7.5 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b022">22</xref>]. Thus, a single dose of 260 mg – 1 g would be expected to produce 7.5 – 28.8 μM blood Meth levels.</p><p>The abusers however tend to self-administer METH in binges, and as the drug exhibits a half-life of 11.4 - 12 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b024">24</xref>], this leads to higher levels. Recently published studies modeling binge pattern of use in individuals show that after the fourth administration of 260 mg during a single day produces maximum blood levels of 17 μM, reaching 20 μM on the second day of such a binge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b022">22</xref>]. Thus, binge doses of 260 mg – 1 g would produce 17 - 80 μM blood Meth levels. The estimates appear consistent with blood levels detected after fatalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b027">27</xref>], ranging as high as 84 μM for an individual for whom Meth intoxication was determined as the cause of death ∼16 hours after ingestion.</p><p>It is also important to estimate how Meth is distributed from blood to other tissues involved in immune response, particularly the spleen, which houses high numbers of dendritic cells. Tissue-to-serum Meth ratios in rat are: brain, 9.7; kidney, 35.3; spleen, 14.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b016">16</xref>]. Thus, relevant levels in spleen, the organ critical for immune response, after administration of 250 mg – 1 g as a single dose is 100 – 400 μM, and during binges between 240 – 1144 μM.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Meth Induces Rapid Alkalization of Acidic Organelles and Changes in Endosomal Morphology</title><p>Dendritic cell MIIC processing organelles are characterized by acidic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b028">28</xref>], a limiting membrane enclosing internal vesicles or lamellae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b017">17</xref>], the presence of proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b029">29</xref>], internal expression of LAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b030">30</xref>] and MHC II proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b031">31</xref>]. The morphological and functional integrity of the MIIC depends on the maintenance of an acidic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b032">32</xref>] due to the action of the V-ATPase, which may also regulate transport from early to late endosomes and lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b033">33</xref>]. Meth and its metabolite, amphetamine, are membranophilic weak bases that collapse intracellular organelle pH gradients in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b035">35</xref>]. We therefore tested whether Meth collapsed intracellular organelle pH gradients in dendritic cells by monitoring quenching of acridine orange, a weak base vital dye that accumulates in acidic organelles including endosomes and lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b035">35</xref>]. We found that Meth concentrations of 50 μM or higher rapidly collapsed acidic organelle pH gradients in dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040028-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040028-g001">1</xref>B). LysoSensor Yellow/Blue ratiometry is a generally accepted method to measure organellar pH in live cells, and was used to measure average pH in acidic organelles using LysoSensor Yellow/Blue fluorescent dye. After 10 min treatment with Meth (50 or 100 μM) or chloroquine (10 μM) acidic organellar pH was elevated (pH 6.5, 6.9 and 6.4 respectively) significantly above the levels in untreated control cells (pH 4.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040028-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As predicted with alkalizing agents, Meth also disrupted MIIC structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b036">36</xref>], producing large organelles (&gt; 1 μm diameter) devoid of internal vesicles (right panels) with LAMP-1 and MHC II staining confined to the limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040028-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040028-g001">1</xref>E).

These actions result in Meth's inhibition of antigen presentation and phagocytosis. Maintenance of low endosomal and lysosomal pH serves many functions, including regulation of protein degradation, pathogen inactivation, and regulation of the amount of several surface receptors. All of these functions require active transport via the endocytic pathway and fusion with lysosomal compartments.</p><p>First, via alkalization, METH-inhibited lysosomal-autophagosomal degradative function for both exogenously and endogenously internalized antigens resulting in accumulation of proteins entering the endocytic pathway through phagocytosis, as well as autophagic vacuoles. Chaperone-mediated autophagy and macroautophagy in lysosomes have been described as major pathways for endogenous antigen processing in MHC class II compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b048">48</xref>] and as a means to directly degrade intracellular virus particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b021">21</xref>]. Thus, through its alkalizing effect, Meth blocks normal antigen processing and presentation. Progression of internalized antigens along the endocytic pathway rely on the progressive maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes and ultimately to lysosomes. Maintenance of an acidic internal pH and a pH gradient in these compartments is important for the cargo progression. Endosomal acidification is accomplished by H<sup>+</sup> transport across the endosomal limiting membrane by the proton pump vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase). The recent discovery that V-ATPase interacts with components of the endocytic transport machinery indicates that V-ATPase is also a pH sensor that regulates early to late endosomal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b033">33</xref>]. This would explain why endosomal alkalization by Meth not only disrupts antigen processing but phagocytosis and cargo progression along the endosomal pathway.</p><p>Second, endosomal alkalization by Meth inhibited <italic>Ca</italic> and <italic>Cn</italic> phagocytosis and killing by macrophages. These effects are expected to be particularly devastating in AIDS-related disorders, since <italic>Ca</italic> and <italic>Cn</italic> are the two most commonly isolated fungi from sterile body fluids obtained from HIV infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b044">44</xref>]. Also, these results could explain recent reports of rapid insurgence of AIDS in Meth-addicted individuals soon after infection with HIV. Thus, Meth also blocks pathogen killing by macrophages. Exposure to Clq and other weak bases was already been shown to inhibit growth of Cn in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b050">50</xref>] even though Clq has no direct toxicity to Cn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b050">50</xref>]. Not all basic compounds are equivalent in their fungicidal activity; for example, ammonium chloride also enhances the anti-cryptococcal activity of macrophages, yet the potency of ammonium chloride is less than that of Clq, which may be a result of the ability of ammonium chloride to inhibit phagolysosomal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b051">51</xref>]. Hence, Meth apparently has complex effects on macrophages that result in an intracellular milieu that enables the replication of the examined pathogenic fungi.</p><p>Third, even though an increase in p24 secretion has been observed in Meth-treated dendritic cells and macrophages, a direct effect of Meth on HIV viral load could not be demonstrated. It is likely that viral proteins enter late endosomal and lysosomal compartments independently of viral assembly, and due to inhibition of processing, more viral proteins are secreted in the extracellular milieu. Within the infected macrophages, HIV has been previously shown to assemble in compartments with characteristics of multivesicular late endosomes (CD63, Lamp-1, CD81 and CD82 positive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b052">52</xref>]. It now appears that the HIV particles present in multivesicular endosomes are the results of endocytosis, and the site of viral assembly is at the invagination of the plasma membrane particularly enriched in tetraspannin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b053">53</xref>]. These results would explain why, by compromising endosomal pH, an increase in HIV viral load has not been observed.</p><p>In conclusion, the immunosuppressive effects of Meth are consistent with reports that Meth-treated mice demonstrate decreased immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b011">11</xref>]. To be noted is that even though there is a linear concentration-dependent response between Meth concentration and pH disruption such an effect is less evident at the biological level. In all assays (antigen processing, Ca or Cn killing and p24 production) different Meth dosages behave very similarly. Likely a small disruption in the endosomal pH is sufficient to alter the microenvironment and endosomal-related functions. This is consistent with the effects of low concentrations of Meth tested on lysosomal pH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040028-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, with alkalinization of &gt; 1 pH unit, which would effectively inhibit lysosomal protease activity.</p><p>The collapse of endosomal pH by Meth and the resulting decrease of normal immune response provide an explanation for the compromised immunity and exacerbate infections occurring in Meth abusers. In fact, Meth is strongly suspected to more dramatically inhibit normal immune responses than other drugs of abuse since Meth users often present with skin lesion and “Meth mouth”, a devastating periodontal disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drugfree.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.drugfree.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b054">54</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b002">2</xref>]. A similar immunosuppressive activity has also been shown for chloroquine, also a well known inhibitor of endosomal acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b036">36</xref>].</p><p>In particular, Meth immunosuppression may underlie the mechanism of the recently reported extremely rapid development of immune deficiency, with devastating effects in AIDS-related disorders in Meth abusers that had contracted HIV. In particular, there is evidence suggesting the presence of a new population of HIV<sup>+</sup> positive men who are developing AIDS over months rather than over 10 or more years as is typical. The most widely reported individual was documented by Dr. Martin Markowitz of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York in 2004. In this individual, a gay man who was also a Methabuser tested HIV negative in May, 2003, then likely contracted HIV during unprotected sex in mid-October 2004, displayed acute retroviral syndrome in November, 2004 and 3-drug-class-resistant HIV-1 (3DCR HIV) with apparently rapid progression to AIDS by December, 2004 (CDC, MMWR July 28, 2006/55(29);793–796). Meth self-administration by HIV+ individuals during the acquisition of sexually transmitted pathogens appears likely to interfere with immunological resistance and lead to AIDS progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Additional detailed methods used in this paper can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0040028-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Primary cell culture.</title><p>Mouse femur hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow were harvested from the hind legs of 8 to 12-week old male wild-type C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) or GFP-LC3 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040028-b039">39</xref>], and plated at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml density in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x non-essential amino acids (Gibco, Carlsbad, California), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 20 mM HEPES.
