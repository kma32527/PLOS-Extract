These cells are present at high frequencies, respond to Mtb-infected cells by producing IFN-γ directly ex vivo, and display characteristics of effector memory T cells. This novel innate population of Mtb-reactive T cells will drive further investigation into the role of these cells in the containment of Mtb following infectious exposure.

Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is responsible for 2–3 million deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b001">1</xref>]. Household contact studies show that over 50% of exposed individuals never develop a positive tuberculin skin test (TST), and are considered uninfected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b002">2</xref>]. However, in those who have been detectably infected with Mtb, as assessed by a positive TST, the lifetime risk of tuberculosis is estimated at 5% to 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b003">3</xref>]. In the remaining 90% of TST-positive individuals, protection is associated with the development of an effective adaptive immune response. Specifically, Th1-like cytokines, including IFN-γ, produced by CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and TNF-α , produced by T cells and macrophages, are essential in the control of tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>The priming of Mtb-specific naïve T cells requires that dendritic cells (DC), either infected with Mtb or having engulfed Mtb-derived antigens, migrate to the lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b006">6</xref>]. There, to optimally prime pathogen-specific Th1 responses, DC require stimulation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b007">7</xref>] by the pathogen as well as host-derived factors such as type I and type II IFNs, cytokines, and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b008">8</xref>].</p><p>Mtb-dependent TLR2 ligation can promote the maturation of DC via upregulation of costimulatory molecules and the production of IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b010">10</xref>]. However, in comparison to potent LPS activation associated with TLR-4 ligation, Mtb induces relatively low levels of IL-12 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b012">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, IL-12 production by DC is essential to prime optimal Th1 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b015">15</xref>]. IFN-γ, the prototypical Th1 cytokine, can directly augment the IL-12 production. In addition to NK cells, MHC Ib-restricted T cells are able to provide an early source of IFN-γ for enhanced IL-12 production by DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b015">15</xref>]. One example of these innate T cells comes from the study of the non-classical MHC-Ib murine molecule H2-M3. Pamer and colleagues defined H2-M3 restricted, <italic>Listeria</italic>-specific, IFN-γ-producing T cells, whose response preceded that of the adaptive T cell response and was therefore consistent with an innate T cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b016">16</xref>]. Subsequently, Urdahl et al. demonstrated the presence of MHC Ib-restricted cells in antigen-naïve mice and that found that they originated from the thymus and displayed properties associated with effector T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b017">17</xref>].</p><p>In this study we sought to test the hypothesis that humans possess an innate population of Mtb-reactive T cells. From this hypothesis, we made the following predictions: 1) the innate T cell population would, unlike a naïve T cell precursor population, be present at high frequency in the circulating pool of lymphocytes; 2) the innate T cell population could respond directly ex-vivo to Mtb-infected cells in the absence of clonal expansion; 3) these cells would be prevalent throughout the human population irrespective of prior exposure to mycobacteria; and 4) these cells would be thymically derived.</p><p>Here we show that Mtb-reactive thymocytes are present at frequencies ranging from 0.01% to 0.2% of CD4<sup>−</sup> thymocytes in humans. The majority of Mtb-reactive thymocytes express the αβTCR and an activated phenotype with cytolytic potential. Mtb-reactive thymocytes require cell contact with DC infected with live Mtb and respond through a mechanism most consistent with MHC class Ib–restricted T cells. Consistent with the hypothesis that humans contain innate T cells that are capable of responding to Mtb-infected DC, we have identified a population of Mtb-reactive cells in cord blood.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human CD4<sup>−</sup> Mtb-Reactive Thymocytes Are Present at High Frequency in the Thymus</title><p>To assess whether or not humans contain a population of innate T cells that can respond to Mtb-infected cells we used thymocytes from infants undergoing cardiac surgery where thymectomy is standard procedure. Based on observations from Pamer and Urdahl, we speculated that such a population would be found in the CD4-negative population of thymocytes. Therefore, we used magnetic beads to deplete thymocytes of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. The CD4-depleted population was then incubated with autologous monocyte-derived Mtb-infected DC. We enumerated IFN-γ production from thymocytes by IFN-γ ELISPOT. Thymocytes from one donor produced IFN-γ in response to autologous DC infected with Mtb but not to uninfected DC while no IFN-γ was detected from Mtb-infected DC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><fig id="ppat-0040039-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0040039.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mtb-Reactive CD4<sup>−</sup> Thymocytes Are Present in the Human Thymus</title><p>(A) CD4-depleted thymocytes from thymocyte donor 11 (750,000/well) were incubated overnight with autologous DC (20,000/well) that were either infected with Mtb (moi of 50) or left uninfected.</p><p>(B) Thymocytes (250,000 cells/well) from one thymocyte donor were incubated with MHC mismatched DC (50,000 cells/well) from 3 different donors.</p><p>(C) Thymocytes from 4 individual donors were left unfractionated, or fractionated based on the positive or negative expression of CD4 using CD4 magnetic bead separation and incubated overnight with Mtb-infected DC (50,000/well).

Mtb-reactive thymocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 18) ranged from 16.5 to 381 spot-forming units (sfu)/250,000 CD4<sup>−</sup> thymocytes with a mean of 115.9 ± SD 101.2.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0040039.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>We reasoned that these cells were not likely to be classically HLA-Ia restricted. HLA class Ib molecules, unlike the highly polymorphic HLA class Ia molecules, have limited polymorphism, such that most individuals will express a similar set of these molecules. As a result, we predicted that allogeneic DC would serve as antigen-presenting cells (APC) for these T cells. Allogeneic DC were tested for their ability to elicit IFN-γ production by thymocytes. CD4-depleted thymocytes incubated with allogeneic DC produced IFN-γ in response to Mtb-infected DC but not to uninfected DC from three separate allogeneic donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Further evaluation of over 40 thymocyte donors using allogeneic DC revealed detectable IFN-γ responses to the Mtb-infected allogeneic DC but not to the uninfected DC (data not shown). The finding that thymocytes are consistently unresponsive to uninfected allogeneic DC is in sharp contrast to the predictable response by peripheral T cells that exhibit strong alloreactivity in response to MHC mismatched DC. Fortuitously, the absence of alloreactivity provided us with the opportunity to employ allogeneic DC given the limited quantities of PBMC available from the thymocyte donors. We confirmed that in response to allogeneic Mtb-infected DC the Mtb-reactive thymocytes are present in the CD4-negative but not in the CD4<sup>+</sup> fraction of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from peripheral blood are distinct from Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells preferentially recognize APC in direct proportion to the degree of intracellular infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b018">18</xref>]. Similarly, Mtb-reactive thymocytes also preferentially recognize DC infected with Mtb at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 30 or higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0040039-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Nevertheless, greater than 90% of DC infected at an MOI of 30 for 18 h of infection, remain viable, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion (not shown) and a minority (less than 20%) are apoptotic as assessed by Annexin V staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0040039-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). We next sought to establish the frequency and prevalence of Mtb-reactive thymocytes. Ex vivo frequencies of Mtb-reactive thymocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 18) ranged from 16.5 to 381 sfu/250,000 CD4<sup>−</sup> thymocytes (mean = 115.9 ± SD 101.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Furthermore, we have detected Mtb-reactive thymocytes from 58 of 60 donors tested (not shown) demonstrating that Mtb-reactive thymocytes are prevalent in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>While γδTCR<sup>+</sup> Thymocytes Can Be Detected, the Majority of Mtb-reactive Thymocytes Express the αβTCR</title><p>In human peripheral blood, 50% to 90% of all γδ T cells are Mtb-reactive. These T cells primarily express the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR and can respond to the mycobacterial non-peptide antigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, Kabelitz et al. previously described the presence of Vγ9-Mtb-reactive thymocytes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b020">20</xref>]. Thus, it was conceivable that γδTCR-expressing cells constituted the majority of Mtb-reactive thymocyte responses. Therefore, thymocytes were sorted by FACS by selecting CD4-negative cells that expressed CD8 and/or the γδTCR. The subsets were tested on Mtb-infected and uninfected DC. None of the sorted cells produced IFN-γ in response to uninfected DC (not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A shows that both γδTCR<sup>−</sup> and γδTCR<sup>+</sup> thymocytes respond to Mtb-infected DC and that as expected, a high frequency of thymocytes that express the γδTCR can respond to Mtb-infected DC. However, both CD8 single positive (SP) and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> double negative (DN) thymocytes in the γδTCR-depleted subset also contained Mtb-reactive thymocytes. Therefore, we used the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay with unfractionated thymocytes to determine if the γδTCR-negative cells expressed the αβTCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g002">Figure 2</xref>B shows that CD3<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Mtb-reactive thymocytes detected by ICS express the αβTCR and not the γδTCR. The fact that we did not detect γδTCR<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Mtb–reactive cells by ICS is consistent with the observation that less than 1% of all thymocytes express the γδTCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, these results indicate that although Mtb-reactive T cells expressing either the γδ or αβ TCR are both present in the thymus, the vast majority of Mtb-reactive thymocytes are αβTCR<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>−</sup> T cells that are either CD8<sup>+</sup> SP or DN.</p><fig id="ppat-0040039-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.0040039.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The Majority of Mtb-Reactive Thymocytes Are αβTCR<sup>+</sup> T Cells, While a Minority Express the γδTCR</title><p>(A) Thymocytes from 3 random donors were stained with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: CD4-PE, CD8-APC, γδTCR-FITC.

To further characterize the phenotype of Mtb-reactive thymocytes we used the ICS assay to assess the expression of molecules associated with effector memory T cells. As a positive control we used PBMC from an adult donor with known T cell reactivity to mycobacterial antigens. PBMC or Mtb-reactive thymocytes were incubated with allogeneic DC infected with Mtb or left uninfected. As expected, uninfected allogeneic DC induced a detectable frequency of PBMC to produce IFN-γ while a much lower frequency was detected from thymocytes. Mtb-reactive cells were defined by the specific production of IFN-γ in response to Mtb-infected DC. All Mtb-reactive thymocytes expressed CD3. This confirms the commitment of these cells to the T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040039-g003">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b022">22</xref>].

Nevertheless, we have been unsuccessful in blocking the response by Mtb-reactive thymocytes using a variety of blocking antibodies to HLA-Ia and HLA-Ib molecules.

As such, we postulate that these cells comprise an innate defense against mycobacterial infection. Several observations support this hypothesis. The frequencies of Mtb-reactive thymocytes are substantial (0.01% to 0.2% of CD4<sup>−</sup> thymocytes) and appear similar to frequencies of other innate T cells that mediate immediate responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b033">33</xref>]. For example, MHC class Ib T22-restricted γδTCR<sup>+</sup> T cells are present at frequencies as high as 0.5% of γδTCR<sup>+</sup> splenocytes in uninfected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b034">34</xref>]. In this regard, we note that corticosteroids are frequently administered to the thymus donors in the peri-operative period. As a result, we believe that our results likely underestimate the prevalence of these cells in the thymus.</p><p>In contrast to the delayed responses inherent in the requisite proliferation, differentiation, and clonal expansion of adaptively acquired immunity, the thymocytes described herein exhibit rapid effector function characterized by the release of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and constituents of the cytolytic granule. Mtb-reactive thymocytes, by virtue of their ability to produce IFN-γ directly ex vivo, display the phenotype of pre-armed effector Th1-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b024">24</xref>]. The rapid production of IFN-γ by T cells is normally induced as a consequence of cell division and differentiation, and is associated with effector and memory, but not naïve T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b035">35</xref>]. The phenotype of Mtb-reactive thymocytes is reminiscent of cells described by Urdahl et al. who showed that MHC class Ib–restricted T cells with an activated effector phenotype could be isolated from the thymus of naïve mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b017">17</xref>]. Therefore, Mtb-reactive thymocytes may represent a subset of innate T cells with direct ex vivo effector function in humans.</p><p>Mtb-reactive thymocyte responses are present in the absence of prior antigenic exposure. In children, exposure to environmental mycobacteria occurs as children begin to explore their environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b036">36</xref>]. As most of our thymus donors are very young (all are &lt;4 mo old and many are less than 1 wk old) it is unlikely they have been exposed to environmental mycobacteria. Furthermore, exposure to tuberculosis is very unlikely in our patient population. In Oregon, the 2006 case rate of tuberculosis was 2.2/100,000 individuals (Oregon DHS). Moreover, in our limited experience, we have not found evidence for reactivity to Mtb-specific antigens such as CFP-10 and ESAT-6 (not shown), arguing against the possibility of prior exposure to Mtb.</p><p>We find it unlikely that Mtb-reactive T cells in the thymus reflect mature peripheral T cells that have recirculated back to the thymus. While mouse studies have demonstrated the capability of peripheral T cells to recirculate to the thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b038">38</xref>] the injection of substantial numbers of T cells was required to detect this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b039">39</xref>]. Moreover, studies by Fink et al. showed that this required exposure to antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b038">38</xref>]. As discussed above, it is unlikely that the very young donors described in this report have had prior mycobacterial exposure.</p><p>The expression of CD3, and the absence of CD161, demonstrate it is unlikely that the Mtb-reactive thymocytes are NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b023">23</xref>]. Furthermore, Mtb-reactive thymocytes do not express Vα24 (not shown) and are therefore not the well-defined subset of invariant NKT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b040">40</xref>]. However, it is possible that these innate cells are non-invariant TCR NKT cells or those restricted by an HLA-Ib molecule. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Innate-like T cells often recognize a signature antigen in pathogen-infected cells. With regard to the possibility that these cells are NKT cells, it is possible that they recognize a danger signal induced by Mtb in the infected cell that would allow for NK-like recognition. In this regard, we note that blocking of the known NK receptor NKG2D and NK and γδ T cell ligands MICA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b032">32</xref>], and ULBP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b031">31</xref>], did not abrogate the recognition by Mtb-infected cells (data not shown). Alternately, antigen presented in the context of an MHC class Ib-molecule may result in T cell activation. Our data support the hypothesis that Mtb-reactive thymocytes are MHC class Ib-restricted. Mtb-reactive thymocytes are activated by allogeneic Mtb-infected DC and activation requires live infection of DC with Mtb as well as proteasomal processing. As a result, we conclude that Mtb-reactive thymocytes represent a subset of T cells that are most likely MHC class Ib-restricted but may utilize a novel mechanism to detect Mtb-infected DC.</p><p>This report provides the first demonstration of a human innate pathogen-reactive αβTCR<sup>+</sup> T cell. In preliminary experiments we have begun to assess the reactivity of thymocytes to other pathogens (not shown). We have detected modest responses to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content>–<italic>, E.coli</italic>–<italic>, and Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>–infected DC but did not detect any responses to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content>– or vaccinia virus–infected DC. Thus, it is possible that innate thymocytes provide early and innate Th1-like immunity at the site of infection with Mtb and perhaps other pathogens. Furthermore, we have identified Mtb-reactive cells in cord blood. This finding is consistent with the potential egress from the thymus of αβTCR<sup>+</sup> Mtb-reactive cells. Through the production of IFN-γ, Mtb-reactive cells may act on Mtb-infected macrophages early in infection and as such control the spread of Mtb. It is known that over half of exposed individuals never convert their TST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040039-b002">2</xref>]. Therefore, perhaps innate responses allow the clearance of the bacterium and obviate the need for adaptive immunity. Furthermore, IFN-γ from Mtb-reactive cells may provide help to DC to augment the production of IL-12 resulting in an enhanced Th1 response. As such, innate Mtb-reactive cells could act as a bridge between the innate and adaptive responses to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content>.
