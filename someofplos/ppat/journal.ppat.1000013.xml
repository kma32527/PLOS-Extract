The rupture of infected erythrocytes triggers an inflammatory response, which is induced by parasite-derived factors that still are not fully characterized. Induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines by these factors is considered a major cause of malaria pathogenesis. In particular, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is thought to mediate most of the life-threatening pathologies of the disease. Here we describe the molecular characterization of a novel pathway that results in the secretion of TNF by host cells. We found that erythrocytes infected by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> accumulate high concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine. Degradation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-derived hypoxanthine/xanthine results in the formation of uric acid, which triggers the secretion of TNF. Since uric acid is considered a “danger signal” released by dying cells to alert the immune system, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> appears to have co-evolved to exploit this warning system. Identifying the mechanisms used by the parasite to induce the host inflammatory response is essential to develop urgently needed therapies against this disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Malaria, a disease that results in more than one million deaths per year, is caused by infection with the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infects erythrocytes inducing an acute inflammatory response with high fevers and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the pathology of the disease. We have identified a soluble factor from infected erythrocytes that induces the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF from murine dendritic cells. We observed that hypoxanthine is accumulated in high concentrations in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes. Upon rupture of these erythrocytes, hypoxanthine is degraded into uric acid by a host enzyme. Uric acid is a well-known modulator of immune responses, as it is the causative agent of gout and has been identified as a danger signal for the immune system. As the malaria-induced inflammatory response contributes to most of the pathology associated with malaria infections, including death, its understanding is essential for the development of effective treatments.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by American Heart Association Grant-in-Aid 0555742T and Burroughs Welcome Fund Award for Investigators in Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseaseto to A.R., NIH training grant 5T32 AI 07180 to J.O., and Ellison Medical Foundation 0566-04 to K.D.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are over 500 million clinical malaria cases and at least one million deaths annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Snow1">[1]</xref>.

Since common desalting methods exploit hydrophobicity and size to achieve separation, we were not able to isolate the low molecular weight fractions containing non-hydrophobic molecules from the HPLC buffer salts. The high concentrations of salts were toxic to DCs prohibiting the direct testing of the fractions for their activity on DCs. Thus, we identified the molecular components found in these peaks and tested their activity on DCs. Three low molecular weight peaks found only in the conditioned medium of <italic>P. yoelii</italic>-infected erythrocytes were isolated, subjected to trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivitization and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) coupled with electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Shi1">[8]</xref>.

We used a quantification method based on the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase (XO), which specifically degrades hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid while releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that the concentration of xanthine/hypoxanthine in the soluble fraction of lysates from late stage <italic>P. yoelii</italic>-infected erythrocytes (schizonts) was very high compared to control uninfected erythrocytes where xanthine/hypoxanthine was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000013-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

First we analyzed the effects of allopurinol on the release of TNF induced by <italic>P. yoelii</italic>-infected erythrocytes from DCs. We observed that TNF, which was released by DCs at 3 and 6 h after the addition of infected erythrocytes, was inhibited almost completely by allopurinol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000013-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This suggests that the degradation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-derived hypoxanthine/xanthine into uric acid is a major contributor to the release of TNF by DCs. We also observed that TNF was no longer secreted by DCs 24 h after addition of infected erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000013-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). At this time, the addition of another TNF-inducing stimulus, such as LPS, did not activate TNF secretion by DCs, most likely due to tolerance induced by the initial parasite activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000013-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the presence of allopurinol, DCs secrete TNF in response to LPS even after incubation with infected erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000013-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This is probably because the initial TNF response induced by the parasite and the subsequent tolerogenic effect are inhibited by allopurinol. Hypoxanthine degradation could therefore contribute to the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced tolerance to endotoxin-mediated activation that is observed both in malaria patients and in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Boutlis1">[29]</xref>.

This could be caused by renal dysfunction induced by infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-1">[41]</xref>, but may be also caused by increased hypoxanthine degradation in the blood. Most mammals, such as mice, have uricase, a liver enzyme that degrades uric acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Becker1">[42]</xref>. The presence of this enzyme affords these mammals low serum uric acid levels (5–20 µg/ml) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-SanchezLozada1">[43]</xref>. However, in humans uric acid is the final product of hypoxanthine degradation because the uricase enzyme was mutated throughout evolution and its activity cannot be found in human serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-SanchezLozada1">[43]</xref>. Thus, humans have higher serum uric acid levels (40–60 µg/ml) and a lower capacity to control increases in uric acid, which may result in more prominent role of this pathway in the inflammatory response to malaria in humans.</p><p>High concentrations of soluble uric acid induce the release of inflammatory mediators from different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Kanellis1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Kang1">[14]</xref>, suggesting that the soluble uric acid formed via hypoxanthine degradation could also contribute to the malaria induced inflammatory response.

Infected erythrocytes concentrate in specific organs, such as the spleen, where they are also found in the extra-vascular tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Mota1">[44]</xref>. It is possible that this environment could also facilitate crystallization, as high local concentrations of uric acid above the threshold of crystallization might easily be reached upon schizont rupture and hypoxanthine release in these organs, especially in synchronized infections. Uric acid may also be formed in the brain when infected erythrocytes are sequestered in capillaries, thus forming a micro-environment that would facilitate crystallization. Interestingly, elevated uric acid levels are found in the brains of mice infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic>, although this increase is not associated with the development of experimental cerebral malaria in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Sanni1">[45]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-derived hypoxanthine must also be converted to uric acid in the phagosome of DCs and macrophages upon uptake and degradation of infected erythrocytes, since they express XO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000013-Vorbach1">[24]</xref>.

We found that the antioxidant NAC and the degradation of hydrogen peroxide by catalase result in decreased secretion of TNF, suggesting that ROS contribute to the inflammatory effect of uric acid.
