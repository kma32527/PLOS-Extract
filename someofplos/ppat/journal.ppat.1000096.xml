In this study, murine embryo fibroblast (MEFs) and mice lacking the gene were used to demonstrate a novel role of ISG15 as a host defense molecule against vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. In MEFs, the growth of replication competent Western Reserve (WR) VACV strain was affected by the absence of ISG15, but in addition, virus lacking E3 protein (VVΔE3L) that is unable to grow in ISG15+/+ cells replicated in ISG15-deficient cells. Inhibiting ISG15 with siRNA or promoting its expression in ISG15−/− cells with a lentivirus vector showed that VACV replication was controlled by ISG15. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that E3 binds ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. The VACV antiviral action of ISG15 and its interaction with E3 are events independent of PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase). In mice lacking ISG15, infection with VVΔE3L caused significant disease and mortality, an effect not observed in VVΔE3L-infected ISG15+/+ mice. Pathogenesis in ISG15-deficient mice infected with VVΔE3L or with an E3L deletion mutant virus lacking the C-terminal domain triggered an enhanced inflammatory response in the lungs compared with ISG15+/+-infected mice. These findings showed an anti-VACV function of ISG15, with the virus E3 protein suppressing the action of the ISG15 antiviral factor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Modification of proteins by ubiquitin (UB) and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBL) represents a key regulatory process of innate and adaptive immune responses. Interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is a member of UBL molecules that can reversibly be conjugated to proteins mediating considerable antiviral response. In turn, many viruses, including poxviruses, have evolved strategies to block the antiviral and inflammatory effects of innate immune responses to keep cells alive until virus replication is completed. Here, a novel viral immune evasion mechanism that inhibits ISG15-dependent antiviral pathway is described. Vaccinia virus (VACV) pathogenesis in ISG15+/+ versus ISG15−/− mice is linked to the virus E3 protein, blocking the activity of ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. This effect was independent of PKR activation. ISG15 controls the inflammatory response regulating cytokine levels. Our findings support a new strategy for poxviruses to evade the host antiviral response through interaction of the virus E3 protein with ISG15.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by the Ramón y Cajal program from Ministry of Education and Science of Spain and grants from the European Union, QLK2-CT-2002-01867 (Vaccinia Vectors), LSHP-CT-2006-037536 (MVACTOR), and Fundacion Botín.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type I interferons (IFN-α and -β) serve a critical role in antiviral innate immunity and in modulating the adaptive immune response to infection and tumor development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Liu1">[1]</xref>.

While in MEFs the yields of WR were slightly different between ISG15+/+ and ISG15−/− infected cells, the non-replicating VVΔE3L in ISG15+/+ cells grew more than one log better in ISG15−/− cells. Biochemical analyses showed that the E3 protein interacts with ISG15 through its carboxyl terminal domain. Repression of ISG15 with siRNAs or expression of ISG15 by a lentivirus vector in ISG15 null cells indicate that VACV replication can be controlled by ISG15 and that E3/ISG15 protein interaction is independent of the presence of PKR. In mice lacking ISG15, VVΔE3L induced stronger pathogenesis than in ISG15+/+, an effect similarly triggered by a C-terminal deletion mutant (VVE3LΔ26C).

When IP was performed without antibody or using a pre-immune serum as a control, no interaction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, central panels). To analyze if RNA was involved in E3/ISG15 interaction, we treated the IP complex with RNase just before its loading in the SDS-PAGE, and found that the complex was destroyed, as no interaction was observed with any of the E3 proteins from the different viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g005">Fig. 5B, left panel</xref>). This result indicate that RNA, and probably dsRNA, has a role as a linking component in the interaction between E3 and ISG15 proteins as its degradation abolishes the binding of both proteins. ISG15/E3 protein interaction was confirmed by confocal microscopy, as WR-, or MVA- or VVE3LΔ83N-infected MEFs showed co-localization between ISG15 and E3, while VVΔE3L- or VVE3LΔ26C-infected MEFs did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, we also studied if the presence of PKR was relevant for this interaction by performing both IP and confocal experiments in PKR−/− cells.

Upon viral entry into cells, ISG induction occurs in two waves: acute, IFN-independent induction of a subset of ISGs and delayed, IFN-dependent induction via the production of IFN-α/β during the initial phase. In many viral infections, IFN-independent ISG induction is mediated by the IRF-3 phosphorylation, homodimerization, and nuclear translocation. Activated IRF3, in turn, induces the expression of type I IFN genes, whose products trigger strong induction of a subsets of ISGs, including IFN-β which after its release and ligand-binding to its receptor then initiates IFN-dependent ISG induction via the IFN receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. IFN-inducible enzymes, like the 2.5 OAS/RNAse L system, PKR, and M×, are the best characterized proteins that mediate antiviral action of IFN. Another protein, ISG15, was first identified as an IFN-stimulated gene whose expression is induced strongly by IFN-α/β treatment and can be detected at low constitutive levels in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Loeb1">[45]</xref>. ISG15 modifies several important molecules and affects type I IFN signal transduction; ISG15 expression is markedly increased following viral infection (14, 30, 49), and many viruses encode inhibitors of the IFN-transduction pathway or specific inhibitors of ISG to avoid deleterious effects triggered by these cytokines.</p><p>Among animal viruses, the poxvirus family contains a large array of genes which are used by the virus to evade host immune responses.

One of the VACV proteins with strong inhibitory activity of IFN-induced pathways is E3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Shors1">[47]</xref>.

In addition viral titers also increase in the absence of ISG15 indicating that ISG15 has an essential role against infection of VACV. During infection of MEFs from ISG15 KO or ISG15 depleted cells, the presence of E3 enhances viral production since the WR titers are greater than those after infection with the VVΔE3L mutant virus. One explanation of this phenotype is that the mutant virus lacking E3 triggers apoptosis through PKR activation which, in turn, reduces virus production as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Ludwig1">[52]</xref>. The role of ISG15 in VACV replication was also supported by the more abundant VACV infectious virus and viral proteins produced in lungs of ISG15−/− mice compared with lungs of ISG15+/+ mice after infection with WR or with the E3L deletion mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g009">Fig. 9B–C</xref>).</p><p>While the depletion of ISG15 has an effect on VVΔE3L mutant phenotype and restores virus growth, over-expression of ISG15 in ISG15−/− murine cells using a retroviral transduction system revert the restricted VVΔE3L viral growth. Over-expression of ISG15 also reduces markedly WR titers reinforcing the idea that ISG15 plays a role in the control of VACV replication.</p><p>Inhibition of ISG15 function by VACV is likely due to its interaction with VACV E3, as shown by IP and confocal analyses. This interaction with ISG15 occurs independently of PKR, through the C-terminal region of E3 and requires RNA. We have shown that ISG15 controls the <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of VACV in a PKR-independent manner, as WR and VVΔE3L titers do not increase in murine PKR−/− cells in comparison to those observed in PKR+/+. While in murine cells VVΔE3L is able to replicate in a PKR-independent manner, as also described in MEFs lacking RNase L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Zhang1">[53]</xref>, in human HeLa cells with PKR expression suppressed by siRNA, the mutant virus is able to grow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Xiang1">[40]</xref>. The differences in cell origin might explain the distinct effect of the IFN system in the control of VACV replication.</p><p>The mutant VVΔE3L virus that was able to replicate in ISG15−/− MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) did not replicate in ISG15 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), but surprisingly infection with VVΔE3L provokes sickness and mortality only in ISG15−/− mice. This was probably related to the strong inflammatory response triggered by the mutant in ISG15 KO mice, as observed by the increased levels of IL-6 in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Although the biological relevance of this observation remains to be established, it can be suggested, in view of the functions assigned to ISG15 in the innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Malakhova1">[54]</xref>, that this molecule plays a role as regulator of IFN-triggered innate responses during VACV infection. It will be of interest to know the type of innate response triggered in ISG15 KO mice infected with VVΔE3L.</p><p>The inability of VVΔE3L to cause significant disease in WT mice is presumably due, at least in part, to induction of type I IFN that, in turn, leads to up-regulation of antiviral proteins, such as PKR and 2–5 OAS/RNaseL system. The mutant virus that lacks the C terminus of E3L gene involved in the dsRNA sequestration (VVE3LΔ26C) is completely attenuated in WT mice; however deletion of the N terminus (VVE3LΔ83N) reduces pathogenesis 500- to 5,000-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Brandt1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Kim3">[48]</xref>. We extended these <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using the i.n route and compared WR and E3L mutant viruses in WT and ISG15 KO mice. We observed that only after VVΔE3L or VVE3LΔ26C inoculation (i.n), the mortality of mice was increased by the absence of ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In the case of WR or VVE3LΔ83N, there were no differences in mortality of both viruses in ISG15 KO in comparison to WT mice although viral replication was enhanced in the lungs of ISG15−/− in comparison to ISG15+/+ mice. One explanation is that ISG15 is made non functional after infection with these viruses, because the carboxy-terminal domain of E3 binds to ISG15 and blocks its activity. These observations are in correlation with the reduced presence of conjugates in lungs of WT mice infected with WR or VVE3LΔ83N, compared with infection by VVΔE3L or VVE3LΔ26C. Although lung homogenates presented similar amounts of ISG15 protein, the conjugation of ISG15 to its targets proteins, was greatly enhanced after infection with VVΔE3L or VVE3LΔ26C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). This evidence suggests that inhibition of conjugation of ISG15 is mediated by E3 and this inhibition requires the presence of the dsRNA binding domain. Similar result was also observed in MEFs infected <italic>in vitro</italic> with VVΔE3L where high levels of ISG15 conjugates were clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The cause of mortality of ISG15 KO mice after infection with VVΔE3L or VVE3LΔ26C was a massive inflammation of lungs with alveolar wall thickening and infiltration of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000096-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). These results indicate a role of ISG15 in the control of an inflammatory response by regulating cytokine levels.</p><p>Cytokine and chemokine release occurs rapidly in response to virus infection, with the aim of recruiting inflammatory leukocytes in order to limit virus replication and spread, and to induce adaptive immunity. However, prolonged expression of chemokines in the context of viral infections may be detrimental to the host. We find that in the absence of ISG15, infection with VVΔE3L produces an increase of IL-6 that correlates with short-term morbidity and complications that include pulmonary function abnormalities. Although the mechanisms of this up-regulation remains to be established, it can be speculated in view of the functions assigned to ISG15 that it might be involved in the regulation of cytokine signal transduction, through the stabilization of specific signalling components that facilitate the development of a correct innate immune response. In this sense a family of intracellular proteins called suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) are essential for the regulation of cytokine expression having a critical role in the regulation of the innate response. Considering that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 negatively regulate the IFN-induced signal cascade, and VACV E3 protein inhibits the type I IFN response, it is possible that E3 or other viral proteins may regulate the IFN response by affecting SOCS protein expression regulating the ISG15 activity by an unknown mechanism. We have previously demonstrated that although WR provokes a general downregulation of cellular mRNAs, there are a discrete number of human genes that are induced selectively during the course of VACV infection. A variety of these upregulated genes encode different members of the SOCS family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Guerra2">[29]</xref> indicating that probably VACV may modify SOCS protein expression to manipulate the cytokine pathway and the antiviral host response. This strategy may be used to reduce the efficacy of innate and acquired immune responses to infection. However, WR modification of cytokine or chemokine responses may also be a mechanism to recruit new targets for infection, or provide new niches for infection. It has been described that over-expression of HCV core protein inhibits IFN signalling and induces SOCS-3 expression. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 proteins have been reported to inhibit IFN-induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and expression of antiviral proteins, such as M×A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Brand1">[55]</xref>.</p><p>There are similarities between the functions of VACV E3 and the NS1 dsRNA-binding protein of influenza virus. NS1 blocks IRF3 phosphorylation and IFNβ mRNA induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Talon1">[56]</xref>. In addition, NS1 is an inhibitor of PKR, suggesting that dsRNA sequestration is a strategy used by both RNA and DNA viruses to evade the IFN induction and action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Bergmann1">[57]</xref>. Furthermore NS1B binds and blocks ISG15 protein inhibiting the ISGylation. The region of the NS1B protein that is required for this inhibition includes the domain that binds dsRNA. VACV may have a similar mechanism of influenza NS1 to evade ISG15 action as well.</p><p>We conclude that the cellular ISG15 protein has an essential role in VACV replication, acting as a negative feedback regulator of the cytokine signalling pathway and regulating in this way the innate response. VACV has therefore developed a mechanism to counteract this antiviral host response through E3. Because VVΔE3L is not lethal to ISG15+/+ mice lacking PKR, RNase L, and M×1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000096-Xiang1">[40]</xref>, there must be an additional IFN-induced antiviral pathway(s) effective against viruses, in which ISG15 should play an essential role. Understanding the host responses triggered by ISG15 and virus mechanisms of escape is necessary for development of therapies against important human pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells, viruses and infection conditions</title><p>HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum (NCS) and antibiotics (Gibco, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>).
