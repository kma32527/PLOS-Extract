<p>H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have seriously affected the Asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003. The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the <italic>M1</italic> and <italic>PB2</italic> genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus emerged in China in 1996, and has spread beyond Asia since 2003. Following the first outbreak reported in Indonesian poultry farms in December 2003, the virus spilled over to 27 Indonesian provinces by June 2006, and became endemic in the country. In the following years, repeated sporadic human infections in Indonesia had been attributed to H5N1 HPAI viruses. Nonetheless, the viral evolution and transmission have not been fully understood. Here, we report phylogenetic evidence of a group of interlineage reassortant viruses isolated from human and cats in Java. Our comparative study of the reassortant viruses and one group of genetic parents found that although their rates of evolution were similar and both of their phylogenies were not geographically structured within mainland Java, the growths of genetic diversity were different. We also detected significant positive selection on the viral matrix and polymerase genes preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, which might correspond to viral adaptation. Based on our findings, we discuss the possibility of host switching in facilitating the emergence of the reassortant strain, and call for more extensive viral surveillances in the non-avian population in Indonesia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus was originally isolated from a farmed goose in Guangdong province of China in 1996 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Xu1">[1]</xref>, and soon spread to live-poultry markets in Hong Kong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Shortridge1">[2]</xref>, resulting in 18 cases of human infection in 1997, 6 of which were fatal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Subbarao1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Yuen1">[4]</xref>. The first wave of H5N1 infection ceased after the depopulation of all poultry in Hong Kong, although the H5N1 virus was later found to circulate continuously in Southern China without causing apparent disease symptoms among infected poultry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Webster1">[5]</xref>. H5N1 outbreaks recurred in 2003, persistently affecting poultry farms in many Southeast Asia countries, such as China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. The viruses also spread outside Asia, including to some European countries. More importantly, occasional zoonotic transmissions to humans occurred in most of the affected Asian countries and the virus continued to pose a serious threat to global public health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Webster2">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>H5N1 outbreaks in Indonesia were initially detected in poultry farms in December 2003 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-OIE1">[7]</xref>. It was suggested that the H5N1 virus was first introduced to Java and subsequently spread to other parts of the country <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Amin1">[8]</xref>. The virus rapidly became endemic in Indonesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Sedyaningsih1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Smith1">[10]</xref>, and continued to cause sporadic zoonotic transmissions to humans beginning in July 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Sedyaningsih1">[9]</xref>. Three clusters of H5N1 transmission among family members were identified in 2005, raising concerns of possible human-to-human transmission of the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Kandun1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Normile1">[12]</xref>. As of April 8, 2008, Indonesia had 132 confirmed human cases with 107 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-WHO1">[13]</xref>, the largest number of deaths among all affected countries.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that several H5N1 genotypes have emerged in Asia through reassortment between H5N1 viruses and other subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Guan1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Li1">[15]</xref>. One of these genotypes, Z, predominated the H5N1 outbreaks throughout 2003–2007, causing most H5N1 outbreaks in Asian countries, including Indonesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Chen1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, a variety of antigenically distinct sublineages of Z genotype virus have been established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Chen1">[16]</xref>. Unlike Vietnam and Thailand, Indonesia was invaded by only a single sublineage of genotype Z virus. Previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that Hunan province of China may be the source of the initial H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Wang1">[17]</xref>, and classified the Indonesian H5N1 HPAI viruses into three groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Smith1">[10]</xref>; however, further statistical analysis is necessary to characterize and compare different aspects of their evolutionary histories. In this study, we examined molecular phylogeny of the most recent Indonesian H5N1 viruses isolated from avian and mammal hosts. A group of putative reassortant viruses was discovered and their genetic parents were identified. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary behaviors (including spatial migration, growth of genetic diversity, and evolutionary drift and selection) of the reassortant viruses and compare with those of the parental strain, thereby providing insights into the nature and impact of this emerging reassortant strain.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic relationships among Indonesian H5N1 viruses</title>
<p>Phylogenetic trees of Indonesian H5N1 viruses were reconstructed from 12 separate gene datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s015">Table S6</xref>), using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach with bootstrapping analyses to assess clade robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s001">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s003">S3</xref>; computer files of dendrogram are available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s009">Dataset S1</xref>). In all the phylogenies, viruses sampled from avian species during earlier years of outbreaks (predominantly 2003–2004) tended to cluster near the root as expected, but with a poorly resolved branching structure that is likely due to relatively low sequence divergence. In contrast, viruses sampled from recent infections (2005–2007) from avian and mammalian hosts formed three well-supported lineages with bootstrap support (or posterior probabilities) over 90 (or 0.9) under neighbor-joining (NJ), ML and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) methods. We denote these lineages as groups 1, 2, and 3 in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s002">S2C</xref>). This structure was preserved in the phylogenies of other genes for which sufficient sequence data were available (viruses from group 3 were missing sequence data for the <italic>NP</italic>, <italic>NS</italic>, <italic>NS1</italic>, <italic>NS2</italic>, and <italic>PB2</italic> genes). The group 3 lineage in the <italic>MP</italic>, <italic>M1</italic>, <italic>M2</italic>, and <italic>PB1</italic> phylogenies was only represented by the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that our phylogenetic groupings (groups 1, 2, and 3) of Indonesian H5N1 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s015">Table S6</xref>) are slightly different to those by Smith and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Smith1">[10]</xref> who did not require the same level of clustering support for each group, leading to the inclusion of earlier viruses (predominantly 2003–2004). We chose to be conservative, and did not include poorly supported branches (e.g., earlier viruses) in our viral group definition. Therefore, we did not define a group corresponding to the group B of Smith et al., because most of group B taxa are earlier viruses. Groups 1 and 2 in this study correspond to groups C and A defined by Smith et al. respectively, plus some more recent viruses. Smith did not report group 3, because the sequences were unavailable at that time.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of reassortant viruses</title>
<p>We found previously unrecognized phylogenetic discordance between gene trees involving human and cat isolates (n = 25, denoted in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s001">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s003">S3</xref>)—the main focus of our study—suggesting that they are reassortant viruses descending from group 2 and 3 lineages. In addition, the placement of two avian viruses isolates from Java (Ck/IDN/Semerang1631-62/07 and Ck/IDN/Magelang1631-57/07, shown in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s002">S2C</xref>) differed between <italic>HA</italic> and <italic>NA</italic> phylogenies, suggesting another reassortment event.</p>
<p>To further investigate the putative reassortant human and cat viruses, a selected dataset (n = 24) of manually concatenated full genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) of Indonesian H5N1 HPAI viruses were analyzed using more sophisticated analysis methods, including similarity plots, bootscan analyses and GARD analyses (genetic algorithm for recombination detection). In the similarity and bootscan plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>), the putative reassortants (represented by a consensus sequence) showed a high degree of sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering with the group 3 strain A/Indonesia/6/05 in the <italic>MP</italic> and <italic>PB1</italic> segments, but not in other genomic regions, where they were more similar to the consensus sequence of group 2 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Moreover, GARD detected two well-supported breakpoints near the boundaries of <italic>MP</italic> and <italic>PB1</italic> segments in the concatenated genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the phylogenetic incongruence was significant between the three regions. In summary, all three analyses agreed that the newly reassortant strains had arisen from acquiring <italic>PB1</italic> and <italic>MP</italic> genome segments from the group 3 lineage and the remaining segments from the group 2 lineage.</p>

<title>Genetic, temporal, and geographical origin of reassortant viruses</title>
<p>Based on the HA phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), we further classified the reassortant viruses into three subgroups (R1, R2, and R3) with bootstrap support of 80% or better, as shown in the phylogenies containing only reassortant viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Similar groupings were observed in the NA phylogeny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s002">Figures S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s004">S4B</xref>), although here subgroup R3 clustered with subgroup R1, and two reassortant viruses isolated in 2007 (IDN/CDC1046/07, IDN/CDC1047/07) moved to a different subgroup. These inferred clustering patterns can be explained by multiple reassortment events, or by a single reassortment followed by divergence due to mutation and selection in different populations. We note that some group 2 viruses also cluster inside the reassortant subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s002">S2C</xref>) and may indicate more reassortment events; however, most of them formed polytomies close to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the reassortant subgroups and had poor bootstrap support for their exact placement. As the divergence between the reassortant subgroups and other intercalating group 2 viruses are low, the three subgroups may actually be linked uninterruptedly, implying a single origin. Therefore, the times and number of reassortment events that generated the putative mosaic reassortant viruses remains elusive. We examine both the single and multiple origin hypotheses in subsequent analyses, excluding the intercalating group 2 viruses from the reassortant group.</p>
<p>To estimate the times of the reassortment events that generated the putative reassortant viruses, the times of the MRCA (tMRCA) of the three reassortant subgroups were estimated using BMCMC methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Drummond1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Lam1">[19]</xref>. Bayes Factors (BF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Suchard1">[20]</xref> were used to select among strict and relaxed clock models of evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Drummond2">[21]</xref>. The uncorrelated exponentially-distributed clock model (UCED) significantly outperformed the other models (lnBF&gt;3) for most datasets, except for the NA gene of the reassortant viruses, for which the strict clock model was not rejected (lnBF&lt;1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s013">Table S4</xref>). The results of tMRCA estimation are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>. In addition, sequence isolation dates were plotted against their genetic distance (units of substitutions/site) to their MRCA, to graphically show the accumulation of mutations through time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). The tMRCA of all reassortant viruses (All-tMRCA) was dated to July 2005 (highest probability density, HPD confidence interval: April–October), which is consistent with the linear regression estimate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>. However, the regression estimate of All-tMRCA for the <italic>NA</italic> gene (April 2005) is slightly older than BMCMC estimate (July 2005). If strains IDN/CDC1046/07 and IDN/CDC1047/07 are excluded from regression analyses then the All-tMRCA date (July 2005; as indicated by the red regression line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) becomes consistent with the BMCMC estimate (July 2005). This suggests that the regression method was sensitive to rate variation caused by the two potential recent reassortants. The tMRCA estimates (R1-tMRCA, R2-tMRCA, and R3-tMRCA) for the individual reassortant subgroups range from May 2005 to April 2006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>

Parsimony reconstruction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) of binary ancestral geographical states (either Greater Jakarta or West Java) upon the <italic>HA</italic> and <italic>NA</italic> ML phylogenies suggested that the MRCA of all reassortants (and the MRCAs of each reassortant subgroup) likely originated from Greater Jakarta and surroundings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s011">Table S2</xref>; result robust to random resolution of polytomies; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

<p>Locations for the putative reassortant viruses focused in this study are indicated with green triangles. Numbers inside the triangles refer to the locations of the reassortant viruses described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Table 1</xref>. Locations of group 2 and 3 viruses are indicated with orange circles and squares, respectively. Red circles and squares denote the locations of putative avian reassortant viruses in 2007. Only those parental strains genetically close to the reassortant viruses are shown in the map. A zoom-in of Greater Jakarta (G.

<title>Spatial migration of reassortant and its parental strain</title>
<p>The mean numbers of observed geographical state changes (GSC) of the reassortant and of the group 2 parental strains were estimated independently and compared with the null distribution of GSC values under the null hypothesis of completely unrestricted migration (i.e. panmixis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s005">Figure S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Slatkin1">[22]</xref>. For the reassortant strain, the observed GSC value was not significantly lower than the GSC value expected under panmixis (Slatkin-Maddison test: <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.2). Therefore the observed geographic structure is not significantly different to that expected by chance alone. For group 2 viruses, the observed GSC value for all geographical state pairs is significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0002) lower than the null value. However, the observed value of GSC within Java (i.e., migrations between Greater Jakarta and the rest of Java) and between the three islands (i.e. migrations between mainland Java, Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua) are insignificantly (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.2) and significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0002) lower than the corresponding null values respectively, suggesting that the phylogeny of group 2 viruses is not geographically structured within Java, but is subdivided by island-to-island migrations. However, we could not address whether the viral migrations inside Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua are panmictic or structured due to limited operative localities in our dataset to distinguish between different regions inside these islands. We also found that the migration of group 2 viruses from Greater Jakarta and surroundings to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua was more frequent than expected under the null hypothesis, and there is relatively little viral migration from the rest of Java to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s012">Table S3</xref>). This observation suggests Greater Jakarta played a more salient role in dispersing group 2 viruses to other Indonesian islands than other parts of Java did.</p>

<title>Population dynamics of reassortant and its parental strain</title>
<p>We used the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Drummond3">[23]</xref> to estimate the change of relative genetic diversity of the reassortant viruses and of the group 2 parental strain over time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3E–3H</xref>. For both the <italic>HA</italic> and <italic>NA</italic> datasets, the group 2 viruses consistently show a slow growth in relative genetic diversity over time which appears to follow a constant size or exponential growth model, whereas the reassortant viruses initially exhibited an abrupt rise in relative genetic diversity followed by stabilization, which visually resembles a logistic growth curve with two phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Carrington1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Hue1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). When the BSPs are superimposed upon the demographic results obtained under parametric growth models (i.e., constant, exponential and logistic growth; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s008">Figure S8</xref>), then a similar observation can also be made. However, BF tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s013">Table S4</xref>) indicate there is insufficient statistical power to discriminate between the three parametric growth models (lnBF&lt;2.99), suggesting a lack of strong demographic signal in these data. When the parametric demographic models were fitted to the data, the median estimates of growth rates for the reassortant datasets are generally higher than those estimated for the datasets of group 2 viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s010">Table S1</xref>). However, the confidence intervals of some growth rate estimates are fairly large and overlapped among the reassortant and group 2 viral datasets.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study classified H5N1 HPAI viruses in Indonesia into three distinct viral lineages (groups 1, 2, and 3) and discovered a group of naturally occurring reassortant viruses that represent a newly emergent H5N1 HPAI strain in Java in 2006. Several phylogenetic methods concurred that two (<italic>MP</italic> and <italic>PB1</italic>) of the reassortant viruses' genome segments descended from the group 3 ancestral viruses, and the remaining six (<italic>PB2</italic>, <italic>PA</italic>, <italic>HA</italic>, <italic>NP</italic>, <italic>NA</italic>, <italic>NS</italic>) segments descended from the group 2 ancestral viruses. Although the majority of reassortant viruses (24/25) are human isolates, few of the associated human infections are epidemiologically linked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting multiple sporadic zoonotic transmissions from birds. The phylogeographic results indicate that the parental viruses of the reassortants have been co-circulating in Java since 2005. Despite the identification of parental lineages, the exact number of reassortment events remains difficult to assess. Although the three fairly consistent phylogenetic subgroups (subgroups R1, R2, and R3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s004">Figure S4</xref>) formed by the reassortant viruses suggest three independent reassortments, the underlying uncertainty in our estimated phylogenies means that we cannot rule out the possibility of a single origin.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of three reassortments implies that the viruses have acquired exactly the same genome segments from the same group of parental viruses, which seems unlikely to occur by chance (probability = 0.0089, assuming panmixis and that exactly two genomic segments are swapped out). This probability might be increased if reassortments confer a selective advantage. We did detect a significantly stronger selection pressure on the M1 protein in the pre-emergence lineage of group 3 parental strain that led to the reassortant viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s014">Table S5</xref>). Previous reports suggested a few amino acid changes in M1 of influenza A and B viruses can confer a growth advantage in mouse lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Brown1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Smeenk1">[29]</xref>. Although the M1 mutations identified in this pre-emergence lineage have not been functional characterized elsewhere in the authors' knowledge, one (residue 137, T→A) of them is close to a previously characterized mutation (residue 139, T→A) which controls the virulence in mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Brown1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Smeenk1">[29]</xref>. Three of the inferred residue changes are located close to the electropositive surface of N-terminal domain of M1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s007">Figure S7</xref>) that acts to bind viral RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Arzt1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Sha1">[31]</xref>. The M1 matrix protein mediates encapsulation of viral RNA-nucleoproteins into membrane envelope during packaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Sha1">[31]</xref>, and has close contact with other viral proteins inside the viral particle. It seems possible that some of these changes may be involved in the adaptation of reassortant viruses, through promotion of structural interactions among viral proteins.</p>
<p>According to our analyses, the common ancestor of the reassortant viruses is dated to July 2005 (HPD: April–October), approximately 5 months prior to the first case of human infection caused by the reassortant virus (index case #15 defined by WHO; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our analysis of virus phylogeography suggests the ancestors of these reassortant viruses first arose in Greater Jakarta and surroundings, which agrees with the observation that the first two cases of human infection by the reassortant viruses occurred in Central and East Jakarta (index cases #15 and #16). The molecular dating and phylogenetic analyses suggest that nascent reassortant viruses might take several months to spread and expand their diversity in the local bird population, eventually leading to the exposure of human population. The subsequent spread of the reassortant strain seems to become more rapid and extensive, as human cases were reported outside Greater Jakarta one month later, and the reassortant virus spread to as far as the south and east of West Java in the following six months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Commercial poultry transportation, as well as carriage by migratory birds, may facilitate the viral migration, but their tangible contributions need further studies. Our results suggest that the circulations of reassortant viruses and their genetic parent (group 2) were not restricted by geography within Java. The viral migration back to Greater Jakarta could be driven by the inter-province transfer of infected poultry, in particular the importation of live poultry or fresh poultry products to the densely human populated Jakarta from the remote provinces engaged in poultry-farming. Future studies on economic and social geography (e.g., addressing the modes of inter-provincial poultry transport) in Indonesia might help to further elucidate the effect on the viral dispersal by human, agricultural and industrial activities. In this study, we opted for a lower geographical resolution (i.e., four widely ranged geographical states instead of distinct geographical coordinate for each viral isolate) in our phylogeographic analyses because of the varying precision of the geographical data we have. Therefore, more complex hypotheses of viral origin and migration trajectory cannot be investigated here, but can be explored when more high-quality geographical data of Indonesian H5N1 viral samples is available.</p>
<p>The BSP analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g003">Figure 3E–3H</xref>) indicate that the reassortant viruses follow a logistic-like growth curve, which is typical for virus invasion and maintenance, especially in a structured population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Carrington1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Hue1">[25]</xref>. In contrast, the group 2 viruses followed a more continuous and relatively slow growth in diversity. There was insufficient data in our samples to definitively discriminate between alternative population growth models and provide narrow confidence intervals for parameter estimates, but our results are suggestive and future sequencing will add to the needed statistical power.</p>
<p>What factors have contributed to the apparent difference in the growth of genetic diversity? Rates of molecular evolution between the two groups were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s006">Figure S6</xref>) and therefore are not likely to be the cause. Since our analyses could not resolve the temporal dynamics of population subdivision by geography, we cannot directly investigate how viral genetic variation is affected by the population structure. We expect future development of analysis methods will help to shed more light on the interaction between viral migration and genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Analysis of clinical records (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Table 1</xref>) found that the mean duration from onset to death in those fatal human cases caused by Indonesian reassortant H5N1 viruses is 9.1 days (standard deviation [SD] = 3.9; n = 23) and those caused by other Indonesian H5N1 viruses is 7.7 days (SD = 2.7; n = 10), and their means are not significantly different (student <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.25, two-tails). Therefore, based on the clinical records, the reassortant viruses did not kill human faster than other Indonesian H5N1 viruses did. However, we would recommend more experimental studies addressing the virulence, pathogenicity and immunogenicity of the reassortant viruses and the parent strains to verify this claim in the future.</p>
<p>Mechanisms of viral transmissions are sometimes correlated with genetic diversity dynamics. For example, hepatitis C viruses transmitted by drug injection or blood products have a faster rate of spread than endemic strains circulating in Asia and Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Pybus1">[32]</xref>. It has also been suggested that mosquito susceptibility may affect the growth of dengue viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Armstrong1">[33]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that a change of host species could generate the difference in the viral dynamics we observe. In our study, the majority of the reassortant viruses (24/25) were isolated from humans, whereas only a minority of the group 2 viruses were isolated from humans (10/57 and 10/41 in the <italic>HA</italic> and <italic>NA</italic> datasets, respectively).</p>
<p>It has been previously shown that the receptor binding specificity of hemagglutinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Yamada1">[34]</xref> and mutations in the viral polymerase (e.g., lysine at residue 627 of PB2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Hatta1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Shinya1">[37]</xref> can determine viral transmissibility and replication in different host species. None of the aforementioned <italic>HA</italic> mutations which confer recognition to human-type host cell receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Yamada1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Stevens1">[38]</xref> were found in the Indonesian reassortant viruses; however, our detection of positively selected sites in the <italic>PB2</italic> gene of the reassortant viruses could potentially reflect adaptation to mammalian hosts, and requires further investigation. In particular, amino acid changes on two positively selected sites (threonine to methionine at reside 76, glutamic acid to glycine and alanine at reside 677) were found on the internal branches of the reassortant lineage, corresponding to molecular changes during sustainable transmissions. However, some of these positively selected changes may also result from the compensatory evolution as the mix of genome segments from different strains might alter their epistatic physiochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Rambaut1">[39]</xref>. Although most of the human isolates in our datasets were epidemiologically unlinked, such linkage is theoretically possible if many asymptotic or mildly manifested human infections are not reported. Recently, some evidence of subclinical or asymptotic H5N1 infection in humans has been put forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Lin1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Haque1">[41]</xref>; however, the ability of the viruses to transmit from these infected individuals to other susceptible individuals remains unknown.</p>
<p>The possible role of other animal host species in the transmissions of reassortant viruses in Indonesia should not be neglected. In particular, one of the reassortant viruses was isolated from a dead cat in Jakarta, where H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Butler1">[42]</xref>. Moreover, unusual high mortality of cats in the vicinity of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-FAO1">[43]</xref>. An unofficial report also detected H5N1 HPAI sero-positivity in around 20% of 500 blood samples taken from stray cats near poultry markets in Java and Sumatera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Mackenzie1">[44]</xref>. In addition to small cats in Germany <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Weber1">[45]</xref>, Iran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Yingst1">[46]</xref>, and Indonesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Butler1">[42]</xref>, dogs and zoo tigers were also found infected with H5N1 HPAI viruses in Thailand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Amonsin1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Keawcharoen1">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, previous experimental studies have demonstrated that cats can be infected with H5N1 HPAI virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Kuiken1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Rimmelzwaan1">[50]</xref>, and that cat-to-cat transmission is possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Kuiken1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Thanawongnuwech1">[51]</xref>. Could cats, or other non-avian species, have played a role in spreading the reassortant viruses in Java? Similarly, could cats act as amplifying hosts facilitating viral expansion and cross-species transmission, as civets did in the SARS outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Guan2">[52]</xref>? Future experimental studies on these reassortant viruses, that assess viral transmissibility between species, together with epidemiological studies, such as viral monitoring within Indonesian animal populations using serological tests and PCR detection, would give more clues to these questions.</p>
<p>H5N1 HPAI viruses have been endemic and evolved into different genetic lineages that have spread across Indonesia. Areas where more than one lineage of virus is co-circulating, such as Jakarta, are most likely to generate novel viruses by inter-lineage reassortment. These reassortant viruses have distinctive evolutionary and transmission dynamics, as shown in this study. We suggest that more intensive and timely field surveillance and analysis of influenza viruses, including H5N1 HPAI and human H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 epidemic strains, should be employed, so that bio-security can be undertaken promptly and appropriate strains can be selected for vaccine production whenever a novel reassortant strain emerges. The reassortant viruses reported in this study should be also added to the watch list for the future epidemiological surveillance.</p>

<p>The geographic locations of virus isolation were either obtained from the sequence databases, or obtained through personal communication with Catherine Smith (from Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA), or inferred from their strain names (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000130.s015">S6</xref>). The locations of isolates were indicated on the map of main island of Java in Indonesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Due to the limit of our geographical data, the localities of the isolates shown in the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000130-g004">Figure 4</xref>) should be regarded as arbitrary within the province which is the highest precision level shared by all viral samples. Each of the reassortant viruses was assigned with a state of either Greater Jakarta (surroundings included) or West Java depending on its place of origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000130-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The geographical states of all ancestral nodes in the tree were estimated to achieve minimum state changes in overall, and therefore the number of state changes and state of the MRCA of the reassortant was obtained. Polytomies were randomly resolved 1,000 times, and state changes were estimated separately for each resolution. The mean number of state changes was then calculated. To test against the null hypothesis of completely unrestricted migration between geographical states (panmixis), the mean number of observed state changes was compared with the frequency distribution of the mean number of expected state changes under the null hypotheses. The null distribution and critical values were generated by randomly shuffling the states of isolates 5,000 times (the Slatkin-Maddison test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Slatkin1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Carrington1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Wallace1">[64]</xref>).

<p>The ancestral nucleotide sequences of all internal nodes were reconstructed using joint ML method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Pupko1">[68]</xref> implemented in HYPHY. Amino acid changes along the pre-emergence lineage were determined, and were then mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of M1 matrix protein molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000130-Arzt1">[30]</xref> available (PDB-ID: 1EA3) in RCSB Protein Data Bank.</p>
