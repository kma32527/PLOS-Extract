<p>To facilitate viral infection and spread, HIV-1 Nef disrupts the surface expression of the viral receptor (CD4) and molecules capable of presenting HIV antigens to the immune system (MHC-I). To accomplish this, Nef binds to the cytoplasmic tails of both molecules and then, by mechanisms that are not well understood, disrupts the trafficking of each molecule in different ways. Specifically, Nef promotes CD4 internalization after it has been transported to the cell surface, whereas Nef uses the clathrin adaptor, AP-1, to disrupt normal transport of MHC-I from the TGN to the cell surface. Despite these differences in initial intracellular trafficking, we demonstrate that MHC-I and CD4 are ultimately found in the same Rab7<sup>+</sup> vesicles and are both targeted for degradation via the activity of the Nef-interacting protein, β-COP. Moreover, we demonstrate that Nef contains two separable β-COP binding sites. One site, an arginine (RXR) motif in the N-terminal α helical domain of Nef, is necessary for maximal MHC-I degradation. The second site, composed of a di-acidic motif located in the C-terminal loop domain of Nef, is needed for efficient CD4 degradation. The requirement for redundant motifs with distinct roles supports a model in which Nef exists in multiple conformational states that allow access to different motifs, depending upon which cellular target is bound by Nef.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>HIV is unique among viral pathogens in its capacity to cause chronic and progressive disease in almost all infected people. To accomplish this, HIV must evade the host immune response, especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which normally function to lyse virally infected cells. HIV encodes a factor, Nef, which protects HIV infected cells from lysis by anti-HIV CTLs. To prevent CTL lysis, Nef interferes with the expression of host MHC-I, which is needed for CTL recognition of infected targets. A clear understanding of how Nef works has been hampered by its many complex functions. In addition to MHC-I, Nef protein disrupts the expression of multiple other cellular targets using different mechanisms and it is unclear how one protein can accomplish all these tasks. Here, we provide evidence that Nef acts as a highly flexible adaptor protein that is capable of utilizing different protein binding domains depending on which cellular target it is bound to. For example, we present evidence that Nef binding to MHC-I creates novel motifs that result in the recruitment of AP-1 and subsequently β-COP. This series of events results in the mis-localization of MHC-I from the cell surface to cellular degradative compartments, where MHC-I is destroyed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The HIV-1 accessory protein, Nef, affects the biology of the infected cell in several ways to achieve conditions optimal for viral replication and spread. Nef alters the intracellular trafficking of important immune molecules, such as class I and II major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHC-I and MHC-II), CD4, CD28, and DC-SIGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Garcia1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Swigut1">[5]</xref>. Nef-dependent reduction of surface MHC-I protects HIV-infected primary T cells from recognition and killing by HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Collins1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, disruption of MHC-I expression by HIV-1 and SIV Nef provides a selective advantage under immune pressure <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Carl1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Swigut2">[10]</xref>. CD4 downregulation by Nef is also essential for efficient viral spread. The rapid removal of CD4 prevents viral superinfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Benson1">[11]</xref>, and enables optimal viral particle production by eliminating detrimental CD4/HIV envelope interactions in the infected cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Lama1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Ross1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis of protein-protein interaction domains has revealed that Nef uses genetically separable mechanisms to affect MHC-I and CD4 transport. Specifically, disruption of MHC-I surface expression requires an N-terminal α helix, a polyproline repeat, and an acidic domain in Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Greenberg1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Mangasarian1">[15]</xref>, while CD4 downregulation requires an intact dileucine motif, two diacidic motifs, and a hydrophobic pocket in Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Mangasarian1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet1">[18]</xref>. Amino acids necessary for the myristoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Aiken1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Peng1">[20]</xref> and oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Liu1">[21]</xref> of Nef are required for the disruption of both MHC-I and CD4 surface expression.</p>
<p>Nef has the capacity to affect MHC-I transport at multiple subcellular locations; Nef blocks the export of newly-synthesized MHC-I from the secretory pathway and Nef expression results in a small increase in the rate of MHC-I internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper1">[22]</xref>. To accomplish this, Nef directly binds to the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I early in the secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper2">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Williams2">[26]</xref>. The Nef-MHC-I complex then actively recruits the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-1, which targets MHC-I from the TGN to the endo-lysosomal network where it is ultimately degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. Recruitment of AP-1 primarily requires a methionine at position 20 in the N-terminal α helical domain of Nef and a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I. Additionally, the acidic and polyproline domains of Nef have recently been shown to stabilize this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Noviello1">[28]</xref>. The normal function of AP-1 is to target proteins into the endosomal pathway and then recycle them back to the TGN. Thus, the AP-1 interaction with the Nef/MHC-I complex explains the targeting of MHC-I containing vesicles to the endosomal pathway and to the TGN. However, it does not explain accelerated degradation of MHC-I, hence other cellular factors may be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanism of Nef-induced CD4 internalization and degradation has been derived, in part, from correlating Nef function with the requirement for domains in the C-terminal flexible loop region of Nef that bind to cellular factors. The Nef dileucine motif (ExxxLL<sub>165</sub>) is needed for CD4 internalization and it binds to adaptor protein complexes AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Bresnahan1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Akagawa1">[36]</xref>. In addition, a diacidic motif, which is also required, enhances the interaction of Nef with AP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Lindwasser1">[37]</xref>. There is separate evidence that this diacidic motif may recruit the H subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V1H) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Lu1">[38]</xref> to promote AP-2 recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Geyer1">[39]</xref>. Because the normal role of AP-2 is to link cargo to clathrin and promote internalization, it makes sense that this molecule would be necessary and indeed, the involvement of AP-2 has now been confirmed using RNAi knockdown in a number of cell systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Chaudhuri1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Stove1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>After CD4 is internalized, it is targeted to lysosomes for degradation. There is evidence that this step requires β-COP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet1">[18]</xref>, a component of COP-1 coats implicated in endosomal trafficking as well as transport through the early secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Daro1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Gu1">[45]</xref>. Specifically, there are defects in the Nef-dependent transport of CD4 into acidified vesicles at the non-permissive temperature in cells harboring a temperature sensitive ε-COP mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet1">[18]</xref>. Nef directly interacts with β-COP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Benichou1">[46]</xref>, and a second diacidic motif in the C-terminal loop domain of Nef has been demonstrated to mediate this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Faure1">[47]</xref>, although, this result has not been reproducible by another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Janvier3">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>To more clearly understand the mechanism of altered MHC-I and CD4 trafficking observed in Nef-expressing cells, we directly compared these two processes in T cells that expressed Nef. We confirmed that Nef primarily affected MHC-I and CD4 at different subcellular locations and we demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tails of the respective molecules dictated which pathway was utilized. Despite the differences in initial trafficking, we found that HLA-A2 and CD4 co-localized in a discrete subset of vesicular structures. Upon further inspection, we determined that these structures also contained markers of late endosomes (Rab7) and to a lesser extent, the lysosomal marker, LAMP-1. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed that CD4 and HLA-A2 were found within MVBs of Nef-expressing T cells. HLA-A2 (but not CD4) was also found in tubulovesicular structures adjacent to the Golgi. In Nef expressing cells, reduction of β-COP expression reduced the targeting of HLA-A2 from the TGN to LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> compartments and stabilized CD4 expression within endosomal compartments. Finally, we identified two separate domains within Nef that were necessary for these activities and for β-COP binding. These data support a model in which both MHC-I and CD4 are ultimately targeted to the lysosomes in Nef expressing cells by a final common pathway.</p>

<title>The cytoplasmic tail dictates the pathway utilized by Nef to eliminate MHC-I and CD4 surface expression</title>
<p>It is known that Nef binds to the cytoplasmic tails of both CD4 and MHC–I, but that it affects them differently. To better understand the similarities and differences governing these two pathways, we examined the trafficking of CD4, HLA-A2 and a chimeric molecule in which the wild type HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail was substituted with the CD4 cytoplasmic tail (HA-A2/CD4). A flow cytometric analysis of steady state surface expression revealed that Nef dramatically reduced steady state surface expression of all three molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with prior studies, we found that CD4 was rapidly internalized from the cell surface in Nef expressing T cells, whereas wild type HLA-A2 was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Substitution of the CD4 tail for the HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail was sufficient to confer this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, prior studies have shown that Nef disrupts cell surface expression of MHC-I by blocking the transport of newly synthesized MHC-I from the TGN to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper2">[23]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, Nef inhibited HLA-A2 forward transport by approximately 75%, whereas CD4 was unaffected at Nef levels that had a clear effect on HLA-A2 transport. Slight effects on CD4 could be observed at higher Nef levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1D, lane 8</xref>). The substitution of the HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail with the CD4 tail reduced the ability of Nef to disrupt forward trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, sequences in the cytoplasmic tails of CD4 and HLA-A2 determine how Nef disrupts their trafficking.</p>

<p>(A) Reduction of surface expression of HLA-A2, CD4 and A2/CD4 as measured by flow cytometry. CEM HA-HLA-A2 and CEM HA-A2/CD4 cells were transduced with a control adenovirus (<italic>nef<sup>−</sup></italic>) or adeno-Nef (<italic>nef<sup>+</sup></italic>) and stained for surface HLA-A2 and CD4. The histograms shaded gray represent cells treated with control adenovirus, and the solid black line indicates cells treated with adeno-Nef. (B-C) Measurements of surface stability. CEM HA-HLA-A2 and HA-A2/CD4 cells were treated with adenovirus as in part A and the internalization of endogenous CD4 (B) or A2/CD4 (C) was compared to the internalization of HLA-A2. The filled squares represent control (<italic>nef−</italic>) cells, and the open squares represent adeno-Nef (<italic>nef<sup>+</sup></italic>) cells. Quantitation of part B was compiled from four independent experiments performed in duplicate. Part C is representative of two experiments performed in triplicate. (D–E) HLA-A2 is inefficiently transported to the cell surface in T cells expressing Nef. CEM HA-HLA-A2 and CEM HA-A2/CD4 cells were transduced as in part A. Metabolic labeling with continuous surface biotinylation was performed in the presence of a cell-impermeable biotinylation reagent [NHS-biotin, (Pierce)] to label cell surface proteins. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated first with an antibody against HLA-A2 or CD4 (part D) or anti-HA (part E), then 2/3 was re-precipitated with avidin beads to selectively precipitate the HLA-A2 on the cell surface. Normalized surface MHC-I was calculated as follows: ((surface MHC-I /total MHC-I×2)×100). Quantitation for parts D and E represents the mean±standard deviation for four and three independent experiments respectively. For part D, quantitation is derived from data for the lower of the two Nef levels shown.</p>

<title>CD4 and a subset of HLA-A2 proteins are found in late endosomes and lysosomes of Nef-expressing T cells</title>
<p>To better understand the similarities and differences between MHC-I and CD4 trafficking in Nef-expressing cells, we compared the steady-state distribution of these molecules in T cells using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that Nef expression caused the bulk of MHC-I to cluster in the perinuclear region where, in agreement with many other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Greenberg1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-LeGall1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Swann1">[49]</xref>, it co-localized with markers of the TGN (data not shown). Interestingly, we also identified a subset of HLA-A2 that co-localized with CD4 in vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; arrows show example vesicles). To further identify these structures, we simultaneously stained for HLA-A2, CD4, and organelle markers using 3-color confocal microscopy (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s001">Table S1</xref>). Our results indicated that CD4 was mainly found in discrete vesicular structures, which also contained HLA-A2 (91.9% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> vesicles co-localized with HLA-A2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s001">Table S1</xref>) and markers of late endosomes and lysosomes. Overall, the best marker for structures containing both HLA-A2 and CD4 was Rab7 (94%, of CD4+ vesicles co-localized with Rab 7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, arrowheads mark example vesicles). CD4 and HLA-A2 were also found to co-localize with markers of lysosomes, such as LAMP-1. However, the vesicles with the most intense LAMP-1 staining did not contain either HLA-A2 or CD4, possibly because of degradation. Consistent with this, the co-localization of HLA-A2 and CD4 was dramatically increased when the cells were treated with bafilomycin, which inhibits degradation in acidic compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s003">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the normal steady-state co-localization of HLA-A2 and CD4 in Nef expressing cells was limited because degradation prevented accumulation in this compartment.</p>

<title>Colocalization of HLA-A2 and CD4 in MVBs</title>
<p>To further discern these structures, we also examined them using electron microscopy (EM). In agreement with the confocal data, our EM analysis revealed that compared with control cells in which both HLA-A2 and CD4 were found on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2B, panel 1</xref>), in Nef-expressing T cells, the majority of CD4 was found in MVBs, co-localizing with HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2B, panel 2</xref>). In addition, we also noted substantial HLA-A2, but not CD4, accumulating in tubulovesicular structures adjacent to Golgi stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2B, panel 3</xref>). In separate experiments these structures were also found to contain AP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Based on these studies, it appears that the majority of HLA-A2 resides in tubulovesicular structures in the region of the TGN with AP-1, whereas at any given time, a small subset can be found in the endosomal compartment with CD4.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Required cellular co-factors</title>
<p>To further elucidate the similarities and differences between these pathways, we examined the role of known Nef-interacting proteins implicated in intracellular trafficking. AP-1 is a heterotetrameric adaptor protein involved in protein sorting from the TGN and it has been previously demonstrated to interact with MHC-I molecules in Nef expressing HIV-infected primary T cells and to direct MHC-I into the endolysosomal pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. Nef is also known to interact with β-COP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Benichou1">[46]</xref>, a component of COP-1 vesicles also involved in endosomal trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Daro1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Gu1">[45]</xref>. Indeed, expression of wild type COP 1 components is needed for targeting CD4 into acidic vesicles in Nef-expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<title>The effect of knocking down β-COP expression on the structural integrity of the Golgi</title>
<p>Because β-COP is known to be important for intra-Golgi and ER-to-Golgi trafficking, we asked whether the Golgi structure or MHC-I trafficking were drastically affected by reduced β-COP expression. We found that there was only a small reduction in the normal transport of MHC-I to the cell surface (35% reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, cells lacking β–COP generally maintained overall Golgi structure as assessed by the intracellular localization of giantin, a transmembrane protein normally residing in the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>medial</italic> Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Linstedt1">[51]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).

The relatively mild phenotype of this knock-down compared to the drastic effects of brefeldin A, suggests that brefeldin A has effects other than just disrupting COP 1 coats by blocking ARF1 activity.</p>
<p>Having established that knocking down β-COP allowed relatively normal forward trafficking of HLA-A2, we proceeded to assess the effect of knocking down β-COP or AP-1 in Nef-expressing cells. Consistent with previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>, we found that knocking down the ubiquitously expressed form of AP-1 (AP-1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Folsch1">[52]</xref>) largely reversed the effect of Nef on HLA-A2 (p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), but had a smaller and less significant effect (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.02) on CD4 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).

The small effect of β-COP on CD4 surface expression indicated that β-COP was not necessary for CD4 internalization and downmodulation from the cell surface.

<title>A role for β-COP in promoting degradation of Nef cellular targets</title>
<p>Prior studies had determined that expression of β-COP was necessary for acidification of CD4-containing vesicles and thus it was hypothesized that β-COP was needed to target vesicles containing internalized CD4 for lysosomal degradation. Therefore, we asked whether the role of β-COP in MHC-I trafficking was also to promote MHC-I degradation. To examine this, we utilized an assay we had developed, which measures the loss of mature, endo H–resistant HA-tagged HLA-A2 in Nef expressing cells by western blot analysis. This assay system is based on previous data demonstrating Nef-dependent degradation of the mature form of MHC-I in a manner that is reversible by inhibitors of lysosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C, under normal</xref>, steady state conditions, most of the HLA-A2 is resistant to endo H digestion, indicating that it has matured through the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C, lane 2</xref>). However, when Nef was expressed, we observed a dramatic reduction in total MHC-I and a decrease in the ratio of endo H resistant to sensitive protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C compare lanes 2 and 18</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s005">Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with a role for AP-1, we observed that AP-1A shRNA largely reversed this effect of Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C, compare lanes 18 and 20</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4D</xref> for quantification). To detect degradation of molecules containing a CD4 tail, we used HA-A2/CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and found that Nef expression accelerated the degradation of endo H resistant forms of this molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C, compare lanes 6 and 22</xref>). However, we found that there was no effect of reduced AP-1A expression on Nef-dependent degradation of molecules containing the CD4 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C, compare lanes 22 and 24</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4D</xref> for quantification).</p>
<p>When β-COP expression was reduced, we observed a small increase in the amount of immature, endo H–sensitive protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g004">Figure 4C, compare lanes 10 and 12</xref>), consistent with the 35% reduction in export of MHC-I to the cell surface shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g003">Figure 3D</xref>.

<title>β-COP is required for targeting internalized CD4 for degradation in Nef-expressing T cells</title>

<title>β-COP is required for targeting MHC-I to LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> compartments in Nef-expressing T cells</title>
<p>Confocal analysis of MHC-I intracellular localization revealed that expression of β-COP shRNA in control cells increased the intracellular accumulation of MHC-I, consistent with the slowing of export we observed in cells deficient in β-COP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g005">Figure 5D, compare rows 1 and 2</xref>). Infection with Nef-expressing HIV resulted in the loss of cell surface MHC-I and an increase in intracellular MHC-I, some of which co-localized with LAMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g005">Figure 5D, compare rows 1 and 3</xref>). Under these conditions, reduction of β-COP expression reduced the degree of colocalization with LAMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g005">Figure 5D, compare rows 3 and 4</xref>).</p>
<p>To enhance our ability to observe trafficking of MHC-I into LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> compartments, we treated the cells with bafilomycin, which inhibits the vacuolar ATPase and thus acidification and degradation within lysosomal compartments. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>, bafilomycin treatment enhanced our ability to detect MHC-I in LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> compartments in Nef-expressing T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g005">Figure 5D, compare rows 3 and 7</xref>). The expression of β-COP shRNA decreased LAMP-1 colocalization with MHC-I, consistent with a role for β-COP in targeting MHC-I for degradation in lysosomal compartments in Nef expressing T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g005">Figure 5D, compare rows 7 and 8</xref>). Similar results were observed whether Nef was introduced using HIV or adenoviral vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g005">Figure 5E and 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also examined co-localization of HLA-A2 and CD4 in cells that expressed β-COP shRNA. We observed that reduction of β-COP expression resulted in increased staining of both proteins, and did not disrupt their co-localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s006">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, β-COP was not necessary for targeting these proteins into a common endosomal pathway, but rather was needed for their subsequent targeting into a degradative pathway.</p>

<title>The cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I is necessary for AP-1 binding in Nef-expressing T cells</title>
<p>To further explore the molecular mechanism for the similarities and differences in MHC-I and CD4 trafficking in Nef-expressing T cells, we asked whether these molecules differed as to how well they bound Nef or cellular factors. As expected, we found that HIV Nef bound to both the HLA-A2 and the CD4 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g006">Figure 6A, right panel</xref>). However, AP-1 only co-precipitated with molecules containing the HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g006">Figure 6A, right panel</xref>). The chimeric molecule with the CD4 cytoplasmic tail did not bind AP-1 in Nef-expressing T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g006">Figure 6A, right panel</xref>). In these experiments, we noted that the expression level of A2/CD4 was lower than for wild type HLA-A2, which could explain this difference. Therefore, we confirmed these data using a fusion protein containing either HLA-A2 or A2/CD4 directly fused to full length HIV-Nef protein. In previously published experiments it was shown that the HLA-A2/Nef fusion protein co-precipitated AP-1 in a manner that depended on sequences both in Nef and in the HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>.

Finally, mutation of the Nef acidic domain (E<sub>62–65</sub>Q), which disrupts binding to MHC-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Williams2">[26]</xref>, AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Noviello1">[28]</xref> and PACS-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet3">[54]</xref>, did not affect binding to β-COP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g007">Figure 7, compare lanes 3 and 6</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, we found that V<sub>10</sub>EΔ<sub>17–26</sub> Nef, which was defective at β-COP binding, was also defective at inducing the degradation of the endo H resistant form of HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g007">Figure 7D, upper panel, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6</xref>). In contrast, V<sub>10</sub>EΔ17–26 Nef was not defective at A2/CD4 degradation based on western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g007">Figure 7D, lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6</xref>). These data suggested that there may be another interaction domain that recruits β-COP to the Nef-CD4 complex to promote CD4 degradation. This would be consistent with the faint band observable in the V<sub>10</sub>EΔ<sub>17–26</sub>-Nef mutant immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g007">Figure 7C, lane 5, longer exposure</xref>) and prior publications demonstrating that mutation of E<sub>154/155</sub> also affected β-COP binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Faure1">[47]</xref>. Thus, there may be two independent binding sites for β-COP within Nef, each of which governs the degradation of a different cellular factor.</p>
<p>To further define the β-COP binding site, and to determine whether there were indeed two β-COP binding sites, we constructed additional Nef mutants. We focused on the arginine residues (R<sub>17</sub>ER<sub>19</sub>MR<sub>21</sub>R<sub>22</sub>) within the Nef deletion Δ17–26) because previous studies had indicated that arginine rich regions could form β-COP-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Vivithanaporn1">[55]</xref>. Flow cytometric analysis of MHC-I levels on cells expressing these mutants revealed that the R<sub>17/19</sub> pair was necessary for maximal MHC-I downmodulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). In contrast, mutation of R<sub>21/22</sub> did not significantly affect MHC-I downmodulation (unpublished data). An assessment of Nef-induced degradation by pulse chase analysis of HA-HLA-A2, revealed that mutating this motif also inhibited Nef-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8C, compare lanes 5 and 7</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Additionally, mutation of R<sub>17/19</sub> reduced, but did not eliminate binding of β-COP to Nef in a manner similar to the effect of the Δ17–26 Nef mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8E, compare lanes 3 and 4</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Flow cytometric analysis of HLA-A2 and CD4 expression in cells expressing Nef mutants. CEM T cells stably expressing HLA-A2 were spin-transduced with murine retroviral supernatants that express the indicated Nef construct and a GFP cassette from an internal ribosomal entry site. The cells were gated for GFP expression and results of HLA-A2 (top panel) or endogenous CD4 (bottom panel) staining are shown. R/E stands for R<sub>17,19</sub>A/E<sub>154,155</sub>A double mutant. Open light gray curve, parental cell line; shaded dark gray curve, empty vector; black shaded curve, wild type Nef; and open dark gray curve, Nef mutant. (B) Quantification of down-modulation. The mean±SD for greater than or equal to six experiments (actual number varies depending on the mutant) is shown. (C,D) R<sub>17/19</sub> is needed for optimal HLA-A2 degradation, whereas the E<sub>154/155</sub> is dispensable. CEM T cells expressing HLA-A2 and Nef were generated as described in part A. The cells were pulse labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled amino acids, chased for 0 or 12 hours in complete medium and lysed. HLA-A2 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HLA-A2 antibody BB7.2, separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified using a phosphorimager. “Ig Control” indicates results from HLA-A2-negative parental CEM cells immunoprecipitated with BB7.2 antibody. (D) Quantification of degradation. Nef activity was calculated as follows: (the fraction of HLA-A2 remaining in control cells /the fraction of HLA-A2 remaining in Nef expressing cells). The value obtained for each mutant was divided by that for wild type Nef and multiplied by 100 to calculate % wild type activity. The mean±SD for two experiments is shown. (E) R<sub>17/19</sub> and E<sub>154/155</sub> are required for the β-COP/Nef interaction. CEM T cells expressing HA-A2 were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing either wild-type Nef or the indicated Nef mutant. The cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti–β-COP antibody and the presence of Nef was assessed by western blot as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>. The Ig control is HLA-A2–negative parental CEM cells expressing wild-type Nef immunoprecipitated with a control antibody (BB7.2) and the vector only control is CEM cells expressing HLA-A2 transduced with the empty retroviral vector.</p>

<p>We next examined the diacidic motif (E<sub>154/155</sub>) previously implicated in β-COP binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>, mutation of this motif did not disrupt MHC-I downmodulation, in fact downmodulation was somewhat enhanced. Additionally, we found that mutation of this motif did not reduce MHC-I degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8C, compare lanes 5 and 11</xref>, see also quantification in 8D). However, in agreement with prior results, we observed a partial defect in β-COP binding with this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8E, compare lanes 3 and 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Piguet1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Faure1">[47]</xref>. However, this defect was less reproducible (observed in two out of four experiments) than that observed with disruption of R<sub>17/19</sub> (consistently observed in five out of five experiments), suggesting that binding to R<sub>17/19</sub> can mask the defect observed with mutation of E<sub>154/155</sub> under certain conditions. To provide additional data supporting the possibility that both sites contributed to β-COP binding, we constructed a double mutant, R<sub>17/19</sub> A and E<sub>154/155</sub>A (R/E). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8E, lane 5</xref>, binding of R/E to β-COP was further reduced relative to binding of Nef proteins containing single mutations in each motif, strongly implicating both motifs in β-COP binding. The phenotype of the double mutant was highly reproducible in 5 out of 5 experiments.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the R/E double mutant was not more defective than R<sub>17/19</sub>A at downmodulating MHC-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figures 8A and 8B</xref>) or at promoting MHC-I degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8C, compare lanes 7 and 9</xref>, quantified in 8D), indicating that Nef did not utilize the E<sub>154/155</sub> binding site to recruit β-COP for MHC-I degradation. Conversely, we confirmed prior reports that the E<sub>154/155</sub>A mutant was defective at CD4 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">Figure 9A, compare lanes 3 and 6</xref>) and determined moreover that there was no significant effect of mutating R<sub>17/19</sub> on CD4 degradation, either alone or in combination with E<sub>154/155</sub>A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">Figure 9A, compare lanes 3 and 4</xref>). It is also worth noting that, in contrast to what was observed with HLA-A2, we did not observe a clear correlation between the relative CD4 surface expression and the relative level of total cellular CD4 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">9B</xref>), indicating that there was a complex relationship between total cellular CD4 and the fraction expressed on the cell surface.</p>

<p>(A) Cells expressing HA-HLA-A2/CD4 were treated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, lysed and treated with endo H as indicated.

The mean±SD for four experiments is shown. (C) Model for the mechanism by which Nef affects CD4 and MHC-I trafficking. HIV Nef binds the CD4 cytoplasmic tail at the cell surface, and recruits AP-2 and/or the vacuolar-ATPase to facilitate internalization. CD4 is internalized and is transported to an endosomal compartment associated with Rab7 and β-COP. In contrast, Nef binds the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail early in the secretory pathway, AP-1 is recruited and facilitates transport to an intermediate endosomal compartment marked with Rab7. If AP-1 falls off the Nef-MHC-I complex after arrival in the endosome, Nef binds β-COP and targets MHC-I (and CD4) to lysosomes for degradation. If AP-1 remains bound, it promotes recycling of the Nef-MHC-I complex to the TGN. LY = lysosome, LE/MVB = late endosome/multi-vesicular body.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s007">Figure S5</xref>, mutation of R<sub>17,19</sub> (and E<sub>154/155</sub>) decreased AP-1 binding only slightly.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Expression of HIV Nef in infected cells protects them from lysis by CTLs and this activity of Nef is due to downmodulation of MHC-I surface expression. The Nef protein also prevents superinfection and promotes viral spread by removing the viral receptor, CD4 from the cell surface (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth2">[56]</xref>). We provide evidence that sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of these molecules are important for determining whether Nef disrupts their trafficking from the cell surface or at the TGN. These data, that swapping cytoplasmic domains switches the initial pathways taken by HLA-A2 and CD4 in the presence of Nef, may seem somewhat obvious. Nef is always the same and thus one might conclude that this information has to be contained in the modulated protein. However, it was also possible that the ectodomain affected Nef responsiveness by binding to other transmembrane proteins or by altering intracellular trafficking. This was certainly a possibility for MHC-I for which it is clear that the efficiency of peptide loading can affect trafficking and we have found that trafficking rates affect responsiveness to Nef and AP-1 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper2">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that Nef initially binds to hypo-phosphorylated forms of the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail early in the secretory compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper2">[23]</xref>, but binding does not affect normal transit through the Golgi apparatus and into the TGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. The Nef-MHC-I complex then recruits the AP-1 heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor protein using a binding site that is created when Nef binds the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail. This binding site requires a methionine from the N-terminal α helix of Nef and a tyrosine residue in the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. Additionally, there is evidence that this complex is stabilized by the acidic and polyproline domains of Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Noviello1">[28]</xref>. Formation of this complex results in the re-direction of MHC-I trafficking in such a way that it is targeted to lysosomes for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. However, cellular proteins that normally bind AP-1 are not degraded, but rather recycled to the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). Here we present new evidence that Nef utilizes β-COP to promote trafficking to degradative compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). Knocking down expression of β-COP inhibited the degradation of MHC-I and it did so by blocking the transport of MHC-I from intracellular vesicles to LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> compartments. We also provide results here that confirm β-COP is necessary for degradation of CD4 in lysosomal compartments. Thus, we propose that AP-1 and AP-2 deliver MHC-I and CD4 respectively to endosomal compartments where β-COP displaces AP-1 and AP-2 to target MHC-I and CD4 for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).</p>
<p>As described above, we found that knocking down β-COP with shRNA resulted in stabilization of internalized CD4, however the effect on CD4 surface expression was small, but still significant. In contrast, there was a greater effect of β-COP knockdown on HLA-A2 surface expression. This might suggest that the role of β-COP in the modulation of these targets was different, rather than the same. However, this apparent paradox can be explained by our model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000131-g009">Figure 9C</xref>. As indicated, differences in response to β-COP knockdown can be explained by differences in the intracellular pathways of these proteins before they interact with β-COP. MHC-I is engaged in an AP-1-dependent endosome-to-TGN loop, and MHC-I could “leak” out to the cell surface from the TGN in the absence of β-COP, whereas CD4 may be unable to return to the cell surface from its endosomal compartment. Consistent with this, we also noted a lack of correlation between degradation and surface expression of CD4 (but not MHC-I) when Nef mutants that were defective in β-COP binding were examined. These data indicate that there is a complex relationship between total cellular CD4 and the fraction that is present on the cell surface and thus intracellular pools need to be directly examined to assess degradation rather than relying on surface expression as an indicator of the efficiency of this process.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that shRNA knockdown of β-COP did not fully reverse Nef-dependent MHC-I and CD4 degradation. This may have resulted from incomplete knockdown of β-COP. However, we also observed a similar phenotype with Nef mutants defective at β-COP binding. Failure to fully reverse degradation may be secondary to a default degradative pathway that exists for all proteins delivered to endosomal pathways. Alternatively, there may be other ways Nef targets these proteins to lysosomes, which have yet to be identified.</p>
<p>Our studies indicate that there are at least three domains needed for Nef to interact efficiently with β-COP. One of these domains (D<sub>123</sub>), is required for dimerization of Nef and is needed to affect a variety of Nef functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Liu1">[21]</xref>. Another region lies within the N-terminal α helical domain of Nef that is specifically required for disruption of MHC-I trafficking and for interactions with AP- 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>. This binding site for β-COP is distinct from that used by AP-1, because recruitment of β-COP does not require Nef's acidic domain or Nef M<sub>20</sub>, whereas AP-1 does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>. The fact that these Nef mutants bind β-COP, but are still defective at MHC-downmodulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Tomiyama1">[53]</xref> makes sense, because these mutants are also unable to bind the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Williams2">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Additional mutants, which focused on the highly conserved stretch of arginines in the N-terminal alpha helical domain of Nef (R<sub>17</sub>XRMRR<sub>22</sub>), revealed that the regions involved in AP-1 and β-COP binding were very closely apposed. However, we determined that mutation of R<sub>17/19</sub> affected primarily β-COP binding, with only a minimal effect on AP-1 interaction. Thus, these two Nef-interacting proteins have distinct and separable amino acid requirements for binding.</p>
<p>The identification of a β-COP binding domain within a region of Nef that is also required for Nef to accelerate MHC-I degradation confirms the requirement for β-COP in this pathway. In addition, the residual binding of β-COP to these Nef mutants provided suggestive data that another binding site for β-COP existed. Indeed, we were able to confirm prior evidence that a diacidic motif within the C-terminal loop of Nef also promoted an interaction with β-COP and that mutation of this motif reduced CD4 degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Faure1">[47]</xref>. Finally, we demonstrated that mutation of both the RXR and the diacidic motifs resulted in the greatest defect in β-COP binding. The double mutant did not however result in a greater defect in either MHC-I or CD4 degradation, indicating the role of each motif is distinct and not additive. The discovery of two distinct β-COP binding motifs helps explain why some groups could not confirm the role of the diacidic motif in β-COP binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Janvier3">[48]</xref> as both motifs need to be mutated to reliably eliminate an interaction between β-COP and Nef.</p>
<p>There is precedent for such redundancy. For example, there are two AP-1 binding sites within Nef; a dileucine motif within the C-terminal flexible loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Bresnahan1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Greenberg2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Craig2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Janvier1">[33]</xref> as well as a second site that forms upon binding of Nef to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail. Despite the presence of two AP-1 signals, only one is active in the context of the natural Nef-MHC-I complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>. The dileucine motif in the C-terminal flexible loop can become activated to affect MHC-I transport, but only when Nef is artificially fused to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>. This result indicates there is no inherent inability of this signal to affect MHC-I traffic but rather that something else, such as the structure of the natural complex, causes the dileucine motif to be inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Wonderlich1">[27]</xref>. The dileucine motif at position 164 is located close to the diacidic motif at position 154 that binds β-COP to promote CD4 degradation. The fact that both of these motifs are inactive when Nef is bound to MHC-I, suggests that much of the C-terminal flexible loop region of Nef is inaccessible under these conditions. Thus, Nef behaves as though it assumes different structural forms in different contexts to differentially expose distinct trafficking signals.</p>
<p>We also present evidence that knock down of β-COP yielded a distinct phenotype from BFA treatment. As described above, BFA is a chemical inhibitor of ARF1, that is known to trigger the reversible collapse of the <italic>cis-medial</italic> Golgi compartments to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Donaldson1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Graham1">[59]</xref> by inhibiting an ARF-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (ARF-GEF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Donaldson2">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Helms1">[61]</xref>. Because ARF1 activity is necessary for recruitment of β-COP to membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Donaldson3">[62]</xref>, it was possible that the dramatic effects of BFA resulted from the inability for β-COP to function normally. However, our results demonstrating that knockdown of β-COP had no effect on overall Golgi structure indicate that the dramatic effects of BFA are not due solely to disruption of β-COP function in the Golgi.</p>
<p>Given the important role of β-COP in the Golgi, it is surprising that β-COP bound to Nef does not also affect transport of MHC-I through the ER/Golgi. It is possible that our inability to detect an effect of Nef on early transport of MHC-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Roeth1">[25]</xref> may be a result of the cell type chosen for these studies. T cells, which are an important natural target of HIV, normally traffic MHC-I through the early secretory pathway slowly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper2">[23]</xref> and thus it might be difficult to further reduce the trafficking speed through an interaction with β-COP. Interestingly, another group has reported a reduced ER-Golgi exit rate for MHC-I in Nef-expressing HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Lubben1">[63]</xref>, which normally transport MHC-I more rapidly than T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper2">[23]</xref>. We have made similar observations in astrocytoma cells expressing higher levels of Nef than typically needed to observe MHC-I downmodulation (Roeth and Collins, unpublished observations). Further studies will be needed to determine whether this effect of Nef plays a role in more physiologically relevant cell systems and whether this effect of Nef might be dependent on β-COP expression.</p>
<p>A recent report indicates that the effect of Nef on internalization of MHC-I, which is only minimally apparent in our system, occurs via a PI3-kinase dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Hung1">[64]</xref>. This publication reported that CEM cells, which were used in our study, have less PTEN (a phosphatase that inhibits PI3-kinase) than another T cell line used in their study (H9). This deficiency might make it relatively more difficult for us to detect an effect of chemical PI3-kinase inhibitors, but would not affect our ability to detect a PI3-kinase-dependent trafficking pathway. In fact, one would expect the opposite, that the PI3-kinase-dependent pathway would be more active in our system. However, we have found that Nef has a relatively small effect on internalization of MHC-I, and mainly affects MHC-I protein export and degradation. These data have been corroborated in HIV-infected primary T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Williams2">[26]</xref>, which were also found to much lower levels of PTEN than H9 cells did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Hung1">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>From a teleological perspective, it makes sense that Nef would have evolved to target early forms of MHC-I, which harbor antigens derived from the newly synthesized viral proteins. Older forms of MHC-I already on the cell surface would be bound to normal cellular antigens and would in fact be protective as they would inhibit killing by natural killer cells that are stimulated to lyse cells with abnormally low MHC-I expression. On the other hand, it makes sense that Nef, an early viral protein, would have evolved to target surface CD4 to rapidly and efficiently remove CD4 in order to prepare the cell for rapid release of viral particles and to render the cell resistant to re-infection. Meanwhile, a late protein, Vpu, is expressed in infected cells and specifically targets the newly synthesized CD4 for degradation, preventing any additional CD4 from reaching the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Willey1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>In sum, we have found that the HIV Nef protein commandeers the cellular trafficking machinery efficiently by utilizing their natural activities for abnormal purposes. The fact that these pathways may end in a final common step raises the important possibility that inhibitors might be developed that could block multiple Nef functions.</p>

For experiments using the GFP-expressing FG12 lentivirus for shRNA expression, the GFP-positive cells were gated to identify the subset of transduced cells (generally &gt;90% of cells). Endocytosis assays were performed as previously described with minor modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000131-Kasper1">[22]</xref>. Briefly, cells were washed once with Endocytosis Buffer [D-PBS, 10 mM HEPES, 10 µg/ml BSA (NEB)], then stained with primary antibody (described above) for 20 minutes on ice. After washing, the cells were resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin (R10) (pre-warmed to 37°C) and replicate aliquots were removed and placed on ice for each time point. Cells were then washed and stained with goat anti-mouse-phycoerythrin (BioSource, 1∶250) and the samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Flow cytometry data was processed using FlowJo v4.4.3 software (Treestar Corp.).

The gold labeling was carried out at room temperature on a piece of parafilm. All antibodies and protein A gold were diluted in 1% BSA. The diluted antibody solution was centrifuged 1 minute at 14,000 rpm prior to labeling to avoid possible aggregates. Grids were floated on drops of 1% BSA for 10 minutes to block for unspecific labeling, transferred to 5 µl drops of primary antibody and incubated for 30 minutes. The grids were then washed in 4 µl drops of PBS for a total of 15 minutes, transferred to 5 µl drops of Protein-A gold for 20 minutes, washed in 4 µl drops of PBS for 15 minutes and 6 µl drops of double distilled water. Contrasting/embedding of the labeled grids was carried out on ice in 0.3% uranyl acetete in 2% methyl cellulose for 10 minutes. Grids were picked up with metal loops (diameter slightly larger than the grid) and the excess liquid was removed by streaking on a filter paper (Whatman #1), leaving a thin coat of methyl cellulose (bluish interference color when dry).

<p>(A) Characterization of HA-HLA-A2 protein forms using western blot analysis. CEM T cells expressing HA-HLA-A2 were lysed and treated with either Endo H or neuraminidase. The samples were then analyzed via Western blot. (B) CEM T cells expressing HA-HLA-A2 and Nef or a control adenoviral vector were lysed, normalized for total protein, digested with endo H, and probed for HA-HLA-A2 by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody.</p>

<p>Shβ-COP does not disrupt co-localization of CD4 and HLA-A2, but does increase the amount of stainable protein within the cell. HLA-A2 CEM cells were transduced with a lentivirus expressing control (shNC) or β-COP (shβ-COP) shRNA. After 3 days, the cells were transduced with adeno-Nef. After three additional days, the cells were stained with antibodies directed against HLA-A2 and CD4 as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000131.s003">Figure S1</xref>. Images were taken with an Olympus FV-500 confocal microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Single Z-sections are shown.</p>

<p>Mutation of R17/19 and E154/155 only slightly diminishes the amount of Nef and AP-1 coprecipitating with HLA-A2. CEM cells expressing HA-HLA-A2 were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing either wild type Nef or the indicated Nef mutant. The cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HLA-A2 antibody (BB7.2), and the presence of Nef was assessed by Western blot as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>. “Control” indicates lysates from parental CEM T cells that lack HLA-A2, but that express wild-type Nef. “Vector only” indicates CEM T cells expressing HA-A2 transduced with empty retroviral vector.</p>
