<p>The protease-resistant prion protein (PrP<sup>res</sup>) of a few natural scrapie isolates identified in sheep, reminiscent of the experimental isolate CH1641 derived from a British natural scrapie case, showed partial molecular similarities to ovine bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Recent discovery of an atypical form of BSE in cattle, L-type BSE or BASE, suggests that also this form of BSE might have been transmitted to sheep. We studied by Western blot the molecular features of PrP<sup>res</sup> in four “CH1641-like” natural scrapie isolates after transmission in an ovine transgenic model (TgOvPrP4), to see if “CH1641-like” isolates might be linked to L-type BSE. We found less diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> than in classical BSE, but similar glycoform proportions and apparent molecular masses of the usual PrP<sup>res</sup> form (PrP<sup>res</sup> #1) to L-type BSE. However, the “CH1641-like” isolates differed from both L-type and classical BSE by an abundant, C-terminally cleaved PrP<sup>res</sup> product (PrP<sup>res</sup> #2) specifically recognised by a C-terminal antibody (SAF84). Differential immunoprecipitation of PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 and PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 resulted in enrichment in PrP<sup>res</sup> #2, and demonstrated the presence of mono- and diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> products. PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 could not be obtained from several experimental scrapie sources (SSBP1, 79A, Chandler, C506M3) in TgOvPrP4 mice, but was identified in the 87V scrapie strain and, in lower and variable proportions, in 5 of 5 natural scrapie isolates with different molecular features to CH1641. PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 identification provides an additional method for the molecular discrimination of prion strains, and demonstrates differences between “CH1641-like” ovine scrapie and bovine L-type BSE transmitted in an ovine transgenic mouse model.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The origin of the transmissible agent involved in the food-borne epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) remains a mystery. It has recently been proposed that this could have been the result of the recycling of an atypical, more probably sporadic, form of BSE (called bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy, or L-type BSE) in an intermediate host, such as sheep. In this study we analyzed the molecular features of the disease-associated protease-resistant prion protein (PrP<sup>res</sup>) found in the brain of transgenic mice overexpressing the ovine prion protein after experimental infection with prions from bovine classical and L-type BSEs or from ovine scrapie. Scrapie cases included rare “CH1641-like” isolates, which share some PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular features with classical BSE and L-type BSE. Scrapie isolates induced in transgenic mouse brains the production of a C-terminally cleaved form of PrP<sup>res</sup>, which was particularly abundant from “CH1641-like” cases. In contrast, this C-terminal prion protein product was undetectable in ovine transgenic mice infected with bovine prions from both classical and L-type BSE. These findings add a novel approach for the discrimination of prions that may help to understand their possible changes during cross-species transmissions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle are tightly associated with the accumulation of an abnormal form of a host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP C) in infected tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Prusiner1">[1]</xref>. The biochemical properties of this disease-associated form of the protein (PrPd), which include insolubility in non-denaturing detergents and partial resistance to degradation by proteases, differ from those of the normal form. Whereas the normal protein is fully sensitive to proteases, the abnormal prion protein is only partly degraded (PrP<sup>res</sup>) due to removal of the amino-terminal end. In most cases, a large protease-resistant C-terminal core fragment is identified which has a gel mobility of ∼19–21 kDa in its unglycosylated form. However, in some prion diseases, such as some cases of human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Zou1">[2]</xref> or the H-type atypical form of BSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Biacabe1">[3]</xref>, a much smaller C-terminal PrP<sup>res</sup> product has also been reported.</p>
<p>A typical molecular signature of the BSE agent has been identified by PrP<sup>res</sup> Western blot analysis, which allows such methods to be used to identify the possible presence of BSE in sheep or goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Thuring1">[10]</xref>. The origin of the BSE agent in cattle is still unknown, and its possible reservoir has not yet been identified. A few isolates of TSEs were described in sheep that showed partial similarities with experimental ovine BSE, with a lower molecular mass of unglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> than in most scrapie cases, as found in ovine BSE. However the very high proportions of diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> found in ovine BSE were not generally apparent in such isolates. This was first demonstrated in the CH1641 experimental scrapie isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Foster1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Hope1">[12]</xref>, then in a few natural scrapie cases in Great Britain and France <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Lezmi1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Stack2">[14]</xref>. Bioassays performed in wild-type mice to identify prion strains from TSE isolates were reported to identify the biological signature of the BSE agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Fraser1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Lezmi2">[18]</xref>, but the CH1641 source failed to transmit the disease to such mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Foster1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Hope1">[12]</xref>. Both CH1641 and “CH1641-like” natural isolates were however transmitted in an ovine transgenic mouse model (TgOvPrP4), showing similar PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular features in both transgenic mice and sheep, i.e. a low apparent molecular of unglycosyslated PrP<sup>res</sup> (referred as l-type PrP<sup>res</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>. In some of the cases this could be not the unique molecular phenotype identified in all scrapie-infected mice, with some of the mice also showing PrP<sup>res</sup> with a higher apparent molecular mass (h-type PrP<sup>res</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Deviant phenotypes of BSE have recently been reported in cattle however (H and L-types, based on the PrP<sup>res</sup> features in cattle brain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Biacabe2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Jacobs1">[24]</xref>. Bioassays in wild-type and transgenic mice showed that these were consistent with the presence of two distinct strains, both differing from the single classical BSE strain involved in the food-borne BSE epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Buschmann1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron4">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Capobianco1">[27]</xref>. Thus, the possible transmission of such forms of BSE in other species such as small ruminants also needs to be considered. Recently the hypothesis has been raised that the classical BSE epidemic might have originated from the recycling of one of these atypical forms of BSE (L-type BSE) after a first cross-species transmission, possibly in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Capobianco1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bringue2">[28]</xref>. Recent studies of a transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) isolate in TgOvPrP4 mice also showed similar phenotypic features to those of L-type BSE, suggesting a possible cross-species transmission of L-type BSE by oral route <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron5">[29]</xref>. Given their unusual molecular properties, “CH1641-like” or CH1641 isolates might be the result of a transmission of L-type BSE to sheep or might represent similar isolates occurring in sheep.</p>
<p>In this study we compared the PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular features of a series of natural “CH1641-like” and experimental CH1641 scrapie isolates, with those of classical and L-type BSE, after transmission to TgOvPrP4 ovine transgenic mice. We demonstrated the abundance of a C-terminal PrP<sup>res</sup> fragment (PrP<sup>res</sup> #2), which distinguished these ovine scrapie isolates from both bovine classical and L-type BSEs after transmission in a common ovine trangenic mouse model.</p>

<title>“CH1641-like” isolates and L-type BSE share similar Western blot features to the usual PrP<sup>res</sup> form (PrP<sup>res</sup> #1) in TgOvPrP4 mice</title>
<p>We compared the PrP<sup>res</sup> Western blot profiles, after transmission in TgOvPrP4 ovine transgenic mice, of two recently identified natural sheep TSE isolates (05-825 and 06-017) that showed PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular features comparable to the experimental CH1641 scrapie isolate, i.e., a low apparent molecular mass (l-type) close to that found in ovine BSE. When the Bar233 antibody was used to detect the usual form of PrP<sup>res</sup> (PrP<sup>res</sup> #1), the molecular features, i.e. the apparent molecular masses of the three PrP<sup>res</sup> glycoforms and the glycoforms proportions, were similar in all PrP<sup>res</sup> positive mice in both experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The glycoform proportions in each of the natural 4 “CH1641-like” isolates (or in CH1641) were significantly different from those of classical BSE (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 for all 15 tests), with essentially lower levels of diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> than in classical BSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g002">2A</xref>). Lane by lane comparisons revealed a slightly lower apparent molecular mass of unglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> in mice infected with scrapie rather than ovine BSE, and also after PNGase deglycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, these differences (0–0.3 kDa) remained within the range of the possible variations of an individual sample in a given Western blot experiment. These molecular features were similar to those found in TgOvPrP4 mice infected with two other previously described “CH1641-like” natural scrapie isolates, at first or second passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>), in all (TR316211 isolate) or in some (O104 isolate) of the mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>.</p>

<p>In contrast, the PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 molecular features in TgOvPrP4 mice infected with “CH1641-like” isolates did not differ from those found in mice infected with L-type BSE. The low apparent molecular mass of unglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> was similar to that found in mice infected with classical BSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and also after PNGase deglycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Glycoform proportions did not differ significantly between any of the natural “CH1641-like” isolates (or CH1641) and L-type BSE with all cases showing lower levels of diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> than in classical BSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g002">2B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.30 for all tests except the one comparing the monoglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> band in TR316211-infected mice for which <italic>p</italic> = 0.07).</p>

<title>A C-terminal PrP<sup>res</sup> fragment (PrP<sup>res</sup> #2) is detected in ovine transgenic mice infected with scrapie isolates but not with L-type or classical BSE</title>
<p>We then used SAF84 for PrP<sup>res</sup> detection, that identified an additional band at ∼14 kDa (PrP<sup>res</sup> #2) in TgOvPrP4 mice infected with the four natural “CH1641-like” isolates and with the experimental CH1641 isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). This was associated with lighter, more diffuse labeling below the well defined ∼19 kDa unglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 band, consistent with the presence of a monoglycosylated form derived from the ∼14 kDa PrP<sup>res</sup> product. This PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 fragment was not detected in mice infected with classical BSE transmitted to sheep or with L-type BSE in cattle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). The existence of two distinct PrP<sup>res</sup> fragments of ∼19 and ∼14 kDa detected with SAF84 antibody only in the “CH1641-like” isolates was also demonstrated after deglycosylation by PNGase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g003">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>). Comparison of PrP<sup>res</sup> profiles between TgOvPrP4 mice and sheep or cattle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000137.s001">Figure S1</xref>) indicate that TgOvPrP4 faithfully reproduced PrP<sup>res</sup> features of ruminants following transmission of scrapie or BSE, including regarding the presence of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in “CH1641-like” scrapie but not in BSE.</p>

<p>We analyzed PrP<sup>res</sup> in TgOvPrP4 mice infected from six different BSE sources including (i) 3 natural isolates from cattle, goat, and a cheetah with feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) and (ii) 3 experimental sources from sheep (homozygous either for A<sub>136</sub>R<sub>154</sub>Q<sub>71</sub> or A<sub>136</sub>R<sub>154</sub>R<sub>171</sub> <italic>prnp</italic> allele) or from C57Bl/6 wild-type mice. All these BSE sources showed a similar PrP<sup>res</sup> profile with low apparent molecular mass (∼19 kDa), close to that found in CH1641-infected mice, but with higher levels of diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup>, after the use of both Bar233 and SAF84 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g004">Figures 4A, 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g006">6</xref>).

<p>Scrapie sources include SSBP1 and CH1641 experimental scrapie isolates and Chandler, 87V, 79A, and C506M3 scrapie strains in TgOvPrP4 mice (second passage). BSE is derived from C57Bl/6 mice infected with classical BSE (Mu BSE) (second passage in TgOvPrP4 mice). PrP<sup>res</sup> was analysed before (A, B) or after (C) PNGase deglycosylation and detected using Bar233 (A) or SAF84 (B, C).</p>

<p>In mice infected with natural scrapie isolates and CH641, the respective proportions of the ∼14 and ∼19 kDa bands, as observed after PNGase deglycosylation, were quantified and the ratios of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2/PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The mean proportions of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in the “CH1641-like” isolates (3–5 mice analysed per experimental group) represented 22.7% to 39.3% of the total signal, except for the O104 isolate for which these proportions were smaller (12.4%–20%) in 4 of the 5 mice analysed. The proportions of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in mice infected with the other scrapie isolates (“non CH1641-like”) (1–3 mice analysed per experimental group), were below 10% in most mice, except those infected with O111 (15.9%–19.4%). Statistical analyses of the data confirmed the significantly higher proportions of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in mice infected with “CH1641-like” isolates (or CH1641) compared with other scrapie isolates (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), as well as the significantly higher proportions of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in the O111 isolate within the “non CH1641-like” isolates (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02). No significant differences in these proportions of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 were found between the natural “CH1641-like” isolates and the experimental CH1641 isolate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.42).</p>

<p>Transmission studies of the O104 isolate showed the presence of a mixture of two distinct PrP<sup>res</sup> phenotypes, with either high (h-type) or low (l-type) apparent molecular masses of unglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup>, in variable proportions in each individual mouse, as shown using Bar233 detection after PNGase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>. The l-type PrP<sup>res</sup>, compared to the h-type, is only faintly labeled by the P4 antibody, but a P4-labelled PrP<sup>res</sup> sub-population that migrates similarly to the h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> can be identified in mice with l-type PrP<sup>res</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). When the SAF84 antibody was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), the C-terminal PrP<sup>res</sup> fragment was detected in all the O104 infected mice, but the lowest proportion (12.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g006">Figure 6</xref>) was found in the sole mouse that showed the most important proportions of h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> (lanes 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These data are also consistent with a preferential association of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 with PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 of low apparent molecular mass (l-type) in this scrapie isolate.</p>

<p>Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to enrich the PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 form in the samples and characterize it. Successive rounds of immunoprecipitation on magnetic beads coated with Sha31 N-terminal antibody that only recognizes PrP<sup>res</sup> #1, allowed progressive depletion of the PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 in the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000137-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

Three bands were detected at ∼22, 18, and 14 kDa, showing that PrP<sup>res</sup> #2, previously identified as an unglycosylated ∼14 kDa band, is also isolated from the mouse brains in monoglycosylated and diglycosylated forms.</p>

<title>Neuropathological investigations of “CH1641-like” isolates in TgOvPrP4 mice</title>
<p>The neuropathological analyses of the first passage experiments indicated comparable distribution of disease-associated prion protein in the brain of the transgenic mice among the “CH1641-like” sheep scrapie group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000137.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This was particularly clear for the 05-825 and 06-017 isolates that resulted in similar intensity of pathological PrP accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000137.s002">Figure S2C and S2D</xref>). Overall, these data were also not dissimilar from those already described for the first passage of L-type BSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron5">[29]</xref>. In both “CH1641-like” scrapie and L-type BSE, the florid plaque type of PrPsc deposition reported in this transgenic mouse line infected with classical BSE was never observed. However it is possible to underline some clear distinctive features such as a difference in the cortex targeting that was less intense compared to L-type BSE, even in the most severely affected cases (05-825 and 06-017 isolates) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000137.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Remarkably the types of PrP<sup>d</sup> deposition were also different; in the “CH1641-like” sheep scrapie group the deposition of pathological PrP was fine granular compared to L-type BSE in which plaque-like deposition were sometimes noticeable. Also, in the mesencephalon (raphe dorsalis), the deposition was intraneuronal for the “CH1641-like” sheep scrapie group but not in the brain of mice infected with L-type BSE. These data thus indicate some differences in the biological features of “CH1641-like” isolates, not only with classical BSE, but also with L-type BSE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study describes the molecular analyses of PrP<sup>res</sup> after transmission into TgOvPrP4 ovine transgenic mice from 4 natural ovine scrapie isolates whose PrP<sup>res</sup> features in sheep were similar to those previously described for the experimental CH1641 scrapie isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Hope1">[12]</xref>. Two of these previously unreported isolates (05-825 and 06-017) behaved as previously described for CH1641 and another natural isolate (TR316211) during the first passage in TgOvPrP4 mice, showing low molecular mass PrP<sup>res</sup> (l-type PrP<sup>res</sup>) in all mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>. In contrast, all the TgOvPrP4 mice receiving 5 natural scrapie isolates characterized by high PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular masses (h-type PrP<sup>res</sup>) in the sheep brain, showed PrP<sup>res</sup> of high molecular mass. Detailed analyses showed, as previously described in the CH1641 isolate in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Stack1">[9]</xref> and in TgOvPrP4 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron2">[19]</xref>, a slightly lower PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular mass in TgOvPrP4 mice from the “CH1641-like” isolates than from ovine BSE, although the resolution of small gels made discrimination difficult. Our results are quite consistent with previous studies of the CH1641 isolate by the immunohistochemical “peptide mapping” method, which revealed that PrP<sup>d</sup> in the CH1641 isolate was truncated further upstream in the N terminus than from experimental BSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Jeffrey1">[30]</xref>. The biochemical PrP<sup>res</sup> features of these scrapie isolates differ from BSE mainly in their moderately high proportions of di-glycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> (50%–60%), whereas ovine BSE is characterized by higher proportions of di-glycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Stack1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Hope1">[12]</xref>. Molecular discrimination of strains based on the relative proportions of glycoforms is however less reliable than that of PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular masses, given the large measurement variations and poor standardization of analytical methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Stack1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Thuring1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron6">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Nonno1">[33]</xref>. Furthermore glycoforms proportions of BSE in sheep have only been determined from a very limited number of sources. A recent study of classical BSE in cattle showed large individual variations (∼20%) in the proportions of di-glycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Siso1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>The question of a possible transmission of BSE in small ruminants now needs to be re-examined considering the recent identification of atypical cases of BSE (H-type or L-type) in cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Biacabe2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Jacobs1">[24]</xref>. Recent studies have indeed hypothesized that cross-species transmission of such rare atypical cases could be at the origin of the BSE epidemic in cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Capobianco1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bringue2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron7">[35]</xref>. The first experimental support for this hypothesis was obtained following the discovery of a BSE-like phenotype in mice following transmission of L-type BSE in wild-type mice (C57Bl, SJL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Capobianco1">[27]</xref> or in an ovine transgenic (tg338) mouse line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bringue2">[28]</xref>. However, unlike tg338, which expressed 8- to 10-fold levels of V<sub>136</sub> R<sub>154</sub> Q<sub>171</sub> ovine PrP, the phenotype of the L-type BSE remained distinct from classical BSE during at least two passages in TgOvPrP4 mice that expressed 2- to 4-fold levels of the A<sub>136</sub> R<sub>154</sub> Q<sub>171</sub> ovine PrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron5">[29]</xref>. It is noteworthy that, in cattle, the essential difference between L-type BSE and classical BSE is the slightly lower apparent molecular mass and the lower proportions of diglycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Casalone1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Jacobs1">[24]</xref>, reminiscent of the differences between CH1641 and classical BSE experimentally transmitted to sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Stack1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Hope1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Jeffrey1">[30]</xref>. The phenotypic features of L-type BSE have not yet been reported in sheep. In this study we showed that the PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular masses and glycoform proportions between “CH1641-like” scrapie isolates and L-type BSE transmitted into TgOvPrP4 mice were indistinguishable, in addition to survival periods in the same range at second passage.</p>
<p>However our study revealed that a highly sensitive C-terminal antibody (SAF84) recognised an abundant PrP<sup>res</sup> product (PrP<sup>res</sup> #2) in TgOvPrP4 mice infected with “CH1641-like” isolates, the unglycosylated form of which migrates at ∼14 kDa, in addition to the usual PrP<sup>res</sup> product (PrP<sup>res</sup> #1) which migrates at ∼19 kDa in its unglycosylated form. The presence of mono- and di-glycosylated forms derived from this PrP<sup>res</sup> cleavage product was confirmed by differential immunoprecipitation of PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 and PrP<sup>res</sup> #2. Depletion of PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 using N-terminal antibodies allowed the samples to be enriched in C-terminally cleaved PrP<sup>res</sup> #2, which then appeared in a 3-band pattern between 14 and 22 kDa. Such experiments also confirm that PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 is only faintly recognized by Sha 31 antibody, which recognizes the 148–155 region of the ovine PrP protein, suggesting that this region is absent from most of the PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 fragments. PNGase deglycosylation also facilitated the identification of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2, and permitted quantification of the respective proportions of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 and PrP<sup>res</sup> #1. Whereas PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 was abundant in TgOvPrP4 mice infected with “CH1641-like” isolates, lower levels of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 could also be detected from 5 natural isolates with h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> transmitted into TgOvPrP4 mice. C-terminally cleaved PrP<sup>res</sup> products have previously been described in sporadic or genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Zou1">[2]</xref>. Although the presence of low levels of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in BSE and L-type BSE cannot be fully excluded, this PrP<sup>res</sup> form remained undetected in our experiments with these BSE forms, even after differential immunoprecipitation. This was also the case in classical BSE transmitted in a variety of different species. Interestingly, similar results were obtained in TgOvPrP4 mice infected with an isolate from cattle experimentally infected with transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), consistent with previous studies showing similarities with L-type BSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron5">[29]</xref>. Our results thus reinforce the molecular discrimination of “CH1641-like” scrapie isolates from classical BSE, but also indicate a clear molecular difference with L-type BSE transmitted from cattle to ovine transgenic mice. However, further comparisons including those of biological and histopathological features during serial passages in this mouse model will be required, as well as transmission studies performed from L-type BSE experimentally transmitted to sheep.</p>
<p>We have also recently described the identification of a C-terminally cleaved PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 form in H-type BSE, in cattle and after transmission to C57Bl/6 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Biacabe1">[3]</xref>. However, a relationship between “CH1641-like” scrapie isolates and H-type BSE seems unlikely. H-type BSE is indeed characterized by a high PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular mass comparable to most natural scrapie cases, in contrast to the low PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular mass, which is the hallmark of “CH1641-like” isolates. Although the transmission of H-type BSE in sheep has not yet been reported, a high PrP<sup>res</sup> molecular mass was maintained upon transmission in tg338 ovine transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bringue1">[26]</xref>. Unfortunately, direct comparisons with H-type BSE in TgOvPrP4 mice were not possible since we were unable to transmit the disease from several cattle H-type isolates to these mice, at least at first passage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron5">[29]</xref>. As these same H-type isolates were transmitted in tg338 expressing higher levels of the V<sub>136</sub> R<sub>154</sub> Q<sub>171</sub> ovine PrP protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bringue1">[26]</xref>, this could suggest a high species and/or strain barrier for H-type BSE in sheep. Conversely, both classical and L-type BSEs were readily transmitted in TgOvPrP4 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron5">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The presence of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 within the different scrapie sources, was preferentially associated with PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 of low molecular mass. When several experimental scrapie sources were analysed, PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 was only detected in the 87V strain, characterized by l-type PrP<sup>res</sup>, but not in C506M3, Chandler or 79A strains or in the SSBP/1 isolate with h-type PrP<sup>res</sup>, still emphasizing the need of further comparisons between 87V and “CH1641-like” isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>. Although PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 could also be detected after the transmission of natural scrapie isolates with high molecular mass, the levels were consistently lower than in “CH1641-like” isolates. It might be that the presence of low levels of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 in scrapie isolates with h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> indicates a mixture of PrP<sup>res</sup> phenotypes in these scrapie sources, with the levels of l-type PrP<sup>res</sup> undetectable. This possibility should be considered in the light of certain observations. (1) A scrapie case with both h-type and l-type PrP<sup>res</sup> has recently been described in the UK, each PrP<sup>res</sup> phenotype originating from two different brain areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Stack2">[14]</xref>. (2) Our recent transmission studies of two “CH1641-like” isolates (O100 and O104) from the same flock into TgOvPrP4 showed the presence of h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> in some of the mice suggesting a possible mixture of the two PrP<sup>res</sup> phenotypes in the initial ovine scrapie isolates; these two PrP<sup>res</sup> phenotypes might be selected, at least in part, during the second passage in TgOvPrP4 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>. Studies of the initial ovine brain samples by immunohistochemistry indeed revealed the presence of differently cleaved PrP<sup>res</sup> forms in different brain nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Lezmi1">[13]</xref>. (3) Transmission of scrapie in cattle from a brain pool (British source) with h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> produced two cows with l-typePrP<sup>res</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Konold1">[36]</xref>. h-type PrP<sup>res</sup> was detected in a second brain sample from one of the two animals. (4) Similar results were observed in a bovine transgenic mouse line, the mobility in mice being faster than in the original scrapie isolate (Irish source) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Espinosa1">[37]</xref>. All together, these data suggest that l-type PrP<sup>res</sup> could be present in a number of scrapie sources. The identification of “CH1641-like” isolates might be the fortuitous and rare result of analysing samples in which the l-type PrP<sup>res</sup> of low molecular mass is more abundant.</p>
<p>Further characterization of the biological properties of scrapie sources with l-type PrP<sup>res</sup> will be required firstly to establish whether these correspond to a single strain of infectious agent or involve a variety of distinct scrapie strains, and secondly to better understand the characteristics of their transmission.</p>

<title>Transmission studies</title>
<p>Four- to six-week-old female TgOvPrP4 ovine transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Crozet2">[42]</xref> were inoculated intra-cerebrally with 10% (first passage) or 1% (second passage) (wt/vol) brain homogenates in 5% glucose in distilled water (20 μl per animal). The brains were sampled at the terminal stage of the disease or death of the animal due to intercurrent disease or ageing. The guidelines of the French Ethical Committee (decree 87–848) and European Community Directive 86/609/EEC regarding mice were respected. Experiments were performed in the Biohazard prevention area (A3) of the author’s institution with the approval of the Rhône-Alpes Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments. The whole brain of every second mouse was frozen and stored at −80°C before Western Blot analysis. The other brains were fixed in 10% formol-saline solution for histopathological examinations.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>Histological examinations</title>
<p>Post-fixed brain were routinely embedded in paraffin after a 1 hour formic acid (98%–100%) treatment. De-waxed and re-hydrated 5 μm brain sections were then either stained using hematoxylin-eosin in order to study vacuolar lesions or immunostained for PrP<sup>sc</sup> using SAF84 (SPI Bio) and 2G11 (Pourquier) monoclonal antibodies with or without an additional step using streptomycin sulfate, following a procedure reported in detail elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bencsik2">[43]</xref>. A peroxydase-labeled avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain Elite ABC, Vector Laboratories) was used to amplify the signal. Final detection was achieved using a solution of diaminobenzidine intensified with nickel chloride (Zymed), producing black deposits. Finally, slides counterstained with aequous hematoxylin were observed under a microscope coupled to an image analysis workstation (Morpho Expert software, ExploraNova). The lesion profiles were built following referential criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Fraser2">[44]</xref> using a computer-assisted method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Bencsik3">[45]</xref>.</p>

<title>Extraction of PrP<sup>res</sup></title>
<p>PrP<sup>res</sup> was obtained following concentration by ultra-centrifugation from half of the mouse brains homogenised in glucose 5% in distilled water (20% wt/vol). A 600 μl volume was made up to 1.2 ml in glucose 5%, before incubation with proteinase K (10 μg/100 mg brain tissue) (Roche) for 1 h at 37°C. N-lauroyl sarcosyl 30% (600 μl; Sigma) was added. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 2 h on a 400 μl 10% sucrose cushion, in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge. Pellets were resuspended and heated for 5 min at 100°C in 50 μl TD4215 denaturing buffer (SDS 4%, β-mercaptoethanol 2%, glycine 192 mM, Tris 25 mM, sucrose 5%). In some experiments, deglycosylation was performed using PNGase F (kit P07043, BioLabs), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref>.</p>

<title>Differential immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Differential immunoprecipitation was used to enrich the samples in the C-terminally cleaved form of PrP<sup>res</sup> (PrP<sup>res</sup> #2), by depletion of the usual form of PrP<sup>res</sup> (PrP<sup>res</sup> #1).</p>
<p>Superparamagnetic polystyrene beads coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for Fc on all mouse IgG (Dynabeads® Pan Mouse IgG_DYNAL #110.41) were used as recommended by the manufacturer. After each step, the beads were recovered using Dynal PMC. 50 μl bead aliquots were washed 3 times in 5 volumes of coating buffer (PBS with 0.1% of BSA). Beads (50 μl of beads resuspended in 50 μl coating buffer) collected after the last washing were then coated with IgG mouse monoclonal antibodies Sha 31 or SAF84 (ascitic fluids; SPI-Bio, France) for PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 or PrPres #2 capture, respectively. Sha31 and SAF84 recognise the ovine PrP sequences 148-YEDRYYRE-155 and 167-RPVDQY-172, respectively. For each cycle of PrP<sup>res</sup> capture, the sample was incubated with antibody-coated beads for 1 h at room temperature under continuous rotation at 60 rpm.</p>
<p>After PrP<sup>res</sup> ultracentrifugation, the pellets obtained from 2 mg brain tissues were resuspended in 20 μl immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] at pH 7.4 and 0.3% of N-lauroyl sarcosyl) and heated 5 min at 100°C, before addition of a 30 μl suspension of antibody-coated beads. After completing the beads suspension to 1 ml, the sample was enriched in PrP<sup>res</sup> #2, by depleting the PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 in 5 to 7 successive rounds of PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 capture using Sha31-coated beads. The supernatants collected after each capture cycle were used for the next one. PrP<sup>res</sup> #2 was then captured by SAF84-coated beads. At the end of each capture cycle, PrP<sup>res</sup> was removed from the beads by heat denaturation for 5 min at 100°C in 30 μl TD4215 buffer prior to Western blot analyses.</p>

<title>Western blot analyses</title>
<p>Western blot analysis was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000137-Baron3">[20]</xref> by 15% SDS-PAGE and electroblotting on nitrocellulose membranes. PrP<sup>res</sup> was detected with P4 (0.2 μg/ml) (93-WGQGGSH-99 ovine PrPsequence; R-Biopharm, Germany), Bar233 (1/5000) (144-FGNDYEDRYYRE-155 ovine PrP sequence; kindly provided by J. Grassi, C.E.A.-Saclay, France), Sha31 (1/10 from TeSeE Bio-Rad sheep and goats kit; Bio-Rad, France) or SAF84 (SPI-Bio, France) mouse monoclonal antibodies. Peroxidase-labelled conjugate anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1/2500 in PBST; ref 1010-05; Clinisciences, France) was used to detect P4, Bar233, and Sha31 antibodies, whereas SAF84 was used as horseradish peroxidase antibody. Streptavidin (5 ng/ml) (S5512) was added to the conjugate solution. Bound antibodies were then detected by direct capture with the Versa Doc (Bio-Rad) analysis system using the ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham, France). Quantitative studies were performed using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software, and the apparent molecular masses were evaluated by comparing the positions of the PrP<sup>res</sup> bands with a biotinylated marker (B2787) (Sigma, France).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The glycoforms proportions of the four “CH1641-like” isolates and the CH1641 isolate were compared with each other and the glycoforms proportions of both classical BSE and L-type BSE were compared with those of each natural “CH1641-like” isolate and with the experimental CH1641 isolate. Comparison of classical BSE alone with each “CH1641-like” isolate and with CH1641 at first passage implies 5 tests for each of the 3 PrP<sup>res</sup> #1 bands. In view of the high total number of tests (19 for each PrP<sup>res</sup> band), paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests with Bonferroni adjustment were used to preclude the detection of spurious differences in glycoform proportions.</p>
<p>A classical analysis of variance was used for comparisons of PrP<sup>res</sup> #2. The statistical analysis was performed with R software (R version 2–6.0 [2007-11-03]: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
