<p>The abundance of lysozyme on mucosal surfaces suggests that successful colonizers must be able to evade its antimicrobial effects. Lysozyme has a muramidase activity that hydrolyzes bacterial peptidoglycan and a non-muramidase activity attributable to its function as a cationic antimicrobial peptide. Two enzymes (PgdA, a <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, and Adr, an <italic>O</italic>-acetyl transferase) that modify different sites on the peptidoglycan of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> have been implicated in its resistance to lysozyme <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we show that the antimicrobial effect of human lysozyme is due to its muramidase activity and that both peptidoglycan modifications are required for full resistance by pneumococci. To examine the contribution of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications during colonization of the upper respiratory tract, competition experiments were performed with wild-type and <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant pneumococci in lysozyme M-sufficient (LysM<sup>+/+</sup>) and -deficient (LysM<sup>−/−</sup>) mice. The wild-type strain out-competed the double mutant in LysM<sup>+/+</sup>, but not LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice, indicating the importance of resistance to the muramidase activity of lysozyme during mucosal colonization. In contrast, strains containing single mutations in either <italic>pgdA</italic> or <italic>adr</italic> prevailed over the wild-type strain in both LysM<sup>+/+</sup> and LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our findings demonstrate that individual peptidoglycan modifications diminish fitness during colonization. The competitive advantage of wild-type pneumococci in LysM<sup>+/+</sup> but not LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice suggests that the combination of peptidoglycan modifications reduces overall fitness, but that this is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to the peptidoglycan degrading activity of lysozyme.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>For many successful pathogens, their surfaces must be able to adapt to different host environments, or to avoid host immune components, to establish infection. Bacterial pathogens, for example, are known to modify their cell walls, which are comprised largely of peptidoglycan. Our study focuses on peptidoglycan modifications by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, which initiates interaction with its host by colonizing the mucosal surface of the upper respiratory tract. Two proteins (PgdA and Adr) that modify the cell wall of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> have each been associated with resistance to lysozyme, which cleaves peptidoglycan and is one of the most abundant antimicrobial factors in the human respiratory tract. Using defined bacterial mutants together with mice that express or lack lysozyme, we show that the full resistance to lysozyme requires modifications by both proteins. These cell wall modifications each come at a significant fitness cost to the bacterium. This fitness cost, however, is outweighed by the benefits of lysozyme resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study, therefore, demonstrates the relationship between a bacterial pathogen and a host defense mechanism that imparts a substantial selective pressure on organisms that colonize the mucosal surface.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For many pathogens, colonization of mucosal surfaces is a prerequisite for events leading to disease. At these sites the host elaborates numerous antimicrobial factors that may reduce the burden of colonizing organisms. Lysozyme, a prominent member of these antimicrobials, is found in high concentrations (&gt;500 µg/ml) in mucosal surface fluids such as those lining the upper respiratory tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Cole1">[1]</xref>. Lysozyme is expressed by the epithelia and is also a major component of the granules of neutrophils, which may be recruited when the mucosa is acutely inflamed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Welsh1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Markart1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Cramer1">[4]</xref>. Lysozyme has two distinct antibacterial activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Ibrahim1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Nash1">[6]</xref>. Its enzymatic muramidase activity hydrolyzes the conserved ß-1,4 glycosidic bond between <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl muramic acid (MurNAc), the disaccharide residues of the peptidoglycan backbone. Hydrolysis of the glycan strands leads to degradation of the cell wall and bacterial lysis. In addition, an antibacterial activity is observed with catalytically inactive lysozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Nash1">[6]</xref>. This non-muramidase activity has been attributed to the disruption of bacterial membrane function by an inherent nine amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Ibrahim1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Ibrahim2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The contribution of lysozyme to innate host defense has been analyzed in genetically- modified mice. Over-expression of rat lysozyme in the lungs of transgenic mice was associated with enhanced killing of group B streptococci and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Akinbi1">[8]</xref>. Mice have two different lysozyme genes, <italic>LysM</italic>, expressed by myeloid and epithelial cells and <italic>LysP</italic>, expressed by Paneth cells in the gut. LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice show defective clearance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Cole2">[9]</xref> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> from their lower airways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Markart1">[3]</xref>. While these studies demonstrate a protective role of lysozyme for opportunistic pathogens in normally sterile sites, its impact on the mucosal flora is unknown.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that bacteria modify the glycan backbone of their peptidoglycan, and these modifications may affect their sensitivity to lysozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Raymond1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Psylinakis1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Herbert1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Hbert1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Fukushima1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Boneca1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Blundell1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Bera1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Bera2">[19]</xref>. In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, for example, <italic>O</italic>-acetylation at position C-6 on MurNAc and <sc>d</sc>-alanine esters on its cell wall-linked teichoic acid have an additive effect on resistance to muramidase and non-muramidase activities of lysozyme <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Herbert1">[13]</xref>. Organisms that reside on mucosal surfaces where lysozyme is particularly abundant must have the ability to evade its antibacterial effects. However, the contribution of cell wall modifications, which affect lysozyme resistance, to bacterial survival on mucosal surfaces has not been examined.</p>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) is a leading extracellular Gram-positive pathogen that commonly colonizes the human nasopharynx. Although colonization is generally asymptomatic, infection induces an acute inflammatory response characterized by a brisk influx of neutrophils. Because the organism is coated by capsular polysaccharide (CPS) covalently attached to its cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Srensen1">[20]</xref>, it is capable of evading phagocytic clearance and causing invasive disease. Two enzymes have been associated with lysozyme resistance in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>: peptidoglycan <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (PgdA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer1">[10]</xref> and attenuator of drug resistance (Adr), which is an <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Crisstomo1">[21]</xref>. These proteins modify a portion of the glycan residues; PgdA deacetylates GlcNAc (40–80% of GlcNAc residues, ∼10% of MurNAc residues) and Adr acetylates MurNAc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Crisstomo1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer2">[22]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that mutations in either of these genes are sufficient to increase sensitivity to chicken egg lysozyme <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Crisstomo1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer2">[22]</xref>. Systemic infection of mice with a <italic>pgdA</italic> strain was associated with decreased virulence, although the role of lysozyme resistance in this effect was not established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we determine the contribution of lysozyme to bacterial colonization using a murine model of carriage by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of lysozyme, and peptidoglycan modifications that affect resistance to its muramidase activity, in dictating the composition of the microflora of the mucosal surface of the upper airway.</p>

<title>Peptidoglycan modifications affect sensitivity to human lysozyme</title>
<p>To test the effects of peptidoglycan modifications, defined mutations were made in <italic>pgdA</italic> and <italic>adr</italic> in the pneumococcal strain TIGR4 based on the genomic information available for this isolate as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g001">Figure 1</xref> depicts the locations of <italic>O</italic>-acetylation (Adr) and <italic>N</italic>-deacetylation (PgdA) relative to the glycosidic linkage of MurNAc and GlcNAc that is hydrolyzed by lysozyme. The wild-type (WT), <italic>pgdA</italic>, <italic>adr</italic>, and <italic>pgdAadr</italic> strains showed equivalent growth characteristics in broth culture during log phase. Addition of chicken egg lysozyme (100 µg/ml) to mid-log phase cultures led to arrested growth for the <italic>pgdA</italic> mutant strains (<italic>pgdA</italic> and <italic>pgdAadr</italic>), but not the WT or <italic>adr</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Growth arrest occurred more promptly for the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> than <italic>pgdA</italic> mutant suggesting a synergistic effect of the two genes on sensitivity to lysozyme. The results with the <italic>pgdA</italic> mutant were consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer2">[22]</xref>, however the <italic>adr</italic> mutant of strain TIGR4 generated in this study did not have increased sensitivity to lysozyme as has been previously reported for a strain derived from R6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Crisstomo1">[21]</xref>. A similar pattern of sensitivity was observed using recombinant human lysozyme (100 µg/ml), although with the human enzyme bacterial lysis was more apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Purified insoluble peptidoglycan from each strain was tested to determine whether the effect of lysozyme on cultures correlated with its hydrolytic activity. For both chicken egg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and human lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) only peptidoglycan from the mutants lacking <italic>pgdA</italic> were hydrolyzed. As with whole bacteria, peptidoglycan from the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant showed greater sensitivity to lysozyme than the <italic>pgdA</italic> strain.</p>

<p>Pneumococcal growth is characterized by spontaneous autolysis in stationary phase because of the endogenous expression of its major amidase, LytA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Since colonies of <italic>pgdA</italic> mutants generated in this study appeared more autolytic based on colony morphology, the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of lysozyme were tested in a <italic>lytA</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). To determine the effect of lysozyme on pneumococcal survival, viable counts were measured five hours after addition of chicken egg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) or human lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) to mid-log phase cultures. The WT strain and <italic>adr</italic> mutant showed no loss of viability. Survival of both <italic>pgdA</italic> mutants was significantly reduced by treatment with chicken egg lysozyme, with a more significant effect on the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant. Only the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant showed a significant decrease in survival following treatment with human lysozyme. The estimated MBC<sub>50</sub> (mean concentration required for 50% killing) for human lysozyme exceeded 180 µg/ml for the WT and <italic>adr</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000241-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the MBC<sub>50</sub> was only 50 to 100 µg/ml for the <italic>pgdA</italic> mutant and 12.5 to 25 µg/ml for the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant. It was concluded that there is a combined effect of peptidoglycan modifications by PgdA and Adr on resistance to human lysozyme.</p>

<title>Peptidoglycan modifications affect resistance to the muramidase activity of lysozyme</title>
<p>To test whether these effects were due to the muramidase activity of lysozyme, the enzyme was inactivated by treatment at 100°C for 60 min, which are conditions that allow lysozyme to retain its non-muramidase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Ibrahim1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Herbert1">[13]</xref>. Hydrolysis assays with purified peptidoglycan were used to confirm the loss of muramidase activity. The human, but not chicken egg enzyme, showed complete inactivation under these conditions (data not shown). Therefore, inactivated human lysozyme was tested for its effects on bacterial viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The denatured enzyme lacked anti-pneumococcal activity against all of the strains tested. There was also no effect on survival when the LP9 peptide, which has been shown to confer the non-muramidase CAMP activity of lysozyme, was substituted for the intact enzyme in these viability assays at concentrations up to 200 µg/ml (data not shown). It was concluded that the combined effect of modifications by PgdA and Adr on resistance to human lysozyme is due to its muramidase, rather than its non-muramidase activity.</p>

<p>The <italic>lytA<sup>+</sup></italic> strains characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> were used to test the hypothesis that lysozyme limits colonization of mucosal surfaces. Both lysozyme sensitive (<italic>pgdAadr</italic>) and resistant (WT) pneumococci were able to colonize the upper respiratory tract of the mouse (data not shown). To examine more subtle differences in bacterial fitness, competition experiments were used to assess the relative ability of these strains to colonize the nasopharynx. Three days after intranasal inoculation with equivalent numbers of the WT strain and the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant, the density of colonization of each strain was measured in nasal lavages to determine the competitive index. Prior to <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments we confirmed there was no effect of one strain on another during <italic>in vitro</italic> co-cultivation experiments (data not shown). As expected, the lysozyme-resistant WT strain out-competed the lysozyme-sensitive <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant in lysozyme-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). To confirm that the effect on colonization was due specifically to the mutations introduced into <italic>pgdA</italic> and <italic>adr</italic>, we generated corrected strains by transformation with WT genomic DNA followed by selection in the presence of lysozyme.

The competitive index was calculated based on the ratio of mutant to WT bacteria in nasal lavages compared to the ratio of mutant to WT bacteria in the inoculum.

<p>To define the contribution of lysozyme during colonization, competition experiments were carried out in congenic LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice. In lysozyme-deficient hosts, unlike the lysozyme-sufficient hosts, the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant prevailed over the WT or <italic>pgdA+adr+</italic> revertant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). This observation demonstrated that the survival advantage conferred by these two peptidoglycan modifications requires lysozyme expression by the host. Moreover, without the expression of lysozyme, pneumococci that do not modify their peptidoglycan show a survival advantage during colonization. This suggests that the combined modifications by PgdA and Adr result in an <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness cost, but that this fitness cost is outweighed by their contribution to lysozyme resistance.</p>
<p>In contrast to the results with the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant, single mutants in <italic>pgdA</italic> or <italic>adr</italic> out- competed the WT strain in both LysM<sup>+/+</sup> and LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g005">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). This suggests that individual modifications by either PgdA or Adr confer a fitness cost on the organism regardless of the presence of lysozyme. A further implication is that the combined effects of both modifications are required to confer a survival benefit – an advantage to the organism seen in lysozyme-sufficient, but not -deficient, hosts corresponding to the increased resistance of the WT strain to the muramidase activity of lysozyme.</p>

<title>Epithelium is the source of upper airway lysozyme</title>
<p>To ascertain the source of upper airway lysozyme that effects colonization, we considered the contributions of the epithelia or the influx of neutrophils in response to pneumococci.</p>
<p>To evaluate the role of neutrophil-derived lysozyme, neutrophil-enriched peritoneal exudates were isolated from LysM<sup>+/+</sup> and LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice and used in <italic>ex vivo</italic> killing assays. The WT strain and <italic>pgdA</italic>, <italic>adr</italic>, and <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutants were equally resistant to killing by these cells whether derived from LysM<sup>+/+</sup> or LysM<sup>−/−</sup> mice (data not shown). Because strain TIGR4 is relatively resistant to neutrophils obtained from mice, human neutrophils were also used in killing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). In comparison to the WT strain, mutants in <italic>pgdA</italic> (<italic>pgdA</italic> and <italic>pgdAadr</italic>) were significantly more resistant to neutrophil-mediated killing. Correction of the mutation in <italic>pgdA</italic> (<italic>pgdA</italic>+<italic>adr</italic>− and <italic>pgdA</italic>+<italic>adr</italic>+) eliminated increased resistance to killing by human neutrophils. Thus, the <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant was less resistant to lysozyme but more resistant to killing by human neutrophils, making it unlikely that the anti-pneumococcal activity of neutrophils was mediated by lysozyme. This also indicated that peptidoglycan modification by PgdA has lysozyme-independent effects on neutrophil-mediated pneumococcal killing. Additional evidence that neutrophil activity was not contributing to lysozyme-dependent differences among strains came from competition experiments in which mice were depleted of neutrophils. Administration of the monoclonal antibody RB6-8C5, which targets Ly6G-expressing cells (or rat IgG control), to LysM<sup>+/+</sup> mice prior to bacterial challenge had no effect on the ability of the lysozyme-resistant WT strain to out-compete the lysozyme-sensitive <italic>pgdAadr</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000241-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Other effects of cell wall modifications</title>
<p>Our observations showed that individual peptidoglycan modifications have lysozyme-independent effects on both bacterial fitness during colonization, and on resistance to neutrophil-mediated killing. This may be due to the effects of peptidoglycan modifications on other molecules that are attached to or associated with the pneumococcal cell wall. Specifically, an alteration in amounts of CPS, which is covalently attached to peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Srensen1">[20]</xref>, may have dramatic effects on fitness during colonization and resistance to neutrophil-mediated killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Kim1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Magee1">[25]</xref>.

In comparison to the WT strain or corrected mutant (<italic>pgdA</italic>+<italic>adr</italic>+), <italic>pgdA</italic> mutants showed significantly elevated levels of type 4 CPS.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that host expression of lysozyme effects bacterial colonization. Specifically, we show that lysozyme is an important antibacterial factor on heavily colonized mucosal surfaces such as those lining the upper airway. These findings extend descriptions of the role of lysozyme in protecting the normally sterile lower airway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Markart1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Akinbi1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Cole2">[9]</xref>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of the enzyme were attributed to lysozyme M, since lysozyme P was not detected in the upper respiratory tract secretions or tissue staining. As expected, the ability of bacteria to resist lysozymes' antibacterial properties dictates success at these sites. For the pneumococcus, resistance to human lysozyme <italic>in vitro</italic> and mouse lysozyme <italic>in vivo</italic> is dictated by the synergistic effects of two distinct modifications to the glycan strands of its cell wall. Even though each of these modifications alone, or in combination, diminishes bacterial fitness for colonization in the absence of lysozyme, together they provide a significant survival advantage when lysosyme is abundant.</p>
<p>Although two different antibacterial properties have been ascribed to lysozyme, only its enzymatic muramidase activity appeared to be relevant to pneumococcal survival. Inactivation of its muramidase activity by denaturing human lysozyme was sufficient to completely eliminate its ability to kill <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Moreover, the cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) activity of the human-derived peptide LP9 was ineffective against the pneumococcus. It remains possible that, as is the case for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, other cell wall features of the pneumococcus account for its resistance to the non-muramidase activity of lysozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Herbert1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Bera2">[19]</xref>. Specifically, <sc>d</sc>-alanylation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cell wall-associated teichoic acids has been shown to contribute to resistance to antimicrobials, such as nicin and gallidermin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Kovcs1">[27]</xref>. This would be consistent with results in <italic>S. aureus</italic> where <sc>d</sc>-alanylation contributed to resistance to several antimicrobials, including lysozyme, and the peptide LP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Herbert1">[13]</xref>. On the other hand, the pneumococcal strains generated in this study differed from <italic>S. aureus</italic> in that acetylation by Adr (OatA in <italic>S. aureus</italic>) by itself does not confer sufficient resistance to the lytic effects of lysozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Bera1">[18]</xref>. Our study confirmed that Adr contributes to lysozyme resistance, as had been shown previously by Crisóstomo <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Crisstomo1">[21]</xref>, although we were only able to show an effect of the <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase Adr in conjunction with the <italic>N</italic>-deacetylase PgdA. This may have been due in part to differences between pneumococcal strains; Crisóstomo <italic>et al</italic> used an unencapsulated laboratory strain, while our studies were conducted using a clinical isolate. The extent to which these strains acetylate peptidoglycan residues could be different, and might account for the limited role of Adr in lysozyme resistance observed in this study.</p>
<p>Our results are also based on testing of mammalian rather than chicken egg enzyme, which may have more potent muramidase activity. This may be due in part to slightly different amino acid residues present in the catalytic cleft of each enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Redfield1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Peters1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Jung1">[30]</xref>. The amino acid sequences of chicken egg and human lysozyme are 57% identical and 76% similar by sequence comparison (blastp), whereas lysozyme M and human lysozyme are 76% identical and 86% similar. Although these differences in sequence do not lead to alterations in protein structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Redfield1">[28]</xref>, they could affect affinity for substrates, which could lead to the observed difference in enzymatic activity.</p>
<p>Although many species modify their peptidoglycan by either <italic>O</italic>-acetylation or <italic>N</italic>-deacetylation, few organisms have thus far been described as having both modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer3">[31]</xref>. Aside from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, these include <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Zipperle1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Weadge1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Logardt1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Araki1">[35]</xref>; both <italic>O</italic>-acetylation and <italic>N</italic>-deacetylation have also been associated with lysozyme resistance, however the combined effects of both modifications in these organisms has not been determined. Our results for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> suggest that both modifications may be needed for full resistance to lysozyme. The aggregate effects of bacterial surface modifications that affect lysozyme resistance other than <italic>O</italic>-acetylation and <italic>N</italic>-deacetylation have also not been explored.</p>
<p>An additional observation was that peptidoglycan modifications affect characteristics of the bacterial cell apart from its resistance to lysozyme. In particular, we show that mutation of <italic>pgdA</italic> is sufficient to alter growth characteristic dictated by its endogenous amidase (LytA) and to markedly increase levels of cell-associated CPS. PgdA cleaves an amide bond leaving a charged amino group on glucosamine residues of the glycan backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer1">[10]</xref>. Mutation of <italic>pgdA</italic>, therefore, will result in a less positively charged cell wall, which could impact molecules attached to and associating with peptidoglycan. The efficiency of attachment of anionic type 4 CPS, which is covalently bound to the surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Srensen1">[20]</xref>, could be affected by this difference in charge. Similarly, it would be interesting to determine if peptidoglycan modifications affect other cell surface structures such as wall teichoic acid (C-polysaccharide), which is also covalently attached to peptidoglycan, albeit at a different position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Srensen1">[20]</xref>. An increase in cell-associated CPS, or other effects on the cell surface, could inhibit phagocytosis and explain the decreased killing of the <italic>pgdA</italic> mutants by human neutrophils. Altered cell surface characteristics of <italic>pgdA</italic> and <italic>adr</italic> mutants could also account for their increased fitness during colonization in the absence of lysozyme. Vollmer <italic>et al.</italic> previously reported that a <italic>pgdA</italic> mutant was less virulent in a pneumococcal model of bloodstream infection – a result that would seem to be at odds with their decreased killing by neutrophils and increased fitness on the mucosal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Vollmer2">[22]</xref>. Mutants in <italic>pgdA</italic> generated in our study, however, showed attenuated growth in human serum compared to the WT strain (data not shown). This demonstrates the potentially pleomorphic and complex effects of peptidoglycan modification on bacterial growth and survival in different environments. It would be interesting to determine whether the expression of peptidoglycan modifying enzymes is differentially regulated under conditions where the requirement for lysozyme resistance may vary.</p>
<p>Mucosal lysozyme may have direct effects on colonization through its ability to lyse pneumococci that do not express PgdA and Adr. Alternatively, degradation of peptidoglycan could release bacterial products recognized by the host which enhance inflammation, and indirectly stimulate bacterial clearance. These inflammatory mediators may include muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which signals through the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (Nod2) cytoplasmic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Inohara1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Girardin1">[37]</xref>. Adr could affect both sensitivity to lysozyme and signaling triggered by MDP since its MurNAc component would be modified by acetylation. In this regard, peptidoglycan modifications have been shown to effect signaling through Nod1, which recognizes the <italic>meso</italic>-diaminopimelic acid (<italic>meso</italic>-DAP) fragment of the cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Girardin2">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Chamaillard1">[39]</xref>, in response to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Boneca1">[16]</xref>. The relative contributions to pneumococcal clearance of the lytic versus inflammatory effects of lysozyme, and the effects of peptidoglycan modifications on the latter, have not yet been explored.</p>
<p>In summary, the host uses lysozyme to target a conserved feature of peptidoglycan, the glycosidic bond between MurNAc and GlcNAc. To counter this host defense mechanism, the pneumococcus modifies both of these residues to decrease hydrolysis of the bond that links them, despite a significant fitness cost associated with altering the glycan backbone of its cell wall. Our findings demonstrate that the peptidoglycan degrading activity of lysozyme exerts a substantial selective pressure on residents of mucosal surfaces.</p>

Broth cultures at mid-log phase (OD 620 nm = 0.3) were divided and received either lysozyme (100 µg/ml) or vehicle control. Where specified, lysozyme from the stock solution was inactivated by treatment at 100°C for 60 min. LP9, a synthetic human lysozyme-derived peptide (<sub>107</sub>R-A-W-V-A-W-R-N-R<sub>115</sub>) (GenScript Corporation, Piscataway, NJ), was used at a concentration of 200 µg/ml. Following addition of lysozyme, growth was monitored for 5 hrs. For viable counts an aliquot was removed and serial dilutions plated. Mean bactericidal concentrations (MBC<sub>50</sub>) were estimated by treating mid-log phase <italic>lytA</italic> mutant strains with recombinant human lysozyme. 10<sup>2</sup> bacterial cells were resuspended in Hank's buffer with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Gibco, San Diego, CA), and 0.1% gelatin (+++ solution), and were incubated with varying concentrations of human lysozyme: 180 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, 25 µg/ml, or 12.5 µg/ml. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and then plated to determine viable counts. MBC<sub>50</sub> values were determined based on viability relative to reactions at time 0 min, and relative to no treatment controls.</p>
<p>To purify cell walls of pneumococci, cultures were first grown to exponential phase as described above. Cell walls were then purified as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000241-Bera1">[18]</xref>. Two-mg of crude cell walls were resuspended in 1 ml of solution (100 mM Tris Buffer pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 100 µg trypsin) and incubated overnight at 37°C with agitation. Trypsin was inactivated by incubation at 65°C in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Cell walls were then washed three times in distilled water to eliminate SDS and resuspended in dH<sub>2</sub>O to an OD 600 nm = 0.6. Hydrolysis was measured by the decline in absorbance (OD 600 nm) over 120 min in the presence of lysozyme (100 µg/ml). Percentage of hydrolysis was expressed relative to the absorbance of each sample at time 0 min.</p>

Animals were housed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. All strains were animal passaged prior to use in experiments and stored at −80°C in 20% glycerol. Inocula consisted of a total of 10<sup>7</sup> mid-log phase PBS-washed bacteria in 10 µl PBS (5×10<sup>6</sup> WT or revertant cells plus 5×10<sup>6</sup> mutant cells). Inocula were plated onto the appropriate selective media to confirm the concentration of each strain. Three days after intranasal inoculation, mice were sacrificed, the trachea cannulated, and 200 µl of PBS was instilled. Lavage fluid was collected from the nares and serially diluted in PBS. Total pneumococci were enumerated by plating onto media supplemented with neomycin to prevent the growth of contaminants. Selective media was used to quantify the proportion of WT or revertant vs. mutant bacteria in lavages. The lower limit of detection was 20 CFU/ml of lavage fluid.</p>
