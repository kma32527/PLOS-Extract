<p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting structures of the teeth caused by, among other pathogens, <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>. Many strains of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> are resistant to killing by the human complement system, which is present at up to 70% of serum concentration in gingival crevicular fluid. Incubation of human serum with recombinant cysteine protease of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> (interpain A) resulted in a drastic decrease in bactericidal activity of the serum. Furthermore, a clinical strain 59 expressing interpain A was more serum-resistant than another clinical strain 57, which did not express interpain A, as determined by Western blotting. Moreover, in the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor E64, the killing of strain 59 by human serum was enhanced. Importantly, we found that the majority of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains isolated from chronic and aggressive periodontitis carry and express the interpain A gene. The protective effect of interpain A against serum bactericidal activity was found to be attributable to its ability to inhibit all three complement pathways through the efficient degradation of the α-chain of C3—the major complement factor common to all three pathways. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> has been known to co-aggregate with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, which produce gingipains to efficiently degrade complement factors. Here, interpain A was found to have a synergistic effect with gingipains on complement degradation. In addition, interpain A was able to activate the C1 complex in serum, causing deposition of C1q on inert and bacterial surfaces, which may be important at initial stages of infection when local inflammatory reaction may be beneficial for a pathogen. Taken together, the newly characterized interpain A proteinase appears to be an important virulence factor of <italic>P. intermedia</italic>.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> is one of the bacterial pathogens that has been implicated in causing periodontitis—an endemic inflammatory disease of the supporting structures of the teeth. The complement system is an important part of host innate immunity and is able to directly kill invading bacteria. To become successful pathogens, many strains of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> developed mechanisms making them very resistant to killing by complement. We found that a cysteine protease, interpain A, that is produced by many clinical strains of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was able to destroy the bacterial killing activity of human serum. A strain of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> that produces interpain A was found to be more resistant to complement than the one lacking interpain A, and the resistance of the interpain A–producing strain could be diminished by a specific inhibitor of cysteine proteases. We attributed the protective effect of interpain A to its ability to inhibit the complement system through the efficient degradation of C3—a major complement protein that is common to all three pathways of complement activation. Understanding the mechanism governing pathogen resistance to complement may help us to design novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat an important bacterial disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition with an infective etiology that leads to loss of tooth support. <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> is a major bacterial periodontal pathogen in humans together with <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Darby1">[1]</xref>. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> is often recovered from subgingival plaque in patients suffering from acute necrotising gingivitis, pregnancy gingivitis and chronic periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Loesche1">[2]</xref>. Recently, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was reported to be found in 14% of adult population in Finland and there was association between the carriage of this species and the number of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Kononen1">[3]</xref>. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was also frequently isolated from root canal infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Tomazinho1">[4]</xref>. Periodontitis is one of the most common diseases affecting humans and is primarily the result of colonization of the subgingival surfaces of teeth by bacteria. The complex interaction between these bacteria harboring many virulence factors and the host's immune response results in localized chronic inflammation and subsequent destruction of the supporting structures of the tooth. Proteinases are crucial virulence factors produced by many periodontal pathogens, which can cause the degradation of host proteins for essential nutrients but they can also protect the bacteria from the host's defenses such as the complement system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Popadiak1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Potempa1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Complement is a major arm of the innate immune defense system and its main function is to recognize and destroy microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Walport1">[7]</xref>. The three pathways of human complement ensure that virtually any non-host surface is recognized as hostile. The classical pathway is usually mediated by binding of the C1 complex (composed of recognition molecule C1q and two proteinases C1s and C1r) to invading pathogens either directly or via immunoglobulins. The lectin pathway is able to recognize, via mannose-binding lectin (MBL), polysaccharide molecules normally present only on microbial surfaces. Finally, complement can also be activated through the alternative pathway, which is not so much an activation pathway but as a failure to appropriately regulate the constant low-level spontaneous activation of C3 (constantly initiated due to inherent instability of this protein). All three pathways lead to opsonisation of the pathogen with C3b (activated form of complement factor C3), which enhances phagocytosis by phagocytes. Furthermore, anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a are released as byproducts to attract phagocytes to the site of infection. Finally, the end result of the complement cascade is formation of the membrane attack complex and bacterial cell lysis. Host cells protect themselves from bystander damage following complement activation through the expression of membrane-bound or recruitment of soluble endogenous complement inhibitors.</p>
<p>Complement deficiencies are very rare but it has been observed that partial C4 gene deficiencies are more frequent in patients with severe chronic periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Seppanen1">[8]</xref>. A patient with aggressive periodontitis and severe edema, localized to the free gingival tissues was reported to be deficient in C1-inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Roberts1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, the highest salivary levels of C3 were measured in periodontally healthy subjects while low levels were often found in edentulous and chronic periodontitis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Aurer1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that heat inactivation of NHS (i.e. inactivation of complement) significantly reduced opsonic activity for <italic>P. intermedia in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Tofte1">[11]</xref> suggesting that complement is important for host defense against this pathogen. Previous studies have shown that <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was opsonized by the alternative pathway in the absence of the classical pathway, probably in response to the endotoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Okuda1">[12]</xref>, however, kinetic studies revealed that opsonisation proceeded at significantly faster rates when the classical pathway was intact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Tofte1">[11]</xref>. Interestingly, the alternative pathway contributed to the killing of serum sensitive strains while the classical pathway was primarily responsible for killing of strains with intermediate sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Sundqvist1">[13]</xref>. Therefore, it appears that complement is able to recognize <italic>P. intermedia</italic> via several sensory molecules. However, it appears that <italic>P. intermedia</italic> is able to override to some extent the complement defenses and to establish chronic infections in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Every successful human pathogen must develop means to circumvent complement. Many bacteria are able to capture human complement inhibitors such as C4b-binding protein and factor H thereby inhibiting complement and avoiding opsonisation and lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Blom1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Potempa2">[16]</xref>. Herpes viruses, on the other hand, produce their own homologues of complement inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Mark1">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, many bacteria use proteinases to incapacitate components of the complement system. For example, most strains of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> are resistant to bacteriolytic activity of human serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Sundqvist1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Okuda2">[18]</xref> and the gingipain proteinases have been implicated as the major factor providing protection against complement in serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Popadiak1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Wingrove1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Schenkein1">[22]</xref>. For a number of <italic>Prevotella</italic> subspecies and strains, including <italic>P. intermedia</italic>, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly higher than that recorded for commensal strains isolated from healthy mouths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Yanagisawa1">[23]</xref>. This, we hypothesize, may provide <italic>P. intermedia</italic> with serum protection.</p>
<p>We have identified three cysteine proteinases in the genome of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> that appeared to be homologues of SpeB protein of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Potempa3">[24]</xref>. Recently, the first of these genes coding for interpain A (InpA; locus PIN0048) was studied in more detail and its 3D structure was determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-MallorquiFernandez1">[25]</xref>. Based on similarity of primary and tertiary structures to known proteinases, InpA is now classified into clan CA, family C10 and registered in the peptidase database MEROPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Rawlings1">[26]</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://merops.sanger.ac.uk" xlink:type="simple">http://merops.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). InpA is a secreted protein composed of 868 amino acid residues including a 44-residue signal peptide, a pro-domain (Ala1-Asn111), a catalytic domain (Val112-Pro359) and a 465-residue C-terminal extension arranged in domains with putative regulatory and secretory functions. However, the specific target(s) and function of InpA have yet to be characterized. In the present study, we have examined in detail the effect of InpA on the human complement system and found that this proteinase targets mainly the C3 component, thereby inhibiting all three complement pathways simultaneously.</p>

<title><italic>inpA</italic> gene is present in the majority of the clinical isolates of <italic>P. intermedia</italic></title>
<p>In order to estimate what fraction of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains found in periodontitis carry the <italic>inpA</italic> gene, detection by PCR was used on subgingival plaque samples obtained from 24 and 58 patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis, respectively. We have validated specificity of the PCR assay by investigating 25 samples that were negative for <italic>P. intermedia</italic> but rich in other periodontal pathogens. No positive signal was obtained in any of the tested <italic>Prevotella</italic>-negative samples showing that the assay is specific for <italic>Prevotella inpA</italic> gene (data not shown). <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was detected in 33% and 57% of plaque samples from chronic and aggressive periodontitis, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000316-t001">Table 1</xref>). The majority of <italic>P. intermedia-</italic>positive samples also yielded positive results regarding the <italic>inpA</italic> gene implying that InpA fulfils some important physiological function. Similarly, we found that the majority of cultivated <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains from various sources also express InpA at the protein level as shown by Western blotting analysis of culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The upper band recognized by the specific antibody corresponds to an unprocessed form of InpA while the lower bands are products of autocatalytic processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-MallorquiFernandez1">[25]</xref>. Western blotting of lysates of bacterial cells did not yield a signal implying that InpA is mainly secreted by the bacteria and does not associate in large amounts with cell wall in the strains tested (data not shown).</p>

<p>(A) Western blotting analysis of InpA expression. Five-day old broth cultures of nine <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains were adjusted to OD<sub>600</sub> of 2, and the culture supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and proteins transferred onto PVDF membranes. InpA was visualized with polyclonal antibodies. One lane shows purified InpA. (B) Western blotting analysis of gingival crevicular fluid (20 µL/lane) from patients with chronic periodontitis. Load of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was determined with qPCR (&lt;100 bacteria/sample “−”, 100–1,000 bacteria/sample “+”, 10,000–50 000 bacteria/sample “++”, &gt;50,000 bacteria/sample “+++”). The leftmost lane contains 1 µg of a purified inactive recombinant mutant, InpAC154A. (C) <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α were incubated with 2% NHS pretreated with increasing concentrations of InpA and InpAC154A, and the surviving bacteria were enumerated after overnight culture on LB agar plates. As a control, heat-inactivated NHS (ΔNHS) was used, and the survival of bacteria in this condition was set to 100%. (D) <italic>P. intermedia</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were incubated with 20% NHS and 40% NHS for 1.5 h in anaerobic conditions, respectively, with and without supplementation with 1 mM E64 protease inhibitor, and the surviving bacteria were enumerated after culture onto TSB and LB plates, respectively. In (C) and (D) an average of three independent experiments is presented with bars indicating standard deviation (SD).

<p>Furthermore, we have detected InpA protein in gingival crevicular fluid samples collected from four chronic periodontitis patients characterized with regard to pocket depth and bleeding-on-probing. The samples were analyzed for the <italic>P. intermedia</italic> load using qPCR and subjected to Western blotting analysis. We detected InpA in various forms in samples obtained from patients with significant load of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> but not from those negative for this pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The 90 kDa form is the unprocessed full length protein, the 76 kDa and the 40 kDa proteins are processed on the N-terminus and the C-terminus, respectively, while the 28 kDa form is the mature, fully-processed protein. These molecular weights are calculated based on amino acid composition. The 40 kDa form runs in fact as 45 kDa protein (28 kDa form as 32 kDa protein) upon separation on 12% SDS-PAGE gel.</p>

<title>Interpain A destroys the bactericidal activity of human serum</title>
<p>In order to quantitatively assess the effect of purified InpA on the bactericidal activity of human serum, we used an <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α model system whereby cells were incubated with normal human serum (NHS) pretreated with various concentrations of InpA or its inactive mutant (InpAC154A) and surviving cells enumerated by colony counting. InpA was found to be able to destroy the bactericidal activity of human serum in a dose-dependent manner and rescued <italic>E. coli</italic> that are otherwise very sensitive to killing by NHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains have been known to vary significantly in their ability to resist killing by NHS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Sundqvist1">[13]</xref>, hence, various strains were investigated to see if there was a relationship between the serum resistance of a given strain and its InpA expression level. By Western blotting, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strain 59 producing a large amount of InpA was found to have a 100% survival rate in 20% NHS while only 78% of the strain 57 with non-detectable InpA production survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). Furthermore, addition of a cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64 to NHS decreased the ability of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strain 59 to survive while it did not affect the killing of strain 57 or <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, the results obtained with both purified InpA and <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains showed that InpA compromised the bactericidal activity of human serum.</p>

<title>Interpain A destroys complement system in human serum</title>
<p>In order to understand in detail how InpA destroys the bactericidal activity of NHS, i.e. complement, the enzyme was incubated at various concentrations with human serum and hemolytic assays were used to assess activity of the classical and alternative pathways of complement in the pre-treated sera. InpA was found to be an efficient inhibitor of both pathways, whereas the inactive mutant InpAC154A did not show any inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). InpA was able to inhibit the classical pathway by 80% when present at high nanomolar concentrations (0.5 µM) while the alternative pathway was inhibited by 80% at 1.5 µM concentration. It should be noted, however, that 10% serum was used for the alternative pathway hemolytic assay versus 1.25% for the classical pathway. These concentrations were chosen on a basis of the initial titration and represent conditions in which each assay was most sensitive. The alternative pathway is known to require high concentrations of serum in order to function properly in contrast to the classical pathway that is rapidly activated even at fractions of percent of NHS. Taken together, it appears that InpA is approximately equally able to destroy activity of both the classical and alternative pathways.</p>

<title>Interpain A interferes with all three pathways by degrading mainly C3</title>
<p>Each complement pathway is composed of several factors activated in a consecutive manner. In order to assess which complement factor(s) were affected by InpA, a microtiter plate-based assay in which complement activation was initiated by various ligands depending on the pathway analyzed was used and the deposition of successive complement factors was then detected with specific antibodies. In the case of the classical pathway, complement activation was initiated by immunoglobulin deposition. We found that depositions of C1 and C4 from 2% serum were not affected by InpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). However, C3 was found to be sensitive to InpA and deposition of C3b from NHS was abolished at 2 µM InpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The inactive InpAC154A mutant had no effect on activation and deposition of C3b at any concentration tested. Accordingly, deposition of C9 that appears in the cascade after C3 was inhibited at similar concentrations as C3 indicating that the inhibitory effect on deposition of C9 was due to degradation of C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Interpain A attacks preferentially α-chains of C3 and C4</title>

<title>Kinetic parameters of C3 and C4 degradation by interpain A</title>
<p>When degradation of C3 and C4 was assessed at a set concentration of InpA for increasing incubation times, C4 was degraded at a faster rate than C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). To determine the kinetic parameters of degradation of C3b by InpA, surface plasmon resonance was employed. When the inactive InpAC154A proteinase was injected over immobilized C3b, no change in signal was detected (data not shown). However, upon injection of InpA, there was a rapid decrease in the signal measured in resonance units (RU) corresponding to degradation of C3b. The initial rates of proteolysis at each concentration of InpA were obtained from the initial slopes in the sensorgrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In this system, 1000 RU corresponds to a mass shift of 1 ng/mm<sup>2</sup>. The analysis demonstrated that 3 µM InpA degrades C3b at an initial rate of 7 pg/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g007">Figure 7B inset</xref>). The kinetic parameters of C3 and C4 degradation by InpA were also determined by fitting initial rates of degradation of α-chains of C3 and C4 into Michaelis-Menten equation. A constant amount of InpA was incubated with increasing concentrations of C3 and C4 and the initial rate of proteolysis at various substrate concentrations was estimated from the decrease of intensity of scanned bands corresponding to α-chains of C3 and C4 as resolved by SDS-PAGE. Using this approach, K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> for C4 degradation was determined to be 4.3+/−0.8 µM and 0.026+/−0.005 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Unfortunately, a reasonably accurate measurement of the kinetic constants for C3 was not possible since there was no visible saturation of the initial rate of C3 degradation up to 2 mg/mL (10 µM) of substrate, hence, the K<sub>m</sub> could only be estimated as greater than 20 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Factors governing <italic>P. intermedia</italic> infection are poorly studied when compared to other periodontal pathogens such as <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. However, it is becoming apparent that all successful human bacterial pathogens must develop strategies to circumvent the complement system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Zipfel1">[15]</xref>. Microorganisms in gingival sulcus are immersed in serum-derived tissue exudate—gingival crevicular fluid, which is similar in composition to human serum. Since complement components are present in gingival crevicular fluid at up to 70% of serum concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Schenkein2">[27]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> there is high level of complement activation in gingival fluid of patients with periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Attstrm1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Schenkein3">[29]</xref>, successful evasion of the complement system is paramount for the survival of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> in the periodontal pocket. One such strategy of defense against complement developed by <italic>P. intermedia</italic> appears to depend on the production of InpA, which we now show, is able to degrade complement factor C3, which is the central molecule of the whole complement system. Importantly, the majority of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains isolated from aggressive and chronic periodontitis carry and express the <italic>inpA</italic> gene.</p>
<p>The proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play important roles in the etiology of periodontitis and dental abscesses. These proteinases may contribute to tissue destruction, increase availability of nutrients and impair host defense by degrading immunoglobulins and components of the complement system. Proteinases of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> display trypsin-like and dipeptidylpeptidase activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Shibata1">[30]</xref> and also have the properties of cysteine proteinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Gazi1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Deschner1">[33]</xref>. They have also been reported to be capable of degrading immunoglobulins, particularly IgG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Kilian1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Jansen1">[35]</xref>, fibronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Wikstrom1">[36]</xref> and host proteinase inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Grenier2">[37]</xref>. The degradation of immunoglobulins was mediated mainly by cysteine proteinase(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Jansen1">[35]</xref>. Now we can add C3 to this list.</p>
<p>Importantly, inhibition of C3 function occurred even when InpA was incubated with whole NHS showing that C3 will be specifically degraded even in the presence of all other plasma proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g005">5</xref>). This is not the case for C4, which was degraded efficiently when purified proteins were used but its function was only weakly affected in the presence of whole serum. According to kinetic parameters determined with purified proteins, C4 should be a far better target for InpA than C3 in serum. Despite that C4 in serum seems to be resistant to proteolytic inactivation by InpA. To explain this discrepancy, we speculate that C4 may interact with other protein(s) in serum, which hinders InpA access to a cleavage site. Alternatively, the α-chain of C4 may also be susceptible to proteolysis in serum but the cleaved protein is still a functional source of C4b. The latter explanation is supported by the observation that in contrast to C3, proteolysis of C4 is more limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Such phenomenon has previously been observed for α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, which remained functionally active after cleavage with gingipains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Gron1">[38]</xref>. Importantly, it is clear that InpA will affect C3 in a way that it can no longer propagate the complement cascades; which should be of direct benefit to InpA producing <italic>P. intermedia</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, InpA showed a preference for the α-chain of C3 and C4, similar to what we have previously observed for gingipains. At low concentrations, gingipains were able to activate complement factors C3, C4 and C5 as they preferentially target the α-chains of these proteins to cause the release of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a as well as the activated forms C3b, C4b and C5b. Similarly, N-terminal sequencing of C3 and C4 fragments generated by InpA revealed that InpA will also release C3a and C4a. At higher concentrations, gingipains simply degrade these three complement factors, particularly C3, into smaller fragments so that they can no longer propagate the complement cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Wingrove1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Schenkein4">[39]</xref>. Yet again, we observe a similar phenomenon for InpA in case of C3. Also similar to gingipains, InpA was able to cause the deposition of C1 from serum onto inert surfaces without the need for a specific C1 activator; which may lead to local inflammation. However, whereas this effect could be recreated <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified C1 for gingipains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Popadiak1">[5]</xref>, InpA required serum to be present for this to occur (data not shown). Thus, it appears that InpA may require a third protein to induce C1 deposition from serum. Consequently, an intricate strategy emerges: periodontal bacteria at low concentrations appear to cause non-specific activation of C1 and to generate C5a and C3a fragments—chemotactic factors for neutrophils. This may lead to a low grade inflammation that provides access to nutrients for bacterial growth and colonization. At higher concentrations of bacteria and proteinases, the complement system becomes incapacitated by multiple cleavages of critical proteins within the cascade.</p>
<p><italic>P. intermedia</italic> can be highly resistant to complement and survive at very high serum concentrations but there are significant differences between various strains with regard to sensitivity to killing by complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Sundqvist1">[13]</xref>. In this study, we have shown that there is a correlation between the presence of InpA and serum resistance of <italic>P. intermedia</italic>. Using <italic>E. coli</italic> as a sensitive model to detect bactericidal activity of human serum, we have found that they were able to survive when supplemented with low micromolar concentrations of InpA in the presence of 2% NHS. In contrast, cells exposed to NHS alone or to NHS containing the inactive interpain mutant showed total loss of viability at this serum concentration. This clearly shows that purified InpA is very efficient at destroying bactericidal activity of NHS. Further, the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64 diminished serum resistance of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains.</p>
<p>It is plausible that <italic>P. intermedia</italic>, in similarity to other bacterial pathogens, has several strategies for evasion of killing by complement. <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> employs not only proteinases for defense from complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Popadiak1">[5]</xref> but it also produces a surface anionic polysaccharide, the presence of which strongly correlates with exceptional serum resistance of these bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Slaney1">[40]</xref>. This bacterium also attenuates the effects of complement by capturing human complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Potempa2">[16]</xref>. In this study, we have found that <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was able to retain some of its ability to resist killing even when incubated with serum containing the broad-spectrum inhibitor E64. However, InpA is a secreted protein and we do not expect large amounts of it being present in our bactericidal assay that has been performed within 1.5 h of culturing. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the bacteria will have the opportunity to secrete much more interpain into its pericellular environment. Our current methodology does not allow for truly quantitative analysis of the InpA content in gingival crevicular fluid. However, we can estimate from our Western blotting analysis that 20 µL of crevicular fluid contained at least 0.1 µg of InpA. Taking into account at least 20-fold dilution of crevicular fluid upon collection, the concentration of InpA in the two positive samples analyzed must be greater than 100 µg/mL. This corresponds to approximately 4 µM of fully processed InpA, implying that the concentration of InpA is high enough for inhibition of the complement system as described to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Our experiments also showed that InpA will aid survival of bystander bacterial species, thus, creating a favorable condition for the establishment of a common ecosystem that would be a beneficial habitat for all participating species. <italic>P. intermedia</italic>, together with <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> may be considered to be the early colonizers of tooth surfaces, thereby promoting secondary colonization of pathogenic organisms such as <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> by providing attachment sites, growth substrates and reduced oxygen concentration locally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Nonaka1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Kamaguchi1">[42]</xref>. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> belongs to the “orange complex”, which encompasses bacterial species bridging between healthy state and advanced periodontitis. Thus, degradation of C3 by InpA in synergy with gingipains of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> will complement the host immune evasion strategy of subgingival microbiota. Importantly, <italic>Prevotella</italic> species readily acquire resistance towards antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Walker1">[43]</xref> and deeper knowledge of how infection and serum resistance occur will be crucial for the development of alternative treatments to periodontal disease.</p>

<p>InpA as well as its inactive mutant InpAC154A (the catalytic cysteine was replaced by alanine) were expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified by affinity chromatography on Fast Flow Ni-NTA Sepharose (Qiagen) followed by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ, GE Healthcare) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-MallorquiFernandez1">[25]</xref>. The amount of active enzyme in wild-type InpA preparation was determined by active site titration using inhibitor E64 (Sigma). Briefly, recombinant protein was activated at 37°C for 15 min in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 freshly supplemented with 2 mM DTT and then preincubated with increasing concentrations of E64 for 37 min at room temperature. Residual enzyme activity was determined by measurement of fluorescence (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 380 nm and λ<sub>em</sub> = 460 nm) of AMC released from Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (PeptaNova) added to the reaction mixture at 250 µM final concentration and using the microplate spectrofluorimeter SpectraMax Gemini EM (Molecular Devices). The concentration of active InpA was calculated from the amount of inhibitor needed for total inactivation of the proteinase. The final preparations of wild type InpA and InpAC154A were assayed for possible contamination with lipopolysaccharide using Limulus test (Hycult Biotechnology) and found to contain 7 and 1 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide, respectively.

<p>Microtiter plates (Maxisorp; Nunc) were incubated overnight at 4°C with 50 µl of a solution containing 2 µg/mL human aggregated IgG (Immuno), 100 µg/mL mannan (Sigma, M-7504) or 20 µg/mL zymosan (Sigma, Z-4250) in 75 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6). Between each step of the procedure, the plates were washed four times with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.5). The wells were blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h at RT. NHS was diluted in GVB<sup>++</sup> buffer and used at a concentration of 2% for C3b, C4b, C1q (classical pathway), 4% for C3b, C4b, MBL (lectin pathway), 6% for C3 (alternative pathway) and 10% for C9 (all three pathways). These concentrations were chosen on the basis of initial titrations. NHS was mixed with various concentrations of preactivated InpA or InpAC154A and incubated in the wells of microtiter plates for 45 min at 37°C for C9 and MBL and 20 min at 37°C for C3b and C4b in case of the alternative and the lectin pathways. For the classical pathway, NHS was incubated with preactivated InpA or InpAC154A for 15 min at RT in eppendorf tubes and the enzyme was inhibited by addition of 20 µM E-64 (Calbiochem) to avoid degradation of IgM deposited on plates. Immediately after addition of inhibitor, NHS was incubated in microtiter plates for 45 min at 37°C for C9 and C1q and 20 min at 37°C for C3b and C4b. The inhibitor itself did not affect activation of complement at the concentration used (data not shown). Complement activation was assessed by detecting deposited complement factors using rabbit anti-C1q, anti-C4b, anti-C3d polyclonal antibodies (pAbs, DakoCytomation) goat anti-C9 pAb (Complement Technology) and goat anti-MBL (R&amp;D) diluted in the blocking buffer.
