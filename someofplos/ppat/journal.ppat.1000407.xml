<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>Hp</italic>) intimately interacts with the gastric epithelial surface and translocates the virulence factor CagA into host cells in a contact-dependent manner. To study how <italic>Hp</italic> benefits from interacting with the cell surface, we developed live-cell microscopy methods to follow the fate of individual bacteria on the cell surface and find that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to replicate and form microcolonies directly over the intercellular junctions. On polarized epithelia, <italic>Hp</italic> is able to grow directly on the apical cell surface in conditions that do not support the growth of free-swimming bacteria. In contrast, mutants in CagA delivery are defective in colonization of the apical cell surface. <italic>Hp</italic> perturbs the polarized epithelium in a highly localized manner, since wild-type <italic>Hp</italic> does not rescue the growth defect of the CagA-deficient mutants upon co-infection. CagA's ability to disrupt host cell polarity is a key factor in enabling colonization of the apical cell surface by <italic>Hp</italic>, as disruption of the atypical protein kinase C/Par1b polarity pathway leads to rescue of the mutant growth defect during apical infection, and CagA-deficient mutants are able to colonize the polarized epithelium when given access to the basolateral cell surface. Our study establishes the cell surface as a replicative niche and the importance of CagA and its effects on host cell polarity for this purpose.</p>

<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>Hp</italic>) is a bacterium that chronically infects the human stomach, in some cases leading to diseases such as stomach cancer and ulcers. The bacteria live in close proximity to the epithelial lining and can adhere directly to the host cell membrane and deliver toxins. We utilized live-cell imaging and a cell culture model of polarized epithelial cells to address why <italic>Hp</italic> attaches to the cell surface. We discovered that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to grow on the surface of epithelial cells, even in conditions where the free-swimming bacteria are rapidly killed. One mechanism involved in this ability to colonize the cell surface is the virulence factor CagA, which is injected directly into host cells by the bacteria. We found that CagA's ability to perturb cell polarity is important for the efficient survival and growth of <italic>Hp</italic> on the apical surface of the host cell. Our study establishes the cell surface as a niche for bacterial growth and elucidates a role of CagA for the bacterium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to cause infection bacteria have to colonize a specialized niche within the host. This implies adaptations that allow bacteria to reach, extract nutrients from, and replicate within particular anatomical and physiological environments in the host. Bacteria that colonize mucosal surfaces, for example, have to reach the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells in the face of mechanical and chemical clearance mechanisms, attach to molecules tethered to the cell membrane, and extract nutrients from the immediate environment to persist and replicate. Some mucosal colonizers replicate near the cell surface within epithelial secretions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Worlitzsch1">[1]</xref>, while others are found directly adhered to the apical surface of the cells, forming clusters of bacteria that suggest replication on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Steer1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Sloan1">[6]</xref>. How cell surface-adhered bacteria affect the host cell in order to survive and replicate in this niche has not been well studied.</p>
<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>Hp</italic>) represents an important example of a bacterium that establishes long-term and intimate interactions with the epithelial surface, in some cases causing serious diseases such as peptic ulcers and gastric cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Ernst1">[7]</xref>. Rather than persisting in the harsh environment of the stomach lumen, <italic>Hp</italic> has evolved the capacity to avoid the microbicidal acid in the stomach, by reaching and colonizing a very narrow anatomical niche near the surface of the epithelial lining. All <italic>Hp</italic> are found within 25 µm of the cell surface in the mucus layer immediately overlaying the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Schreiber1">[8]</xref>. Within this microenvironment, <italic>Hp</italic> survives as two major populations: one that is free-swimming in the mucus gel and utilizes motility, chemotaxis and stress responses to survive and swim towards the shelter of the epithelium; and a second population (∼20%) found directly adhered to the epithelial surface via multiple adhesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Hessey1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Mahdavi1">[11]</xref>. The more virulent strains of <italic>Hp</italic> also have contact-dependent mechanisms to interact with and modify epithelial cells, including a type IV secretion system (TFSS) that injects the virulence factor CagA into host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Backert1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Asahi1">[16]</xref>. CagA has multiple effects on epithelial cells, including the potential to modify apical junctions and perturb cell polarity, but its function for the benefit of the bacteria has not been established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bagnoli1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Zeaiter1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that <italic>Hp</italic> has evolved the capacity to adhere to and deliver bacterial products to the epithelial cells in order to colonize and grow directly on the cell surface, independently of the free-swimming form. We thus asked (i) whether <italic>Hp</italic> can replicate directly on the epithelial cell membrane, (ii) whether <italic>Hp</italic> can usurp the barrier and polarity of the epithelium to obtain nutrients from the cells or the interstitium in conditions where nutrients for free-swimming bacteria are limited, and (iii) whether the cag TFSS and CagA play a role in colonization of the cell surface.</p>
<p>In this study we show, in a cell culture model of a polarized epithelium, that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to replicate and grow directly on the cell surface in conditions that do not support the growth of the free-swimming bacteria. We also show that the contact-dependent virulence factor CagA plays a key role in altering epithelial cell polarity to enable adhered <italic>Hp</italic> to turn the apical cell surface into a replicative niche.</p>

<title><italic>Hp</italic> replicate and form clonal microcolonies directly at epithelial intercellular junctions</title>
<p>During initial interaction with an epithelium, <italic>Hp</italic> preferentially adhere to the intercellular junctions as single spiral bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Amieva1">[18]</xref>. Over a period of 12 to 24 hours, clusters comprised of 8 or more <italic>Hp</italic> become visible over the intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that initially attached <italic>Hp</italic> replicate to form microcolonies. However, static images from a time-course cannot distinguish between clonal growth of microcolonies vs. aggregation of adhered bacteria into clusters, or the recruitment of new free-swimming bacteria to sites of adhesion. To directly distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a live-cell imaging system controlled for temperature, atmosphere and light levels, to enable tracking of individual <italic>Hp</italic> after attachment to the cell surface (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). We observed individual <italic>Hp</italic> elongating and dividing, over several cycles of replication, all while remaining adhered to the cell membrane near their original attachment site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s006">Video S1</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Confocal immunofluorescence time course of <italic>Hp</italic> attachment and microcolony formation on the cell surface. MDCK cells were infected for 5 minutes and washed (0 hr), and then incubated for times shown. Monolayers were stained with anti-<italic>Hp</italic> antibodies (red) and for the apical junctions (anti-ZO-1, green). Bottom panels show cross sections through the monolayer (also stained for f-actin in blue). Scale bars 5 µm. (B) DIC time-lapse of <italic>Hp</italic> replicating on the MDCK cell surface. Single bacteria were followed through 1.5 rounds of replication. Star indicates the bacterium of each pair being followed. Images from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s006">Video S1</xref> aligned horizontally. Time in minutes is indicated. Scale bar 1 µm. (C) DIC time-lapse movie of <italic>Hp</italic> replicating on the cell surface of primary murine gastric epithelial cells (GPC) of pit lineage. <italic>Hp</italic> were attached near a cell junction at 0 hr and followed through 2 rounds of replication (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s007">Video S2</xref>). Scale bar 1 µm. (D) Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of GFP-<italic>Hp</italic> (green) replicating over the epithelial junctions of MDCK cells expressing RFP-E-cadherin (red). GFP-<italic>Hp</italic> shown in the top panel was filmed as it adhered to the cell surface, and followed for several hours (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s008">Video S3</xref>). Scale bar 5 µm. (E) A longer time-lapse recording of cells infected as in (D), starting a day after initial infection (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s009">Video S4</xref>). Scale bar 5 µm. (F) <italic>Hp</italic> replication rate on the surface of MDCK or Gastric Primary Cells (GPC). <italic>Hp</italic> were followed by DIC microscopy as in (B) and (C). Cycles of replication were noted by single frame analysis of the video recordings taken at 1–2 minute resolution. Points on the graph represent individual <italic>Hp</italic> that were followed over a replication cycle, collected from multiple experiments. Median rates of replication on the cell surface were 227, 196, and 220 minutes for WT on MDCK, WT on GPC, and Ä<italic>cagA</italic> on MDCK respectively. These were not significantly different from each other as determined by Mann-Whitney statistical test.</p>

<p>To better visualize the spatial relationship between the epithelial junctions and the replicating cell-associated <italic>Hp</italic>, we infected MDCK cells stably expressing the junctional protein E-cadherin fused to red fluorescent protein (MDCK Ecad-RFP), with <italic>Hp</italic> expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). We confirmed that individual <italic>Hp</italic> preferentially adhere over the junctional area, and remain there as they replicate, even as the host cells move (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s008">Video S3</xref>). This persisted throughout the course of 2 days, resulting in the formation of large microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s009">Video S4</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Hp</italic> grow on the apical surface of a polarized monolayer in conditions where free-swimming bacteria are killed</title>
<p>The finding that <italic>Hp</italic> adhere to and replicate directly on the cell surface suggests that <italic>Hp</italic> has evolved specific adaptations to survive on this niche. However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, cell polarity allows epithelial cells to create distinct apical (luminal) vs. basolateral (interstitial) cell surfaces. The apical surface of epithelia is bathed in conditions very different from those of the interstitial compartment, which contains nutrients necessary for epithelial maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bryant1">[24]</xref>. To better mimic intact tissue polarity, we used a Transwell filter system that allows tight separation of the apical and basolateral regions of the epithelium. MDCK cells grown on Transwell filters polarize and form a barrier between the two chambers, so that media applied to the basal chamber does not leak components into the apical chamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Vogelmann1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Pentecost1">[26]</xref>. We added co-culture media able to support the growth of cells and <italic>Hp</italic> (DMEM supplemented with FBS and Brucella broth) to the basal chamber, and bathed the apical side of the cells in DMEM only, which does not support <italic>Hp</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Free-swimming <italic>Hp</italic> (∼10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/ml) were added to the apical side of the polarized epithelium for 5 minutes (MOI 100∶1), and non-adherent bacteria removed by extensive washing, resulting in ∼0.1% of the inoculum attaching to the cell surface (∼1 bacterium/10 cells). Bacterial counts from the population attached to the epithelium (cell-associated) increased in accord with a <italic>Hp</italic> doubling time of 4–6 hours over the first day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The apical surface was washed and fresh media replaced daily. Under these conditions, the cell-associated <italic>Hp</italic> population maintained a steady-state level of ∼10<sup>7</sup> bacteria/monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This shows that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to grow and colonize the apical surface of a polarized epithelium, despite the lack of appropriate nutrients in the medium.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we monitored the counts from the free-swimming (planktonic) <italic>Hp</italic> population, and found that the counts mirrored those of the cell-associated population, increasing over the first day, and recovering to a steady level of ∼10<sup>6</sup> bacteria/chamber each day, despite washing of the epithelium and replacement of the apical media daily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). To determine if <italic>Hp</italic> grows both in the planktonic and cell-associated form on the polarized epithelium, we asked if the planktonic population grows independently of the cell-associated population. Moving the planktonic population with the apical media into a new culture well without host cells induced a rapid decrease in bacterial counts, indicating that the planktonic population does not survive independently of the host cells and the cell-associated <italic>Hp</italic> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To distinguish whether <italic>Hp</italic> growth on the apical cell surface is due to damage of the epithelial barrier with a resultant leak of nutrients into the apical chamber, or if it instead occurs without gross disruption of monolayer integrity, we used the bacteria as sensors to test whether the apical medium becomes enriched in nutrients sufficient to support <italic>Hp</italic> growth. Media from the apical chambers of polarized monolayers (infected or uninfected) were collected and filtered to remove bacteria, before re-inoculating with fresh <italic>Hp</italic> grown on agar plates. Such “conditioned-apical” media from monolayers, whether infected or not, did not support growth of plate-grown <italic>Hp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This said, the death rate of <italic>Hp</italic> in this conditioned-apical media was slower than in DMEM, indicating that the presence of cells does change the media composition, but not sufficiently to enable replication of planktonic bacteria. In agreement with these results, two different tests for macromolecule diffusion across the monolayers (tracking biotinylated albumin or 10 kD dextran) revealed no detectable gross leakage of macromolecules over 5 days of <italic>Hp</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s002">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Examination of a time-course of infected monolayers on Transwell filters by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that <italic>Hp</italic> replicate while adhered to the polarized apical cell surface without detectable disruption of the epithelium, and despite the lack of essential nutrients in the surrounding medium. Under our experimental conditions, most of the initial attached <italic>Hp</italic> are single, spiral shaped, and attach directly over the apical junctions (83%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g003">Figure 3A, 3D, and 3G</xref>). Attachment to cellular microvilli was the most prominent initial interaction between <italic>Hp</italic> and the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Growth of single bacteria into microcolonies was observed within 1 day after infection, and spiral bacteria in the process of dividing were noted by SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g003">Figure 3B, 3E, and 3H</xref>). After 3 days of growth, larger microcolonies consisting of mostly spiral bacteria were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g003">Figure 3C, 3F, and 3I</xref>).</p>

<title>CagA provides a critical advantage for colonization of the apical cell surface</title>
<p>Having established that wild type (WT) <italic>Hp</italic> is able to colonize a polarized cell surface, we next examined how the <italic>Hp</italic> virulence factor CagA, a contact-dependent effector protein, affects bacterial survival in this niche. While much work has been done describing the effects of CagA on epithelial cells, little is known about how CagA benefits the bacteria.</p>
<p>We utilized a two-chambered coverglass system to simultaneously observe and compare, by time-lapse microscopy, WT and CagA-deficient mutants (Δ<italic>cagA</italic>) after they adhered to the cell surface. Both WT and Δ<italic>cagA</italic> were able to replicate on the cell surface and form microcolonies, with similar replication rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). However, unlike in the Transwell system, during live-cell imaging the apical and basal compartments are not separated, the cells are not polarized, and the medium contains all the nutrients required for replication.</p>
<p>Since several reports have shown that CagA has the ability to disrupt host cell junction function and cellular polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bagnoli1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Zeaiter1">[21]</xref>, we hypothesized that CagA might serve to provide <italic>Hp</italic> access to nutrients normally found only on the basolateral side of the epithelium, thereby enabling successful colonization of the apical surface. To test this hypothesis, we used the Transwell system to infect polarized MDCK monolayers from the apical side with either WT or Δ<italic>cagA</italic>. We also tested an isogenic <italic>cag</italic> pathogenicity island deletion mutant (Δ<italic>cagPAI</italic>). In striking contrast to WT, growth of Δ<italic>cagA</italic> and Δ<italic>cagPAI</italic> were reduced 100× (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Both mutant strains grow as well as WT if co-culture media is provided in the apical chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that this phenotype is not due to an <italic>in vitro</italic> growth defect of the mutants. Delivery of CagA into the host cells is required for effective colonization of the apical cell surface, as deletion of a TFSS gene (<italic>cagE</italic>) essential for CagA translocation also led to ∼100× reduction in the bacterial counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s003">Figure S2A</xref>). This attenuation in growth was not due to the presence of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the mutants, since an isogenic deletion mutant in the <italic>ureA</italic> and <italic>ureB</italic> genes (Δ<italic>ureAB</italic>), carrying the same resistance cassette as Δ<italic>cagA</italic>, grew as well as WT in polarized conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s003">Figure S2B</xref>). We also tested a second <italic>Hp</italic> strain, 7.13, that has been characterized for its ability to deliver CagA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and which causes gastric cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Franco1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Franco2">[28]</xref>.

<p>Finally, we complemented Δ<italic>cagA</italic> with the <italic>cagA</italic> gene. The reconstituted strain (CagA*) produces equivalent amounts of CagA protein as WT, delivers CagA to epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s004">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s001">Protocol S1</xref>), and recovers the ability to colonize the apical cell surface of a polarized epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if CagA acts globally on the epithelium or locally at the site of individual microcolony growth, we tested whether WT would rescue Δ<italic>cagA</italic> if both co-infected the same monolayer. We first determined that a 1∶1 mixture of WT and Δ<italic>cagA</italic> in the apical chamber have similar growth kinetics in the presence of nutrients by inoculating a fixed monolayer. Fixation makes the monolayers permeable to nutrients and macromolecules from the basal chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s002">Figure S1D</xref>). Mixed WT and Δ<italic>cagA</italic> grow equally well under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, when we infect live, polarized monolayers, WT are able to survive and grow, but do not rescue the growth of Δ<italic>cagA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>To examine how lack of CagA affects the growth of microcolonies on the cell surface, we used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and SEM to examine a time-course of polarized cells infected with Δ<italic>cagA</italic>. Initial adherence of Δ<italic>cagA</italic> to the apical cell surface (14 bacteria/100 cells) was not lower than WT (9 bacteria/100 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). After 5 minutes of infection, both adhered preferentially to intercellular junctions (83% of WT vs. 74% of Δ<italic>cagA</italic>, p = 0.2), and were spiral shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). However, Δ<italic>cagA</italic> exhibit a defect in microcolony formation on the cell surface, forming significantly smaller microcolonies than WT by day 3 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g003">Figure 3C and 3F</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g006">Figure 6C, 6G, and 6H</xref>). In addition, there were striking differences present at the ultrastructural level even by day 1 post-infection, with almost half of Δ<italic>cagA</italic> in various stages of coccoid formation, exhibiting swelling of the cell body and degenerate flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g006">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>). At later time points (3 days post-infection), Δ<italic>cagA</italic> consisted mostly of aggregates of coccoid bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). The morphology of the free-swimming bacteria in the apical chamber supernatant was also different in WT vs. Δ<italic>cagA</italic> beginning after one day of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s005">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s001">Protocol S1</xref>). Both strains initially consisted of spiral bacteria with polar flagella, but over time, the apical supernatant from the Δ<italic>cagA</italic> infection had increasing numbers of coccoid bacteria, and the viable counts decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000407.s005">Figure S4</xref>).

<title>CagA disruption of epithelial polarity is important in <italic>Hp</italic> colonization of the cell surface</title>
<p>CagA has the ability to affect both barrier function of an epithelium, as well as to disrupt cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bagnoli1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Zeaiter1">[21]</xref>. We asked whether CagA is providing localized leakage of nutrients from the interstitial space or whether CagA affects the cells themselves to provide <italic>Hp</italic> with the nutrients required for growth. As shown above, in our experimental conditions, intercellular leakage appears to be minimal, since WT does not rescue Δ<italic>cagA</italic> in a mixed infection on a polarized epithelium, and we do not observe significant leakage of solutes across the monolayer. We thus asked whether WT is still able to colonize and grow on the cell surface of a polarized epithelium in the absence of extracellular nutrients provided in the basal media.</p>
<p>We generated polarized cells and then replaced both apical and basal media with DMEM at the time of infection. We found that WT is still able to survive and grow on the apical cell surface, while Δ<italic>cagA</italic> exhibits the same ∼100× defect in colonization observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This result implies that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to obtain needed nutrients from the epithelial cells themselves. It also suggests the hypothesis that epithelial polarity, independently of the barrier function of the junctions, is an important target of pathogenesis, and that CagA's effects on cell polarity may be involved in colonizing the apical cell surface.</p>

<p>To begin testing this hypothesis, we asked whether the basolateral vs. apical surfaces of the epithelium have intrinsically different abilities to support the growth of <italic>Hp</italic>. We repeated the Transwell system experiment above, but infected the cells either from the apical or basal side, and utilized filters with larger 3 µm pores to allow <italic>Hp</italic> access to the basolateral surface of the cells. Strikingly, when the bacteria are allowed to infect from the basal side, where they have access to the basolateral surface of the polarized epithelial cells, Δ<italic>cagA</italic> grow as well as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000407-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>The results above suggest that cell polarity is a deterrent to <italic>Hp</italic> colonization of the cell surface, and that CagA functions in colonization of this niche by perturbing cell polarity. This implies that disrupting cell polarity should result in rescue of Δ<italic>cagA</italic>, allowing it to now colonize the apical cell surface.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While many microbial infections disrupt the epithelial barrier in order to cause damage, reach deeper tissues or disseminate, here we present the concept that, in addition, some pathogenic bacteria affect epithelial polarity to use the cell surface as a replicative niche. We found that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to replicate while remaining adhered to the cell surface, forming clonal microcolonies. Microcolony formation on the cell surface has been observed for <italic>Hp</italic> in human infection, as well as in several other mucosal colonizers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Steer1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Sloan1">[6]</xref>. Our observations suggest that <italic>Hp</italic> and other microbes may be taking advantage of the cell surface in order to exploit a niche that is distinct from growth in epithelial secretions.</p>
<p>We were able to begin dissecting whether cell-associated <italic>Hp</italic> can grow independently of the planktonic population by mimicking intact tissue polarity using a Transwell filter system. Epithelial cell polarity is the ability to generate distinct apical vs. basolateral surfaces, as well as the maintenance of a barrier between the lumenal vs. interstitial spaces. This has been studied mostly in the context of cellular development and physiology in which tissue maintenance, wound healing and vectorial transport of nutrients and ions are controlled by epithelial polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bryant1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Mellman1">[34]</xref>. However, most epithelia also serve as a barrier to microbial invasion, and are constantly exposed through their apical side to interactions with microbes. As such, some aspects of epithelial polarity may have also evolved to deter bacterial colonization of the apical cell surface. We found that <italic>Hp</italic> survive, grow, and form microcolonies on the apical surface of a polarized monolayer, in conditions where the free-swimming <italic>Hp</italic> population is rapidly killed.</p>
<p>To examine the molecular mechanisms involved in cell surface colonization, we tested the role of the cag TFSS and CagA. CagA is the only known effector protein translocated into host cells through <italic>Hp</italic>'s TFSS. CagA-positive strains are correlated with more severe disease outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Blaser1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Covacci1">[37]</xref>, and CagA's effects on the host cell have been a topic of intense study. In addition to its effects on cellular polarity and tight junction function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bagnoli1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Zeaiter1">[21]</xref>, CagA is also known to activate receptor tyrosine kinase growth factor-like signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Mimuro1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Higashi1">[41]</xref> and affect cellular turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Mimuro2">[42]</xref>. These effects of CagA may be important in its ability to act as a bacterial oncogene, leading to the development of carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Ohnishi1">[43]</xref>. However, the fundamental question of how CagA might act to benefit <italic>Hp</italic> has remained unclear, although a recent report showed that <italic>Hp</italic> Δ<italic>cagA</italic> mutants are less effective in colonizing the stomach in a Mongolian gerbil model of <italic>Hp</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Mimuro2">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>We found that Δ<italic>cagA</italic> mutants became coccoid in morphology as early as one day after infection of a polarized epithelium, and formed small aborted microcolonies on the cell surface. A coccoid morphology in <italic>Hp</italic> is associated with stress conditions and thought to be a specialized form of cell death or degeneration, although there remains controversy regarding whether coccoid <italic>Hp</italic> are viable but non-culturable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Kusters1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Kelly1">[47]</xref>. Δ<italic>cagA</italic> were not rescued by WT <italic>Hp</italic> in mixed infections, indicating the highly localized nature of CagA action in mediating the ability of <italic>Hp</italic> to colonize the polarized epithelium.</p>
<p>CagA's ability to disrupt cellular polarity and tight junction function has led to the idea that disruption of the epithelial barrier is a means to acquire nutrients located in the interstitium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Blaser2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-vanAmsterdam1">[49]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, both polarity and barrier disruption may occur, since <italic>Hp</italic> utilize multiple strategies to perturb the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Wroblewski1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Suzuki2">[51]</xref>. Our use of a simplified experimental system allows us to distinguish between CagA's effects on cell polarity vs. its effects on epithelial barrier function on <italic>Hp</italic> colonization of the apical cell surface. We found that CagA's effects on cell polarity, independent of its ability to disrupt barrier function, plays a key role in enabling <italic>Hp</italic> to turn the apical cell surface into a replicative niche. In contrast to apical infection, the Δ<italic>cagA</italic> mutant survived and grew as well as WT upon infection from the basolateral surface, indicating that the apical vs. basolateral membranes are intrinsically different in their ability to support <italic>Hp</italic> growth. Further, inhibition of the aPKC/Par1b polarity pathway, known to be affected by CagA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Saadat1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Zeaiter1">[21]</xref>, led to rescue of Δ<italic>cagA</italic>, which was now able to survive and grow on the apical cell surface.</p>
<p>Our findings show that the sophisticated manipulation of cell polarity by injection of CagA is one mechanism that enables <italic>Hp</italic> to exploit the apical cell surface as a replicative niche. Further studies will reveal which specific nutrients <italic>Hp</italic> extracts from the epithelium, and how perturbations of polarity result in altering the epithelial surface for the benefit of colonizing microbes. As an example, iron is a key nutrient important for <italic>Hp</italic> growth that is known to be sequestered by the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Merrell1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Payne1">[53]</xref>. It has been reported that <italic>Hp</italic> is able to survive despite iron chelation in the medium, when grown in the presence of host cells, suggesting that the bacteria are able to extract needed iron directly from the host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-vanAmsterdam2">[54]</xref>. Of note, the presence of lactoferrin in mucosal secretions, where it sequesters iron, and the delivery of iron to cells via transferrin, which binds iron in the interstitium, requires their proper polarized secretion and transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Fuller1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Masson1">[59]</xref>. We speculate that perturbation of the ability of polarized epithelial cells to vectorially direct and compartmentalize micronutrients, sequester receptors for adhesion away from microbes, or control secretion of anti-microbial factors, may all be targets for microbes that utilize the cell surface as a replicative niche.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that the delivery of CagA itself may be regulated by cell polarity, since a recent report proposed that CagL on the TFSS must interact with integrin α5β1 receptors before CagA is delivered into host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Kwok1">[60]</xref>. Integrins are exclusively localized at basolateral membranes in an intact polarized epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Bosman1">[61]</xref>, suggesting that the localization of initial attachment, and perhaps other means of initially perturbing polarity, are important in injecting CagA.</p>
<p>In the same way that intracellular pathogens have evolved diverse molecular adaptations to colonize the inside of the host cell, we suggest that the apical cell surface presents unique challenges for microbial colonization. We propose the concept that <italic>Hp</italic> locally modulates epithelial polarity through CagA as one strategy to colonize the cell surface. This concept may be pertinent not only for <italic>Hp</italic>, but also for other mucosal colonizers such as enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, for which microcolonies on the host cell surface have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Phillips1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Hicks1">[5]</xref>, and which is known to disrupt host cell polarity at the site of bacterial attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-MuzaMoons1">[62]</xref>. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has also been shown to locally disrupt cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000407-Kierbel1">[63]</xref>, raising the possibility that several microbial pathogens have evolved strategies to usurp this epithelial function for their benefit. Further study of this niche is likely to reveal additional molecular mechanisms for bacterial survival, ranging from specialized adhesion, to mechanisms for microcolony formation and dispersal, and to novel strategies for perturbing the epithelial barrier and cell polarity. It also presents a novel niche of host-bacterial interactions for which therapeutic or preventive targets may be developed.</p>

<p>Just prior to infection, fresh co-culture media was added to the basal chamber. For experiments in DMEM alone, the basal chamber was washed 5 times with fresh DMEM before final addition of DMEM. <italic>Hp</italic> (∼10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/ml) were added to the apical chamber, allowed to adhere for 5 minutes, and cell monolayers then washed 5 times with fresh DMEM to remove non-adherent bacteria. Appropriate media was added back to the apical chamber, and the cells incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Basal media was changed daily. After sampling for colony-forming unit (CFU) counts from the apical chamber each day, cell monolayers were washed 3 times with fresh DMEM, before appropriate media added back and the cells returned to the incubator. For mixed infections, samples were also plated on Columbia blood agar plates containing 25 µg/ml chloramphenicol, in order to differentiate the two strains. Data are shown as means±SD. For counts of cell-associated <italic>Hp</italic>, after the cell monolayers were washed 3 times with fresh DMEM, they were incubated for 5 minutes with DMEM containing 1% saponin (Sigma), and the monolayers then scrapped off the filter. The cells were dispersed by 8 passages through a 27-gauge syringe, and samples plated for CFU counts. Where used, the Par1b inhibitor hymenialdisine (Biomol International) was added at a final concentration of 20 µM, and the myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor (United States Biological) was added at a final concentration of 10 µM to the media in the basal chamber.

Alexa-fluor 647 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used for visualization of the actin cytoskeleton. Samples were imaged with a BioRad Confocal MRC-1024 microscope, and z-stacks reconstructed into 3D using Volocity software (Improvision). For quantification of microcolony sizes, we randomly sampled 100 µm×100 µm optical fields by confocal microscopy. The 3D reconstructions of the confocal stacks were used to collect the fluorescence voxel volume of each microcolony stained with anti-<italic>Hp</italic> antibodies.

<p>Tracking of solute diffusion across polarized monolayers. (A) Determination of detection limit and linear range of biotin-albumin by western blot. Biotin-albumin from a 2 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in PBS was diluted into DMEM starting at 1 µg/ml. These were further diluted 1∶1 in SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and an amount of biotin-albumin equivalent to 0.2 ng to 10 ng was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with Alexa-fluor 647-conjugated streptavidin and bands visualized by the LI-COR Odyssey Scanner. The 24-bit data scan of each band was quantified by determining the integrated intensity of the pixel signals using the Odyssey software. Background was detected by obtaining readings of the integrated intensity from 5 other areas in the blot. Arbitrary units were used for the integrated intensity graph. The data was plotted as integrated intensity minus the background. A best-fit linear curve for the data is shown, as is the linear formula and its fit. The detection limit was around 0.2 ng, which represents a concentration of 20 ng/ml of biotin-albumin in the apical chamber or 0.13% of what would be expected if there were free diffusion between the basolateral and apical chambers. (B) Five-day <italic>Hp</italic> infection does not lead to gross disruption of monolayer integrity. 30 µg of biotin-albumin was added to the basal chamber of uninfected or infected polarized monolayers. The apical supernatant was sampled daily and 10 µl of these samples separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose and the biotinylated albumin visualized with fluorescent streptavidin. Each band was quantified with the Odyssey Scanner (see Figure S1A). The solid line plots the concentration of biotin-albumin detected each day in the apical chamber of the infected cells. The dotted line shows a similar plot with samples collected from uninfected Transwell chambers. In uninfected polarized monolayers we detected a daily apical concentration of 50±2 ng/ml (0.33%) constantly over 8 days. With <italic>Hp</italic> infected monolayers we found similar levels of apical biotin-albumin (57±2 ng/ml 0.38%) in the first 5 days of infection. By 8 days of infection a higher amount of transfer was detected in infected monolayers (80 ng/ml) but still only accounting for 0.53% of what would be expected if there were free diffusion of macromolecules between the two chambers. (C) Determination of detection limit and linear range of 10 kD Alexa-fluor 647 dextran by the LI-COR Odyssey Scanner. A dilution series starting with 100 µg/ml of fluorescent dextran in DMEM was made in a 96-well plate. All samples were in triplicate, and fluorescence directly detected using the LI-COR Odyssey Scanner. Scan data was obtained and a best-fit linear curve determined as in (A). The detection limit was around 1.5 µg/ml. (D) <italic>Hp</italic> infection does not lead to gross leakage of basal contents into the apical chamber. Using the Transwell system, live or fixed cells were either left uninfected or infected with WT. After 1 day, fresh DMEM was added to the apical chamber, and 100 µg/ml fluorescent 10 kD Alexa-fluor 647 dextran in DMEM added to the basal chamber for 30 minutes. Samples were then taken from the apical chamber, and fluorescence directly measured in a LI-COR Odyssey Scanner. Data is presented as percent diffusion of starting amount of dextran into the apical chamber. Detection limit (2%) is indicated by the line labeled “Bkg”. Fixing the monolayers perturbs barrier function, allowing diffusion of basal solutes into the apical compartment. With fixed uninfected or infected monolayers we detected about 10–12% diffusion of dextran apically in 30 minutes. With live uninfected or infected monolayers we could not detect any transfer of 10 kD dextran into the apical chamber.</p>
