<p>The continued spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses among poultry and wild birds, together with the emergence of drug-resistant variants and the possibility of human-to-human transmission, has spurred attempts to develop an effective vaccine. Inactivated subvirion or whole-virion H5N1 vaccines have shown promising immunogenicity in clinical trials, but their ability to elicit protective immunity in unprimed human populations remains unknown. A cold-adapted, live attenuated vaccine with the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of an H5N1 virus A/VN/1203/2004 (clade 1) was protective against the pulmonary replication of homologous and heterologous wild-type H5N1 viruses in mice and ferrets. In this study, we used reverse genetics to produce a cold-adapted, live attenuated H5N1 vaccine (AH/AA<italic>ca</italic>) that contains HA and NA genes from a recent H5N1 isolate, A/Anhui/2/05 virus (AH/05) (clade 2.3), and the backbone of the cold-adapted influenza H2N2 A/AnnArbor/6/60 virus (AA<italic>ca</italic>). AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> was attenuated in chickens, mice, and monkeys, and it induced robust neutralizing antibody responses as well as HA-specific CD4+ T cell immune responses in rhesus macaques immunized twice intranasally. Importantly, the vaccinated macaques were fully protected from challenge with either the homologous AH/05 virus or a heterologous H5N1 virus, A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/05 (BHG/05; clade 2.2). These results demonstrate for the first time that a cold-adapted H5N1 vaccine can elicit protective immunity against highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infection in a nonhuman primate model and provide a compelling argument for further testing of double immunization with live attenuated H5N1 vaccines in human trials.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>H5N1 influenza viruses have caused human infections with more than 60% fatality in 14 countries and may yet be the source of the next pandemic. Therefore, the development of effective vaccines against these viruses is the highest priority for H5N1 pandemic preparedness. A high dosage or adjuvants improve the immunogenicity of H5N1 inactivated vaccines; however, limited production capacity for conventional inactivated influenza virus vaccines could severely hinder the ability to control the spread of H5N1 influenza through vaccination. Here, we generated and tested the efficacy of a cold-adapted, live attenuated H5N1 vaccine in mice and nonhuman primates. We found that the vaccine provided complete protection in these animals against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus challenge. Since live vaccines require less processing than inactivated vaccines and do not require adjuvants, our study represents a major advance in vaccine development for H5N1 pandemic influenza.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1996, a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus was detected in geese in China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Chen1">[1]</xref>. A year later, a reassortant H5N1 virus caused disease outbreaks in poultry in Hong Kong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Shortridge1">[2]</xref> and was transmitted to humans, infecting 18 people, six of whom died <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Claas1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Subbarao1">[4]</xref>. Beginning in late 2003, outbreaks of H5N1 influenza A virus infection appeared among poultry, and wild birds in numerous countries in Asia and subsequently were reported in Europe and Africa (Office International des Epizooties [OIE]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oie.int" xlink:type="simple">http://www.oie.int</ext-link>). Despite substantial efforts to control the infection in poultry, H5N1 viruses have continued to evolve and spread, producing human infections in 14 countries, with 236 of the 372 confirmed cases proving fatal (World Health Organization [WHO]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int" xlink:type="simple">http://www.who.int</ext-link>). The emergence of H5N1 viruses resistant to adamantanes and oseltamivir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-deJong1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Le1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Cheung1">[7]</xref> has raised serious concerns over the ability of current antiviral agents to prevent global influenza outbreaks. Thus, the development of an effective vaccine has assumed the highest priority in preparedness for an H5N1 influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>H5N1 inactivated vaccines can induce functional and cross-reactive antibodies that protect ferrets or nonhuman primates from H5N1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Ruat1">[8]</xref>, and have been shown to be safe and tolerable in human trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Treanor1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Bresson1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Lin1">[11]</xref>. With the addition of adjuvants, such vaccines induce antibody titers that are known to provide protection against seasonal influenza in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Lin1">[11]</xref>, however, the antibody level considered to be protective was based on findings in humans who had likely been exposed to the seasonal human virus and thus were “preimmunized”. Because the vast majority of humans have not been exposed to highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, it is still unknown whether the level of antibody known to be protective against seasonal human influenza virus infection would also be effective against H5N1 viruses. Additionally, while humoral immunity is effectively induced by the inactivated vaccines, the cellular immune response is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Gambotto1">[12]</xref>. This deficit has raised concern because of indications that the cellular immune response may play a significant role in protection against H5N1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Gambotto1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The cold-adapted (<italic>ca</italic>) influenza virus A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA) (H2N2) has been developed as a live attenuated vaccine seed virus that exhibits cold-adaptation, temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>), and attenuation (<italic>att</italic>) phenotypes which are specified by mutations in the internal genes. Reassortant H1N1 and H3N2 human influenza A viruses with the six internal gene segments of the AA<italic>ca</italic> virus have been repeatedly demonstrated to bear these phenotypes and extensive evaluation in humans has proven them to be attenuated and safe as live virus vaccines (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Maassab1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Belshe1">[15]</xref>). In previous studies, live attenuated H5N1 vaccines generated by reverse genetics and comprising internal genes of the AA<italic>ca</italic> virus and the HA and NA genes derived from earlier H5N1 influenza viruses were proved to be safe in mice and ferrets, and to protect these animals from death against different H5N1 viruses challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Li1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Suguitan1">[17]</xref>. In this study, we produced three live attenuated, <italic>ca</italic> H5N1 viruses, using reverse genetics, that contain the HA and NA genes of H5N1 viruses isolated at different times and from different species in China. After <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic> analyses, one of the cold-adapted virus that contains the HA and NA genes from a recent H5N1 virus, A/Anhui/2/2005 (AH/05) (clade 2.3), was selected for immunogenicity and efficacy testing in mice and nonhuman primates.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of H5N1 cold-adapted reassortant viruses</title>
<p>We constructed three H5N1 reassortant virus by reverse genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Fodor1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Neumann1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Hoffmann1">[20]</xref>, using the published sequences of the low pathogenic A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca virus (AA<italic>ca</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Cox1">[21]</xref> to generate all of the genes encoding the internal proteins. The HA and NA genes were from the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses, including A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GS/GD/96) (clade 0), A/chicken/Shanxi/2/2006(CK/SX/06), a virus isolated from chickens in northern Chine in 2006, and A/Anhui/2/2005 (AH/05) (clade 2.3), which was isolated from a human in China (WHO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int" xlink:type="simple">http://www.who.int</ext-link>). The multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, a major virulence motif for H5N1 influenza viruses, were replaced with those found at the HA cleavage site of a nonpathogenic avian influenza virus, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Li1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Subbarao2">[22]</xref>. The cold-adapted (<italic>ca</italic>) and temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) phenotypes of the resultant viruses GSGD/AA<italic>ca</italic>, CKSX/AA<italic>ca</italic>, and AH/AA<italic>ca</italic>, attributable to the internal genes of AA<italic>ca</italic>, were also confirmed as described previously (data not shown). The <italic>ca</italic> reassortant viruses did not cause disease or death in chickens upon intranasal or intravenous administration, while all of the three wild-type H5N1 viruses are lethal to chickens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Replication and immunogenicity of the reassortant viruses in mice</title>
<p>We evaluated the replication of GSGD/AA<italic>ca</italic>, CKSX/AA<italic>ca</italic>, and AH/AA<italic>ca</italic>, in mammals, using the BALB/c mouse. Groups of 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> (dose required to infect 50% of eggs) of the reassortant viruses or their wild-type H5N1 viruses. Three mice in each group were killed on day 3 postinoculation (p.i.) and their organs were collected for virus titration. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Chen1">[1]</xref>, the replication of the wild-type GS/GD/96 virus was not detected in any organs on day 3 p.i.; however, the <italic>ca</italic> virus GSGD/AA<italic>ca</italic> was detected in the nasal turbinate of the inoculated mice at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t002">Table 2</xref>). The wild-type CK/SX/06 virus replicated in the nasal turbinate and lung, while the replication of the reassortant <italic>ca</italic> virus CKSX/AA<italic>ca</italic> was not detected in any organs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t002">Table 2</xref>). The wild-type AH/05 replicated systemically with high virus titers in all of the organs examined. The replication of AH/AA<italic>ca</italic>, by contrast, was restricted to the respiratory system. Even in lung, the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> titer was significantly lower than that for AH/05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t002">Table 2</xref>). The reassortant viruses, as well as the wild-type GS/GD/96 and CK/SX/06 viruses did not kill any mice at the highest inoculation dose, whereas the AH/05 virus killed mice at a very low dosage (MLD<sub>50</sub> = 1.5 log<sub>10</sub>EID<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Three mice were killed on day 3 postchallenge, and their organs were collected for virus titration; the remaining seven mice in each group were observed for 2 weeks.

Virus was not detected in any of the organs tested, and the mice remained healthy over the 2 weeks of observation (no weight loss). By contrast, the virus replicated systemically and was detected in all of the test organs in unvaccinated mice, with death occurring between 6 and 10 days postchallenge. In mice challenged with BHG/05, virus was detected at low titers (&lt;2 log<sub>10</sub> EID<sub>50</sub> g<sup>−1</sup>) in the nasal turbinates of animals that had received a single dose of vaccine, but was undetectable in the organs from mice that were vaccinated twice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).

<title>Humoral and cellular immune responses to the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> vaccine in rhesus macaque</title>
<p>To assess the immunogenicity of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> reassortant virus in a rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) model, we inoculated 2- to 3-year-old female animals (n = 8, Vaccinated 1–8, V1–V8) intranasally with 10<sup>7</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> virus in a 1-ml volume, twice, at a 4-week interval. A control group (n = 8, Control 1–8, C1–C8) received the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Serum was collected from each animal at 4 weeks after the first vaccination (week postvaccination dose, wpd1) and at 2 weeks after the second vaccination (wpd2). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the monkeys were isolated at different times for detection of a T-cell immune response using an H5-HA specific IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Intranasal inoculation of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> virus was not associated with any adverse events (not shown).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, each of the vaccinated macaques had a detectable antibody response by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) at 2 weeks after the first inoculation, with the titer ranging from 120–780 (median, 760), and the titers increased sharply at 4 weeks after the first inoculation, with titers ranging from 1520 to 12780 (median, 7640). HI and NT antibodies were not detectable from the animals at 2 weeks after the first inoculation (data not shown). Five of these animals developed HI antibodies to the AH/05 virus (titers, range of 10–80, median, 40), and all had NT antibodies to this virus (range of titers, 40–640, median 240) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g002">Figure 2B and 2D</xref>) at 4 weeks after the first inoculation. Antibody levels in the vaccinated animals increased significantly after the second vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Eight animals had detectable HI antibody to AH/05 (range of titers, 40–640; median, 160) at 2 weeks after the second vaccination, while NT and ELISA antibody titers reached 320–2560 and 25,118–199,526, respectively, at this interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g002">Figure 2A, 2B, and 2D</xref>). Overall, the HI and NT antibody titers against the heterologous virus BHG/05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g002">Figure 2C and 2E</xref>) were 2- to 4-fold lower than those against the AH/05 virus. T cell responses to the HA protein were not detected at 4 weeks after the first immunization. However, the HA-specific T cell responses could be detected at 2 weeks after the second immunization in all vaccinated macaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, 11 of the 13 T cell HA-specific peptides identified in samples from eight macaques represented CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t004">Table 4</xref>), suggesting this T cell subset may have played a role in the generation of antibodies against H5N1 epitopes.

<title>Protective efficacy of AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> in monkeys against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus challenge</title>
<p>Three weeks after the second vaccination, animals in each group were challenged with an intratracheal inoculation of 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of AH/05 virus (n = 4) or BHG/05 virus (n = 4) in a 3-ml volume. Three days later, two animals from each group were euthanized, and different parts of the respiratory system were collected for virus titration and histologic and immunohistochemical studies. The remaining animals were observed and euthanized on day 15 postchallenge.</p>
<p>The control animals showed disease symptoms after challenge. All eight control animals became anorexic on day 1 postchallenge, and completely lost their appetites for two days. Four were euthanized on day 3 postchallenge, while the remaining four animals gradually recovered on days 4 and 5 postchallenge. Four control animals challenged with AH/05 and three challenged with BHG/05 developed fever within the first 2 days postchallenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). By contrast, the vaccinated animals remained healthy during the 15 days of observation post-challenge with either the AH/05 or BHG/05 virus. The appetites and body temperatures of the vaccinated animals were unchanged during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>In the vaccinated animals, the HI and NT antibody titers measured at 2 weeks postchallenge were approximately the same as those recorded at 2 weeks after the second vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g002">Figure 2B–2E</xref>). HA-specific T cell responses increased on week 1 after challenge, and the peak response was detected at 2 weeks postchallenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g003">Figure 3</xref>). While in the control animals, although the titers of antibodies measured by ELISA reached 400–800, the HI and NT antibody, and the HA-specific T cell responses were not detected at 2 weeks after challenge (data not shown).</p>
<p>Lung tissue from four vaccinated macaques euthanized on day 3 postchallenge with either BHG/05 or AH/05 lacked macroscopic lesions, had only mild-to-moderate bronchopneumonia with prominent peribronchiolar lymph follicles apparent on microscopic observation, and were free of detectable viral antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g005">Figure 5A, 5B, 5E, 5F, and 5I</xref>). A spectrum of macroscopic lesions—including congestion, exudation, and consolidation—were observed in the lung lobes of two unvaccinated control animals challenged with the BHG/05 virus (C3 and C4) and one challenged with the AH/05 virus (C1). Only prominent swelling of the lymph nodes and tonsil were seen in another control animal (C2) challenged with the AH/05 virus. Moderate-to-severe bronchopneumonia with prominent viral antigen expression was a characteristic finding in the nonvaccinated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000409-g005">Figure 5C, 5D, 5G, 5H, and 5I</xref>; also <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t005">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Vaccine efficacy in nonhuman primates assessed on the basis of lung lesions.</title>
<p>Eight macaques were euthanized on day 3 postchallenge with AH/05 virus (A–D) or BHG/05 virus (E–H). Vaccinated animals (A,B,E,F) had less extensive bronchopneumonia (i.e., smaller foci of consolidation) than did unvaccinated animals (C,D,G,H). The vaccinated animals also showed prominent peribronchial lymph follicles (a, e; arrows), and their consolidated lung areas lacked viral antigen-positive cells (B,F). By contrast, the unvaccinated animals had lung lesions of moderate size with a wide consolidated area (C,G; outlined by yellow dashes), smaller and less abundant peribronchial lymph follicles (C,G; arrows), and pneumonic lesions containing many antigen-positive cells (D,H; brown pigment). (I) Schematic diagrams indicating distribution of pathologic lesions in the lungs of animals vaccinated and challenged with AH/05 (V1 and V2); nonvaccinated and challenged with AH/05 (C1 and C2); vaccinated and challenged with BHG/05 (V3 and V4); and nonvaccinated and challenged with BHG/05 (C3 and C4). In vaccinated animals, scant-to-moderate bronchopneumonia was present in each lobe, but viral antigens were not detected in the lesions (V1, V2, V3, and V4; purple). By contrast, more severe bronchopneumonia was observed in nonvaccinated macaque lungs (C1, C2, C3, and C4). Moreover, viral antigens were prominent in the pneumonic lesions in the most affected lung lobes (C1, C2, C3, and C4; red). One lung lobe was entirely affected by pneumonia after infection with the BHG/05 virus (C3). Purple, bronchopneumonia without viral antigen; red, bronchopneumonia with viral antigen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We generated a reassortant H5N1 cold-adapted virus, AH/AA<italic>ca</italic>, using reverse genetics in Vero cells, and evaluated its immunogenecity and efficacy as a live attenuated vaccine. The virus retained both the <italic>ca</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes of the AA<italic>ca</italic> virus, and was attenuated in chickens, mice and monkeys. After a single immunizing dose, the vaccine induced strong HI and NT antibody responses to H5 influenza virus in mice and protected them from homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus challenges. Most importantly, after two immunizations, the vaccine induced both humoral and T cell immune response in nonhuman primates and completely protected these animals from challenge with either homologous or heterologous H5N1 virus. Our results warrant human testing of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> virus as a candidate live attenuated pandemic vaccine for use against H5N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>The H5N1 viruses are divided into ten distinct phylogenetic clades (0–9) based on their HA genes. Those associated with human infection are all from either clade 1, representing viruses isolated mainly from patients in Thailand and Vietnam, or clade 2, in which the viruses have been further divided into different subclades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-AbdelGhafar1">[23]</xref>. The clade 2.1 viruses are circulating only in Indonesia, while the clade 2.2 and 2.3 viruses continue to infect poultry and humans in multiple countries, posing severe threats to public health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-AbdelGhafar1">[23]</xref>. The H5N1 pandemic vaccines evaluated to date are all based on clade 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Treanor1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Lin1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Suguitan1">[17]</xref> or calde 0 viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Li1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Suguitan1">[17]</xref>, and their efficacy against clade 2 viruses is quite limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Suguitan1">[17]</xref>. The AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> vaccine we described provides complete protection against challenge with viruses from both clades 2.2 and 2.3; moreover, the monkey antisera induced by AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> cross reacted well with clade 1 virus as in an HI test (data not shown).</p>
<p>The H5N1 viruses, AH/05 and BHG/05, replicate in multiple organs in mice after intranasal inoculation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000409-t002">Table 2</xref>), however, our preliminary studies indicate that these viruses could not replicate in monkeys after intranasal inoculation, but they replicate efficiently in the respiratory system and caused severe pneumonia upon intratracheal inoculation, as has been seen with human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Uiprasertkul1">[24]</xref>. This is why we challenged the monkeys with intratracheal inoculation instead of the intranasal inoculation. Despite introduction of the challenge virus into the trachea, a preferred site of replication for H5N1 viruses, the intranasal immunization of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> vaccine provided complete protection to animals, further demonstrating the efficacy of this live vaccine.</p>
<p>In a previous study, Suguitan et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Suguitan1">[17]</xref> found differences in the immunogenicity of three H5N1 live attenuated viruses. The vaccine that contains the HA and NA genes from a clade 1 virus (A/VN/1203/2004) was poorly immunogenic in mice, and was not able to prevent the replication of the challenge viruses in lungs and turbinates of mice (even two doses of the vaccine were not able to prevent the replication of the challenge virus in ferrets). That vaccine was also poorly immunogenic in humans (personal communication from Dr. Subbarao). We also generated different H5N1 live attenuated viruses with the surface genes derived from different viruses that had been isolated in China. We found that these reassortants possessed diverse replicative abilities and induced varied antibody responses in mice; only the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> vaccine proved highly immunogenic in both mice and monkeys. These results suggest that the immunogenicity of H5N1 live attenuated vaccine largely depends on the HA and NA genes, emphasizing the need for careful selection of donor viruses when preparing vaccines for a likely H5N1 influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>Although the precise responses that must be induced to protect against H5N1 infection in humans are unknown, animal studies indicate a central role for the cellular immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Gambotto1">[12]</xref>. Thus, in the face of a pandemic, a vaccine that elicits cellular immunity could be valuable in reducing the severity of disease and mortality, if not in providing complete protection from infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Subbarao3">[25]</xref>. Moreover, a vaccine that induces a cellular immune response could increase the likelihood of generating broadly cross-reactive responses that may be effective against multiple virus strains. Ruat et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Ruat1">[8]</xref> reported that inoculation of two doses of inactivated vaccine (containing 30 µg of HA) with adjuvants in monkeys could induce functional antibody and protect the animals from a homologous H5N1 virus challenge, but that vaccine did not induce any detecable cellular immune response. In the present study, the HI antibody titers induced by two doses of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> vaccine in monkeys were higher than those achieved with two doses of the inactivated vaccine in the study of Ruat et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Ruat1">[8]</xref>. Two doses of AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> vaccine also induced strong T cell responses, which may play an important role in the sterile protection of monkeys after H5N1 influenza virus challenge.</p>
<p>Whether cold-adapted, live attenuated H5N1 vaccines would be sufficiently immunogenic to merit their widespread use during a pandemic remains unclear, the use of live influenza H5N1 vaccines before a pandemic would be difficult to justify, as this strategy would introduce a new HA gene into human populations. Nonetheless, considering the efficacy shown by our vaccine in nonhuman primates, we suggest that it has strong potential as an effective H5N1 virus countermeasure, warranting further evaluation in humans.</p>

<p>The H5N1 virus AH/05 was isolated from the tracheal secretion of a patient with lethal outcome from Anhui province in China in 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Shu1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Yu1">[27]</xref>, the BHG/05 virus and the GS/GD/96 viruses were isolated from a bar-headed goose and a goose, respectively, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Chen1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Chen2">[28]</xref>, and the CK/SX/06 virus was isolated from a chicken in northern China in 2006. Virus stocks were propagated in specific-pathogen free chicken embryos or MDCK cells. The PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS genes of the AA<italic>ca</italic> virus were synthesized (Jinsite Biotechnology, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jinsite.com.cn" xlink:type="simple">www.jinsite.com.cn</ext-link>) and inserted into the viral RNA-mRNA bidirectional expression plasmid pBD as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Li2">[29]</xref>.

<title>Detection of antibodies</title>
<p>Serum antibody against H5N1 influenza virus was detected by IgG ELISA essentially as described by DiNapoli et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-DiNapoli1">[31]</xref> using 400 ng of AH/AAca virus, which was grown in eggs and purified by ultracentrifugation though a 30% sucrose cushion, to coat the 96-well Immulon 1B plates (Dynex Technologies, Inc., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dynextechnologies.com" xlink:type="simple">www.dynextechnologies.com</ext-link>). The pretest ELISA values (range 20–80) are the background; which have been subtracted from the experimental values of the monkeys. Sera were treated with Vibrio cholerae (Denka-Seiken, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.denka-seiken.co.jp" xlink:type="simple">www.denka-seiken.co.jp</ext-link>) receptor-destroying enzyme before being tested for the presence of HI antibody with 0.5% (V/V) chicken erythrocytes. The antigens used were homologous wild-type H5N1 virus or BHG/05 virus. The NT antibody titers were tested in MDCK cells with heat-inactivated sera collected from mice or animals. HI and NT antibody titers were transformed into log<sub>10</sub> titers for the calculation of mean±s.d. values.</p>

<title>IFN-γ ELISPOT assay</title>
<p>The frequencies of PBMC-derived T lymphocytes that released IFN-γ upon restimulation with H5 HA-derived peptide pools were determined by an ELISPOT assay, using a Mabtech kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, thawed PBMC samples, isolated by Lymphoprep density gradient centrifugation (Axis-Shield, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.axis-shield.com" xlink:type="simple">www.axis-shield.com</ext-link>), were incubated without peptides at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 h. After washing, they were incubated for 20 h at a concentration of 20 µg/ml with peptides (18-mer overlapped by 10 amino acids; Sigma, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com" xlink:type="simple">www.sigmaaldrich.com</ext-link>) generated from a human H5N1 isolate (A/Anhui/01/05). PHA mitogen was used as a positive control. Cells (200,000 per well) were added to each well of the ELISPOT plates (Millipore, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.millipore.com" xlink:type="simple">www.millipore.com</ext-link>), which had been coated with antiprimate IFN-γ antibody (Mabtech clone G2.4), and incubated at 4°C overnight. The wells were next washed six times with PBS to remove cells and were then treated with a biotinylated antiprimate IFN-γ monoclonal antibody (Mabtech clone 7-B6-1) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. After another three washes with PBS, an avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed, incubated with BCIP substrate (BioRad, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bio-rad.com" xlink:type="simple">www.bio-rad.com</ext-link>) for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed with distilled water to halt spot development, dried and read with an automated ELISPOT reader (AID, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elispot.com" xlink:type="simple">www.elispot.com</ext-link>). The number of spot-forming cells (SFCs) from each well was determined for each animal after subtraction of counts from cells cultured without peptide. A response was considered positive if SFCs exceeded 20 per 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs. The average response for negative peptides and mock controls was 3 SFC/million PBMC. The H5 HA response of each animal was taken the sum of the IFN-γ positive responses from all HA pools after subtraction of background counts.</p>
<p>To confirm the presence of peptide induced IFN- <italic>γ</italic> responses and their relationship to CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes, we tested individual peptides from the first ELISPOT using a two-dimensional matrix system in a second ELISPOT assay, using thawed PBMC samples depleted of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Cell depletion was carried out with nonhuman primate CD8+-specific microbeads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.miltenyibiotec.com" xlink:type="simple">www.miltenyibiotec.com</ext-link>). CD8+ lymphocytes in the PBMC samples were removed by labeling the cells with specific microbeads in buffer containing PBS pH7.2, 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA and then applying a magnetic field. Undepleted PBMCs were used as positive controls.</p>

<title>Mouse study</title>
<p>Six-week-old female specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice were used in this study. The wild-type and reassortant viruses were both tested for their replicative capacity, and the dose required to kill 50% of the mice (MLD<sub>50</sub>) was determined as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000409-Chen1">[1]</xref>. For the immunogenicity study, groups of 5 mice were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> before they were inoculated intranasally once or twice (4 weeks apart) with 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of the GSGD/AA<italic>ca</italic>, CKSX/AA<italic>ca</italic> or AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> virus. Sera were collected at 4 weeks after the first vaccination or second vaccination for the HI and NT antibody detection using the homologous wild-type H5N1 virus as antigen. For the vaccine study, 80 6-week-old female specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> before they were inoculated intranasally once or twice (4 weeks apart) with 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> in a 50 µl volume or with PBS as control. Serum samples were collected from six mice in each group at 4 weeks after the first and second immunizations and were examined for HI and NT antibody using the homologous AH/05 virus and heterologous BHG/05 virus as antigens. Four weeks after vaccination, the mice were challenged with 100 MLD<sub>50</sub> of the AH/05 (10<sup>3.5</sup>EID<sub>50</sub>) or BHG/05 (10<sup>3.6</sup>EID<sub>50</sub>) virus intranasally; three mice from each group were killed on day 3 postchallenge, and their organs collected for virus titration.

<title>Macaque study</title>
<p>Sixteen female rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) 2 or 3 years of age were divided into two groups of eight animals each; one group (V1–V8) was inoculated intranasally twice (4 weeks apart) with 10<sup>7</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of the AH/AA<italic>ca</italic> virus in a 1-ml volume, while the other (C1–C8) received the same volume of PBS as a control. Serum samples were collected from each animal at 2 and 4 weeks after the first immunization and 2 weeks after the second immunization. Three weeks after the second immunization, the animals in each group were challenged by intratracheal inoculation of 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of AH/05 virus (n = 4) or BHG/05 (n = 4) virus in a 3 ml volume. Three days later, two animals from each subgroup were euthanized, and different parts of their respiratory system were collected for virus titration and histologic and immunohistochemical examinations; the remaining animals were observed and euthanized on day 15 postchallenge. Nasal swabs were collected from all of the animals on days 2, 4 and 6 postchallenge for virus isolation in eggs.</p>
