<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is widely believed that one of the main triggers of host inflammation is the recognition of microbial products by receptors of the innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Karin1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Barton1">[3]</xref>. Conserved microbial products, collectively known as “pathogen-associated molecular patterns” (PAMPS), stimulate specific host receptors triggering a variety of generic responses directed at controlling pathogen spread. In the case of bacterial pathogens, conserved bacterial products such as lipopolysacharide, flagella, or peptidoglycan, are recognized by transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or intracellular nucleotide oligomerizaton domain-like receptors (NLRs), leading to conserved signaling cascades that culminate in the activation of NF-<italic>κ</italic>B, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Medzhitov1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Creagh1">[7]</xref>. These receptors are widely expressed in cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which consequently are well equipped to respond to virtually any invading pathogen.</p>
<p>Intestinal epithelial cells, however, are a special case in that they are exposed to massive amounts of bacterial products with the potential to activate innate immune receptors. Therefore, signaling through these receptors, in particular surface TLRs, must be prevented to avoid uncontrolled inflammation, which would be detrimental to the host. The mechanisms by which this negative regulation of innate immune receptor activation is exerted are poorly understood. It is believed that a combination of topological sequestration of the receptors and the activity of specific negative regulators that control the output through TLRs, are responsible for the control of intestinal cell homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Creagh1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Lang1">[12]</xref>. Misregulation of these negative regulatory control mechanisms leads to intestinal inflammatory pathology.</p>
<p>Certain enteropathogens are able to stimulate intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Petri1">[13]</xref>. For example, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium), a major cause of food-borne illness, causes intestinal inflammation leading to diarrhea, which is essential for its replication and spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Grassl1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Ohl1">[15]</xref>. The mechanisms by which these or other intestinal pathogens bypass the negative regulatory controls in the intestinal epithelium to induce inflammatory responses are poorly understood. Although limited gene expression studies have shown that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium reprograms gene expression in cultured cells leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hobbie1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Eckmann3">[18]</xref>, it is unclear to what extent these responses overlap with responses stimulated through the activation of innate immune receptors. The ability of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to stimulate intestinal responses requires the activity of a type III protein secretion system (TTSS) encoded within its pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hobbie1">[16]</xref>. However, it is unclear whether this system stimulates inflammatory responses directly, or whether it works in conjunction with surface innate immune receptors that may recognize components of this machine, or cytoplasmic receptors that may recognize conserved bacterial products, since this TTSS is also required for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to enter epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Galn1">[19]</xref>. Here we report that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium can stimulate innate immune responses in cultured epithelial cells through the activity of bacterial effector proteins delivered by its TTSS and in a manner that is independent of innate immune receptors. This mechanism has implications for the ability of <italic>S.</italic> typhimurium to induce intestinal inflammation.</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium induces innate immune responses in cultured epithelial cells</title>
<p>In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium stimulates intestinal innate immune responses and inflammation, we first determined the global transcriptional response of cultured human Henle-407 epithelial cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium using DNA microarray analysis. Consistent with previous more limited studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Eckmann3">[18]</xref>, infection of epithelial cells with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium led to a very significant transcriptional reprogramming in comparison to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s007">S2</xref>). We identified 66 genes whose expression changed at least 4-fold in cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium relative to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and 290 genes whose expression changed at least 2-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Table S1</xref>). The majority (235 of 290) of these genes showed increased expression in response to infection and, in some cases, up to several hundred fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Table S1</xref>). We validated the changes of gene expression observed by the microarray analysis by performing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) determination of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) or in some cases western blot analysis of protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) of selected genes or gene products, respectively. The transcriptional program stimulated by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection included several genes whose products are pro-inflammatory such as several chemokines and cytokines and their receptors [e. g. CXCL2 (Mip2a), CXCL3 (Mip2b), IL-8, IL1a, IL11, IL1R1, COX-2, TNFRSF10D, IL4R, TNFRSF12A]. <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium also induced the stimulation of expression of a number of transcription factors (e. g. FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, JUN, JUNB, EGR1, EGR3, ATF3, STAT3) that amplify the immune response and that most likely are constituents of a positive feed-back loop resulting in the stimulation of expression of themselves and other pro-inflammatory genes. In addition, bacterial infection stimulated the expression of several genes whose products limit the immune response, which most likely constitute a negative feed-back loop to preserve homeostasis and limit damage as a consequence of the inflammatory response. These included the mRNA stability regulator tristetraprolin (ZFP36), the suppressors of cytokine signaling SOCS2 and SOCS3, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NQO2), the NF-κB inhibitor IκB zeta, and several members of the DUSP family of tyrosine phosphatases (DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP4, DUSP5, DUSP6, DUSP8).</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium-induced transcriptional response.</title>
<p>Cultured human epithelial cells were infected with different strains of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (as indicated) and the levels of expression of selected genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR after reverse transcription of RNA samples extracted from cells infected with the indicated <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium strains. The transcript levels were normalized to the levels of GAPDH in each sample, which were found to remain constant under any of the conditions used in the microarray experiments. Values are expressed as percentage of the fold change observed in cells infected with wild type (considered 100%) and represent the mean±s. e. m. of at least three independent experiments. Fold change for the different reporter genes after infection with wild type was as follows: SCCA1: 749; IL-8: 105; MIP2: 100; TTP: 52; EGR1: 89; IGFBP1: 11; LMO7: 54; GEM: 38; JUN: 42. The differences between the values of cells infected with wild type vs those infected with <italic>ΔinvA</italic>, <italic>ΔsopE/ΔSopE2/ΔsopB</italic>, or effectorless were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>≥0.002, Student <italic>t</italic> test).</p>

<p>The transcriptional response to wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium exhibited striking similarities with reported transcription profiles of cells stimulated by agonists of receptors of the innate immune system such as TLRs, or the core response to other microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Jenner1">[20]</xref>. A gene ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in the innate immune response were significantly over-represented among those induced 2-fold or more by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection (p&lt;0.05). In fact, 54 of the 290 differentially-expressed genes belong to the cluster of genes that have been defined as the ‘common host response’ to pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), a group of genes that are induced in many different cell types in response to exposure to several different microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Jenner1">[20]</xref>. The proportion is much higher if genes induced by other bacterial pathogens are considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s008">Table S3</xref>). These results indicate that this pathogen has the capacity to stimulate a pro-inflammatory response in cultured epithelial cells that exhibits a great deal of commonality with the innate immune responses triggered by agonists of innate immune receptors or by other pathogens.</p>

<title><italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium stimulation of innate immune responses in epithelial cells requires the TTSS effector proteins SopE, SopE2, and SopB</title>
<p>To determine the extent to which the transcriptional changes induced by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium depend on the components and activities of its SPI-1 TTSS, we examined the transcriptional response of cultured Henle-407 epithelial cells infected with an isogenic <italic>ΔinvA</italic> mutant strain. InvA is an essential component of the SPI-1 TTSS and therefore the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>ΔinvA</italic> mutant is defective in all phenotypes dependent on this system, which include bacterial internalization into non-phagocytic cells and the induction of programmed cell death in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Galn2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Galan1">[22]</xref>. The transcriptional profile of cultured epithelial cells infected with this mutant strain closely resembled that of uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s007">S2</xref>), demonstrating that the transcriptional reprogramming stimulated by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium requires a functional SPI-1 TTSS. The levels of lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, and other potential agonists of innate immune receptors are not affected by the <italic>invA</italic> mutation and are therefore identical to those of wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Galn2">[21]</xref>. Hence, these results also indicate that the responses observed in cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium cannot be the result of the stimulation of surface Toll-like receptors by these bacterial PAMPS.</p>
<p>The requirement of a functional SPI-1 TTSS for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to trigger transcriptional reprogramming in cultured epithelial cells suggested the possibility that one or more effector proteins delivered by this system are responsible for the stimulation of those responses. Alternatively, such responses could be the result of other activities dependent on a functional TTSS. For example, the outermost component or “needle substructure” of the TTSS needle complex organelle is absent from the <italic>ΔinvA</italic> mutant strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Kubori1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Sukhan1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the needle substructure itself may be directly recognized by innate immune receptors in epithelial cells thus stimulating transcriptional responses. In addition, delivery of proteins by the TTSSs requires the deployment of a group of TTSS secreted protein translocases, which mediate the passage of effector proteins through the host cell plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Tardy1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Collazo1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that potential membrane perturbations caused by the deployment of the TTSS protein translocases, which does not occur in cells infected with the <italic>ΔinvA</italic> mutant, could be sensed by the cell triggering innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Tardy1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Collazo1">[26]</xref>. Finally, stimulation of innate immune responses may be the result of the TTSS-mediate delivery of some agonist of intracellular immune receptors (e. g. flagellin).</p>
<p>To distinguish among these possibilities we examined the transcriptional responses of human epithelial cells infected with a <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium strain lacking the protein effectors delivered by the SPI-1 TTSS (from here forth referred as “effectorless”). This strain displays a wild-type TTSS organelle, including the needle component, is fully capable of deploying the translocases SipB, SipC and SipD, and it is therefore competent for TTSS-mediated protein translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hernandez1">[27]</xref>. Cells infected with the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium effectorless strain showed a transcriptional profile similar to that of uninfected cells or cells infected with the TTSS-defective <italic>invA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Table S1</xref>). These results ruled out the hypothesis that the innate immune responses stimulated by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> typhimurium are the result of the recognition of the needle component of the TTSS by innate immune receptors. In addition, these results excluded the hypothesis that the <italic>S.</italic> typhimurium-induced responses are the result of membrane perturbations induced by the deployment of the translocases, or the delivery of intracellular receptor agonists such as flagellin since all these activities or agonists are present in this mutant strain. Rather, these results unambiguously indicate that one or more effector proteins delivered by this TTSS must be responsible for the induction of the transcriptional reprogramming.</p>
<p>The guanidyl nucleotide exchange factors SopE and SopE2 and the phosphoinositide phosphatase SopB are good candidates to mediate these responses since, in a functionally redundant manner, they activate Rho-family GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Zhou1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Friebel1">[30]</xref>, which can lead to MAPK and NF-κB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Chen1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Vojtek1">[33]</xref>. Cells infected with a <italic>ΔsopE ΔsopE2 ΔsopB</italic> triple mutant strain showed a transcriptional profile largely similar to that of uninfected cells or cells infected with a strain lacking a functional SPI-1 TTSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s007">S2</xref>). Although strains carrying individual mutations in each one of these effectors retained their ability to activate MAPKs and NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), the Δ<italic>sopE ΔsopE2</italic> Δ<italic>sopB S.</italic> Typhimurium triple mutant strain did not activate these signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of these signaling pathways by the bacterially-encoded Rho-family GTPase activators SopE, SopE2, and SopB is central to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium's ability to stimulate innate immune responses.</p>

<p>In addition to its ability to activate Rho-family GTPases, SopB mediates activation of AKT by poorly understood mechanisms that require its phosphoinositide phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-SteeleMortimer1">[34]</xref>. However, we found that the transcriptome of cells infected with this strain was largely equivalent to that of cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s007">S2</xref>) arguing against a prominent role for AKT in the stimulation of the transcriptional responses.

<p>The SPI-1-TTSS <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium mutant strains (i. e. <italic>ΔinvA, ΔsopE/ΔsopE2/ΔsopB</italic>, or “effectorless”), which were unable to stimulate transcriptional responses, posses “wild type” agonists of the innate immune system (i. e. LPS, flagellin, etc.) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Consequently, these observations suggest that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium can trigger innate immune responses in a manner that does not require innate immune receptors such as TLRs. However, since the SPI-1 TTSS, and in particular the effector proteins SopE, SopE2, and SopB, are also required for bacterial internalization, the <italic>ΔsopE/ΔsopE2/ΔsopB</italic> or the “effectorless” mutant strains are unable to enter into host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Zhou1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hardt1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, it is formally possible that the gene expression changes observed in cells infected with wild type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium are stimulated by intracellular bacteria through the intracellular cytoplasmic NLRs such as Nod1 or Nod2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Inohara1">[5]</xref>, which can sense conserved bacterial products to stimulate innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Fritz1">[35]</xref>. To test this hypothesis we depleted cells of Rip2, a kinase essential for Nod1 and Nod2 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Kobayashi1">[36]</xref>. Depletion of Rip2 by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), which had no effect on the ability of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to enter epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000538.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), did not prevent the transcriptional responses stimulated by <italic>S.</italic> typhimurium infection (in fact, the expression of some the reporter genes examined was actually higher in the Rip2-depleted cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that the Nod1 or Nod2 receptors are not required for the stimulation of the SPI-1 TTSS-dependent transcriptional responses.</p>

<p>A Depletion of Rip2 by RNAi. Cells transfected with siRNAs directed to Rip2 or with an irrelevant control siRNA were infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium and the levels of Rip2 in infected and uninfected cells were measured by qRT-PCR. The transcript levels were normalized to the levels of GAPDH. Values are expressed as percentage of the levels of Rip2 transcript in cells that had been treated with a control siRNA, which was considered 100%, and represent the mean±s. e. m. of at least three independent determinations. B Rip2 is not required for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium stimulation of gene expression in epithelial cells. Cells in which Rip2 had been depleted by RNAi were infected with the indicated strains of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium and the levels of expression of selected genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR after reverse transcription of RNA samples extracted from infected cells. The transcript levels were normalized to the levels of GAPDH. Values are expressed as percentage of the fold change observed in cells that had been treated with a control siRNA and infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, which was considered 100%, and represent the mean±s. e. m. of at least three independent experiments. C <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium internalized into epithelial cells through a heterologous internalization pathway does not stimulate the transcriptional responses induced by wild type. Cells were infected with a wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, an isogenic <italic>ΔinvA</italic> mutant, or the same mutant expressing <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> invasin protein (p-invasin). The levels of expression of selected genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR after reverse transcription of RNA samples extracted from infected cells. The transcript levels were normalized to the levels of GAPDH. Values are expressed as percentage of the fold change observed in cells that had been infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, which was considered 100%, and represent the mean±s. e. m. of at least three independent experiments. The differences between the values of cells infected with wild type vs those of uninfected cells or cells infected with the <italic>ΔinvA</italic>, or <italic>ΔinvA</italic> (p-invasin) strains were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>≥0.001, student <italic>t</italic> test), except for the values corresponding to COX2 and IL-8 in cells infected with the <italic>ΔinvA</italic> (p-invasin) strain. D Levels of intracellular <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium after internalization through the invasin-mediated pathway. Epithelial cells were infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium or the type III secretion-defective <italic>invA</italic> mutant expressing the <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> invasin protein and the levels of intracellular bacteria were measured by the gentamicin protection assay as indicated in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.

<p>To further address the potential contribution of cytoplasmic sensors to the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SPI-1 TTSS-mediated stimulation of transcriptional responses in epithelial cells we used an alternative approach. We reasoned that if cytoplasmic sensors were responsible for the stimulation of cellular responses by intracellular <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, internalization of a SPI-1 TTSS-defective mutant strain by an alternative entry pathway should lead to the stimulation of the same transcriptional responses observed in cells infected with wild type <italic>S.</italic> typhimurium. We therefore expressed in the SPI-1 TTSS-defective Δ<italic>invA</italic> mutant strain the <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> invasin protein, which mediates bacterial uptake by interacting with α4-β1 integrin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Isberg1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Isberg2">[38]</xref>. Infection of epithelial cells with the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>ΔinvA</italic> (p-invasin) strain did not stimulate the expression of 7 out of 9 reporter genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) despite the presence of similar levels of intracellular bacteria to that of cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). The reduced but significant increase in the expression of IL-8 and COX2 is most likely due the effect of the stimulation of α4-β1 integrins by invasin, since these genes have been reported to be induced by the invasin protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Bohn1">[39]</xref>. These results indicate that the intracellular location of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium is not sufficient to stimulate the transcriptional responses observed after infection with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. Furthermore, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that specific signaling pathways triggered by the activity of the SPI-1 TTSS effectors SopE, SopE2, and SopB are responsible for the stimulation of the transcriptional reprogramming in epithelial cells.</p>

<p>SopE, SopE2, and SopB stimulate Rho-family GTPase signaling by different mechanisms.

Therefore, the lack of involvement of Cdc42 in the entry and intracellular fate of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium allowed us to specifically test its potential role in the transcriptional reprogramming induced by wild-type bacteria, independent from any secondary effect due to actin remodeling or the intracellular location of the internalized bacteria. We found that depletion of Cdc42 significantly prevented the stimulation of expression of the reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These results indicate that this Rho-family GTPase plays a critical role in the SPI-1 TTSS-dependent transcriptional reprogramming induced by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in epithelial cells. The observation that Cdc42 depletion did not completely block the stimulation of gene expression by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium suggests that signaling through the other Rho-family GTPases such as Rac1 and RhoG may also contribute to the stimulation of nuclear responses. Alternatively, incomplete depletion of Cdc42 could also account for this result since the transfection efficiency of the cell line used in this study is less than 100%.</p>

<p>We further explored the ability of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> encoded Rho-family GTPase activators to stimulate inflammatory responses by transiently expressing SopE in epithelial cells and examining its effect on IL-8 expression using a transcriptional reporter construct. Transient expression of SopE resulted in a significant increase in IL-8 transcription, and this effect was effectively prevented by the expression of dominant negative Cdc42 (Cdc42<sup>N17</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000538-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intestinal pathogens such as <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium must induce intestinal inflammation to secure the acquisition of scarce nutrients as well as their spread to other hosts through the induction of diarrhea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Stecher1">[49]</xref>. An intact intestinal epithelium does not respond to the multitude of potential agonists of the innate immune system. Such responsiveness would be detrimental in the context of the presence of the abundant intestinal microbial flora containing a plethora of innate immune receptor agonists. Although the mechanisms for this unresponsiveness are not fully understood, it is thought that these mechanisms involve exclusion of innate immune receptors from the epithelial cells' apical side, and the expression of specific negative regulators of innate immune receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Creagh1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Lang1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, to induce inflammation, enteropathogens must be able to circumvent these negative regulatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Petri1">[13]</xref>. We have shown here that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium has evolved a unique mechanism to stimulate innate immune responses in epithelial cells in a manner that is independent of the canonical innate immune receptors and conserved bacterial products or PAMPs. Rather, we have shown that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium uses a specific set of effector proteins, SopB, SopE2, and SopE, which are delivered into cells via its SPI-1 TTSS, to activate these responses. We have demonstrated that these responses are not the consequence of bacterial internalization and its subsequent detection by cytoplasmic sensors. Instead, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium stimulation of innate immune responses in epithelial cells are the result of the effector-mediated stimulation of Rho-family GTPases leading to the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Nevertheless, these responses very closely mimic those induced by the stimulation of innate immune receptors such as TLRs or NLRs. It has been previously reported that TLR2 signaling requires Rac-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Arbibe1">[50]</xref>, presumably at steps downstream from the receptor proximal components of the signaling cascade. Therefore, by targeting similar downstream components of the signaling cascade of innate immune receptors, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium effectors can trigger similar outputs as those triggered by the stimulation of those receptors. This mechanism may allow <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to bypass the negative regulatory mechanisms that prevent signaling through innate immune receptors in intestinal epithelial cells and thus initiate the inflammatory response at this site.</p>
<p><italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium can induce intestinal inflammation in mice deficient in various innate immune pathways such as <italic>myd88−/−</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hapfelmeier1">[41]</xref>, caspase 1−/− <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-LaraTejero1">[43]</xref>, or as we have shown here, myd88/TLR4−/− and rip2−/− deficient mice. These observations indicate that our observations with cultured epithelial cells are likely to be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>. Innate immune receptors, however, do play a major role in controlling <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection and spread to systemic tissues, since mice with deficiencies in innate immune pathways are more susceptible to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection. Innate immune receptor pathways may also contribute to the amplification of the inflammatory response in the gut once initiated by <italic>S.</italic> Typimurium through the specific adaptations described here. However, our results as well as previous <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hapfelmeier2">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Jones1">[48]</xref> show that with an intact epithelium, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium needs its SPI-TTSS to initiate an intestinal inflammatory response presumably via the mechanism reported here.</p>
<p>It is well established that many pathogens have evolved specific adaptations to counteract their hosts' innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Finlay1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Loo1">[52]</xref>. However, we have shown here that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium has evolved specific mechanisms to stimulate innate immune responses, a remarkable adaptation presumably evolved to bypass mechanisms that are in place in intestinal cells to prevent inflammation. Although the mechanisms that prevent intestinal epithelial cells from responding to innate immune receptor agonists are poorly understood, it is well established that misregulation of such mechanisms can lead to chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Creagh1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Shibolet1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Marks1">[53]</xref>.

<p>The acquisition of LAMP1 by the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole and its co-localization with the endocytic tracer Alexa-Fluor-488-labeled dextran were assayed in Cdc42-depleted and control cells by flurorescence microscopy as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Watson1">[57]</xref>. Briefly, Cdc42-depleted and control cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated in the presence of 250 µg/ml dextran-Alexa-Fluor-488 MW 10,000 (Molecular Probes), which was chased into lysosomes as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Drecktrah1">[58]</xref>. Three hours before infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently incubated in cultured medium. Cells were infected for 1 h with a multiplicity of infection of 10 with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium expressing dsRed under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Patel2">[59]</xref>, which had been grown in the presence of 0.1% arabinose. After additional 3 h in medium containing 100 µg/ml Gentamicin, cells were fixed with 3% PFA and subsequently stained with mouse-anti-LAMP1 (clone H4A3) and goat-anti-mouse-Alexa-Fluor-488 (Molecular Probes). For quantification, the localization of bacteria relative to LAMP1 or dextran was determined in CFP positive cells (to identify transfected cells) using fluorescence microscopy.</p>

<title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from infected Henle-407 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The final pellet was resuspended in RNAse-free water and further purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), digested with DNAse I (Invitrogen) and used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the iScript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was subject to qRT-PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad).

<title>IL-8 transcription reporter assay</title>
<p>Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding SopE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hardt1">[32]</xref> along with the reporter plasmid PSB2805, which encodes a fusion between the IL-8 promoter and firefly luciferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Patel1">[29]</xref>. To standardize transfection experiments, cells were also transfected with a plasmid pSB2806, which is a derivative of pCDN3.1 encoding Renilla luciferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Patel1">[29]</xref>. Two days after transfection (including overnight serum starvation), cells were lysed and the levels of firefly and Renilla luciferase were determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was normalized by the comparison of IL-8–induced firefly luciferase levels with that of constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase. Induction of the IL-8 reporter by SopE was expressed relative to that of a vector control.</p>
