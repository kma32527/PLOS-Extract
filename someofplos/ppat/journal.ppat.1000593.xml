<p>Identification of novel cellular proteins as substrates to viral proteases would provide a new insight into the mechanism of cell–virus interplay. Eight nuclear proteins as potential targets for enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>) cleavages were identified by 2D electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF analysis. Of these proteins, CstF-64, which is a critical factor for 3′ pre-mRNA processing in a cell nucleus, was selected for further study. A time-course study to monitor the expression levels of CstF-64 in EV71-infected cells also revealed that the reduction of CstF-64 during virus infection was correlated with the production of viral 3C<sup>pro</sup>. CstF-64 was cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by 3C<sup>pro</sup> but neither by mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup> (in which the catalytic site was inactivated) nor by another EV71 protease 2A<sup>pro</sup>. Serial mutagenesis was performed in CstF-64, revealing that the 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites are located at position 251 in the N-terminal P/G-rich domain and at multiple positions close to the C-terminus of CstF-64 (around position 500). An accumulation of unprocessed pre-mRNA and the depression of mature mRNA were observed in EV71-infected cells. An <italic>in vitro</italic> assay revealed the inhibition of the 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation in 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract, and this impairment was rescued by adding purified recombinant CstF-64 protein. In summing up the above results, we suggest that 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage inactivates CstF-64 and impairs the host cell polyadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as in virus-infected cells. This finding is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that a picornavirus protein affects the polyadenylation of host mRNA.</p>

<p>Many viruses contain specific proteases that are essential for processing their own viral proteins. For an efficient replication within their hosts, on the other hand, viruses also utilize these proteases to cleave a number of key host proteins and hijack cellular machineries. In this study, host proteins are identified as the substrates for enterovirus 71 viral protease by adopting a proteomic strategy. Enterovirus 71 infection is highly associated with neurological complication and mortality in an era when poliovirus has been controlled by vaccination. Investigating the host substrates for enterovirus 71 protease may shed light on the viral–host interaction, ultimately providing further insight into the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. We found that 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>) cleaved CstF-64, the latter a cleavage stimulation factor in host polyadenylation machinery. 3C<sup>pro</sup> is known to enter host nucleus, whereas the replication of the virus occurs in cytoplasm. While its role in nucleus has been thought to inhibit host transcription, we found that 3C<sup>pro</sup> may inhibit host-cell gene expression at host 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation steps. Consequently, less polyadenylated host mRNA is synthesized and more cellular resources, such as the translation factors, would be available for viral RNA expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) belongs to the family of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, to which poliovirus also belongs. EV71 infection usually causes childhood herpagina or exanthema, which is also called hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Acute EV71 infection may also cause a severe polio-like neurological disease and significant mortality. EV71-related neurological complications include aseptic meningitis, brainstem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), myocarditis, and rapid fatal pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, which have been observed during outbreaks in Taiwan, mainland China, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, western Australia, the United States, and Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Ho1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-AbuBakar2">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Numerous host machineries are affected by picornaviral infection, including host cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Etchison1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Rose1">[12]</xref> and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark2">[14]</xref>. Viral proteases are responsible for inhibitory effects. Picornaviruses typically encode two viral proteases, 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup>, which are important for viral polypeptide processing. The major catalytic sites of type I poliovirus and EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> are His40, Glu71, and Cys147 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Hammerle1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Li1">[20]</xref>. In general, enterovirus 3C proteinases cleave at Gln/Gly scissile pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Kitamura1">[21]</xref>. Picornaviral 3C<sup>pro</sup> can enter nuclei through its precursor 3CD′ or 3CD, which contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Amineva1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Sharma1">[23]</xref>, and can cleave some cellular transcriptional factors or regulators, such as TATA-box binding protein, p53, Histone H3 and transcription factor IIIC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Yalamanchili1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Weidman1">[27]</xref>, offering insight into the effects of these factors or regulators on the transcriptional machinery of the host. Therefore, the identification of other cellular proteins that are cleaved by EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> in nuclei is of interest, as it may help us to understand unknown viral-host interactions during EV71 infection. In this work, a novel nuclear factor, CstF-64, that is cleaved by EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup>, is identified.</p>
<p>Poly(A) tails are important for both cellular mRNA and picornaviral mRNA. The poly(A) tail in eukaryotic cells is suggested to confer mRNA stability, promote the translational efficiency of mRNA, and the transport mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Ford1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Wickens1">[31]</xref>. The poly(A) tail of poliovirus is critical to viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Silvestri1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Kusov1">[33]</xref>. However, poly(A) for picornaviruses is obtained differently from that for host cells. The poly(A) tail of picornaviruses is encoded by the genome, copied into a 5′ poly(U) tract in the negative sense form, then back into a poly(A) tail during the virus RNA replication cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-DorschHasler1">[34]</xref>. Polyadenylation of most eukaryotes involves a series of steps. Prior to poly(A) synthesis, a polyadenylation signal located at the 3′ end of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) must be recognized by multiple factors such as cleavage factors I and II (CF I and II), cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complex, which causes endonucleolytical cleavage at the site of polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Zhao1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Colgan1">[36]</xref>. One of these factors, cleavage stimulation factor, 3′ pre-RNA, subunit 2, 64 kDa (CstF-64) is responsible for recognizing the second polyadenylation sequence element, a G/U-rich motif which is down-stream of the polyadenylation sites on pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-MacDonald1">[37]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> blockage of CstF-64 impairs the 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Takagaki1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Zhu1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>This work identified eight cellular nuclear proteins as potential targets for EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF analysis. CstF-64, the target selected from these eight proteins, is further examined. CstF-64 in the nuclear extract was verified by western blot to be degraded upon EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> treatment. The reduction and cleavage pattern of CstF-64 in EV71-infected cells were studied. The EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites in CstF-64 were also mapped by performing an <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay. The 3′-end pre-mRNA processing in host cells was monitored during EV71 infection. An <italic>in vitro</italic> assay was also conducted to test the effect of 3C<sup>pro</sup> on the cellular 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation. The findings herein are the first to demonstrate that a picornaviral protease interferes with host gene expression at the machinery of polyadenylation.</p>

<title>Identification of CstF-64 as Potential EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> Substrate in Nuclear Extract</title>
<p>Picornavirus 3C<sup>pro</sup> proteins can enter the nuclei of host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Amineva1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Sharma1">[23]</xref>. To identify potential substrates of EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> in nuclei, <italic>in vitro</italic> 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage assay was conducted and the proteomic technique was utilized to identify the cellular targets. First, the catalytic activities of purified recombinant EV71 wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> or mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>(C147S) were verified using a [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled peptide substrate, which contains a 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site, as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Shih1">[19]</xref>. The result shows that the wild-type, but not the C147S mutant of 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaves the viral substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The recombinant EV71 wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> or mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup> were then added to nuclear extracts from SF268 cells. Following incubation for 4 hours at 37°C, the reactions were subjected to 2D electrophoresis. The experiments were performed six times and the results were analyzed using PDquest 7.0 (Bio-rad). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> presents one of these six 2D electrophoresis experiments. Proteins that appeared in the mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated reactants but in at least half of the amounts of the wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated reactants, based on silver staining, were regarded as potential targets. From the six pairs of gels in these 2D gel experiments, eight proteins that yielded similar results at least three times were selected. These proteins were then identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the results were summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000593-t001">Table 1</xref>. In contrast with that of mutant 3C-treated nuclear extract, CstF-64 of the wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract was decreased to nearly undetectable levels in five individual 2D electrophoresis gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g001">Figs. 1B and 1C</xref> indicate the locations of CstF-64 on 2D gels. These results suggest that CstF-64 is a potential substrate for EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup>.</p>

<title>Reduction of CstF-64 in Nuclear Extracts by Addition of 3C<sup>pro</sup> <italic>In Vitro</italic></title>
<p>The reduction of CstF-64 by proteomic assay was confirmed by using an anti-CstF-64 antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Wallace1">[40]</xref> to detect the level of CstF-64 in nuclear extracts from SF268 cells, which were incubated with wild-type or mutant recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup>. The amount of CstF-64 in SF268 nuclear extract dramatically declined following incubation with wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lane 3), and the intact form of CstF-64 was clearly detected in mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract (lane 2). One potential cleavage product of 55 kDa was also detected using CstF-64 antibody in wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-incubated nuclear extract (lanes 3, 6 and 9, indicated by *). CstF-64 levels in nuclear extracts from other cell lines, RD and HeLa cells, also declined upon incubation with wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> and the cleavage pattern is similar to that in SF268 nuclear extracts. (Compare lanes 6 and 9 with results for mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extracts in lanes 5 and 8). The wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-induced CstF-64 reduction in nuclear extract depends on dose of recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lanes 3–7). The intensities between the full-length CstF-64 and its 55 kDa cleavage product were not the same as expected. This discrepancy is attributed to that later in the experiments, the cleavage sites were mapped to position 251 and multiple positions close to the C-terminus (around position 500) of CstF-64. The cleavage of CstF-64 at positions around 500 produce a product of 55 kDa, which contains another 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site at its Gln251. When position 251 was mutated (Gln to Ala), the mutant CstF-64 was cleaved into a 55 kDa product with the same intensity as that of full-length CsfF-64. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> shows a band faster than 24 KDa (lane 2, 5 and 8), which we speculate is a cleavage product from a degraded form of CstF-64. The degraded form of CstF-64 might contain the cleavage sites for 3C<sup>pro</sup> as well as the CstF-64 antibody recognition sites. Therefore, western blot analysis detected the cleaved product from the degraded form only in mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>, but not in wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract because the cleavage destroyed the antibody recognition of CstF-64. The other EV71 viral protease, 2A<sup>pro</sup> was also tested to determine whether it could degrade CstF-64 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<title>Reduction of CstF-64 in EV71-infected Cells</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> assays demonstrated that EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> can cleave CstF-64; the degradation of CstF-64 in EV71-infected cells was, therefore, examined. A time-course study was conducted to monitor the levels of CstF-64 in RD cells infected with EV71 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 40. Total cell lysates harvested from EV71-infected RD cells at various hours post-infection (h.p.i.) were analyzed by western blot assay. Infection reduced the amount of host CstF-64 proteins from 6 to 10 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 4, 6 and 8). One potential CstF-64 cleavage product of 55 kDa (indicated by *) which resembles that obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage, began to be detected at 6 h.p.i. (lane 4). EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> in the same infected cells was also observed at 6 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lane 4), and its level increased markedly from 8 to 10 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lane 6–8), in a manner that is related to the degradation times of CstF-64 in infected cells. The reduction of CstF-64 and the appearance of 55-kDa product were also observed in cells infected with a lower titer (m.o.i of 1) of EV71 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000593.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), but with a 2 hour delay. To detect other cleavage products from CstF-64, a CstF-64 that was fused with FLAG at its N-terminal was overexpressed in EV71-infected cells and detected using FLAG antibody at 6 and 8 h.p.i.. During EV71 infection, FLAG-CstF-64 was cleaved into products of size 55 kDa and 30 kDa (CP1 and CP2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The 55 kDa products from FLAG-CstF-64 reduced at late point of EV71 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, CP1, compare lanes 2 and 4), similar to the result from endogenous CstF-64 in EV71-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, the bands marked as * in lane 4 and 6). On the other hand, another cleavage product of about 30 kDa was increased during virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, CP2 compare lanes 2 and 4). The 55 kDa intermediate cleavage products suggest that CstF-64 may be cleaved at more than one cleavage site in EV71-infected cells.</p>

<p>(A) After RD cells have been infected with EV71 (m.o.i. = 40), 3C<sup>pro</sup> and CstF-64 protein in total cellular proteins of infected RD cells (+) or mock infected cells (-) were detected at various hours post-infection (h.p.i.) using specific antibodies. A potential cleavage product of CstF-64 was also indicated (*). The detection of β-actin was used as a loading control (B) RD cells with transient FLAG-CstF-64 overexpression were also infected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 40 and the total cellular proteins from mock infected (-) and infected cells (+) were harvested at 6 and 8 h.p.i.. FLAG-CstF-64 was detected using FLAG-specific antibody. The other cleaved FLAG-peptides were indicated as CP1 and CP2 (C) Cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions from EV71-infected RD cells at 8 h.p.i. were extracted and CstF-64 or 3C<sup>pro</sup> in each of the fractions were detected using specific antibodies. Detections of β-actin and histon deacetylase (HDAC) were used as cytoplasmic and nucleus protein controls. (D) The locations of CstF-64 in uninfected (Mock) or EV71-infected cells at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 h.p.i. were detected using specific antibody. The detection of viral 2B protein was applied as an infection-positive marker. The nuclei of cells were stained using Hoechst dye.</p>

To determine whether CstF-64 also undergoes changes in sub-cellular localization, the location of CstF-64 in EV71-infected was monitored by immunohistostaining using a confocal microscope. The result demonstrated that most CstF-64 remains in the nucleus of the infected cells at 6 to 10 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), whereas the other nuclear factor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), is redistributed to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000593.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Our 3C Ab was unable to be used in confocal experiment; therefore to determine whether EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> was also present in the nucleus, EV71-infected cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nucleus fractions. Western blot demonstrated that EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> is equally distributed across cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> can enter into a host nucleus during virus infection, as can other picornaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-FernandezTomas1">[44]</xref>.

<title>3C<sup>pro</sup> Cleaves CstF-64 Protein <italic>In Vitro</italic></title>
<p>The results presented above suggest that the CstF-64 was reduced in wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extracts but not in mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Therefore, 3C<sup>pro</sup> is reasonably hypothesized to cause the reduction of CstF-64 by proteolytic cleavage.</p>
<p>Details of the cleavage were elucidated using a [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled CstF-64 generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation (TNT) as a substrate in the <italic>in vitro</italic> 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage assay. After it had incubated with recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup>, [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled CstF-64 can be cleaved into fragments of approximately 25 and 30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 3). Since the size of these two peptides do not correlate with the full-length size of CstF-64 (64 kDa compared to 25 kDa+30 kDa = 55 kDa), at least one cleavage product smaller than 10 kDa that could not be detected in PAGEs was expected to exist. To identify the 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites on CstF-64, [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled CstF-64 and a series of truncated CstF-64 peptides that were designed according to functional domains of CstF-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) were generated <italic>in vitro</italic> by TNT for 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> summarizes the size of these cleavage products, estimated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>. The peptides 221–409 and 410–557 were both cleaved suggesting that CstF-64 included at least two cleavage sites. The 20 kDa peptide 410–557 was cleaved into the product of 10 kDa, suggesting that a cleavage site was located close to the C-terminus of CstF-64. Peptide 1−220 (25 kDa) was not cleaved but peptides 221−409 and 110−409 were both cleaved into a product of about 17 kDa, suggesting that one cleavage site can produce a product of 30 kDa from the N-terminal of CstF-64. The cleavage of peptide 221−469 supported this conclusion. In summary, these cleavage results suggest the existence at least two potential cleavage sites around the amino acid position 250 and 500 of the CstF-64 protein.</p>

An attempt was made to detect the cleavage intermediates by performing <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics analysis of [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled CstF-64 cleavage by recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup>. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, three cleavage products began to appear at 15 min. A 55 kDa product resulted from cleavage at positions around 500, while two products of 30 (front) and 35 (rear) kDa both resulted from cleavage at position around 250. A new 25 kDa product began to appear at 60 min, in addition to the three previously detected products. This 25 kDa segment is attributed to the further cleaving of either the aforementioned 35 (rear) kDa product at positions around 500 or the 55 kDa product at position around 250. As the incubation time exceeded 2 hours, only the 25 and 30 kDa products dominated and became the final cleavage products. Various concentrations of 3C<sup>pro</sup> were added to the reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000593.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), and similar cleavage products were observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>.</p>

<title>Mapping 3C<sup>pro</sup> Cleavage Sites on CstF-64 <italic>In Vitro</italic></title>
<p>Picornavirus 3C<sup>pro</sup> generally cleaves peptides at the Gln/Gly junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Kitamura1">[21]</xref>. Based on the cleavage results presented above, an analysis of the amino acid sequence of CstF-64 was conducted, revealing that numerous Gln/Gly junctions may have potential 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites on CstF-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). They are Gln251, corresponding to the predicted cleavage site in the region of amino acid 250, and residues Gln483, 496, 505, 510, 515 at around the amino acid position 500 on CstF-64. To determine which Gln/Gly junction on CstF-64 is the actual 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site, an attempt was made to produce mutant [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled CstF-64 at putative Gln/X cleavage sites. Since two cleavage sites around the amino acids positions 250 and 500 of CstF-64 were estimated, cleavage at position around 250 is expected to produce a product of ∼55 KDa. However, as is predicted, a CstF-64 in which both 250 and 500 sites are mutated would be fully withstand 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Following 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treatment, the CstF-64 with the mutation of Gln251 into Ala (Q251A) yielded a cleavage product of 55 KDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lanes 1–3), which is consistent with the predicted product when the cleavage site around amino acid position 250 is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This result suggests that the Gln251 of CstF-64 is the only 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site around the position 250 <italic>in vitro</italic>. To identify the other cleavage sites around the amino acid position 500 of CstF-64, CstF-64(Q251A) was further mutated at the Gln483, 496, 505, 510 and 515 amino acids into Ala (Q483A, Q496A, Q505A, Q510A and Q515A, respectively). The results indicate that CstF-64(Q251A) peptides with single mutations on these potential cleavage sites are not completely resistant to wild-type (WT) 3C<sup>pro</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lanes 4–18). A mutant CstF-64(Q251A) with Q483A, Q496A, Q505A, Q510A, and Q515A is fully resistant to 3C<sup>pro</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, lanes 4–6), suggesting that the existence of multiple cleavage sites around the amino acid position 500 of CstF-64 in the five residues, Gln483, 496, 505, 510 and 515. Moreover, the cleavage pattern was examined in a mutant CstF-64 (CstF-64-5 m), in which all Gln/Gly sites around position 500 were mutated. This observation indicates that CstF-64-5 m was cleaved into two detectable products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000593.s004">Fig. S4</xref>): a) 30 kDa product, i.e. the N-terminal part of CstF-64 after 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaves it at Gln/Gly of position 251 and b) the 35 KDa product, i.e. the C-terminal part of CstF-64 when 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaves it at Gln/Gly of position 251, but not at Gln/Gly sites near position 500. Taken together, above results demonstrate that Gln to Ala mutations at position 251 and multiple sites around position 500 let CstF-64 become fully resistant to EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage.</p>

The pEGFP plasmid contained a SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence, which was commonly used in the study of cellular mRNA processing and polyadenylation. Primers that target GFP pre-mRNA and an oligo-dT primer that targets GFP poly(A) mRNA were used in RT-PCR for detecting RNA species (pre-mRNA and mature mRNA with poly(A) tail) in EV71-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). A set of primers that target the GFP coding region, which can theoretically detect both pre-mRNA and mRNA with a poly(A) tail, were also utilized as controls to demonstrate the total amount of GFP RNA in cells. RD cells were infected with EV71 after they were transfected with eGFP plasmid.

Following calibration to the total amount of GFP RNA, the fold changes from the amount of pre-mRNA and poly(A)-RNA in mock-infected cells (Mock) to that of EV71-infected cells (EV71) were calculated.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Picornaviral 3C<sup>pro</sup> reportedly influences numerous cellular functions by cleaving various host proteins, which mechanism is important in shutting off cellular gene expression in transcriptional and translational levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Yalamanchili1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Weidman1">[27]</xref>. Here we show that EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> may affect another cellular mechanism, polyadenylation, since a novel substrate, CstF-64, was identified using the proteomic approach. CstF-64 is a crucial element in cellular mRNA maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Takagaki1">[38]</xref>. This 64 kDa component plays a role in the CstF complex that binds to the polyadenylation signal region of pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-MacDonald1">[37]</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage studies revealed that 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaves CstF-64 at amino acid position 251 and around 500 close to the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">5</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> data also demonstrated the blockage of pre-mRNA 3′-end processing and the polyadenylayion activities of the nuclear extract upon 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The inhibitory effect of EV-71 3C<sup>pro</sup> resembles that of the blockage of CstF-64 by the specific antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Takagaki1">[38]</xref>. The results together suggest that EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaves CstF-64 and thus inhibits the 3′-end processing of cellular pre-mRNA. Our semi-quantitative RT-PCR results support this claim because the cellular 3′-end pre-mRNA processing was inhibited in EV71-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Pre-mRNA and mature poly(A) mRNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> were detected individually by using two pairs of primers. Different primers have varying sensitivities, making it difficult to achieve a quantitative correlation between the increase in precursor and decrease in polyadenylated RNA. However, a quantivitive real-time RT-PCR result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) provides further evidence to demonstrate that the pre-mRNA processing or polyadenylation (either an exogenous RNA or an endogenous RNA) was impaired in EV71-infected cells.</p>
<p>Other proteins than CstF-64 may be involved in EV71-induced inhibition of pre-mRNA processing in virus-infected cells even though the levels of poly(A) polymerase in EV71-infected cells were found to be similar to those of the mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000593.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g007">Fig. 7</xref> demonstrate that CstF-64 is the target factor that caused 3C<sup>pro</sup> to affect 3′-end processing and polyadenylation. Adding recombinant CstF-64 can restore the function of 3C-incubated nuclear extracts on 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation (Lane 6 in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g007">Fig. 7A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>Before the surge of the proteomic method, a substrate for a protease is commonly identified using western blot analysis. The proteomic approach has the advantages of the ability to identify multiple candidates simultaneously with no limitation by antibody availability. However, 2D electrophoresis and the silver staining are occasionally unable to detect proteins visible in western blot analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Lin2">[46]</xref>. This study identified eight novel proteins as the substrates for EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> via the proteomic approach, in which no previously known substrates for other picornaviral 3C<sup>pro</sup> were available, such as TATA-box binding protein, p53, Histone H3 and transcription factor IIIC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Falk1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Weidman1">[27]</xref>. This might be due to that silver staining and western blot differ in sensitivity. Moreover, the strategy adopted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g001">Fig. 1</xref> is set only in a single condition, i.e. the recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup> was incubated with nuclear extract from SF268 cells for 4 hours. More potential substrates could be identified if several interaction conditions were tested, e.g., varying in incubation time and nuclear extracts from other cell lines.</p>
<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay revealed that 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaves [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled CstF-64 protein into detectable products of 25 kDa and 30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, CstF-64 in 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract yielded 55 kDa products detected by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). A product similar to that of 55 kDa was also present in EV71-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The size of the 55 kDa products above is correlated to that of the 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage product when the cleavage site of the amino acid position 251 on CstF-64 is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The detection of FLAG in FLAG-CstF-64 overexpressed cells revealed that the proportion of 30 kDa increased and that of 55 kDa declined upon EV71-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). A FLAG-CstF-64 with Q251A mutation was transfected into EV71-infected cells and the results indicated the accumulation of 55 kDa products but no 30 KDa product was detected (data not shown), suggesting that the 55 kDa component was an intermediate cleavage product when 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaved CstF-64 at an amino acid position ∼500. The production of multiple 55 kDa bands in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Figs. 3A and B</xref>) was also observed, explaining the multiple cleavage sites around the amino acid position 500 of CstF-64. In addition, the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics of CstF-64 cleavage by 3C<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000593.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) showed a cleavage intermediate of 55 kDa. In summary, these results showed the similarity between the cleavage patterns obtained in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays suggests that 3C<sup>pro</sup> may have reduced CstF-64 levels via proteolytic activity in infected cells.</p>
<p>Single mutation at position around 500 in CstF-64 still made it susceptible to EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage, while multiple mutations cause CstF-64 become resistant to the cleavage. Analytical results indicate the C-terminal of CstF-64 may contain multiple cleavage sites; otherwise, these mutations could lead to a loss of exposure of the cleavage site.</p>
<p>This study also attempted to examine whether C147S mutation in EV71 impairs the viral inhibition of cellular pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation. However, C147S mutation rendered EV71 lethal. Alternatively, transcripts derived from EV71 infectious clones, i.e. wild-type versus C147S mutant, were transfected into cells to examine how they affect cellular pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation. In wild-type transcript -transfected cells, CstF-64 was cleaved and cellular pre-mRNA processing was inhibited (data not shown), the same phenomenon was observed in EV71 virus-infected cells. However, in C147S mutant transcript -transfected cells, no cleavage occurred in CstF-64 and no effect on cellular pre-mRNA processing was observed, which is similar to the results in mock-infected cells. Still, no detectable viral protein (mature 3C<sup>pro</sup>) was found. We believe that phenomenon is owing to that C147S mutation destroys the proteolytic activity of 3C<sup>pro</sup> and inhibits viral protein processing and maturation. Therefore, we can not conclude that the C147S mutant in EV71-infected cells impairs the viral inhibition of cellular pre-mRNA processing.</p>
<p>CstF-64 reportedly contains at its N-terminal an RNA-binding domain and a hinge domain, which are responsible for the reorganization of RNA and its binding to CstF-77 or other factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Takagaki2">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Hatton1">[50]</xref>. No 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage was detected in this region (1–220), suggesting that the cleaved CstF-64 maintains functions RNA binding and interaction with CstF-77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, the Pro/Gly-rich domains of the C-terminal region of CstF-64 form an extended α-helix structure and are suspected to be able to interact with several transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Takagaki2">[47]</xref>, including binding of the transcription factor PC4 via the 100 amino acids of C-terminal CstF-64 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Calvo1">[51]</xref>. One study noted that the truncation of the C-terminal domain (529–577) of CstF-64 inhibited cellular 3′ pre-mRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Qu1">[52]</xref>. Accordingly, multiple cleavage by 3C<sup>pro</sup> in C-terminal domain (around 500<sup>th</sup> a.a.) of CstF-64 is expected to destroy the cellular pre-mRNA processing functions of CstF-64.</p>
<p>The RNA virus-induced inhibition of 3′-end pre-mRNA processing has been observed in the influenza A virus. NS1A of influenza A reportedly inhibits the cellular 3′-end pre-mRNA processing by interacting with CPSF-30 which is within the same machinery co-factor as CstF-64 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Nemeroff1">[53]</xref>. Similar to those in EV71-infected cells, the inhibition of the cellular 3′-end pre-mRNA processing by influenza A virus causes the loss of poly(A) mRNA and the accumulation of un-poly(A) pre-mRNA. This inhibitory effect of NS1A has also been suggested to be involved in the countering of cellular antiviral responses, including virus-induced interferon β production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Noah1">[54]</xref>. The capacity of NS1A to bind to CPSF-30 may also be crucial to viral replication because of high interferon-β mRNA production in NS1A mutant virus-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Twu1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Picornaviruses influence host-cell gene expression by the inhibition of cellular transcription and cap-dependent mRNA translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Etchison1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark1">[13]</xref>. However, several cellular genes could escape the inhibition of gene expression by picornavirus infection. Our previous cDNA microarray analysis for total cellular RNA demonstrated that the level of some RNAs, related to chemokines, protein degradation, complement proteins and proapoptosis proteins increased upon EV-71 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Shih2">[45]</xref>, suggesting leakage from the inhibition of transcription by EV71. Translations of of c-myc, Bip, and eIF4G mRNA have been found to be increased in poliovirus-infected cells as the cap-dependent translation shuts down, because of the presence of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Sarnow1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Johannes1">[58]</xref>. This work proposes a novel mechanism by which picornavirus inhibits cellular gene expression in the 3′-end pre-mRNA processing step, which would probably inhibit polyadenylation of the surviving host RNAs. It has been reported that the poly(A) tail of poliovirus is essential to viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Silvestri1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Kusov1">[33]</xref>, which suggests several host poly(A)-associated factors are important for viral growth. Inhibition of cellular poly(A) RNA synthesis may provide yet an additional advantage for virus replication.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a novel mechanism by which picornavirus inhibits cellular function was identified. CstF-64 was identified as an EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> substrate. The 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites were mapped onto amino acid position 251 and the C-terminal region of CstF-64. The cleavage of CstF-64 impairs the cellular 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylaytion. EV71 utilizes 3C<sup>pro</sup> to interfere polyadenylation of host cellular RNA; however, its own poly(A) synthesis is not affected since picornaviral poly(A) tail is genetically encoded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Silvestri1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Kusov1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation assay</title>
<p>Capped RNA substrate with a poly(A) signal of the SV40 late gene was synthesized using a Megascript SP6 kit (Ambion) and Cap analog (Ambion). Plasmid pG3SVL-6, flanked by <italic>Dra</italic>I, was utilized as the template in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction. The synthesized capped RNA substrate was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction before it was used in <italic>in vitro</italic> 3′-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation assay.</p>
<p>The nuclear extract was treated with recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup> at 37°C for two hours before it was used in 3′ pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation assay. After the treatment, the 3C<sup>pro</sup> activity was stopped by adding protease inhibit cocktail (Roche). The volume of each 3′ pre-mRNA processing reaction with 20 µl contained 25% (v/v) nuclear extract (25 µg in total), and 2 ng of RNA subtrates with added 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 2.5% (v/v) of polyvinyl alcohol. In <italic>in vitro</italic> polyadenylation, dATP was replaced by ATP, and the conc. of EDTA declined to 0.08 mM with the addition of 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. 4 µg of recombinant CstF-64 was added into one of the 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated reaction. After incubation for two hours at 37°C, the assayed RNA was purified phenol/chloroform extraction. The purified RNA was analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel and denatured using formaldehyde.</p>

<title>Real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>Real-time RT-PCR was performed to detect levels of IL-10RB RNA. The High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was applied for reverse transcription. To differentiate pre-mRNA and polyadenylated IL-10RB RNA, different primers were used in reverse transcription step. A specific primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTGAGAGCTCCCAGATGACTGA-3′</named-content> that targets the region that contains polyadenylation cleavage signal on IL-10RB was used to detect the pre-mRNA. On the other hand, an oligo-d(T) was used as the primer to detect poly(A)-mRNA. For total mRNA (including pre-mRNA and poly(A)-mRNA), a random hexomer was used an the primer in reverse transcription step. For PCR step, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GAGGGATCAGGGCAGCAA-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CAGGGTCTGGGAGTTCTAGATGTG-3′</named-content> designed by Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) targeting IL-10RB coding region were used. The PCR reaction was performed on 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) using SYBR Green Core Kit (Applied Biosystem).</p>
