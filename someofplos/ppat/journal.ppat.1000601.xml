<p>To mate, <italic>MTL</italic>-homozygous strains of the yeast pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> must switch from the white to opaque phase. Mating-competent opaque cells then release pheromone that induces polarization, a G1 block and conjugation tube formation in opaque cells of opposite mating type. Pheromone also induces mating-incompetent white cells to become adhesive and cohesive, and form thicker biofilms that facilitate mating. The pheromone response pathway of white cells shares the upstream components of that of opaque cells, but targets a different transcription factor. Here we demonstrate that the genes up-regulated by the pheromone in white cells are activated through a common <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence, WPRE, which is distinct from the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence, OPRE, responsible for up-regulation in opaque cells. Furthermore, we find that these white-specific genes play roles in white cell biofilm formation, and are essential for biofilm formation in the absence of an added source of pheromone, suggesting either an autocrine or pheromone-independent mechanism. These results suggest an intimate, complex and unique relationship between switching, mating and <italic>MTL</italic>-homozygous white cell biofilm formation, the latter a presumed virulence factor in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic>, like other microbial pathogens, form protective biofilms on host tissue, prosthetics and catheters. But <italic>C. albicans</italic> forms two types of biofilm, one by cells of majority strains that are heterozygous at the mating type locus, and another by white cells of minority strains that are homozygous at the mating type locus. These latter biofilms are enhanced by mating-competent minority opaque cells, a source of pheromone. The white cell biofilm response to pheromone is regulated by a pheromone response pathway that shares all of the upper components of the opaque cell mating response pathway, but targets a different transcription factor and activates different phase-specific downstream genes. Here we demonstrate that genes are up-regulated by pheromone in white cells through a common white <italic>cis</italic>-acting specific pheromone response element (WPRE), distinct from the element (OPRE) responsible for pheromone up-regulation of genes in opaque cells. In addition, the pheromone-induced white-specific genes play essential roles in biofilm formation. We further demonstrate that in the absence of minority opaque cells, the source of pheromone, majority white cells form biofilms through a process that is still dependent upon the same pheromone response pathway and targeted white-specific genes, suggesting either an autocrine system that involves the auto release of pheromone of the opposite mating type, or pheromone-independent activation. These observations indicate a unique interdependency of white cell biofilm formation, a presumed pathogenic trait, switching and mating in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In nature, the majority of natural strains of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> are heterozygous (<bold>a</bold>/α) at the mating type locus, <italic>MTL</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lockhart1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Odds1">[4]</xref>. To mate, they must first undergo homozygosis to <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> or α/α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hull1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Magee1">[7]</xref>, then switch from the white to unique opaque phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Miller1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lockhart2">[9]</xref>. Switching from the white to opaque phenotype occurs spontaneously and involves activation and deactivation of the master switch locus, <italic>WOR1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Zordan1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Srikantha1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the mating process, opaque cells of each mating type release their respective pheromone, which induces opaque cells of the opposite mating type to polarize, form a mating projection, become blocked in G1, undergo chemotropism and fuse, in a fashion similar to that of haploid cells of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lockhart2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lockhart3">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Zhao1">[19]</xref>. The requirement to switch from white to opaque, however, was considered both unique and paradoxical. Why did <italic>C. albicans</italic> undergo a phenotypic transition that was so highly complex in order to become mating-competent, when there was no similar requirement for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>? The surprising discovery that mating-incompetent white cells also responded to the mating pheromone, but in a manner different from that of mating-competent opaque cells, provided a clue. Pheromone induced none of the responses in white cells that it induced in opaque cells. Rather, it induced cohesion between cells, adhesion to a substratum and enhanced biofilm development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>. Biofilm formation is a general virulence factor of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes that provides environments resistant to antibodies and host challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-HallStoodley1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lynch1">[23]</xref>. In the case of biofilms formed by <italic>C. albicans</italic> white cells, it also provides an environment that facilitates mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>. The white cell response to pheromone has been shown to be a general characteristic of <italic>MTL</italic>-homozygous strains for all of the major clades of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, including derivatives of the laboratory strain SC5314 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Sahni1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mutational analyses have revealed that the white cell response to pheromone involves the same receptors and MAP-kinase pathway as the opaque cell mating response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi2">[26]</xref>. This pathway, however, activates a different downstream <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>CPH1</italic>, which encodes the downstream transcription factor targeted by the pheromone response pathway in opaque cells, blocks the opaque cell response, but not the white cell response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>. The downstream transcription factor targeted by the pheromone response pathway in white cells has not yet been identified. In white cells pheromone induces the expression of a number of genes that are also induced in opaque cells, as well as a number of genes specific to white cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lockhart3">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Sahni1">[24]</xref>. Since the major effects of pheromone on white cells includes increased adhesion, increased cohesion and enhanced biofilm formation, we predicted that pheromone-induced white-specific genes would play key roles in these processes. Here we demonstrate that white-specific genes are regulated through an A-rich white-specific pheromone response element, WPRE (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAAAAAAAAAGAAAG</named-content>), which is distinct from the G-rich response element, OPRE (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GTGAGGGGA</named-content>), regulating genes in the opaque cell pheromone response. These results support our earlier conclusion that white genes are regulated by a single white-specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, we show by mutational analysis that the white-specific genes play fundamental roles in adhesion and white cell biofilm formation. Moreover, these genes as well as the signal transduction pathway, are essential for white cell biofilm formation in the absence of an opaque cell pheromone source, indicating either the existence of a pheromone-based autocrine system, or a pheromone-independent process. Interestingly, the white-specific genes up-regulated by pheromone in <italic>MTL</italic>-homozygous white cells have previously been demonstrated to play roles in biofilm formation in <bold>a</bold>/α cells, which represent a majority of the strains found in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Lockhart1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Odds1">[4]</xref>. Together, these results provide clues to the evolution of the white cell pheromone response.</p>

<p>To identify potential pheromone-regulated <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, the promoters of the 12 white-specific test genes and the promoters of six genes that had previously been shown to be selectively up-regulated by pheromone in opaque cells, <italic>MFA1</italic>, <italic>FUS1</italic>, <italic>CPH1</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>KAR4</italic> and <italic>RAM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bennett1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bennett3">[27]</xref> and N. Sahni, S. Yi, D. R.

The one thousand base pair upstream regions of the genes in the white and opaque sets were each analyzed for a common motif with an upper length limit of 15 bp at an E value of ≤0.001 as a threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey2">[30]</xref>. At this stringent threshold, the E value represents the expected number of motifs with a score as good or better than the analyzed motif, in a set of similar sized random sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey2">[30]</xref>. The promoters of all 12 white-specific genes contained at least one copy of a putative white pheromone-regulated element (WPRE) with high homology to the consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAAAAAAAAAGAAAG</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s007">Table S5</xref>). Using the same stringent E value of ≤0.001 as a threshold, this DNA sequence was found to be absent in the promoters of the six genes selectively up-regulated by pheromone in opaque but not white cells. The consensus sequence had no homology to the consensus sequences for the pheromone response elements (PRE) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dolan1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hagen1">[33]</xref> or <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Urban1">[34]</xref>. The white-specific gene promoters also contained WPRE-like sequences with lower homology to the consensus sequence (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s007">Table S5</xref>). Only the WPRE sequence with the highest homology to the consensus sequence was included for initial analyses.</p>
<p>Again using the MEME program at an E value of ≤0.001 as a threshold and with an upper length limit of 15 bp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey2">[30]</xref>, the promoters of all six opaque-specific genes were found to contain at least one copy of a putative opaque pheromone-regulated element (OPRE) with the unique consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GTGAGGGGA</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s008">Table S6</xref>). At this E value, this element was absent in the promoters of the 12 genes selectively up-regulated by pheromone in white cells. It exhibited no significant homology with the PREs of mating genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dolan1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hagen1">[33]</xref> or <italic>U. maydis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Urban1">[34]</xref>. Bennett and Johnson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bennett3">[27]</xref> had reported the presence of a putative PRE element similar to that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in some, but not all, pheromone up-regulated genes in opaque cells. In an expanded list of ten pheromone-regulated opaque genes (<italic>MFA1</italic>, <italic>FUS1</italic>, <italic>STE2</italic>, <italic>SST2</italic>, <italic>CPH1</italic>, <italic>KAR4</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>RAM1</italic>, <italic>CEK2</italic>, <italic>RBT1</italic>), we found sequences weakly homologous to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PRE-like element with an average E value of 10<sup>+2</sup>, which indicates that the homology is probably spurious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey2">[30]</xref>. In contrast, every one of the 10 genes had an OPRE sequence with an average E value of 10<sup>−5</sup> (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s008">Table S6</xref>). Decreasing the length in the MEME search to a maximum of nine base pairs identified the same consensus sequences (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s008">Table S6</xref>) These results strongly suggested that the OPREs were better candidates for a <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence regulating pheromone-induced expression of opaque genes than sequences weakly homologous to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PRE-like sequences, which were weakly to negligibly homologous to each other and not present in all opaque genes regulated by pheromone (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s008">Table S6</xref>).</p>
<p>If pheromone up-regulated opaque-specific genes through OPRE and white-specific genes through WPRE, then genes up-regulated by pheromone in both opaque and white cells should have both elements with the same high E values of white- and opaque-specific genes. Four such genes, <italic>STE2</italic>, <italic>CEK2</italic>, <italic>SST2</italic> and <italic>RBT1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bennett3">[27]</xref>, were analyzed by MEME software using the same high stringency E value of ≤0.001 as a threshold.

<title>WPRE regulates pheromone-induced white-specific gene expression</title>
<p>Although sequence analyses revealed potential <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, only functional analyses can establish their roles as such.

<p>The low but reproducible levels of expression of <italic>PGA10</italic>, <italic>CSH1</italic> and <italic>PBR1</italic> induced by α-pheromone in the respective WPRE deletion mutants could have been mediated by a second, weaker pheromone-response element in the promoters of each of the three genes.

<title>The four pheromone-induced white-specific genes play no role in the opaque pheromone response</title>

<p>In the absence of opaque cells, the thickness of the biofilms of the four homozygous deletion mutants averaged 56±6 µm and that of the four WPRE deletion mutants 56±4 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These biofilms were, therefore, on average 20% thinner than those of parental and complemented control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These differences were significant (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s009">Table S7</xref>). The presence of opaque cells had only a marginal effect on the thickness of the biofilm formed by the deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Examples of the pixel intensity scans used to measure thickness for control and mutant cell biofilms are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6F</xref>.</p>
<p>In both the absence and presence of opaque cells, the biofilms formed by the deletion mutants had no consistent white cell basal layer; the cells at the substratum were sparse or patchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6B, D</xref>). The matrix also strained far less intensely than that of control strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In addition, the hyphae formed as patches and were orientated horizontally (<italic>i.e.</italic>, in parallel with the substratum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6B, D</xref>), rather than vertically, in contrast to the vertical orientation in control cell biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6B, C</xref>). This aberrant orientation may have been due to the dramatic decrease in matrix suggested by the staining results (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Measurements of β-glucan in the supernatant of biofilms revealed significant differences between mutants and the parental stain both in the absence and presence of minority opaque cells. For the WPRE deletion mutants <italic>EAP1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>/eap1</italic> and <italic>PBR1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>/pbr1</italic>, the levels of β-glucan were on average 33% and 19% lower, respectively, in the absence of opaque cells, and 44% and 42% lower, respectively, in the presence of opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). These differences proved significant. Together these results demonstrate that each of the four α-pheromone-induced, white-specific genes analyzed was essential for normal biofilm formation and architecture in the absence as well as in the presence of opaque cells.</p>

<p>Misexpression of <italic>PBR1</italic> in the absence of pheromone caused an increase in adhesion in the transformed parental strain P37005 that was approximately one third of the increase induced by α-pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g008">Figure 8B, C</xref>). Misexpression in the four transformed WPRE deletion mutants in the absence of α-pheromone resulted in similar levels of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g008">Figure 8B, C</xref>). In the presence of α-pheromone, <italic>PBR1</italic> misexpression in both the transformed parental strain and the four WPRE deletion mutants resulted in a level of adhesion greater than when <italic>PBR1</italic> was misexpressed in the absence of α-pheromone or when cells were only treated with α-pheromone (<italic>i.e.</italic>, in the absence of doxycycline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g008">Figure 8B, C</xref>).

To explore this point further, we transformed the double mutant <italic>cek1/cek1 cek2/cek2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref> with the misexpression module at the <italic>ADH1</italic> locus.

This result supports the suggestion that expression of <italic>PBR1</italic> alone results in increased adhesion, but not to control levels.</p>
<p>Since the WPRE deletion mutants of <italic>EAP1</italic>, <italic>PGA10</italic> and <italic>CSH1</italic> express these genes at basal or slightly induced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), misexpression of <italic>PBR1</italic> in these WPRE deletion mutants might still result in interactions between Pbr1 and the gene products Eap1, Pga10 or Csh1, respectively.

<title>Differences in the opaque and white response pathways</title>
<p>The α-pheromone response pathway of white cells, from receptor through the MAP kinase cascade, includes the same gene products as the pheromone response pathway of opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g009">Figure 9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi2">[26]</xref>. However, the downstream targets of the pathways differ. The target of the opaque pathway is the transcription factor Cph1, a homolog of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcription factor Ste12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Liu1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Chen1">[45]</xref>. The target of the white pathway, however, is a transcription factor that is distinct from Cph1 and remains unidentified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, pheromone up-regulates genes involved in the mating response through the transcription factor Ste12, which binds to a common pheromone response element, PRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dolan1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hagen1">[33]</xref>. Here we have presented evidence that in opaque cells, Cph1 activates opaque-specific genes by binding to a GC-rich, opaque-specific pheromone response element, OPRE, not a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PRE-like sequence, as has been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bennett3">[27]</xref>. We have also presented evidence that in white cells, the white-specific transcription factor activates white-specific genes by binding to an AT-rich, white-specific pheromone response element, WPRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The promoter of each opaque-specific gene contains at least one OPRE and no WPRE, and the promoter of each white-specific gene contains at least one WPRE and no OPRE. Genes up-regulated by pheromone in both white and opaque cells have both a WPRE and an OPRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The strategy for gene regulation in the white pheromone response therefore appears to involve a single white-specific transcription factor and a single white-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter element, and the strategy for gene regulation in the opaque pheromone response appears to involve a single opaque-specific transcription factor and a single opaque-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000601-g009">Figure 9</xref>). These strategies are highly similar to that of the homologous mating pathway in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which also activates genes through one primary transcription factor and a single, dominant <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dolan1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hagen1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Magee2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Chen1">[45]</xref>.</p>

<title>White-specific genes and the adhesion response</title>
<p>Each of the twelve genes that we found were strongly up-regulated by pheromone in white but not opaque cells, contained a WPRE. Deletion of four of these genes or deletion of the WPRE from their promoters resulted in a marked reduction in the white cell adhesion response to pheromone. But in no case did the full deletion of the gene, the WPRE of the representative gene, or the WPRE and lcWPRE of the representative gene in combination, lead to the complete loss of the adhesion response, suggesting that the protein product of each gene may make an independent but additive contribution to the pheromone adhesion response. Hence, none of the four gene products appeared to be essential for the entirety of the adhesion response to pheromone. The experiments performed in which <italic>PBR1</italic> was misexpressed revealed that increased expression of <italic>PBR1</italic> alone, in the complete absence of expression of either <italic>EAP1</italic> or <italic>CSH1</italic> (<italic>i.e.</italic>, in the null mutants), resulted in a further, but incomplete, increase in adhesion. This was true for the WPRE and full homozygous deletion mutants as well. Moreover, misexpression of <italic>PBR1</italic> in the mutant <italic>cek1/cek1 cek2/cek2</italic>, in which <italic>EAP1</italic>, <italic>PGA10</italic>, <italic>CSH1</italic> and native <italic>PBR1</italic> cannot be induced, results in an increase in adhesion to 34% that of the induced control strain. These results indicate that the adhesion response contributed by <italic>PBR1</italic> in white cells may be independent of the adhesion response contributed by the other three genes. Hence, α-pheromone induced adhesion in white cells may represent the sum of multiple adhesion systems.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>White-specific genes and the biofilm response</title>
<p>Deletion of each one of the four randomly selected white-specific genes resulted in a reproducible loss in the adhesion response to α-pheromone, ranging between 57 and 86%. In contrast, deleting any one of the four genes or their WPREs resulted in relatively uniform defects in biofilm formation. Since biofilm formation is a complex process involving multiple cell phenotypes, matrix formation and a temporal sequence of steps during maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hawser1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Blankenship1">[53]</xref>, one might have expected that deletion of each of the four genes would cause a different and partial defect. If, however, all four genes played roles in an early step in biofilm development, such as the formation of the initial basal layer of cells on the substratum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Chandra1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Douglas1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Soll1">[55]</xref>, then all subsequent steps might be similarly defective in the four deletion mutants, thus accounting for the uniformity of the biofilm defects.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Induction of white cell biofilm formation in the absence of minority opaque cells</title>
<p>Perhaps our most surprising observation was that the major defects in biofilm development by white <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> cells were exhibited by the homozygous and WPRE deletion mutants of the four white-specific genes in the absence as well as in the presence of minority opaque cells. The defects included the absence of a continuous, dense basal layer on a silicone elastomer substratum, horizontally oriented patches of hyphae rather than uniformly dense, vertically intertwined hyphae in the domains above the basal layer, and a dramatic reduction of the extracellular matrix. These defects occurred in the absence as well as the presence of minority opaque cells, indicating that white cells possess the ability to autoactivate. Given that the white response, which includes increased adhesion and up-regulation of white specific genes, depends upon an exogenous source of pheromone, these results suggest one of two mechanisms. First, there may exist an autocrine system in which <italic>MTL</italic>-homozygous white cells, when placed on a surface under conditions conducive to biofilm formation, are able to self-stimulate by releasing pheromone of opposite mating type. This pheromone then binds to receptors on the same cells, activating the white cell response pathway. Such a scenario is plausible since white <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> cells possess the gene for α-pheromone and α/α cells possess the gene for the <bold>a</bold> pheromone. We had previously suggested that an autocrine system might regulate white cell biofilm formation based on the defective phenotype of the α-receptor deletion mutant, <italic>ste2/ste2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi2">[26]</xref>. The mutant formed a patchy biofilm with diminished thickness in the absence of minority opaque cells, similar to that observed for the mutants <italic>eap1/eap1</italic>, <italic>pga10/pga10</italic>, <italic>csh1/csh1</italic> and <italic>pbr1/pbr1</italic>. In a mechanism alternative to an autocrine system, white cells may depend upon the basal activity of the pheromone response pathway in the absence of pheromone, for normal biofilm formation. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, such basal activity has not only been observed in the pheromone response pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hagen1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Roberts1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dolan2">[58]</xref>, but the <bold>α</bold> subunit of the trimeric G protein complex, <italic>Gpα1</italic>, which, when overexpressed, can activate changes in the mating response in the absence of pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dohlman1">[57]</xref>.

The white response to pheromone appears to function solely to facilitate opaque cell mating through the genesis of a protective biofilm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>, suggesting that it arose from the opaque response in order to facilitate it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Daniels2">[20]</xref>. Because the white cell pheromone response appears to be present only in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, it represents a pathway that has only recently evolved, and that appears to have borrowed the entire upper portion of the pheromone response pathway that functions in the mating process. The observations that the genes selectively up-regulated by α-pheromone in white, but not opaque, cells appear to play roles or to be regulated in the formation of <bold>a</bold>/α biofilms, also suggests that the target genes regulated by the white cell pheromone response pathway that are involved in white cell biofilm formation may have been derived from an ancestral program for <bold>a</bold>/α biofilm formation. Because it represents a recent event, the borrowed portions of the pathway appear to have had insufficient time to undergo refinement through gene replacement or alteration.</p>

<title>MEME identification of WPRE and OPRE</title>
<p>To identify candidate white- and opaque-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting pheromone response elements (PREs) in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a set of white phase-specific and opaque phase-specific pheromone-inducible genes were submitted to the motif-finding program, MEME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey2">[30]</xref>. All the selected genes were verified by northern analysis for induction by pheromone prior to motif analysis. One thousand base pairs upstream of the open reading frame of 12 white-specific and the 6 opaque-specific pheromone-up-regulated genes were pooled into two respective groups and subjected to MEME analysis. The website address for MEME is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi</ext-link>. MEME program analyzes input promoter sequences for similarities among them and elicits consensus motifs, which may be present in some or all of the promoters analyzed. The parameters were set as follows: width of each motif between 6 and 15, a limit output of 3 different motif types, and other parameters with default values defined in the program. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> from the MEME analysis yields an E value defined as the probability of finding an equally well conserved pattern in random sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bailey2">[30]</xref>. The highest scoring hit in the analysis output for the white and opaque groups of genes represented the conserved DNA motifs, WPRE and OPRE, respectively. The WPRE or OPRE site was highlighted in each promoter and the distance from the translation start site shown.</p>
<p>To identify a strong WPRE or OPRE motif in the promoter, the parameter of “number of occurrences of a single motif” was set to be zero or one per sequence, and the result of MEME yielded one motif per promoter with the highest E value. To identify additional weaker WPRE or OPRE motifs in the promoter, the parameter of “number of occurrences of a single motif” was set to be any number of repetitions, and the result of MEME yielded more motifs, if any, per promoter with the same consensus but with lower E values. Noteworthy, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PRE (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGAAACA</named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Dolan1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Hagen1">[33]</xref> was not identified in our analysis with the same parameters, although a motif that contained a similar sequence to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PRE was obtained with a poor E value of 10<sup>+2</sup>. The result is consistent with the observation by Bennett and Johnson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Bennett3">[27]</xref>, who reported that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PRE was present in some, but not all, of genes that are induced by pheromone in opaque cells.</p>

<title>Construction of WPRE mutants, WPRE-complemented strains and gene disruption mutants</title>
<p>The recyclable SAT1 flipper cassette SAT1-2A, containing a dominant nourseothricin resistance marker SAT<sup>r</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Reuss1">[70]</xref>, was used for all mutant construction according to a protocol previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>. The original SAT1 flipper plasmid pSFS2A was a generous gift from Dr. Joachim Morschhäuser, the University of Würzburg, Germany. To generate WPRE mutants, a two-step strategy was employed. First, heterozygous mutants of the coding region were derived. In brief, 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of each gene were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs f1, r1, and f2, r2, respectively (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>). The 5′ and 3′ fragments were then each digested with SmaI and ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. The fusion product was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), generating the plasmid pGeneX1-T. The SAT1-2A cassette was then inserted into the SmaI-digested, dephosphorylated plasmid pGeneX1-T, yielding pGeneX1-2A. This plasmid was digested with SacI and SacII (or PvuII in the case of <italic>CSH1</italic>), then introduced into <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain P37005 by electroporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-DeBacker1">[71]</xref>. The derived heterozygotes were confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis. The heterozygotes were subjected to a pop-out protocol in YPM medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref> to excise the <italic>CaSAT1</italic> marker prior to the next step. Second, WPRE elements were deleted directly from the endogenous promoters in the heterozygous background. The methods used were as follows. A 5′ flanking DNA fragment, about 2 kb upstream of the start codon plus the ORF, was amplified using the primer pair pf1 and pr1 (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>). In addition, two DNA fragments spanning a promoter region on the 5′ and 3′ side, respectively, of the WPRE element to be deleted, were amplified by PCR with the primer pairs listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>. These two fragments, bordering the targeted WPRE element, were then fused by PCR using the primer pair pf2 and pr2 (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>), generating the 3′ flanking DNA fragment. The 5′ and 3′ flanking DNA fragment were then each digested with SmaI, fused together with T4 DNA ligase, amplified by PCR using primers pf1 and pr2 (supplemental ), and ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), generating the plasmid pGeneXw-T. The SAT1-2A cassette was inserted into the SmaI-digested, dephosphorylated plasmid pGeneXw-T, yielding pGeneXw-2A. This plasmid was digested with SacI and SacII (or PvuII in the case of <italic>PGA10</italic>), then introduced by electroporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-DeBacker1">[71]</xref> into the heterozygous strains obtained in the first step. Two or more independent WPRE deletion mutants were obtained for each gene and verified by PCR sequencing and Southern analysis. We generated in this way the mutants <italic>EAP1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>/eap1</italic>, <italic>PGA10<sub>WPREΔ</sub>/pga10</italic>, <italic>CSH1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>/csh1</italic>, and <italic>PBR1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>/pbr1</italic> (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s006">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>To obtain a complemented strain for each of the above WPRE deletion mutants, a DNA sequence containing an intact promoter region, the ORF and a C-terminal GFP fusion was designed to target the gene copy of each WPRE deletion mutant in which the WPRE was deleted. The SAT<sup>r</sup> marker was first excised from the WPRE mutants in the medium YPM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Yi1">[25]</xref>. The 5′ region spanning the promoter and ORF was amplified by PCR with the primers wQ1f and wQ1r (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>). The 3′ region spanning a region downstream of the stop codon was amplified using the primers wQ2f and wQ2r (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>). The 5′-3′ fusion product was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy to derive pGeneXwQ-T. A fragment containing both <italic>GFP</italic> and the SAT<sup>r</sup> marker was amplified by PCR with primers GFBhF1 and SATBgF1 (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000601.s004">Table S2</xref>), using plasmid pK91.6 (T. Srikantha and D. R. Soll, unpublished) as template. This <italic>GFP</italic>-<italic>SAT</italic> fragment was digested with BamHI plus Bg1II and ligated into the BamHI (or BglII in the case of <italic>CSH1</italic>)-digested, dephosphorylated plasmid pGeneXwQ-T to derive plasmid pGeneXwQ-SAT. C-terminal GFP fusion was confirmed to be in-frame by sequencing. pGeneXwQ-SAT was then digested with SacI plus SacII and transformed into the WPRE deletion mutants. The resulting complemented strains were verified by PCR, sequencing and Southern analysis. We generated in this way the complemented control strains <italic>EAP1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>-EAP1/eap1</italic>, <italic>PGA10<sub>WPREΔ</sub>-PGA10/pga10</italic>, <italic>CSH1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>-CSH1/csh1</italic>, and <italic>PBR1<sub>WPREΔ</sub>-PBR1/pbr1</italic>.</p>
<p>Null mutants of each gene were also created. As described earlier, the heterozygous mutants were derived based on the selection marker SAT<sup>r</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000601-Reuss1">[70]</xref>. The deletion cassette for the second allele was then constructed using the same strategy to delete the first copy. The resulting plasmid pGeneX2-2A was digested with SacI and SacII, and transformed by electroporation into the heterozygous mutant strains for each gene. At least two independent null mutants for each gene were generated and confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis. We generated in this way the null mutants <italic>eap1</italic>/<italic>eap1</italic>, <italic>pga10</italic>/<italic>pga10</italic>, <italic>csh1</italic>/<italic>csh1</italic> and <italic>pbr1</italic>/<italic>pbr1</italic>.</p>

The mean grayscale value (0–256) of all the pixels (512×512) in each X-Y optical section was calculated. To visualize the extrapolymeric substance (EPS), also referred to as “matrix”, between cells in a biofilm, excitation of calcofluor was increased. Since the EPS was much dimmer than the cells in a biofilm, the laser power at 780 nm was increased to the point at which the cell pixels became saturated. Adobe Photoshop™ was then used to remove the saturated pixels (the cells), leaving behind an image of the EPS.
