<p>Dimorphism or morphogenic conversion is exploited by several pathogenic fungi and is required for tissue invasion and/or survival in the host. We have identified a homolog of a master regulator of this morphological switch in the plant pathogenic fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>. This non-dimorphic fungus causes vascular wilt disease in tomato by penetrating the plant roots and colonizing the vascular tissue. Gene knock-out and complementation studies established that the gene for this putative regulator, <italic>SGE1</italic> (<italic>SIX</italic> Gene Expression 1), is essential for pathogenicity. In addition, microscopic analysis using fluorescent proteins revealed that Sge1 is localized in the nucleus, is not required for root colonization and penetration, but is required for parasitic growth. Furthermore, Sge1 is required for expression of genes encoding effectors that are secreted during infection. We propose that Sge1 is required in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and other non-dimorphic (plant) pathogenic fungi for parasitic growth.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plant pathogenic fungi have evolved many ways to infect their hosts and can have devastating effects on commercial crop production. Dissecting their infection strategies and understanding the molecular pathways involved in pathogenesis have been and continue to be the subject of intensive research. New insights gained may help to develop disease controlling strategies. <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> has become a model for root invading, pathogenic fungi. This fungus attacks a wide range of plant species worldwide and the only effective disease control strategies in the field are crop rotation and usage of resistant plant varieties, if at all available. In the last decade, many genes have been identified that play a role during pathogenesis, many of which are linked to general strain fitness. Only few genes have been identified that are required for pathogenesis but do not affect vegetative growth. This paper describes the characterization of such a gene. Its protein product, Sge1, is conserved in the fungal kingdom and represents a new class of transcriptional regulators involved in morphological switching in dimorphic fungal pathogens. In <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, the Sge1 protein is required for parasitic growth and is associated with expression of parasitic phase-specific genes. We suggest that the function of Sge1 is conserved in (plant) pathogenic fungi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> is found in both agricultural and non-cultivated soils throughout the world. The species consists of non-pathogenic and pathogenic isolates, both known as efficient colonizers of the root rhizosphere. The pathogenic isolates, grouped into <italic>formae specialis</italic> depending on their host range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Gordon1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Armstrong1">[2]</xref>, cause wilt or rot disease in important agricultural and ornamental plant species, such as tomato, banana, cotton and tulip bulbs, thereby causing serious problems in commercial crop production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Brayford1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Ploetz1">[4]</xref>. Recently, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> has also been reported as an emerging human pathogen, causing opportunistic mycoses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Albisetti1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Romano1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the absence of plant roots <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> survives in the soil either as dormant propagules (chlamydospores) or by growing saprophytically on organic matter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Gordon1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Agrios1">[8]</xref>. When growing on roots of a suitable host <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> appears to switch from a saprophyte into a pathogen. As a pathogen <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> needs to overcome host defence responses and sustain growth within the host in order to establish disease. To do so, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> likely undergoes reprogramming of gene expression. In the last decade, genes have been identified that do not seem to be required for saprophytic growth, but are involved in or required for pathogenicity and/or are specifically expressed during <italic>in planta</italic> growth. Examples are <italic>SIX1</italic>, encoding a small secreted protein, and <italic>FOW2</italic> and <italic>FTF1</italic>, both encoding Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys6-type transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Michielse1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Srikantha1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In an insertional mutagenesis screen aimed at identification of pathogenicity factors of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopercisi</italic> (<italic>Fol</italic>), a gene now called <italic>SGE1</italic> (<italic>SIX</italic> Gene Expression 1) was identified that shows homology to the transcriptional regulators <italic>Candida albicans WOR1</italic> and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum RYP1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Michielse1">[9]</xref>. These transcription factors have been identified as major regulators of morphological switching in these human pathogens: from a filamentous to a yeast form in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> and from a white to opaque cell type in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Huang1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan1">[13]</xref>. In both fungi, these morphological transitions are correlated with the ability to cause disease. Targeted deletion of <italic>RYP1</italic> in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> or <italic>WOR1</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> locks the fungus in its filamentous form or white cell type, respectively.</p>
<p>In this work we characterize <italic>SGE1</italic> and show that it shares many characteristics with <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>RYP1</italic>. In addition, we show that expression of effector genes is lost in the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant. We conclude that Sge1 plays a major role during parasitic growth, defined as extensive <italic>in planta</italic> growth leading to wilt symptoms, in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>.</p>

<title>Isolation and characterization of <italic>SGE1</italic> and <italic>FoPAC2</italic></title>
<p>In an insertional mutagenesis screen aimed at identifying genes involved in pathogenicity a non-pathogenic mutant (5G2) and one severely reduced in pathogenicity (101E1) were identified that both carried a single T-DNA insertion into the ORF of <italic>FOXG_10510</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Michielse1">[9]</xref>, hereafter called <italic>SGE1</italic> (<italic><underline>S</underline>IX</italic> <underline>G</underline>ene <underline>E</underline>xpression 1). The <italic>SGE1</italic> ORF contains no introns and encodes a protein of 330 amino acids (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/MultiHome.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/MultiHome.html</ext-link>). Sequence analysis revealed that the N-terminus (amino acids 1–120) contains a TOS9 (COG5037) and a Gti1_Pac2 family domain (Pfam09729) and is conserved in the fungal kingdom; all fungi of which the genome sequence was examined, including ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and zygomycetes, contain related genes that divide in two groups based on sequence similarity of the predicted proteins. Most ascomycetes have one member in each group, except <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> which lacks a member of the <italic>SGE1</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The basidiomycete <italic>Coprinus cinereus</italic> and the zygomycete <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> contain more than two members, still with at least one member in each group (data not shown). The branching order within the two groups does not always follow species phylogeny, making orthology questionable. Examples are the placement of FoSge1 and FGSG_12164 basal to the <italic>Magnaporthe grisea</italic> homolog (MGG_00850), the placement of CAWG_04607 of <italic>C. albicans</italic> basal to Pac2 of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (and closer to basidiomycete homologs) and of NCU06864 of <italic>N. crassa</italic> basal to homologs of other filamentous fungi (pezizomycotina) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Sge1 is in the same group as <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> Ryp1 and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> Wor1, both identified as regulators for morphological switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Huang1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan1">[13]</xref>, and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Gti1, which plays a role in gluconate uptake upon glucose starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Caspari1">[14]</xref>. A potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site (KRWTDS/G) is conserved between these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, a nuclear localization motif is present in Sge1 (+93 to +100) that is shared with Ryp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> protein related to Sge1, encoded by <italic>FOXG_12728</italic>, shows high similarity to <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pac2, a protein controlling the onset of sexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Kunitomo1">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, in the same insertional mutagenesis screen mentioned above, a <italic>Fol</italic> mutant with reduced pathogenicity (30C11) was identified in which one of two T-DNA insertions resides in the <italic>FOXG_12728</italic> ORF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Michielse1">[9]</xref>, hereafter called <italic>FoPAC2</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>SGE1</italic> is strictly required for pathogenicity</title>
<p>To assess the involvement of <italic>SGE1</italic> and <italic>FoPAC2</italic> in pathogenicity, gene knock-out mutants were generated by homologous recombination. Four independent <italic>SGE1</italic> and eight independent <italic>FoPAC2</italic> knock-out mutants were obtained, with the deletions confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s002">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s005">S4</xref>). The <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutants were non-pathogenic on tomato in a root dip bioassay and corroborated the severely reduced to non-pathogenic phenotype of the insertional mutagenesis mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Re-introduction of the <italic>SGE1</italic> gene <italic>in locus</italic> by homologous recombination in a knock-out mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s003">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s004">S3</xref>) restored pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), confirming that the loss of pathogenicity was due to loss of <italic>SGE1</italic>. Deletion of <italic>FoPAC2</italic> only had a minor effect on pathogenicity. All knock-out mutants were significantly different from the wild type in disease causing ability, but seven out of the eight mutants were also significantly different from the original insertion mutant (30C11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This indicates that <italic>FoPAC2</italic> plays at most a minor role during infection and that most probably additional defects in the 30C11 mutant added to the reduced pathogenicity phenotype. Since the loss of pathogenicity was complete upon deletion of <italic>SGE1</italic>, we focussed on this gene for further analysis.</p>

<title><italic>SGE1</italic> is not required for vegetative growth, but quantitatively affects conidiation</title>
<p>Previously, we reported that vegetative growth of the insertional mutants 5G2 and 101E1 are indistinguishable from that of the wild type on various carbon sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Michielse1">[9]</xref>. To more fully analyze potential metabolic defects of the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant, we made use of BIOLOG FF MicroPlates, in which each well contains a different carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-PrestonMafham1">[16]</xref>. Also in this assay no reproducible differences were observed between growth of the wild type and the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant on 95 different carbon sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s006">Figure S5</xref>). Microconidia and macroconidia generated in minimal or CMC liquid medium were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s007">Figure S6</xref>). However, the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutants produced about 6-fold less microconidia compared to the wild type in both media, and this phenotype was only partially restored in the <italic>SGE1</italic> complementation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The conidial germination rates were comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that, although less microconidia are formed, they are fully viable. These observations indicate that <italic>SGE1</italic> is quantitatively involved in conidiogenesis, but is not required for conidial fitness, overall (colony) morphology, vegetative growth or carbon source utilization.</p>

<title><italic>SGE1</italic> is not essential for colonization or penetration of the root surface</title>
<p>To determine at which stage during infection the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant is halted, tomato root colonization by the mutant was visualized using fluorescent binocular and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Tomato seedlings were infected with a GFP expressing wild type strain or <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion strain and colonization was followed over time. After two days, patches of colonization on the roots were observed for both strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s008">Figure S7</xref>), indicating that the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant is not impaired in root surface colonization. This observation was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. For both strains, germinated spores were observed on the root surface 24 hours after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>) and mycelial mass increased in time leading to patches of colonization as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). No difference in colonization was observed between the wild type and the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant in the first 2 days after inoculation. However, after three days, plant cells filled with spores and mycelium were observed in roots infected with the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that penetration of the root surface had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). A mixture of germinated spores and mycelium was also observed on plant roots infected with the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant, however, growth was dispersed over the entire root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) and was not confined to single plant cells as observed for the wild type. Occasionally, the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant was observed within the root cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), indicating that the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant is capable of penetrating the surface. This is in line with our observation that the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant is able to penetrate a cellophane sheet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s009">Figure S8</xref>), an assay used to assess the ability to form penetration hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-PradosRosales1">[18]</xref>. Four days after infection fungal growth within the roots was observed. In roots infected with the wild type, growth within the xylem vessel was observed once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Also in one case, extensive growth of the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant was observed within the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000637-g007">Figure 7F</xref>); however, this growth was mainly intercellular. In both cases the fungal growth extended from a point where the root was broken. Since these cases were too rare for a proper quantification, we can only conclude that both the wild type and the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant are capable of <italic>in planta</italic> growth.</p>

<p>To determine whether the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant is able to colonize xylem vessels as extensively as the wild type, tomato seedlings were inoculated with the wild type, <italic>SGE1</italic> knock-out or the <italic>SGE1</italic> complementation strain and potted according to the bioassay procedure (i.e. with damaged roots to allow relatively easy entry into vessels). One week after inoculation the hypocotyl was cut in slices of several millimeters and put on rich (PDA) medium. After two days <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> outgrowth was observed from hypocotyl pieces previously inoculated with the wild type and the <italic>SGE1</italic> complementation strain, but not from the hypocotyl pieces previously inoculated with the <italic>SGE1</italic> knock-out mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000637.s010">Figure S9</xref>). Based on the above described observations, it can be concluded that Sge1 is not required for early pathogenesis-related functions, such as root colonization and penetration, but appears to be required for extensive growth within plant cells and the xylem.</p>

To our surprise, after numerous transformation attempts only one colony was obtained.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fungi have various ways to adapt their morphology to the environment, one example being dimorphism. Dimorphism is a strategy frequently employed by fungal pathogens where this developmental transition is correlated with the ability to cause disease (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Klein1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Nadal1">[28]</xref>). In this study, we have characterized Sge1, the <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> homolog of the master regulator of morphological switching Wor1 and Ryp1. Although <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> does not display an immediately obvious morphological switch like <italic>C. albicans</italic> or <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, Sge1 was found to be required for colonization of the xylem system and disease development.</p>
<p>Sge1, together with its homolog FoPac2, described in this work, belong to a class of conserved fungal proteins. Both proteins have apparent orthologs across the fungal kingdom and the N-terminal domain of these proteins is always more conserved than the C-terminus, which is generally rich in glutamine residues. Despite their similarity, the <italic>SGE1</italic> and <italic>FoPAC2</italic> deletion mutants generated in this study display different phenotypes, indicating that the functions of these proteins are not redundant. The FoPac2 and Sge1 homologs in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Pac2 and Gti1, respectively, also have a different function although both proteins are involved in regulation of transition processes. Pac2 is a negative regulator of sexual development, which is induced under nitrogen starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Kunitomo1">[15]</xref> and Gti1 is a positive regulator of metabolic reprogramming by inducing gluconate uptake under glucose starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Caspari1">[14]</xref>. The best characterized members of the class to which Sge1 belongs are Wor1 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and Ryp1 in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Huang1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ryp1 and Sge1 share a conserved and apparently functional nuclear localization signal. In addition, all three proteins contain a putative protein kinase A (Pka) phosphorylation site. Another common feature of these proteins is increased expression of their genes upon transition. <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>RYP1</italic> are both under tight transcriptional regulation in that hardly any expression of these genes can be detected in the white and the filamentous growth phase, respectively. Their expression is upregulated 45- and 4-fold during and after the transition to the opaque or the yeast growth phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Huang1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Tsong1">[17]</xref>. Although <italic>SGE1</italic> expression can easily be detected in the saprophytic growth phase, it was found to be upregulated 2- to 5-fold during <italic>in planta</italic> growth. <italic>WOR1</italic> is preceded by an exceptionally large intergenic region of 10.3 kb (average length in <italic>C. albicans</italic> ∼0.9 kb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/candida_albicans/GeneStatsSummary.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/candida_albicans/GeneStatsSummary.html</ext-link>) and it is able to bind to several positions in its own upstream region, although the protein does not contain an annotated DNA binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan1">[13]</xref>. Also Ryp1, which is preceded by an intergenic region of about 2 kb, is able to bind to several positions in its own upstream region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>. The intergenic region preceding <italic>SGE1</italic> is larger than the average in the <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> genome: 4.3 kb versus 2.0 kb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/GeneStatsSummary.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/GeneStatsSummary.html</ext-link>), but whether Sge1 is able to activate its own transcription by binding to its promoter remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, given the nuclear localization of Sge1, the homology to the transcriptional regulators Wor1 and Ryp1, and the effect of deletion of <italic>SGE1</italic> on expression of <italic>SIX</italic> genes, we propose that also Sge1 also acts as a transcriptional regulator.</p>
<p>The requirement of Sge1 for expression of effector genes may explain the non-pathogenic phenotype of the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant. Based on the apparent absence of xylem colonization as observed with confocal microscopy and the absence of the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant in hypocotyls from infected plants, we conclude that although the mutant is still able to colonize roots and penetrate the root surface, it is not able to grow extensively in living cells or the xylem system. The ability of the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant to colonize roots superficially is supported by the biocontrol activity of the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant. The only additional phenotype of the mutant that we found was a 6-fold lower microconidia production compared to the wild type strain. An aberrant conidiogenesis behaviour was also observed for the <italic>H. capsulatum ryp1</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>, indicating a conserved role for these proteins in conidiogenesis. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the regulatory network that drives white-opaque switching, to which Wor1 belongs, is beginning to be understood. A gene counteracting <italic>WOR1</italic> is <italic>EFG1</italic>, which is necessary for maintaining the white state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Sonneborn1">[29]</xref>. Wor1 is able to bind to the upstream region of <italic>EFG1</italic>, thereby regulating its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan2">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, the <italic>Fusarium</italic> homolog of Efg1 is FoStuA, a protein required for conidiogenesis in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Ohara1">[30]</xref>. However, <italic>STUA</italic> expression levels in the wild type and in the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant were comparable (data not shown). How Sge1 affects conidiogenesis remains, therefore, to be elucidated.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a common feature of Sge1 and its homologs is the presence of a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site. The functionality of this phosphorylation site has been investigated in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. It was shown that gluconate import under repressing conditions (high glucose concentration) occurred in a protein kinase A deletion mutant. Therefore, it was speculated that Pka1 inhibits Gti1 protein function. However, alteration of the Pka phosphorylation site by replacement of the conserved threonine residue by an alanine did not result in activation of the Gti1 protein and the expected gluconate import was not observed, indicating that either Pka1 does not inhibit Gti1 activity by phosphorylation or that the mutation impairs Gti1 function or its stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Caspari1">[14]</xref>. In Sge1, the same Pka site appears to be required for activity. A stable transformant of <italic>SGE1</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was obtained only after a spontaneous mutation of an arginine into a serine in the potential phosphorylation site, suggesting that expression of wild type <italic>SGE1</italic> in yeast inhibits growth. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains a <italic>SGE1</italic> homolog, <italic>YEL007W</italic>, and this gene has been implicated to play a role in regulation of smooth ER, cell adhesion and budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Li1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zettel1">[33]</xref>. It could be that expression of both genes is lethal to yeast. Introduction of the mutated <italic>SGE1</italic> gene in the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>Fol</italic> failed to restore the pathogenicity defect, confirming that the R66S mutation impairs Sge1 function, possibly due to an effect on phosphorylation. Since there is only a minor increase in <italic>SGE1</italic> expression levels upon <italic>in planta</italic> growth, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation could play a key role in activation of Sge1. Unfortunately, initial attempts to demonstrate phosphorylation by Pka1 of purified Sge1 and Sge1R66S <italic>in vitro</italic> remained inconclusive (data not shown) and will be subject of further investigation.</p>
<p>The loss of effector (<italic>SIX</italic>) gene expression in the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant supports a role of Sge1 as a transcriptional activator controlling the onset of parasitic growth. In <italic>Fol</italic>, these effector genes encode small cysteine rich proteins secreted during colonization of xylem vessels, designated Secreted in xylem (Six) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Houterman1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Rep2">[34]</xref>. <italic>SIX1</italic> is only expressed during <italic>in planta</italic> growth and encodes Avr3, as it is required for <italic>I-3</italic> mediated resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-vanderDoes1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Rep2">[34]</xref>. Six3 is Avr2 and is required for <italic>I-2</italic> mediated resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Houterman3">[25]</xref>. Both Six1/Avr3 and Six3/Avr2 are required for full virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Rep1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Houterman3">[25]</xref>. No function has yet been assigned to Six2 and Six5. Here, we show that, like Six1, Six2 is highly expressed during <italic>in planta</italic>-mimicking growth conditions (co-cultivation with tomato cells), but <italic>SIX3</italic> and <italic>SIX5</italic>, divergently transcribed from the same promoter region, are expressed in synthetic medium. It could be that Sge1 activity under axenic growth conditions is too low for induction of <italic>SIX1</italic> and <italic>SIX2</italic>, but high enough to induce <italic>SIX3</italic> and <italic>SIX5</italic> expression. The increased <italic>SGE1</italic> expression levels during <italic>in planta</italic> growth may then lead to expression of all <italic>SIX</italic> genes. Currently, a <italic>SGE1</italic> over-expression mutant is being generated in order to determine whether increased <italic>SGE1</italic> expression alone can lead to expression of all <italic>SIX</italic> genes under axenic growth conditions. At the moment, it is not known whether Sge1 influences the expression of the <italic>SIX</italic> genes directly or indirectly, for instance through involvement of other (transcription) factors, nor how <italic>SGE1</italic> expression itself is regulated. Preliminary promoter analysis of the <italic>SIX</italic> genes revealed a potential common motif (unpublished data). The role of this motif in <italic>SIX</italic> gene expression and the question whether Sge1 is able to bind DNA and the <italic>SIX</italic> gene promoter regions in particular remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>All the genes tested in the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant (<italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>SIX2</italic>, <italic>SIX3</italic>, and <italic>SIX5</italic>) were found to be dependent on Sge1 for their expression, even during growth in synthetic medium. Although deletion of individual <italic>SIX</italic> genes (<italic>SIX1</italic> or <italic>SIX3</italic>) only leads to a minor reduction in pathogenicity, the loss of expression of all <italic>SIX</italic> genes in the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant may be the primary cause of the complete non-pathogenic phenotype, due to the inability to suppress host defence responses. Still, loss of pathogenicity upon deletion of <italic>SGE1</italic> may not be due to loss of production of effector proteins only. The majority of pathogenicity genes found in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> have pleiotropic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-DiPietro1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Michielse2">[36]</xref>. It is therefore unlikely that expression of these genes is altered in the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant, since this mutant did not display growth defects other than a minor effect in conidiogenesis. One described <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> mutant that is only disturbed in pathogenicity is the <italic>fow2</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Imazaki1">[37]</xref>. Expression of <italic>FOW2</italic> nor that of two other pathogenicity genes, the protein kinase gene <italic>SNF1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-OspinaGiraldo1">[38]</xref> and velvet homolog gene <italic>FOXG_00016</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-LopezBerges1">[39]</xref>, is altered in the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant (unpublished data). However, preliminary results suggest that the expression of the <italic>FTF1</italic> transcription factor gene, implicated to be involved in pathogenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Ramos1">[40]</xref>, seems to be altered in the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant (unpublished data). In addition, secondary metabolite profiling revealed that the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant is reduced in the production of fusaric acid, beauvericin and a number of unknown metabolites compared to the wild type (U. Thrane and C.B. Michielse, unpublished data). High concentrations of fusaric acid may contribute to pathogenicity by reducing host resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Bouizgarne1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Gaumann1">[42]</xref>. Thus, processes implicated in pathogenesis other than <italic>SIX</italic> gene expression are also altered in the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant, supporting the hypothesis that Sge1 plays a central role during parasitic growth. Deletion of the Sge1 homolog in <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, <italic>BC1G_11680</italic>, also leads to a severely reduced pathogenicity phenotype (C.B. Michielse and P. Tudzynski, unpublished data), indicating that the role of Sge1-like proteins in (plant) pathogenic fungi might be conserved.</p>
<p>The regulation of expression of phase specific genes (<italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>SIX2</italic>), and genes involved in virulence (<italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>SIX3</italic>) by Sge1 resembles the functions of Wor1 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and Ryp1 in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>. Wor1 has been shown to bind directly to the upstream region of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000637-Zordan2">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, these target genes all have a large upstream region, indicating that large upstream regions might be a prerequisite for Wor1 binding. Whether this is a common feature shared between Wor1 and Sge1 is still unknown. Future efforts include the identification of additional genes regulated by Sge1 and, eventually, to unravel the network of transcriptional regulators involved in activating the pathogenicity program in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. This will also reveal whether Sge1 indeed plays a master role in this network, like its homologs in dimorphic fungi. Given the striking conservation of Sge1 across fungi, we expect that many features of this network will turn out to be similar in pathogens of both plants and animals. Obviously, since Sge1 homologs are also present in non-pathogenic fungi, this regulatory network must serve a fundamental morphological or physiological switch function and pathogens would have adopted this network for adapting to the host environment. </p>

<p>The <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant is not impaired in carbon source utilization. To analyze carbon utilization of the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant, BIOLOG FF MicroPlates containing in each well a different carbon source were used. A conidial suspension (10<sup>4</sup> conidia in 150 µl) of the wild type or the <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion stain was inoculated in each well and incubated at 25°C. The absorbance of each well at 600 nm was measured with a microtiter plate reader (Packerd Spectra Count) after 4 days of incubation. The ratios were calculated by dividing the measured values of the mutant strain by those of the wild type strain. Only values higher than 1.5 or lower than 0.5 were marked (boxed) as carbon sources on which the <italic>sge1</italic> mutant appeared to display a different growth rate than the wild type strain in this experiment. An additional plate assay containing these carbon sources showed that these differences were not reproducible (data not shown).</p>
