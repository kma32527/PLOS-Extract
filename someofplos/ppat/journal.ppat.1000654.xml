<p>Borna disease virus (BDV) is a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus that employs several unique strategies for gene expression. The shortest transcript of BDV, X/P mRNA, encodes at least three open reading frames (ORFs): upstream ORF (uORF), X, and P in the 5′ to 3′ direction. The X is a negative regulator of viral polymerase activity, while the P phosphoprotein is a necessary cofactor of the polymerase complex, suggesting that the translation of X is controlled rigorously, depending on viral replication. However, the translation mechanism used by the X/P polycistronic mRNA has not been determined in detail. Here we demonstrate that the X/P mRNA autogenously regulates the translation of X via interaction with host factors. Transient transfection of cDNA clones corresponding to the X/P mRNA revealed that the X ORF is translated predominantly by uORF-termination-coupled reinitiation, the efficiency of which is upregulated by expression of P. We found that P may enhance ribosomal reinitiation at the X ORF by inhibition of the interaction of the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 with the 5′ untranslated region of X/P mRNA, via interference with its phosphorylation. Our results not only demonstrate a unique translational control of viral regulatory protein, but also elucidate a previously unknown mechanism of regulation of polycistronic mRNA translation using RNA helicases.</p>

<p>All viruses rely on host cell factors to complete their life cycles. Therefore, the replication strategies of viruses may provide not only the understanding of virus pathogenesis but also useful models to disentangle the complex machinery of host cells. Translation regulation of viral mRNA is a good example of this. Borna disease virus (BDV) is a highly neurotropic RNA virus which is characterized by persistent infection. BDV expresses mRNAs as polycistronic coding transcripts. Among them, the 0.8 kb X/P mRNA encodes at least three open reading frames (ORFs), upstream ORF, X, and P. Although BDV X and P have opposing effects in terms of viral polymerase activity, the translational regulation of X/P polycistronic mRNA has not been elucidated. In this study, we show an ingenious strategy of translational control of viral regulatory protein using host factors. We demonstrate that host RNA helicases, mainly DDX21, can affect ribosomal reinitiation of X via interaction with the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of X/P mRNA and that the downstream P protein autogenously controls the translation of X by interfering with the binding of DDX21 to the 5′ UTR. Our findings uncover not only a unique translational control of viral regulatory protein but also a previously unknown mechanism of translational regulation of polycistronic mRNA using RNA helicases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The control of translation initiation on mRNA is one of the most fundamental processes in the regulation of gene expression. Most eukaryotic mRNAs initiate translation via the so-called “scanning mechanism”, in which the 40S ribosomal subunit binds to the cap structure at the 5′-terminus of mRNA and slides to the proximal AUG codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kozak1">[1]</xref>. In this mechanism, translation initiation from the downstream AUGs is generally inefficient. Thus, the eukaryotic cellular genes are transcribed individually, generating monocistronic mRNAs. On the other hand, many animal viruses produce polycistronic mRNAs and express efficiently functionally different proteins from a single mRNA molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Ryabova1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Flint1">[5]</xref>, suggesting that eukaryotic ribosomes have the potential to initiate the translation of downstream ORFs, under the control of sequence- and/or structure-dependent features of the mRNAs.</p>
<p>Polycistronic coding by mRNAs is a means of coordinating the expression of more than two proteins, which are arranged in tandem or overlapping in a single mRNA molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kozak3">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Ryabova2">[7]</xref>. Analysis of polycistronic mRNAs therefore provides a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ribosomal scanning during mRNA translation. In the leaky scanning mechanism, ribosomes bypass the first start codon when the context is poor and thus reach a start codon further downstream. Some viruses, such as Sendai virus and papillomaviruses, use such mechanisms to enable a multifunctional mRNA to express several proteins with different functions in viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Latorre1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Racine1">[10]</xref>. Another strategy for translation of downstream cistrons from an mRNA is termination/reinitiation, is the major method of translation of prokaryotic and some viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Jackson1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kozak4">[13]</xref>. In this case, ribosomes resume the scanning of the mRNA and reinitiate translation efficiently at a downstream AUG codon, following the termination of an upstream cistron. Although eukaryotic ribosomes are in general unable to reinitiate downstream cistrons on an mRNA, it is also true that about 10 to 30% of eukaryotic mRNAs contain upstream AUG codons (uAUG), which have the capacity to initiate translation of a short upstream ORF (uORF), usually consisting of fewer than 30 codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Churbanov1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>. The uORF-mediated reinitiation of downstream ORFs also has been demonstrated in eukaryotic mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Morris1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Hinnebusch1">[20]</xref>, suggesting that ribosomal termination/reinitiation may be a key mechanism for the regulation of complex gene expression in eukaryotic cells. However, we know little about the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ribosomal initiation in the translation of polycistronic mRNA, especially how eukaryotic viruses use translational regulation in the expression of viral proteins.</p>
<p>Borna disease virus (BDV) is a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> and which is characterized by highly neurotropic and persistent infection. BDV replicates and is transcribed in the cell nucleus and employs several unique strategies for gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Tomonaga1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-delaTorre1">[22]</xref>. One of the most striking characteristics of this virus is that all of the BDV transcripts have polycistronic coding capacity. The shortest, 0.8 kb transcript of BDV, X/P mRNA, encodes at least three ORFs: uORF, X, and P in the 5′ to 3′ direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The X and P ORFs produce major viral proteins, which overlap by 215 nucleotides (nt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Briese1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Cubitt1">[24]</xref>. In contrast, the uORF, whose stop codon overlaps the X translation start codon (X-AUG) by one nt, UG<underline>A</underline>UG, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), encodes an 8 amino acid peptide, the expression of which has not yet been shown in infected cells. BDV X is a negative regulator of viral polymerase activity, while the P phosphoprotein is a necessary cofactor of the polymerase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Schneider1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Perez1">[26]</xref>. Thus, the expression ratio between X and P is critical for viral polymerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Schneider1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch2">[28]</xref>. Previous studies revealed that, despite an optimal sequence context for initiation of X compared to P, translation of X seems to be suppressed at an early stage of viral infection and gradually increases along with the establishment of persistent infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kobayashi1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kobayashi2">[30]</xref>. This finding allows us to hypothesize that translational regulation of such a short polycistronic mRNA may have evolved to control rigorously the ratio between X and P in the infected cell nucleus and is essential for the maintenance of the persistent infection. Recent studies have suggested that the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of X/P mRNA plays a critical role in the translational regulation of X from the polycistronic mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch3">[31]</xref>. However, the translation mechanism used by the X/P polycistronic mRNA has not been determined in detail.</p>

<p>In this study, we demonstrate the autogenous translational regulation of the X/P polycistronic mRNA mediated by host RNA helicases. We show that DDX21, also known as RNA helicase II/Gu, is a regulator of ribosomal reinitiation of X via interaction with the 5′ UTR of X/P mRNA (X/P UTR) and that expression of the downstream P protein may regulate the translation of X by interfering with the binding of DDX21 to the 5′ UTR. Our results provide not only a unique insight into translational control of a viral polycistronic mRNA but also a novel role for RNA helicase in the regulation of ribosomal reinitiation during eukaryotic mRNA translation.</p>

<title>Translational regulation of BDV X from the X/P polycistronic mRNA</title>
<p>To investigate translational regulation of the X/P polycistronic mRNA, we first used a plasmid, pX/Pwt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kobayashi2">[30]</xref>, which encodes a cDNA clone corresponding to the X/P mRNA, and assessed whether this plasmid is able to reproduce the translational regulation of X/P mRNA independently of BDV infection. Upon transfection into COS-7 and OL cells, the plasmid produced efficiently both X and P, and expression of X appeared to increase following the course of time after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), similar to the expression dynamics of X in BDV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kobayashi2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Watanabe1">[32]</xref>. Previous studies revealed that P translocates to the cytoplasm from the nucleus via interaction with X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kobayashi2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Yanai1">[33]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, although the cells transfected with pX/Pwt exhibited the nuclear distribution of P at an early time after transfection, P was shown to move to the cytoplasm of the cells expressing X at 72 h post-transfection (arrows). These observations suggested that the X/P mRNA by itself regulates the translation of X independently of BDV infection and, therefore, that pX/Pwt provides a useful tool to investigate the translational regulation of the polycistronic mRNA.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>The uORF controls translation initiation of the X and P ORFs</title>
<p>To understand the role of the uORF in the translation of the X and P ORFs, we generated a series of mutant plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and examined the expression of X and P by Western blotting at 12 h post-transfection, at which point the expression of X had not yet been upregulated. Mutants with the uAUG replaced by TAG or TTG exhibited markedly increased expression of X compared to the wt plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the involvement of uORF in the translation of X was demonstrated by using a series of deletion mutants of the 5′ UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, the translation of P was reduced to approximately 50% of the wt plasmid (lanes 1 and 2). In addition, changing the initiation codon of X (X-AUG) to TTG in the above uAUG mutants recovered the expression level of P to the equivalent of the wt plasmid (lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, single mutants, which lack only the X ORF, with substitution of the X-AUG by AGC or ACG produced P at levels comparable to the wt plasmid with complete abolition of the expression of X (lanes 5 and 6). These observations suggested that the uAUG is recognized efficiently by scanning ribosomes and that the presence of the uORF seems to downregulate the basal expression level of X, while enhancing the translation efficiency of the P ORF to a level equivalent to an mRNA lacking both the uORF and X ORF.</p>
<p>To determine how translation of the X and P ORFs is initiated from the X/P mRNA, we next introduced mutations into the termination codon of the uORF. A mutant in which the uORF stop codon had been changed to TTA expressed both X and P at equivalent levels to the wt plasmid (lane 7). Furthermore, a 3-nt downstream extension of the uORF termination codon also appeared not to influence the translation of either protein (lane 8). Meanwhile, downstream extension of the uORF to 29 nt reduced the expression of X, but not P, to 70% of the wt level (lane 9). Interestingly, a 164 nt extension of the uORF, so that a stop codon is introduced within the P ORF, showed significant decreases (∼30%) in the expression of both X and P (lane 10). The introduction of premature stop codons within the uORF also reduced the expression level of X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results indicated that the presence of the uORF termination codon in close proximity to the X-AUG seems to be important for efficient translation of the X ORF. Furthermore, termination of the uORF before initiation of the P ORF is required for the expression of P. We also demonstrated that P is unlikely to be expressed by ribosomal shunting or internal ribosome entry site-mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Taken together, both the X and P ORFs were shown to be translated predominantly by ribosomal reinitiation, dependent on uORF termination, and the remainder of the translation (approximately 30%) might be initiated by leaky scanning of upstream start codons.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Translation initiation of the X ORF is upregulated by P</title>
<p>The results shown above suggest that uORF-termination/reinitiation may play a key role in the regulation of translation of X. Therefore, we sought next to investigate the factors that influence ribosomal reinitiation at the X ORF. At first, we examined the role of the peptide predicted to be produced by the uORF. However, we could not detect any effects of this predicted peptide on the translation of the downstream ORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the effect of the protein encoded downstream, P, because this may accumulate in the nucleus in association with the expression of the X/P mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Schwemmle1">[34]</xref>. We generated mutant plasmids, pX/PΔP, in which the initiation codon of P, P-AUG, was substituted by TTG, and puORF-X/PΔP, in which the uORF was fused in-frame to the X ORF in pX/PΔP, and assessed the production of X at 48 h post-transfection, at which point P should have accumulated sufficiently in wt plasmid-transfected cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, translation of X was significantly higher in cells transfected with pX/Pwt than with pX/PΔP. In contrast, initiation of translation of the uORF-X fusion protein appeared not to be affected by deletion of the P-AUG. These results indicated that expression of P upregulates the translation of the X ORF without affecting the ribosomal initiation from the uAUG. To verify this, a plasmid expressing P, pcP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Yanai1">[33]</xref>, was cotransfected with pX/PΔP or puORF-X/PΔP. Interestingly, expression of X, but not the uORF-X fusion protein, was enhanced markedly in a dose-dependent manner by co-expression of P, while the nucleoprotein (N) of BDV failed to enhance the expression of X in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). A ΔP mutant based on a 164-bp uORF-extension plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 10), puORF164ΔP, also upregulated the expression of X in the presence of P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), although the basal expression level of X in the puORF164ΔP is significantly lower than that in pX/PΔP both with or without P. These data suggested that P influences the ribosomal initiation at the X-AUG predominantly by the uORF-termination-coupled reinitiation mechanism, while a leaky scanning mechanism may be involved to some extent in the upregulation of the translation of X by P.</p>

<title>Nuclear factor(s) inhibit translation of the X ORF by binding to the 5′ UTR</title>
<p>We set out to address next the question of how the expression of P can enhance the reinitiation of translation of X. First, we investigated the possibility that P may interact directly with the X/P mRNA and then influence ribosomal reinitiation at the X ORF. We could not demonstrate, however, a direct interaction between P and the X/P mRNA by immunoprecipitation (IP)-RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). Second, it might be possible that P affects the functions of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), such as eIF2α and eIF3. However, an interaction between eIFs and BDV P was not demonstrable in cells transfected with BDV P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Furthermore, expression of eIF2α, 2Bε and 3A, as well as the serine phosphorylation level of eIF2α, appeared not to be changed in cells expressing P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), indicating that the expression of P is unlikely to affect the quantitative and qualitative properties of eIFs.</p>
<p>We therefore considered the possibility that P enhances the translation of X indirectly by interaction with cellular factor(s), which may affect ribosomal reinitiation at the X ORF. To investigate this, we conducted first an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed X/P mRNAs encoding firefly luciferase fused with the X ORF and cellular extracts of OL cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, luciferase activity was markedly reduced in the presence of the nuclear extract, but not the cytoplasmic extract, demonstrating that the nucleus may contain factor(s) that suppress translation initiation from the X-AUG. Interestingly, a mutant X/P RNA, which lacks a 38-mer from the 5′ end of the UTR, retained luciferase activity even in the presence of the nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that nuclear factors may influence the translation of X via interaction with the 5′ UTR. To verify this, we used 48-mer decoy RNAs, which represent the X/P UTR and, as a control, the 5′ UTR of another BDV polycistronic mRNA (M/G UTR). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, incubation with the X/P UTR decoy RNA, but not the M/G UTR control, interfered with the inhibitory effect of the nuclear extract in a dose-dependent manner. We also performed an RNA-electrophoretic mobility shift assay (RNA-EMSA) using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled riboprobes corresponding to the X/P UTR and M/G UTR to determine whether the nuclear extract interacts specifically with the X/P UTR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, we found that the X/P UTR riboprobe forms complexes with the nuclear extract (arrows) and that an excess of cold riboprobe efficiently interferes with complex formation. On the other hand, the M/G UTR probe failed not only to generate clear complexes with the extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) but also to interfere with the complex formation of X/P UTR probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). All these observations suggested the presence of nuclear factors that inhibit the translation of the X ORF via interaction with the 5′ UTR of X/P mRNA.</p>

<title>DDX21 causes structural alteration of the X/P UTR</title>
<p>DDX21 is known to have RNA helicase activity, which may link to RNA-folding and/or -unwinding through its binding directly to target RNA elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-FullerPace1">[38]</xref>.

<p>To determine the effect of DDX21 on X/P UTR structure, we added GST-fused DDX21 to the RNA probe during the equilibration period.

<title>BDV P interferes with the interaction of DDX21 and the X/P UTR</title>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g009">Figure 9A</xref>, incubation with DDX21 reduced the translation not only of X, but also of P, from the X/P mRNA. This result suggested that DDX21 inhibits ribosomal scanning through its binding to the X/P mRNA, resulting in suppression of translation of both X and P. However, the difficulty of the reaction conditions, which must be suitable for <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA binding and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions in the same tube, as well as the possibility that the effect of DDX21 on ribosomal scanning may require its interaction with other UBPs, suggested that this <italic>in vitro</italic> assay is insufficient to determine completely the role of DDX21 in translation. Furthermore, although we generated short-interfering RNAs for UBPs, including DDX21, expression of the siRNAs appeared to induce nonspecific inhibition of the translation of other mRNAs (data not shown). Therefore, we sought to investigate further the effect of DDX21 on the translation of the X ORF by focusing on its interaction with P. P is phosphorylated and acts as a protein kinase substrate, inhibiting the phosphorylation of host proteins to modify their functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Schwemmle2">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Volmer1">[40]</xref>.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of RNA helicases, such as nucleolin, is known to be critical for RNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Yang1">[42]</xref>. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that interference with phosphorylation by P affects the ability of DDX21 to bind to the X/P UTR.

Although the expression levels of the UBPs were unchanged by the expression of P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), the phosphorylation levels of both DDX21 and nucleolin decreased clearly in the cells transfected with wt P, but not with P<sup>S26/28A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).</p>

The binding activities of the tagged proteins from the cells transfected with P<sup>S26/28A</sup> were significantly higher than those with wt P, suggesting that interference with phosphorylation by P decreases the RNA binding activity of DDX21. Therefore, we finally examined whether phosphorylation of P directly affects translation of the X ORF. Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, the expression of X was significantly upregulated in the pX/PΔP-transfected cells in the presence of wt P in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the P<sup>S26/28A</sup> mutant was not able to upregulate the translation of X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that BDV P may inhibit the binding of DDX21 to the 5′ UTR by interfering with its phosphorylation, resulting in the upregulation of the ribosomal reinitiation from the X-AUG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated translational regulation of polycistronic mRNA in a unique animal RNA virus. The BDV X/P polycistronic mRNA encodes three overlapping ORFs within a short, 0.8 kb sequence. We showed that the X and P ORFs are translated predominantly by a reinitiation strategy, following the termination of translation of the uORF, although a leaky scanning mechanism is implicated to some extent in the translational processes. In this study, we employed an RNA polymerase II-controlled vector for expression of the X/P mRNA in transfected cells. We have carefully investigated the expression, as well as the structure, of the transcripts from pX/P plasmid DNAs in each experiment and then verified that our system could recreate the translational regulation of X/P mRNA in BDV-infected cells (data not shown). Currently, two types of reinitiation mechanism have been identified in eukaryotic and viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Ryabova1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kozak2">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kozak3">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Jackson1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Morris1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Sachs1">[18]</xref>. The first type of mRNAs contain short uORFs (&lt;30 codons) upstream of the main ORFs. In this mechanism, the efficiency of reinitiation is controlled by the length of the uORF and by the intercistronic region, an appropriate distance being necessary for the recharging of reinitiation factors, including eIF2 and Met-tRNAiMet, to the ribosomes. Cellular mRNAs such as C/EBP and AdoMetDC, are representative examples of this type of regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Morris1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Calkhoven1">[44]</xref>. In the X/P mRNA, initiation of translation of the P ORF may be mediated by this type of reinitiation mechanism. The scanning ribosomes, which travel continuously on the mRNA after termination of translation of the uORF, must recharge the initiation factors on the intercistronic region between the uORF and P ORF and efficiently initiate translation from the P-AUG. Note that the expression level of P is quite invariant, with or without translation of X, if the uORF is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g002">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the number of ribosomes, which move continuously along the mRNA after uORF termination, is relatively constant on the X/P mRNA. This may be the mechanism underlying the stable and persistent expression of P in infected cells.</p>
<p>The second type of reinitiation mechanism involves mRNAs containing long 5′ ORFs, which usually encode functional proteins. These mRNAs display only short intercistronic distances between the upstream and downstream ORFs, or even may overlap. It has been shown that efficient reinitiation in this mechanism is determined by the stability/mobility of ribosomal complexes to allow reinitiation at the downstream initiation codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Morris1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Sachs1">[18]</xref>. Among viral mRNAs, segment 7 of influenza B virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Horvath1">[45]</xref>, the ORF-2 of the M2 gene of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Ahmadian1">[46]</xref>, and the 3′ terminal ORF (VP2) of feline calicivirus (FCV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Meyers1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Luttermann1">[48]</xref> represent are examples of this type of reinitiation process. Our experiments revealed that reinitiation of the X ORF may be regulated by this type of mechanism, although the uORF encodes only a short and, probably, non-functional peptide. Interestingly, the uORF and X ORF feature an overlapping stop-start codon, UGAUG, as found in other viral polycistronic mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Meyers1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kojima1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Powell1">[50]</xref>. This feature indicates that the overlapping stop-start codon of the X/P mRNA may play a key role in the regulation of translation of the X ORF. Previous studies revealed that genes divided by such an overlapping stop-start codon are expressed predominantly by termination-coupled translation, in which translation of the downstream ORF is initiated by ribosomes which have read the uORF and stalled at the overlapping stop-start codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Luttermann1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poyry1">[51]</xref>. The downstream extension of the termination signal of the uORF in the X/P mRNA significantly reduced the expression of X, suggesting that ribosomal reinitiation from the X-AUG is also carried out by the coupled translation mechanism associated with uORF termination.</p>
<p>The regulation of ribosomal movement/stability around the overlapping stop-start codon must be crucial for controlling the translation of the downstream ORF. The scanning ribosomes, which have not dissociated from the mRNA after stalling at the uORF termination codon, may be reutilized efficiently for the reinitiation of translation of the X ORF. In favor of this hypothesis, we found that host nuclear factors influence ribosomal initiation of the X ORF through interaction with the 5′ UTR and identified RNA helicase complexes, mainly involving DDX21. DDX21 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that localizes to the nucleoli and is involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis or processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-FullerPace1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Henning1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Holmstrom1">[53]</xref>. Although detailed functions of DDX21 have not been elucidated yet, this helicase appears to fold or unwind RNA or ribonucleoprotein structures through regulation of RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-FullerPace1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Henning1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Holmstrom1">[53]</xref>. We found that DDX21 may be a scaffold protein that interacts with the X/P UTR, among the UBPs, and causes structural alteration of the 5′ UTR. Numerous reports have demonstrated that RNA secondary structure contributes to translational control by affecting the constancy of ribosomal scanning on mRNAs or the recognition of initiation signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kozak3">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Meijer1">[54]</xref>. The ribosomes may stack or pass through the initiation codons if secondary structures are formed around the initiation site, leading to enhancement or reduction of the translation efficiency of the ORFs. Therefore, it is conceivable that structural modification of the X/P UTR by DDX21 and the UBPs decreases the ribosomal reinitiation at the X ORF or increases ribosomal dissociation from the mRNA after termination of translation of the uORF, both resulting in the suppression of the translation of the X ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g010">Figure 10</xref>, left arrow). We found that the structural alterations induced by the base-pair changes in a short stem-loop structure within the X/P UTR influence the translation of the X ORF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000654.s008">Figure S8</xref>), supporting this conclusion. On the other hand, in this model the structural change of the X/P UTR should occur in the cytoplasm. Considering DDX21 is mostly a nuclear protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Holmstrom1">[53]</xref>, it is possible that the transient interaction of DDX21 with X/P mRNA in the nucleus is enough to maintain the structure of X/P UTR in the cytoplasm by introducing the UBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g010">Figure 10</xref>, left arrow). Alternatively, DDX21 may be transported to the cytoplasm along with the mRNA in this case.</p>

<title>Possible mechanism of autogenous regulation of BDV polycistronic mRNA translation.</title>
<p>During the early stage of BDV replication, the phosphorylated DDX21 and other UBPs, including nucleolin, interact with the 5′ UTR of X/P mRNA (left arrow). The interaction may facilitate dissociation or impede X-AUG recognition of ribosomes at the overlapping stop-start codon, leading to inefficient termination-coupled reinitiation, by ribosomes which have translated the uORF, at the X ORF. The DDX21 may be dissociated from the 5′ UTR in the cytoplasm. BDV P accumulation in BDV-infected cells may interfere with phosphorylation of DDX21 and UBPs (right arrow), resulting in the detachment of the RNA helicase complex from the 5′ UTR. The free 5′ UTR may increase the reinitiation processes of ribosomes at X-AUG.</p>

<p>We revealed that phosphorylation of DDX21, as well as nucleolin, is inhibited by expression of P. Previous studies demonstrated that hyperphosphorylation of nucleolin increases its RNA binding affinity, whereas dephosphorylation reduces the affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Yang1">[42]</xref>. In this study, the RNA-binding activity of DDX21 was shown to be reduced significantly in cells expressing P. These data suggested that accumulation of P in infected cells blocks interaction of DDX21 with the X/P UTR, resulting in upregulation of translation of the X ORF by promotion of ribosomal reinitiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g010">Figure 10</xref>, right arrow). Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000654-g009">Figure 9D</xref> the P<sup>S26/28A</sup> did not fully recover the binding activity of DDX21 to the X/P UTR. This suggests that hypophosphorylation of DDX21 may be not exclusively involved in the promotion of the translation of X, although the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay based on the transfection may be insensitive for the detection of the binding activity of DDX21 to the 5′ UTR.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that the intranuclear stoichiometry of N and P is important for BDV polymerase activity and that accumulation of P in the nucleus markedly disturbs both viral replication and persistent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Tomonaga1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Geib1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Schneider2">[56]</xref>. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that X binds directly to P and promotes translocation of P to the cytoplasm from the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Kobayashi2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Yanai1">[33]</xref>. Therefore, P-dependent translational regulation of X must be a convenient and effective mechanism for ensuring an optimal level of P in the nucleus. The nuclear accumulation of P above the threshold level upregulates the translation of X, thereby leading to the translocation of P to the cytoplasm. This could keep the amount of P at the optimal level in the nucleus, which is unequivocally necessary for productive replication and/or persistent infection of BDV in the nucleus. A previous study, which demonstrated that the mutations in Ser26 and Ser28 of P aberrantly upregulate the viral polymerase complex activity, and that recombinant BDVs containing the phosphorylation mutations (rBDV-P<sup>S26/28A</sup>) reduce the expression of X in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Schmid1">[43]</xref>, may be consistent with our findings, although the possibility that two amino acid changes inevitably introduced in the X ORF of rBDV-P<sup>S26/28A</sup> affect the expression level of X has remained. In addition, a recent work using a mutant rBDV, which ectopically expresses X under the different transcriptional unit, demonstrated that the expression of X from the mutant virus is not as tightly linked to expression of P as in the wild type BDV, resulting in strong attenuation of the replication of the rBDV in rat brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch4">[57]</xref>. This observation may also support our conclusion that the X/P UTR is not only specifically involved in the regulational expression of X but also essentially controls the balanced expression between X and P in infected cells. Furthermore, a recent work by Poenisch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch3">[31]</xref> showed that recombinant BDVs containing either a premature stop codon in the uORF or mutations ablating the stop codons of the uORF express wild-type like X and P in cultured cells and efficiently replicate in the brains of adult rats. Although this observation may seem to conflict with our findings that the overlapped termination of uORF is critical for the translation reinitiation of X, the recombinant viruses may be able to recover the translation level of X by the expression of other transcription unit, such as a 1.9-kb mRNA, resulting in the efficient replication in infected cells. In fact, Poenisch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000654-Poenisch3">[31]</xref> have demonstrated that the 1.9-kb mRNA not only serves as a template for the synthesis of N but also might be used for the translation of the viral P protein and possibly X, suggesting that the 1.9-kb transcript is a multicistronic mRNA of BDV.</p>
<p>This is the first example, to our knowledge, of autogenous translational regulation of polycistronic mRNA mediated by its own encoding protein and host RNA helicases. The detailed description of the mechanism should provide novel insights into not only an ingenious strategy of virus replication but also the roles of RNA helicases in the translation of eukaryotic mRNAs. Further study remains to be done to discover cellular mRNAs using a similar translation strategy.</p>

Immunoprecipitates were analyzed using the indicated antibodies. CE indicates cell extract. (B) Expression and phosphorylation of eIFs in BDV P-expressed cells. The cells expressing BDV N or P were analyzed by western blotting using the antibodies indicated. The phosphorylation of eIF2α was detected by phosphoserine 51-eIF2α antibody.</p>

<p>The stability of the 5′ UTR controls translation of X ORF. (A) Schematic representation of a short stem-loop (SL) structure in the 5′ UTR. (B) Base-pair changing mutations were introduced within the SL region. The nucleotide substitutions are indicated by black squares. OL cells were transfected with 0.8 µg of wt and SL mutants, and at 48 h post-transfection, cells were subjected to western blotting using anti-BDV P mouse monoclonal and anti-BDV X rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Predicted free energies (kcal/mol) of SL structures are shown. (C) Relative expression of X and P was determined after quantitation of band intensities by ImageJ software. The mean plus S.D. of three independent experiments are shown.</p>
