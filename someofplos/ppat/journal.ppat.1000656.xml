<p>Drosophila C virus (DCV) is a natural pathogen of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and a useful model for studying antiviral defences. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> host is also commonly infected with the widespread endosymbiotic bacteria <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>. When DCV coinfects <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, virus particles accumulate more slowly and virus induced mortality is substantially delayed. Considering that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is estimated to infect up to two-thirds of all insect species, the observed protective effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may extend to a range of both beneficial and pest insects, including insects that vector important viral diseases of humans, animals and plants. Currently, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection has only been described from a limited number of very closely related strains that infect <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We used <italic>D. simulans</italic> and its naturally occurring <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections to test the generality of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection. We generated paired <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines either uninfected or infected with five different <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains. Each paired fly line was challenged with DCV and Flock House virus. Significant antiviral protection was seen for some but not all of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain-fly line combinations tested. In some cases, protection from virus-induced mortality was associated with a delay in virus accumulation, but some <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected flies were tolerant to high titres of DCV. The <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains that did protect occurred at comparatively high density within the flies and were most closely related to the <italic>D. melanogaster Wolbachia</italic> strain <italic>w</italic>Mel. These results indicate that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection is not ubiquitous, a finding that is important for understanding the distribution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus in natural insect populations.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many human, animal and plant viruses are transmitted between hosts by insect vectors. Understanding the processes that control virus infection in insects may facilitate strategies that aim to control the spread of important viral pathogens. Infection of the model insect <italic>Drosophila</italic> with the endosymbiotic bacteria <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can significantly affect the outcome of infection with pathogenic viruses. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is widespread in insects, so here we tested the generality of antiviral protection across diverse strains of the bacteria. We show that some, but not all, strains of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protect flies from pathogenic viruses. These results have implications for proposed strategies utilising <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to control the spread of insect-transmitted viral diseases, such as dengue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses have intricate associations with their hosts. Many viruses have deleterious effects on their host including virus induced pathology, morbidity and mortality. For this reason a suite of antiviral defence responses have evolved. Some of these responses are conserved across different kingdoms, while others are unique to closely related groups of organisms. For example, viruses that infect insects encounter some host defences that are distinctive to invertebrates, such as the peritrophic matrix.</p>
<p>There are a number of motivations for studying antiviral responses in insects. Insects are a useful model for research on innate immune responses, and because of the evolutionary conservation in many of these pathways, this research may lead to an increased understanding of antiviral immunity in mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Huszart1">[1]</xref>). It is also important to understand insect antiviral responses for other reasons. Viruses cause diseases in both pest insect species and beneficial insects. Also insects are involved in the transmission of many viruses that cause serious disease in humans, other animals and plants. Thus there are diverse reasons for wanting to control virus infection in insects and understanding antiviral responses in insects may facilitate strategies to achieve this.</p>
<p>The vinegar fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is an appropriate model for the study of antiviral responses. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellular antiviral responses include both the intrinsic RNAi pathway and inducible immune pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-vanRij1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Wang1">[6]</xref>. In addition to host antiviral defences, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are also protected from RNA viruses when infected by the intracellular bacterium, <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> the interaction between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus has important implications for the outcome of viral infection.</p>
<p>Recent studies on antiviral responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have utilised the most pathogenic of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> viruses, Drosophila C virus (DCV). A member of the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family, DCV is a natural pathogen of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> found in both wild and laboratory fly populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Christian1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Christian2">[10]</xref>. Following injection of DCV into the hemocoel of adult <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> flies typically die within 4–6 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges2">[11]</xref>. In contrast, following injection of DCV into <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected flies, the accumulation of infectious DCV particles is delayed and flies live for 12–14 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection is not limited to DCV. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection also protects flies from mortality induced by a second member of the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family <italic>Cricket paralysis virus</italic> (CrPV) and a member of the <italic>Nodaviridae</italic> family <italic>Flock House virus</italic> (FHV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>. In addition, antiviral protection has been demonstrated in a number of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genetic backgrounds and using closely related <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains that naturally occur in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> namely <italic>w</italic>MelCS and <italic>w</italic>MelPop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are predicted to infect from 20–70% of insect species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Werren1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hilgenboecker1">[14]</xref>, which raises the possibility that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may potentially influence virus infection across a large number of insect species. Bacteria of the genus <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are maternally inherited intracellular symbionts, which are best known for their propensity to manipulate host reproductive systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-ONeill1">[15]</xref>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infect a wide range of arthropods and filarial nematodes and are classified into 7–8 phylogenetic supergroups based on analysis of the sequence of a number of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Lo1">[16]</xref> and references therein). The majority of known <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains that infect insect species belong to either supergroup A or B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Werren2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Zhou1">[18]</xref>. The <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that occur in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are very closely related strains from the Mel clade of supergroup A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Riegler1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is currently not known whether antiviral protection is mediated by diverse strains of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. The fly species, <italic>D. simulans</italic> is infected by up to six strains of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that span across both supergroup A and B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Zhou1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Casiraghi1">[20]</xref>, including three supergroup A strains <italic>w</italic>Au, <italic>w</italic>Ri and <italic>w</italic>Ha and one supergroup B strain <italic>w</italic>No <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Zhou1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Casiraghi1">[20]</xref>. Here we tested whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated protection extends to insects other than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and whether each of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains could protect <italic>D. simulans</italic> from virus infection. Our results show that some, but not all, of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains protected naturally infected <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines from virus-induced mortality.</p>

<title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain <italic>w</italic>Mel can protect <italic>D. simulans</italic> from DCV</title>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains closely related to <italic>w</italic>Mel have previously been shown to protect their natural host <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> from accumulation of DCV particles and DCV-induced mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>.

Me29 flies infected with <italic>w</italic>Mel and the genetically paired population that had been cured of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection were challenged with DCV and mortality was recorded for 15 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For flies both with and without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> the mortality in PBS injected controls was negligible. All DCV injected <italic>w</italic>Mel-free flies died by 8 days post infection (dpi), with a median survival time of 6 days. In contrast, at 15 dpi about 50% of <italic>w</italic>Mel infected flies remained alive. These results indicate that the presence of <italic>w</italic>Mel mediates a significant decrease in DCV induced mortality in Me29 flies.</p>

<p>The accumulation of infectious DCV particles was assayed in Me29 flies with and without <italic>w</italic>Mel. The titre of infectious virus in homogenates from flies collected 2 dpi was significantly different in flies with and without <italic>w</italic>Mel (p&lt;0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The titre of virus in flies without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was estimated to be about 2600-fold greater than in Me29 flies infected with <italic>w</italic>Mel. By 10 dpi there were no surviving <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free flies and the virus titre in the surviving <italic>w</italic>Mel infected flies had increased to a level similar to that of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free flies at 2 dpi. This indicates that the presence of <italic>w</italic>Mel in Me29 flies delays rather than prevents DCV accumulation.</p>

<title><italic>D. simulans Wolbachia</italic> strains and protection from DCV induced mortality</title>
<p><italic>D. simulans</italic> populations are naturally infected with a range of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains. To analyse whether diverse strains could protect from DCV induced mortality we assayed four <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines CO, DSR, DSH and N7NO, which are naturally infected with <italic>w</italic>Au, <italic>w</italic>Ri, <italic>w</italic>Ha and <italic>w</italic>No, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000656-t001">Table 1</xref>). Each of the four fly lines was treated with tetracycline to produce a genetically paired line without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. Flies with and without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were challenged by injection with DCV or mock infected with PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In all cases less than 10% mortality occurred in the mock-infected flies, indicating that in the absence of virus fly survival was stable over the course of the experiments. The CO flies without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> had a median survival time of 8 days following DCV injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Strikingly, the <italic>w</italic>Au-infected CO flies survived DCV infection; more than 90% were alive when the experiment was terminated at 30 dpi. The <italic>w</italic>Ri-infected DSR flies had significantly better survival (p&lt;0.0001) than <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free DSR flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The median survival times following DCV infection were 14 dpi as compared to 6 dpi for flies with and without <italic>w</italic>Ri, respectively. Thus presence of either <italic>w</italic>Au or <italic>w</italic>Ri in <italic>D. simulans</italic> can mitigate DCV-induced mortality.</p>

Experiments were replicated on at least two additional independent cohorts of flies, and the results for all respective replicates of experiments shown in panel A, B and D were similar, however the replicates for panel C varied (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000656.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Not all <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains protected flies from DCV induced mortality. The median survival time of DSH and N7NO flies challenged with DCV was 4 days regardless of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection status for fly lines infected by <italic>w</italic>Ha or <italic>w</italic>No, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). While there was a small but statistically significant (p = 0.001) difference between the survival curves for the DSH flies with and without <italic>w</italic>Ha infection for the representative experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, a significant difference was evident in only 2 out of 4 experiments replicated on independent cohorts of flies (data not shown). Taken together, the minor difference in survival and non-reproducible nature of the result suggests that it is unlikely that this difference is biologically relevant, and as such we interpret the results as indicating that there is no protection against DCV induced mortality in the DSH flies infected with <italic>w</italic>Ha. There was no difference between the survival curves of N7NO flies with and without <italic>w</italic>No infection (p = 0.7). To investigate whether protection would be evident for these lines challenged with reduced amounts of virus we decreased the concentration of DCV injected by 10- or 100-fold. Even at these lower doses of virus no <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection was observed in DSH and N7NO flies (data not shown).</p>

<title>Accumulation of DCV in flies with and without <italic>Wolbachia</italic></title>
<p>DCV accumulation was assayed in each <italic>D. simulans</italic> line in the presence or absence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g003">Figure 3</xref>). DCV infected flies were assayed at 2 dpi and the DCV titre was compared for each fly line with and without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. The average DCV titre was approximately 800-fold lower in CO flies infected with <italic>w</italic>Au compared to paired <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free flies, and an unpaired t test showed this to be a significant difference (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>w</italic>Au infected flies survived DCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), virus continued to accumulate beyond 2 dpi and high titres of DCV were observed in <italic>w</italic>Au-infected flies harvested at both 10 and 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This shows that these flies did not clear the virus infection.

<title><italic>D. simulans Wolbachia</italic> strains and protection from FHV induced mortality</title>
<p>Having identified that some but not all <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains mediate protection against DCV in the <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines tested, we next investigated whether antiviral protection was consistent across different viruses. Flies with and without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were challenged by injection with FHV or mock infected with PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In all cases mortality in the mock-infected control flies was negligible. The CO flies without <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection reached 100% mortality within 7 days of injection with FHV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Similar to challenge with DCV the <italic>w</italic>Au-infected flies survived FHV infection; more than 90% were alive when the experiment was terminated at 24 dpi. The <italic>w</italic>Ri-infected DSR flies had significantly better survival (p&lt;0.0001) than <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free DSR flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The median survival times or DSR flies challenged with FHV were 10 days as compared to 7 days with and without <italic>w</italic>Ri, respectively. Thus median time to death was reduced in both DCV and FHV infections for <italic>w</italic>Ri-infected DSR flies. No virus-induced mortality was observed in <italic>w</italic>Au-infected CO flies for either virus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many insect species are infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, raising the possibility that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection could be a widespread phenomenon. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains vary both between host species and within a host species (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Casiraghi1">[20]</xref>). Naturally occurring <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ubiquitously protect against DCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>, however these strains are very closely related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Riegler1">[19]</xref>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is maternally inherited and therefore has a close association with its host. Using <italic>D. simulans</italic> fly lines that are naturally infected by different <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains we showed that some strains did not mitigate virus-induced mortality. Strains <italic>w</italic>Au and <italic>w</italic>Ri protected the CO and DSH host flies respectively. In contrast, neither <italic>w</italic>Ha nor <italic>w</italic>No protected their host lines from DCV induced mortality. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the <italic>D. simulans Wolbachia</italic> strains <italic>w</italic>Au and <italic>w</italic>Ri are most similar to <italic>w</italic>Mel. Whereas of the phylogenetic supergroup A strains, <italic>w</italic>Ha is the most divergent to <italic>w</italic>Mel, and <italic>w</italic>No belongs to supergroup B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Zhou1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Casiraghi1">[20]</xref>. This may suggest that there is a <italic>Wolbachia</italic> feature involved in antiviral protection, which is conserved among strains more closely related to <italic>w</italic>Mel.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Me29 flies infected by <italic>w</italic>Mel, natural host-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> combinations were used. The <italic>D. simulans Wolbachia</italic> strains are known to be associated with different mitochondrial haplotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Ballard1">[22]</xref> and we did not control for host nuclear genetic background which can have an impact on virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>. As a consequence it is not possible to rule out that intrinsic variability in susceptibility to virus that is linked to the host background has an influence on the outcome of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated protection in our experiments. Indeed there is variation in the time to death of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines used in this study when challenged with DCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g002">Figure 2</xref>), although interestingly these same <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free lines showed similar time to death when challenged with FHV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000656-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Antiviral protection was observed in both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> when infected with <italic>w</italic>Mel. This indicates that antiviral protection mediated by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transferred between different host species.</p>
<p>Since protection against DCV was not seen in all the fly lines infected with the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains, we tested whether there is specificity in protection against different viruses. Infection of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protected the flies from all RNA viruses tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>. Although each of these viruses was a non-enveloped, positive sense RNA virus, the viruses come from a broad spectrum of virus families. Compared to DCV the most divergent of these viruses is FHV. DCV is a member of the <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family and has a single genomic RNA that is not capped but is polyadenylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Christian1">[9]</xref>. The genome is a bicistronic mRNA from which the structural and non-structural polyproteins are translated via internal ribosome entry sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Wilson1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Sasaki1">[25]</xref>. DCV RNA replication occurs on membranes derived from the golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Cherry1">[26]</xref>. In contrast, the nodavirus FHV genome comprises two mRNA sense RNAs which are capped but not polyadenylated and a third subgenomic RNA is synthesised during replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Ball1">[27]</xref>. FHV genome replication occurs on mitochondrial membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Kopek1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Miller1">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, although DCV and FHV have distinct infection cycles the same <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains protected <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines from both DCV and FHV induced mortality. This suggests that the mechanism of protection from virus-induced mortality may be common across diverse viruses, although it is not currently known what the mechanism of viral pathogenesis is in flies infected with either DCV or FHV. It remains to be seen whether the same host-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> combinations that do or do not protect against DCV and FHV have similar outcomes for other viruses, or indeed other types of pathogens.</p>
<p>Concurrent with protection from virus induced mortality in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> was a delay in accumulation of DCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hedges1">[8]</xref>. Here a similar result was seen with <italic>w</italic>Mel protection in <italic>D. simulans</italic>, the amount of infectious virus accumulated 2 dpi was significantly lower in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected flies. By 10 dpi the DCV titre in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected flies was similar to the day 2 titre for <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free flies. It would be tempting to speculate that the resistance to DCV accumulation protects the flies from DCV induced mortality, however, the results observed with the <italic>D. simulans Wolbachia</italic> strains complicate this interpretation. The CO flies infected with <italic>w</italic>Au survived DCV infection beyond 30 dpi, whereas the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free flies were clearly susceptible to DCV-induced mortality. <italic>w</italic>Au infected flies had by 10 dpi accumulated high titres of DCV and the virus titre remained high at 30 dpi. This shows that <italic>w</italic>Au infected flies were tolerant of DCV infection, that is the virus accumulated but did not cause mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Schneider1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, although <italic>w</italic>Ri-infected DSR flies were protected from DCV induced mortality, at 2 dpi there was no difference in virus accumulation in flies with and without <italic>w</italic>Ri. We cannot rule out that accumulation was delayed in <italic>w</italic>Ri-infected flies earlier than 2 dpi.</p>
<p>Taken together our results indicate that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral protection could arise in flies in two ways. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can interfere with the virus infection cycle to delay virus accumulation, that is, it can induce resistance to virus infection in the host. In addition <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection can protect flies from the pathogenesis associated with virus infection, that is, it can increase host tolerance to virus infection. The processes or mechanisms involved in resistance and tolerance may be the same, independent or overlap. Our results show that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains can induce both resistance and tolerance to DCV infection, but importantly prolonged resistance is not a requirement for protection against DCV-induced mortality. These results are consistent with those reported for FHV in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, where there was no difference in FHV accumulation 6 dpi but <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection protected flies from FHV induced mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Teixeira1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The strains of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that mediate antiviral protection were anticipated to be present at higher density in infected flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Giordano1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Sinkins1">[32]</xref>. We confirmed the density of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the particular fly lines used in this study correlated with protection. The density of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was assayed in whole flies as previous assays have shown that in addition to reproductive tissues somatic tissues are commonly infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Dobson1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Ijichi1">[34]</xref>. Further experiments controlling the density of a single strain are required to determine if high <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density is a pre-requisite for antiviral protection.</p>
<p>The mechanisms or processes by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protects the host from virus are not yet understood. The correlation of high bacterial density of the strains that protect the host suggests that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density may be important for antiviral protection. Potentially protection may require a threshold of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density to be exceeded, which would be consistent with protection being a consequence of competition between the two intracellular microbes for limited host resources. Antiviral protection may also be dependent on the distribution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> between tissue or cell types. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have been identified in a range of somatic and reproductive tissues in insects and are known to display variable tissue tropism depending on infecting strain and host combination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Dobson1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Miller2">[35]</xref>. Late in infection DCV is widely distributed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues including both reproductive and somatic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Cherry2">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-LautiHarivel1">[38]</xref>, giving abundant opportunity for overlap with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> distribution. However, little is known about the spread of virus from the initial infection site or if replication of the virus is equivalent in all of the susceptible tissues. It is possible that there are tissues or cell types that are critical to virus replication or pathogenesis and that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated protection occurs by exclusion or regulation of virus in these tissues. In addition, if particular tissues are critical for pathogenesis, tolerance may be a result of protection of those tissues.</p>
<p>The relatively close phylogenetic relationships of the strains that do confer antiviral protection compared to non-protective strains, suggests that other features of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains could determine the outcome of virus infection. Protection via both resistance and tolerance could be induced by modulation of host antiviral responses by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. For example, proteins from the ankyrin family, which can play a role in innate immune pathways, vary considerably both in number and sequence between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Duron1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Klasson1">[42]</xref>. Interestingly defence against bacterial infection in flies via the melanisation response has been shown to involve both resistance and tolerance effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Ayres1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are able to rapidly invade host populations and are often maintained at high prevalence in these populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Turelli1">[44]</xref>. In many cases this is achieved at least in part by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> manipulation of host reproductive systems to increase the prevalence of infected individuals in the host population. For example the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains <italic>w</italic>Ri, <italic>w</italic>Ha and <italic>w</italic>No used in this study induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in <italic>D. simulans,</italic> however <italic>w</italic>Au does not manipulate host reproductive systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Hoffmann1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Turelli2">[48]</xref>. In the absence of strong reproductive parasitism, theory predicts that to be maintained in a host population <italic>Wolbachia</italic> must provide a fitness advantage to the female host (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Brownlie1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Haine1">[50]</xref>). <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated protection from viruses and other pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000656-Panteleev1">[51]</xref> may confer this fitness advantage. It is therefore likely that the interactions between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and viruses such as DCV impact on the distribution of both microbes in insect populations.</p>
