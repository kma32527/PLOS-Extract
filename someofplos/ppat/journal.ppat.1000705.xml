<p>Plus-stranded RNA viruses replicate in infected cells by assembling viral replicase complexes consisting of viral- and host-coded proteins. Previous genome-wide screens with <italic>Tomato bushy stunt</italic> tombusvirus (TBSV) in a yeast model host revealed the involvement of seven ESCRT (<underline>e</underline>ndosomal <underline>s</underline>orting <underline>c</underline>omplexes <underline>r</underline>equired for <underline>t</underline>ransport) proteins in viral replication. In this paper, we show that the expression of dominant negative Vps23p, Vps24p, Snf7p, and Vps4p ESCRT factors inhibited virus replication in the plant host, suggesting that tombusviruses co-opt selected ESCRT proteins for the assembly of the viral replicase complex. We also show that TBSV p33 replication protein interacts with Vps23p ESCRT-I and Bro1p accessory ESCRT factors. The interaction with p33 leads to the recruitment of Vps23p to the peroxisomes, the sites of TBSV replication. The viral replicase showed reduced activity and the minus-stranded viral RNA in the replicase became more accessible to ribonuclease when derived from <italic>vps23Δ</italic> or <italic>vps24Δ</italic> yeast, suggesting that the protection of the viral RNA is compromised within the replicase complex assembled in the absence of ESCRT proteins. The recruitment of ESCRT proteins is needed for the precise assembly of the replicase complex, which might help the virus evade recognition by the host defense surveillance system and/or prevent viral RNA destruction by the gene silencing machinery.</p>

<p>Plus-stranded RNA viruses, which are important pathogens of humans, animals and plants, replicate in infected cells by assembling viral replicase complexes consisting of viral- and host-coded proteins. In this paper, we show that a group of host factors called ESCRT proteins (<underline>e</underline>ndosomal <underline>s</underline>orting <underline>c</underline>omplexes <underline>r</underline>equired for <underline>t</underline>ransport) play important roles in tombusvirus replication. The expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT factors inhibited virus replication in the plant host, suggesting that tombusviruses co-opt selected ESCRT proteins for the assembly of the viral replicase complex. In addition, we show direct interaction between the viral p33 replication protein and Vps23p ESCRT-I and Bro1p accessory ESCRT factors. The interaction with p33 leads to the recruitment of Vps23p to the peroxisomes, the sites of tombusvirus replication. We also showed that the viral RNA within the viral replicase complex became more sensitive to ribonuclease in the absence of ESCRT factors, suggesting that the protection of the viral RNA is compromised within the replicase complex assembled in the absence of ESCRT proteins. Intriguingly, the host ESCRT factors also affect the budding of several enveloped viruses, intracellular transport of proteins and cytokinesis. Overall, this work demonstrates that a plus-stranded RNA virus uses the endosomal sorting pathway in a unique way.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses replicate in the infected cells by assembling viral replicase complexes consisting of viral- and host-coded proteins in combination with the viral RNA template. Although major progress has recently been made in understanding the functions of the viral replication proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and auxiliary replication proteins, the contribution of host proteins is poorly documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Nagy1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Ahlquist1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Noueiry1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Nagy2">[4]</xref>. Genome-wide screens to identify host factors affecting (+)RNA virus infections, such as <italic>Brome mosaic virus</italic> (BMV), <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> (TBSV), West Nile virus and Droshophila virus C, in yeast and animal model hosts led to the identification of host proteins including ribosomal proteins, translation factors, RNA-modifying enzymes, proteins of lipid biosynthesis and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Ahlquist1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Noueiry1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Cherry1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Jiang1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Kushner1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Krishnan1">[9]</xref>. The functions of the majority of the identified host proteins in (+)RNA virus replication have not been fully revealed.</p>
<p>TBSV is a small (+)RNA virus that infects a wide range of host plants. TBSV has recently emerged as a model virus to study virus replication, recombination, and virus - host interactions due to the development of yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) as a model host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Nagy3">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-White1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panaviene1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas2">[13]</xref>. Systematic genome-wide screens covering 95% of yeast genes have led to the identification of over 100 host genes that affected either TBSV replication or recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Jiang1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serviene1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serviene2">[15]</xref>. Moreover, proteomics analysis of the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex revealed the presence of the two viral replication proteins (i.e., p33 and p92<sup>pol</sup>) and 6–10 host proteins in the replicase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>. These host proteins have been shown to bind to the viral RNA and the viral replication proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Nagy1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Wang1">[19]</xref>.

<p>Genome-wide screens for host factors affecting TBSV replication in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Jiang1">[7]</xref> has led to the identification of seven ESCRT proteins involved in multivesicular body (MVB)/endosome pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Perlman1">[26]</xref>. The identified host proteins included Vps23p and Vps28p (ESCRT-I complex), Snf7p and Vps24p (ESCRT-III complex); Doa4p ubiquitin isopeptidase, Did2p having Doa4p-related function; and Vps4p AAA-type ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas1">[5]</xref>. The identification of ESCRT proteins supports the idea that tombusvirus replication could depend on hijacking of ESCRT proteins, thus promoting efforts to test their roles in TBSV replication in this paper. Recruitment of ESCRT proteins for TBSV replication might facilitate the assembly of the replicase complex, including the formation of TBSV-induced spherules and vesicles in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-McCartney1">[27]</xref>. Induction of membranous spherule-like replication structures in infected cells might be common for many plus-stranded RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Kopek1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>The endosome pathway is a major protein-sorting pathway in eukaryotic cells, which down- regulates plasma membrane proteins via endocytosis; and sorts newly synthesized membrane proteins from trans-Golgi vesicles to the endosome, lysosome or the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Slagsvold1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Hurley1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Katzmann1">[31]</xref>. The ESCRT proteins in particular have a major role in sorting of cargo proteins from the endosomal limiting membrane to the lumen via membrane invagination and vesicle formation. Defects in the MVB pathway can cause serious diseases, including cancer, defect in growth control and early embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Slagsvold1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Hurley1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Katzmann1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Bowers1">[32]</xref>. In addition, various viruses, such as enveloped retroviruses (HIV), (+) and (−)RNA viruses (such as filo-, arena-, rhabdo and paramyxoviruses) usurp the MVB pathway by redirecting ESCRT proteins to the plasma membrane, leading to budding and fission of the viral particles from infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Perlman1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The first step in the endosome pathway is the monoubiquitination of cargo proteins, which serves as a signal for proteins to be sorted into membrane microdomains of late endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Hurley1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Katzmann1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Bowers1">[32]</xref>. The ubiquitinated cargo protein is bound by Vps27p (Hrs protein in mammals), which in turn recruits Vps23-containing ESCRT-I complex. Then, the ESCRT-I-complex recruits ESCRT-II complex, which in turn recruits the large ESCRT-III complex. The proposed role of the ESCRT-III complex is grouping the cargo proteins together in the limiting membranes of late endosomes and deforming the membranes that leads to membrane invagination into the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1">[34]</xref>. Then, Vps4p recycles the ESCRT proteins, whereas Doa4p recycles the ubiquitin, leading to budding of multiple small vesicles into the lumen of endosome and to MVB formation. Fusion of the limiting membrane of MVB with the lysosome/vacuole will release the lipid/protein content of MVB into the lysosome, or alternatively, by fusing to the plasma membrane (exocytosis), it releases its content outside the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Hurley1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Katzmann1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Bowers1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that ESCRT proteins previously identified in a genome-wide screen in yeast for affecting TBSV replication are involved in tombusvirus replication in plants. We demonstrate that Vps23p, which is a key ESCRT-I adaptor protein recognizing ubiquitinated cargo proteins, and Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein bind to the TBSV p33 replication protein, which could be critical for p33 replication protein to recruit Vps23p and Bro1p, allowing TBSV to usurp additional ESCRT proteins for replication. We also show that functional ESCRT proteins are needed for optimal replicase activity and protection of the viral RNA template within the tombusvirus replicase from a ribonuclease <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data are consistent with the model that TBSV co-opts ESCRT proteins for its replication.</p>

<title>Inhibition of tombusvirus replication in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> by expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT factors</title>
<p>To test the roles of ESCRT proteins in tombusvirus replication in a plant host, we have expressed dominant negative mutants of selected ESCRT factors in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. This approach has been facilitated by the availability of dominant negative mutants of <italic>ESCRT</italic> genes in mammals and yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Babst1">[35]</xref>. Expression of dominant negative mutants might inhibit the function of the endogenous ESCRT proteins in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, albeit the number of <italic>VPS23</italic> and other <italic>ESCRT</italic> genes are not known in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, whose genome is not yet sequenced completely.</p>
<p>To this end, we cloned ten ESCRT genes, including <italic>AtVPS4, AtVPS24, AtVPS36, AtBRO1,</italic> and two genes for <italic>AtVPS23, AtVPS28,</italic> and <italic>AtSNF7</italic> from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a model plant with known sequence, which is not infected by TBSV or the closely related <italic>Cucumber necrosis virus</italic> (CNV). First, we have made dominant negative mutants of two <italic>AtVPS23</italic> via deletion of the N-terminal UEV (ubiquitin E2 variant) domain. We have found that co-expression of CNV genomic (g)RNA with either <italic>AtVPS23-1</italic>dn or <italic>AtVPS23-2</italic>dn in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves from the constitutive 35S promoter via agroinfiltration led to inhibition of CNV gRNA replication in the infiltrated leaves (down to 25–30%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lanes 5–8). Expression of the wt <italic>AtVPS23-1</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> did not inhibit CNV RNA accumulation when compared with the samples based on agroinfiltration with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lanes 3-4 versus 1-2). Altogether, inhibition of CNV gRNA replication by the dominant negative Vps23p mutants supports the idea that Vps23p play a significant role in tombusvirus replication in a plant host.</p>

<title>Inhibition of tombusvirus RNA accumulation in plants by expression of dominant negative ESCRT mutants.</title>
<p>(A) Expression of N-terminal deletion mutants of the two homologous AtVps23p proteins (lanes 5–8) was done in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, which were co-infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> carrying a plasmid to launch CNV replication from the 35S promoter. The control samples were obtained from leaves expressing no proteins (35S, lanes 1-2) or the full-length AtVps23p (lanes 3–4). Total RNA was extracted from leaves 2.5 days after agroinfiltration. The accumulation of CNV gRNA and subgenomic (sg)RNAs in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves was measured by Northern blotting (Top panel). The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as a loading control and shown in agarose gel stained with ethidium-bromide (Second panel). The bottom two panels show the lack of inhibition of TRV RNA1 accumulation by the expression of the above proteins. TRV infection was launched by agroinfiltration as described above for CNV. (B) Blocking tombusvirus RNA replication in plants by expression of the dominant negative mutant of AtVps4p [named AtVps4p(K<sub>178</sub>A)] (lanes 5–6), and C-terminal deletion mutants of two homologous AtSnf7p and one AtVps24p ESCRT-III proteins. See further details in panel A. (C) The expression of the C-terminal deletion mutants of two homologous AtVps28p and the N-terminal deletion mutants of AtVps36p and AtBro1p ESCRT proteins in plants was done from the constitutive 35S promoter. See further details in panel A.</p>

<p>To test the effect of additional dominant negative mutants in the ESCRT pathway, we generated a dominant negative mutant of <italic>AtVPS4</italic> by changing the highly conserved K178 to A, which has been shown to inhibit the ATPase activity required for disassembly and release of the ESCRT proteins from the endosomal membranes, resulting in strong inhibition of ESCRT functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Babst1">[35]</xref>. We have found that co-expression of CNV with <italic>AtVPS4(K178A)</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves led to dramatic inhibition of CNV gRNA replication in the infiltrated leaves (down to 4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 5–6), whereas expression of the wt <italic>AtVPS4</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> inhibited CNV RNA accumulation only by 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 3–4). In addition, expression of one <italic>AtVPS24</italic> gene and two <italic>AtSNF7</italic> genes with C-terminal deletions, which are known to interfere with proper ESCRT-III functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Zamborlini1">[36]</xref>, inhibited CNV gRNA accumulation by 89–95% in the infiltrated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Expression of <italic>AtBRO1</italic> mutant inhibited CNV replication to a lesser extent in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (by ∼60% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, lanes 11–14), whereas <italic>AtVPS28</italic> and <italic>AtVPS36</italic> mutants did not significantly affect CNV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, lanes 1–10). Altogether, these data support the model that several ESCRT components are involved in tombusvirus replication in plants.</p>
<p>Since the ESCRT proteins are involved in membrane bending/invagination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1">[34]</xref>, it is possible that they are used by tombusviruses during the assembly of the membrane-bound replicase complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Nagy1">[1]</xref>. Accordingly, we observed the formation of the characteristic spherule-like structures (which likely serve as the sites of tombusvirus replication) in reduced number in plants actively replicating TBSV repRNA and expressing the dominant negative mutants <italic>AtVPS4(K178A)</italic> and <italic>AtSNF7-1</italic>, respectively, in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves when compared with the control samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s001">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s004">Protocol S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility that the above inhibitory effect of the ESCRT protein mutants on tombusvirus replication is due to unwanted cytotoxic effect of the expressed ESCRT proteins, we tested the replication of a distantly related RNA virus, <italic>Tobacco rattle virus</italic> (TRV), in similarly treated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. These experiments revealed the lack of inhibition of TRV RNA accumulation in leaves expressing the dominant negative ESCRT proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1A-B</xref>, lower panels), suggesting that the inhibitory effects of these mutant proteins are specific to CNV RNA replication.</p>

<title>Inhibition of <italic>in vitro</italic> tombusvirus replicase activity derived from plants expressing dominant negative mutants of ESCRT factors</title>
<p>To test if the above dominant negative ESCRT mutants affect the activity of the tombusvirus replicase, we isolated the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expressing selected mutated ESCRT proteins. The tombusvirus replication proteins as well as the plus-stranded (+) DI-72 replicon (rep)RNA were expressed from separate expression plasmids in the above plants. The activity of the isolated tombusvirus replicase was tested <italic>in vitro</italic> on the co-purified repRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

<title>Deletion of <italic>VPS23</italic> and other ESCRT factors in yeast reduces the activity of the tombusvirus replicase <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To further test the possible roles of ESCRT proteins in the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex, we used yeast model host, since yeast strains with deletion of ESCRT genes are available.

<title>Increased ribonuclease sensitivity of the tombusvirus replicase from <italic>vps23Δ</italic> or <italic>vps24Δ</italic> yeast</title>

Since our model proposes a role of Vps23p/ESCRT proteins in facilitating the precise assembly of the tombusvirus replicase, we predicted that the tombusvirus replicase might become more sensitive to a ribonuclease if assembled in the absence of an ESCRT factor.

The protected (−)repRNA was only 8% in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The simplest interpretation of the enhanced sensitivity of the (−)repRNA within the viral replicase assembled in the absence of Vps23p or Vps24p is that the viral replicase complex (possibly the whole spherule) assembles less precisely in the absence of recruitment of ESCRT proteins, thus making the viral RNA within the membrane-bound replicase-complex more accessible to a ribonuclease.</p>

<p>The repRNA carrying the miR target sequences (called DI-miR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) accumulated to ∼60% level of the wt repRNA (DI-72) lacking the miR171 target sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 1-2 versus 3–4) in the control plants.

<p>The greatly reduced accumulation of DI-miR repRNA in comparison with DI-72 repRNA can be explained with increased sensitivity of (−)DI-miR RNA to the RNAi machinery when dominant negative ESCRT-III factors are expressed. This, in turn, supports the model that the tombusvirus replicase complexes are assembled less precisely in these plants, making them more accessible to targeted ribonucleases. Overall, these data support the role of ESCRT-III proteins in the precision/quality of viral replicase assembly.</p>

<title>Binding of the p33 replication protein to Vps23p and Bro1p ESCRT proteins</title>
<p>Since the above experiments demonstrated that ESCRT proteins affect the activity of the tombusvirus replicase, we wanted to test if interaction between p33 replication co-factor and the ESCRT proteins occurs that could facilitate the recruitment of ESCRT factors for tombusvirus replication.

The interaction between p33 and either Vps23p or Bro1p was much weaker than the interaction between p33 and Ssa1p, the yeast heat shock protein 70, which is a resident protein in the tombusvirus replicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g005">Fig. 5A–B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Pogany3">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Wang2">[39]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Host factors likely play key roles during the assembly of viral replicases in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Nagy1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Ahlquist1">[2]</xref>. In this work, we have shown that a set of ESCRT proteins is critical for optimal tombusvirus replication and the assembly of the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase complex. We found that over-expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT-III and Vps4p in plants reduced the accumulation of tombusvirus RNA by 10–20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), inhibited the tombusvirus replicase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and reduced the number of spherules formed in infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). This inhibition seems to be specific for tombusviruses, since the distantly related TRV RNA accumulation was not inhibited in these plants. The inhibitory effect on tombusvirus replication by the over-expressed dominant negative ESCRT mutants seems to be direct, since the activity of the tombusvirus replicase was also reduced when isolated from these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Similarly, the activity of the tombusvirus replicase assembled <italic>in vitro</italic> was inhibited when we used the cellular membrane fraction from yeast lacking ESCRT-III or Vps4p proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In addition, the replicase from <italic>vps24Δ</italic> yeast was more sensitive to RNase treatment than the replicase preparation obtained from wt yeast, suggesting that Vps24p ESCRT-III protein is important to assemble RNase-insensitive replicase complexes. Moreover, DI-miR repRNA carrying the miR171 target sequence in the (-)strand RNA replicated poorly in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves expressing dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These data suggest that the (-)strand repRNA in the replication intermediate within the viral replicase complex became more accessible to ribonuclease cleavage when the replicase was assembled in the presence of dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants. Altogether, the presented data support a role for ESCRT-III and Vps4p proteins in the formation of active tombusvirus replicase in plants and in yeast as well. Intriguingly, the role of ESCRT proteins seems to control the quality of the replicase complex assembly, making the viral RNAs within replicase complex more protected from ribonucleases. Based on these observations, we propose that ESCRT proteins help tombusviruses hide from host defense recognition and/or avoid the attack by the host defense during viral replication.</p>
<p>We also show that the recruitment of the ESCRT factors for virus replication is likely driven by interaction between the auxiliary p33 replication cofactor and Vps23p ESCRT-I protein and Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein. These interactions seem to be important for tombusvirus replication in yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) as well as in plant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The interaction between p33 and Vps23p depends on the N-terminal UEV domain in Vps23p and p33, which is monoubiquitinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>. The ubiquitination of p33 may play a role in interaction with Vps23p since it has been shown that Vps23p binds to monoubiquitinated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Hurley1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Carlton1">[41]</xref>. By binding directly to Vps23p or Bro1p, p33 might be able to recruit additional ESCRT factors for tombusvirus replication as discussed below.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other enveloped retroviruses co-opt ESCRT components through direct interaction with Tsg101, the human homologue of Vps23p, and with Alix, a homologue of Bro1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Carlton1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Usami1">[42]</xref>. Tsg101 and Alix play redundant roles in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1">[25]</xref>. HIV gag protein also interacts with Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase protein that could complement Tsg101 or Alix during HIV budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Usami1">[42]</xref>. We have shown previously that p33 can bind to Rsp5p, the yeast homologue of Nedd4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Barajas1">[43]</xref>. This indicates that different viruses seem to exploit the ESCRT proteins through co-opting Vps23p (Tsg101), Bro1p (Alix) and/or Rsp5p (Nedd4) via direct protein-protein interactions. In addition, the ESCRT machinery is also recruited for cell division to separate the daughter cells from the mother cells through the process of cytokinesis. It has ben shown that the midbody resident protein Cep55 interacts with Tsg101 and Alix to recruit additional ESCRT proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Carlton1">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, these cellular processes, such as MVB biogenesis, cytokinesis and HIV virion budding as well as the spherule formation during the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase, are based on topologically similar membrane invaginations (membrane deformation occurring away from the cytosol). Co-opting ESCRT proteins for these processes could be critical, since Snf7p and other ESCRT-III proteins have been shown to be involved in membrane deformation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the interaction of HIV gag protein, Cep55 midbody protein and the tombusvirus p33 replication protein with members of the endosomal pathway shows close parallel and mechanistic similarities, albeit the ESCRT proteins would be used for different processes, such as either virus budding, cytokenesis or viral RNA replication.</p>
<p>Another novel feature is that Vps23p, in the presence of p33 replication co-factor, is shown to re-localize temporarily to the peroxisomal membrane, which represents the place of tombusvirus replicase assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Jonczyk1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas3">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-McCartney1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). After brief recruitment, Vps23p seems to be released from the replicase, because we did not find Vps23p in the highly-purified functional replicase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1">[17]</xref> and it was not co-localized with a peroxisomal marker at latter time points after induction of p33 expression (not shown). The relatively weak interaction between Vps23p and p33 as well as the low percentage of ubiquitinated p33 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref> could be useful during virus replication to optimize the number of Vps23p recruited into each replicase complex. Indeed, based on replicases of other plus-strand RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Kopek1">[28]</xref>, it is predicted that 100-to-200 p33 molecules are likely needed for the formation of a single replicase complex, whereas only a few Vps23p molecules should be recruited temporarily for each replicase complex. In addition, it is likely that Vsp23p and Bro1p and possibly Rsp5p could play complementary roles in recruiting additional ESCRT factors as shown in case of HIV gag for virion budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1">[34]</xref>. Weak interactions between Vps23p - p33 and Bro1p - p33 could help recycling these host proteins that should not be present in the fully assembled replicase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1">[17]</xref>. On the contrary, host factors that are permanent residents in the replicase, such as heat shock protein 70 (the yeast Ssa1p protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1">[17]</xref>, bind more efficiently to p33 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g005">Fig. 5</xref>.</p>
<p>We propose that p33 - Vps23p interaction is important for the optimal assembly of the tombusvirus replicase, because the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase preparation obtained from <italic>vps23Δ</italic> yeast supported low TBSV repRNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Further support on the role of p33 - Vps23p interaction in replicase assembly comes from data obtained using a membrane-enriched fraction containing the viral replicase prepared from <italic>vps23Δ</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The protection of the (-)repRNA associated with the replicase complex is likely due to the repRNA becoming inaccessible as part of the assembled replicase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Pogany2">[23]</xref>. We found that the viral (−)repRNA within the replicase complex obtained from <italic>vps23Δ</italic> yeast was more sensitive to RNase treatment than the replicase preparation obtained from wt yeast. Thus, similar to <italic>vps24Δ</italic> yeast discussed above, the viral replicase, which is located inside the spherules, assembles less precisely in <italic>vps23Δ</italic> than in wt yeast. Overall, these data are compatible with the model that p33 - Vps23p interaction could be important during the replicase assembly process and/or affect the structure of the replicase complexes, which could determine the accessibility of the repRNA to RNases during replication. However, the effect of <italic>VPS23</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) or over-expression of a dominant negative mutant of Vps23 homologue in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) was not as detrimental to virus replication as deletion of ESCRT-III or <italic>VPS4</italic> in yeast or over-expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT-III or Vps4p homologues in plants. This could be due to the redundant roles likely played by Vps23p, Bro1p and possibly Rsp5p in recruitment of ESCRT-III/Vps4p factors, based on the similar redundancy documented for subversion of ESCRT-III/Vps4p by HIV gag's interaction with Tsg101/Alix/Nedd4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Usami1">[42]</xref>. Also, we do not know if the dominant negative mutants were able to block completely the function of every <italic>VPS23</italic> gene, since the number of <italic>VPS23</italic> genes is yet not known in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p>
<p>It is likely that the most important aspect of recruitment of Vps23p and Bro1p for tombusvirus replication is the possibility to co-opt additional ESCRT proteins, including the ESCRT-III factors and Vps4p. Accordingly, the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the tombusvirus replicase is 3-5-fold lower when obtained from plants expressing dominant negative ESCRT-III/Vps4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) or from <italic>vps24Δ, snf7Δ</italic>, or <italic>vps4Δ</italic> yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Since the ESCRT-III factors are involved in grouping the cargo proteins together in the membrane and they have been shown to deform the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1">[34]</xref>, we propose that these proteins could be useful to affect the formation/structures of the spherules for virus RNA replication. Indeed, TBSV replication induces the formation of spherules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-McCartney1">[27]</xref>, which are topologically related to multivesicular bodies (MVB), since both require membrane invagination into the lumen, away from the cytosol. This is opposite to the regular intracellular vesicle formation, which buds into the cytosol. Collectively, usurping a partial set of ESCRT factors by tombusvirus replication proteins might facilitate the optimal formation of active viral replicase complexes within the membranous spherules. Moreover, recruitment of Vps4p AAA ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Babst1">[35]</xref>, could help re-cycling of the ESCRT factors from the replicase after the assembly. Thus, it is possible that the expression of dominant negative mutants of Vps24p and Snf7p ESCRT-III or Vps4p factors inhibit tombusvirus replication in plants by interfering with the proper assembly of the replicase complex. Accordingly, the (−)repRNA located within the viral replicase complex became more accessible to targeted ribonuclease cleavage when the replicase was assembled in the presence of dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants in plant leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the data presented here, we propose that the ESCRT machinery is recruited for tombusvirus replication in a unique way. The first step in recruitment of Vps23p is the ubiquitination of small percentage of p33 (Ub-p33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, step 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>. Then, the ubiquitinated p33 (Ub-p33) binds to the adaptor protein Vps23p (step 2) or to Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein, followed by the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7p and Vps24p. The ESCRT-III proteins could then help the optimal assembly of the replicase complex, facilitate the grouping of p33 molecules together in the membrane and/or promote the formation of viral spherules by deforming the membrane (membrane invagination) (step 3). Then, Doa4p deubiquitination enzyme is predicted to remove ubiquitin from Ub-p33, whereas Vps4p AAA ATPase could recycle the ESCRT proteins (step 4). Altogether, we suggest that these events could promote the optimal and precise assembly of the TBSV replicase complex, resulting in TBSV RNA replication, including (−) and (+)RNA syntheses, in a protected microenvironment and then the regulated release of the progeny (+)RNAs into the cytosol. Importantly, the precisely assembled replicase complex provides protection from recognition by the host defense surveillance system and/or viral RNA destruction by the gene silencing/RNAi machinery. Similar events might also take place in case of other (+)RNA viruses, which are also known to deform membranes and/or form spherules during replication.</p>

<p>Recruitment of Vps23p and/or Bro1p to the peroxisomal membrane by a small fraction of p33 is suggested to lead to the recruitment of additional ESCRT factors. Then, ESCRT-III and Vps4p factors facilitate the precise assembly of the replicase that is needed to prevent the recognition of the virus by the host surveillance system and prevent the destruction of the viral RNAs in the spherule by the host gene silencing machinery.</p>

<p>The split-ubiquitin assay was based on the Dualmembrane kit 3 (Dualsystems biotech). pGAD-BT2-N-His33 has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>. pPR-N-VPS23 and pPR-N-ScUEV were generated by PCR using yeast genomic DNA and primer pairs of #2252/#2046 and #2252/#2292 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s005">Table S1</xref>), respectively. The PCR products were digested with <italic>EcoR</italic>I and <italic>Nhe</italic>I and cloned into pPR-N-RE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>. pPR-C-BRO1 was obtained by PCR using yeast genomic DNA and primers #2053/#2054. The product was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Nhe</italic>I and cloned into pPR-C-RE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> UEV-1 (At3g12400; aa1-186) and UEV-2 (At5g13860; aa1-175) were amplified from genomic DNA with primers #2669/#2670 and #2984/#2985 respectively, digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I and cloned into pPR-N-RE digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Sal</italic>I or <italic>Bgl</italic>II/<italic>Sal</italic>I. <italic>Nicotiana</italic> sp homologues of Vps23-UEV were amplified from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> or <italic>N. tabacum</italic> genomic DNA with primers #2986 and #2987 (based on accession # EB680173; nt 208-750), digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Sal</italic>I and cloned into pPR-N-RE digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II/<italic>Sal</italic>I.</p>
<p>Yeast strain NMY51/vps4Δ::URA3 was created by homologous recombination using the URA3 gene, which was amplified from plasmid pCM189 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Gari1">[54]</xref> with primers #2446 and #2447. The PCR product was transformed into yeast strain NMY51 (Dualsystems) and the recombinants selected on Ura- plates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000705-Li2">[18]</xref>. NMY51 or NMY51/vps4Δ::URA3 were transformed with pGAD-BT2-N-His33 and pPR constructs. Transformed colonies were selected in Trp-/Leu- plates. Yeast colonies were re-suspended in a small volume of water and streaked onto Trp-/Leu-/His-/Ade- plates to score interactions.</p>

<p>Reduced number of tombusvirus-induced spherules in plant cells expressing dominant negative mutants of Snf7-1p and Vps4p. Representative electron microscopic images of portions of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells. Several characteristic virus-induced spherules are marked with arrowheads. These spherules are formed via membrane invagination into peroxisomal or ER-derived membranes. Panels I and II show control samples, which were obtained from leaves either infected with CNV gRNA or agroinfiltrated to express p33/p92/DI-72 repRNA. Panel III shows a magnified portion of panel II to visualize ∼20 individual spherules within the membranous structure. Note that, in addition to the reduced numbers (not shown), the sizes of the spherules are very variable in cells over-expressing the dominant negative Snf7-1p (panel IV) when compared with the control infections (panels I and II). The expression of the dominant negative Vps4p mutant made portions of the cells containing irregular membranes and we could not definitively identify virus-induced spherules (panel VI).</p>

<p>The effect of <italic>bro1Δ</italic> and <italic>vps23Δ</italic> on tombusvirus RNA accumulation in yeast. Total RNA was extracted from yeast 24 hours after inducing repRNA replication. The accumulation of (+)repRNAs was measured by Northern blotting, whereas the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as a loading control (not shown). Each experiment was done at least six times. Overall the result indicates that the lack of <italic>BRO1</italic> and <italic>VPS23</italic> ESCRT genes inhibits repRNA accumulation, suggesting that these genes play a role in tombusvirus replication.</p>
