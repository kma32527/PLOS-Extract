<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Marburg viruses (MARV) and Ebola viruses (EBOV) inhibit interferon (IFN)-α/β signaling but utilize different mechanisms. EBOV inhibits IFN signaling via its VP24 protein which blocks the nuclear accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1. In contrast, MARV infection inhibits IFNα/β induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. MARV infection is now demonstrated to inhibit not only IFNα/β but also IFNγ-induced STAT phosphorylation and to inhibit the IFNα/β and IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of upstream Janus (Jak) family kinases. Surprisingly, the MARV matrix protein VP40, not the MARV VP24 protein, has been identified to antagonize Jak and STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, to inhibit IFNα/β or IFNγ-induced gene expression and to inhibit the induction of an antiviral state by IFNα/β. Global loss of STAT and Jak tyrosine phosphorylation in response to both IFNα/β and IFNγ is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in Jak1-null cells. Consistent with this model, MARV infection and MARV VP40 expression also inhibit the Jak1-dependent, IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. Finally, expression of MARV VP40 is able to prevent the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, STAT1, STAT2 or STAT3 which occurs following over-expression of the Jak1 kinase. In contrast, MARV VP40 does not detectably inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 or Tyk2 when Tyk2 is over-expressed. Mutation of the VP40 late domain, essential for efficient VP40 budding, has no detectable impact on inhibition of IFN signaling. This study shows that MARV inhibits IFN signaling by a mechanism different from that employed by the related EBOV. It identifies a novel function for the MARV VP40 protein and suggests that MARV may globally inhibit Jak1-dependent cytokine signaling.</p>

<p>The closely related members of the filovirus family, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans with high fatality rates. Infected individuals exhibit dysregulated immune responses which appear to result from several factors, including virus-mediated impairment of innate immune responses. Previous studies demonstrated that both MARV and EBOV block the type I interferon-induced Jak-STAT signaling pathway. For EBOV, the viral protein VP24 mediates the inhibitory effects by interfering with the nuclear translocation of activated STAT proteins. Here, we show that MARV uses a distinct mechanism to block IFN signaling pathways. Our data revealed that MARV blocks the phosphorylation of Janus kinases and their target STAT proteins in response to type I and type II interferon and interleukin 6. Surprisingly, the observed inhibition is not achieved by the MARV VP24 protein, but by the matrix protein VP40 which also mediates viral budding. Over-expression studies indicate that MARV VP40 globally antagonizes Jak1-dependent signaling. Further, we show that a MARV VP40 mutant defective for budding retains interferon antagonist function. Our results highlight a basic difference between EBOV and MARV, define a new function for MARV VP40 and reveal new targets for the development of anti-MARV therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Filoviruses, which include the genera <italic>ebolavirus</italic> (EBOV) and <italic>marburgvirus</italic> (MARV), are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses that cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and in non-human primates<bold>.</bold> The ability of filoviruses to counteract innate antiviral responses of the host, particularly the IFNα/β response is thought to promote uncontrolled virus replication <italic>in vivo</italic> and thereby contribute to development of severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Bray1">[1]</xref>. The IFNs, which include IFNα/β and IFNγ, are antiviral cytokines. IFNα/β are members of a family of proteins that interact with the same ubiquitous receptor to trigger innate antiviral defense mechanisms and promote adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Tough1">[2]</xref>. IFNγ also triggers expression of antiviral genes, however, its major function is to modulate adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Biron1">[3]</xref>. IFNα/β signaling results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases Jak1 and Tyk2. These phosphorylate STAT2 and STAT1, which in turn heterodimerize and associate with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a complex that is translocated into the nucleus to activate genes involved in antiviral response (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Platanias1">[4]</xref>). IFNγ signaling activates Jak1 and Jak2, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. This induces STAT1 homodimerization and translocation to the nucleus such that IFNγ dependent gene expression is induced (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Platanias1">[4]</xref>). Of note, Jak1, a kinase involved in multiple cytokine signaling pathways, is critical for both IFNα/β and IFNγ signaling. For example, in cells lacking Jak1, IFNα/β fails to trigger STAT1 or STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation and Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation is greatly reduced or eliminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Muller1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Yang1">[6]</xref>. Similarly, in cells lacking Jak1, IFNγ fails to trigger Jak1, Jak2 or STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Muller1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Rodig1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Guschin1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Filovirus genomes encode seven structural proteins. Four of these proteins, the nucleoprotein (NP), the viral proteins VP35 and VP30, and the L protein are tightly associated with the RNA genome, form the nucleocapsid and mediate replication and transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Mhlberger1">[9]</xref>). Besides its function as polymerase cofactor, VP35 acts as an inhibitor of antiviral pathways (see below). Two of the filovirus structural proteins are matrix proteins, VP40, the functional equivalent of the matrix (M) proteins of other non-segmented negative-stand RNA viruses, and the minor matrix protein VP24 that is unique to filoviruses. As a peripheral membrane protein VP40 is located at the inner side of the virion membrane. It is critical for viral budding and interacts with cellular proteins involved in vesicle formation to facilitate virus release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Licata1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Noda1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Yamayoshi1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kolesnikova1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Timmins1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Swenson1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Bavari1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-MartinSerrano1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Urata1">[18]</xref>. The minor matrix protein VP24 is involved in nucleocapsid formation and assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Bamberg1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Han1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Licata2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Hoenen1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Noda2">[23]</xref>. EBOV VP24 plays a crucial role in host tropism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Volchkov1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Ebihara1">[25]</xref> and is able to counteract the type I IFN response (see below). Filoviruses possess a single surface protein, the type I transmembrane glycoprotein GP that mediates attachment to target cells and virus entry. Besides EBOV VP35 and VP24, EBOV GP is the third filoviral protein known to interfere with antiviral cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kaletsky1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among filoviruses, IFN evasion strategies have been most thoroughly explored for EBOVs. The EBOV species <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (ZEBOV) suppresses production of IFNα/β and inhibits cellular responses to IFNα/β and IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Gupta1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Harcourt1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Hartman1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kash1">[30]</xref>. Inhibition of IFNα/β production appears to be mediated by the VP35 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Basler1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Hartman2">[32]</xref>, whereas cellular responses to IFNα/β and IFNγ are blocked by the EBOV VP24 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid2">[34]</xref>. EBOV VP24 prevents the IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1. This results in inhibition of IFN-induced gene expression and blocks the antiviral effects of IFNs. The inhibition of STAT1 nuclear accumulation is mediated by interaction of VP24 with NPI-1 subfamily of karyopherin α proteins that normally transport dimerized phospho-STAT1 to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid2">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>MARVs have a genome organization similar to EBOVs, but they are phylogenetically distinct from EBOVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Sanchez1">[35]</xref>. Despite their similar genomic organization, morphology and the similarity of MARV versus EBOV induced disease, several biological differences between the viruses have been noted, such as differences in their transcription strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Mhlberger2">[36]</xref>, in the structure of their replication promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Enterlein1">[37]</xref>, the use of mRNA editing to express the surface glycoprotein by EBOVs but not MARVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Sanchez2">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Volchkov2">[39]</xref> and differences in the protein requirement for nucleocapsid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Huang1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kolesnikova2">[41]</xref>. In terms of the capacity of EBOV and MARV to counteract host IFN responses, microarray analyses suggest that ZEBOV and MARV each efficiently suppress host IFN responses, and each virus effectively inhibits cellular responses to exogenously added IFNα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kash1">[30]</xref>. However, examination of the phosphorylation status of STAT1 following addition of IFNα to infected cells revealed an intriguing difference between ZEBOV and MARV. While ZEBOV did not inhibit the IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, MARV infection resulted in an inhibition of both STAT1 and STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kash1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The present study demonstrates that MARV infection inhibits not only IFNα/β but also IFNγ and Jak1-dependent IL-6 signaling. Further, the MARV protein mediating these effects has been identified. We show that expression of the MARV matrix protein VP40 is sufficient to block IFN and IL-6 signaling pathways. Experiments in which either Jak1 or Tyk2 are over-expressed suggest that MARV VP40 targets Jak1 function. These observations identify an important difference in the biology of MARV and EBOVs, identify a novel function for a negative-strand RNA virus matrix protein and suggest that MARV may inhibit multiple Jak1-dependent cytokine signaling pathways.</p>

<title>MARV infection prevents IFN-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins</title>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 is strongly reduced in MARV- but not in ZEBOV-infected Huh-7 cells treated with IFNα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kash1">[30]</xref>. To confirm this observation and to determine whether MARV inhibition extends to other Jak-STAT signaling pathways, the impact of MARV infection on IFNα-induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and on IFNγ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was compared. As reported, MARV but not EBOV inhibited phosphorylation of endogenous STAT1 and STAT2 induced by IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). MARV also inhibited IFNγ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas EBOV did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). For these studies, immunofluorescence analyses were performed in parallel to confirm that more than 95% of cells were infected with either virus (data not shown). These data show that MARV not only blocks type I but also type II IFN signaling by interfering with an early step of the Jak-STAT signaling cascade.</p>

<p>Huh-7 cells were infected with MARV or ZEBOV at an MOI of 5 or mock-infected (Mock).

<p>Since previous studies indicated that the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 is inhibited in EBOV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid2">[34]</xref>, we examined the cellular localization of STAT1 in MARV-infected cells by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). As expected, STAT1 was translocated into the nucleus in non-infected cells treated with IFNα (left panels, red staining), whereas IFNα-induced translocation was inhibited in ZEBOV-infected cells (right panels, infected cells shown in green). Please note that a single non-infected cell in the ZEBOV infection panel showed nuclear accumulation of STAT1. Nuclear translocation of STAT1 was also blocked in MARV-infected cells treated with IFNα (middle panels).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results highlight a fundamental difference in the mechanisms by which MARV and EBOV counteract innate immune responses.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases is inhibited in MARV-infected cells</title>
<p>Since our data suggested that MARV infection leads to the inhibition of IFN-induced STAT phosphorylation, we next sought to determine the activation status of Jak1 and Tyk2, the Janus kinases involved in IFNα-induced phosphorylation of STAT proteins. Huh-7 cells were infected with MARV or ZEBOV, treated with IFNα and the phosphorylation state of endogenous Jak1 and Tyk2 was analyzed by western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, both kinases were phosphorylated in ZEBOV-infected cells in response to IFNα, although phosphorylation of Jak1 was less pronounced compared to non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, compare lane 2 and 4). However, only background levels of Jak1 phosphorylation were detectable and Tyk2 phosphorylation was completely blocked in MARV-infected cells treated with IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lane 6). From this we concluded that the inhibition of the Jak-STAT-signaling pathway by MARV takes place upstream of Jak phosphorylation or directly at the Janus kinases.</p>

<title>IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases is inhibited in MARV- but not in EBOV-infected cells.</title>
<p>This inhibition occurs early in infection and is insensitive to PTP inhibitors. (A) Huh-7 cells were infected with MARV or ZEBOV at an MOI of 5 or left uninfected. At 24 h p.i., cells were treated with 1000 IU/ml of IFNα for 20 min where indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies directed against total protein and phosphorylated forms of Jak1 and Tyk2. (B) Huh-7 cells were infected with MARV or UV-inactivated MARV at an MOI of 5 or left uninfected. 20 min before lysis (24 h p.i.), cells were treated with 2000 IU/ml of IFNα and harvested at the indicated time points. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies directed against total protein and phosphorylated forms of Tyk2. (C) Huh-7 cells were infected with MARV at an MOI of 5. The cells were treated with DMSO (D) or the phosphatase inhibitors sodium orthovanadate (SO) or PTP1B inhibitor (PTP) prior to IFN treatment (24 h p.i., 2000 IU/ml IFNα for 20 min). Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies directed against total protein and phosphorylated forms of Tyk2. Note that the cuts in the films excised samples irrelevant to this study.</p>

<p>As part of the innate immune response, the Jak-STAT signaling cascade acts as a first line of defense to prevent viral infections. Therefore, we determined at which time point of the MARV replication cycle the observed inhibition of Jak activation occurs. Further, we asked whether live virus and viral replication are needed to antagonize IFN signaling. Huh-7 cells were infected with live MARV or UV-inactivated MARV, treated with IFNα, harvested at different time points post-infection (p.i.) and subjected to western blot analysis to determine the phosphorylation state of Tyk2. While Tyk2 was still efficiently phosphorylated in MARV-infected and IFN-treated cells at 1 hour and 2.5 hours p.i., respectively, near complete inhibition of Tyk2 phosphorylation was achieved at 4 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). A single MARV replication cycle takes approximately 21 hours in Vero E6 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Mhlberger3">[42]</xref>. Thus, it can be concluded that the observed antagonistic effect occurs early in infection. Additionally, since MARV infection did not lead to the inhibition of Tyk2 phosphorylation at time points earlier than 4 hours p.i., it is assumed that binding of MARV to its receptor does not trigger its IFN antagonist function. Interestingly, infection of cells with UV-inactivated MARV prior to IFNα treatment did not lead to the inhibition of Tyk2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), supporting the assumption that receptor binding does not play a role in the MARV-specific inhibition of the IFN signaling cascades. In addition, these data indicate that intracellular virus replication is required for the observed antagonistic effects.</p>
<p>To examine whether MARV indirectly inhibits Jak1 phosphorylation via protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), we treated MARV-infected and IFN-treated cells with different PTP inhibitors prior to IFNα stimulation. Besides an inhibitor against PTP1B, which specifically dephosphorylates Tyk2 and Jak2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Wiesmann1">[43]</xref>, we tested the broad acting phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate. Our results show that even in the presence of PTP inhibitors Tyk2 phosphorylation was inhibited in MARV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that the observed inhibitory effects do not depend on active cellular PTPs.</p>

<title>MARV matrix protein VP40 acts as an IFN antagonist</title>
<p>To identify the viral protein mediating the antagonistic effects observed in MARV-infected cells, individual EBOV or MARV proteins were assessed for their capacity to counteract the antiviral effects of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Vero cells were transfected with expression plasmids; one day post-transfection the cells were either mock-treated or treated overnight with IFNβ, and the cells were then infected with a Newcastle disease virus that expresses GFP (NDV-GFP). Since NDV is IFN-sensitive, GFP expression in these cells provides a measure of virus replication, and suppression of GFP expression provides a read-out for the antiviral effects of IFNβ. While empty vector (pCAGGS)-transfected, mock-treated cells permitted NDV-GFP replication, IFNβ-treated, empty vector-transfected cells, in contrast, greatly suppressed GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, panels 1 and 2). As previously described, expression of Nipah virus W protein, or ZEBOV VP24, known inhibitors of IFN signaling, rescued replication of NDV-GFP in IFNβ-treated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Shaw1">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, panel 3 and 4). Surprisingly, MARV VP24 did not detectably counteract the antiviral effects of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, panel 6). In fact, the only MARV protein tested that clearly permitted NDV-GFP replication in IFNβ-treated cells was the major matrix protein VP40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, panel 9).

Since it has been shown by Brzozka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Brzozka1">[45]</xref> that rabies virus phosphoprotein (P) efficiently blocks the nuclear translocation of STAT2 into the nucleus, P was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Cells transfected with empty vector served as a negative control. While expression of either MARV VP40 or ZEBOV VP24 led to a significant inhibition of STAT2 accumulation in the nucleus, none of the other tested filoviral proteins including ZEBOV VP40 and MARV VP24 was able to inhibit nuclear translocation of STAT2 in response to IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>Next, we analyzed the impact of MARV VP40 on the phosphorylation of Janus kinases in cells treated with IFNα/β or IFNγ. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmids that express LGTV NS5, ZEBOV VP24, ZEBOV VP40, MARV VP24 or MARV VP40, treated with IFNα/β and analyzed for phosphorylation of endogenous Jak1 and Tyk2. MARV VP40 inhibited the IFNα/β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Interestingly, none of the other expressed proteins including LGTV NS5 detectably blocked Jak1 phosphorylation. Although Tyk2 phosphorylation was also reduced by LGTV NS5 and to a lesser extent by ZEBOV VP24, this reduction was less pronounced compared to cells expressing MARV VP40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Similarly, levels of phosphorylated endogenous STAT1 were decreased in the presence of MARV VP40. However, the total levels of HA-Tyk2 were also decreased in the presence of MARV VP40 in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Therefore the bands were quantified by densitometry and the ratio of phosphorylated Tyk2 to total Tyk2 was calculated for each sample. In all samples the ratios were in the range of 0.85 to 1.05, suggesting that the decreased levels of phospho-Tyk2 were due to reduced total levels of Tyk2 (data not shown).

<p>Previous studies have shown that both members of the filovirus family, MARV and EBOV, impair cellular responses to IFNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kash1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Jahrling1">[50]</xref>. While ZEBOV blocks the nuclear accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid2">[34]</xref>, the present study demonstrates that MARV has evolved a different mechanism to counteract IFN signaling. We show that MARV inhibits the IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of not only STAT1 and STAT2 but also of the upstream kinases Jak1 and Tyk2. This inhibition prevents the IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of STAT1 and STAT2. Further, MARV infection inhibits the IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. The inhibition extends even beyond the IFNα/β and IFNγ signaling pathways to another Jak1 dependent signaling pathway, the IL-6 pathway, where the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was inhibited. Significantly, the study also identifies a single MARV protein, the matrix protein VP40, sufficient to mediate these inhibitory effects, whereas ZEBOV-induced inhibition of IFN signaling is mediated by VP24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid1">[33]</xref>. Emphasizing the specificity of the inhibitory function for MARV VP40, neither ZEBOV infection nor ZEBOV VP40 expression impairs Jak or STAT phosphorylation. Moreover, MARV VP24, including VP24s corresponding to the Musoke strain and the Angola strain, which caused an outbreak with a very high fatality rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Towner1">[51]</xref>, did not detectably inhibit IFNα/β-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> and data not shown). Musoke MARV VP24 was also unable to inhibit IFNα/β-, IFNγ- or IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Jaks or STATs.</p>
<p>The striking differences in the strategies employed by filoviruses to block IFN signaling may have been driven by the different evolutionary paths taken by Marburg and Ebola viruses. Bayesian analysis of genome sequence differences indicates that Ebola and Marburg viruses diverged from a common ancestor several thousands of years ago (S.T. Nichol, personal communication). Evolution in and adaptation to different host species might account for different immune evasion mechanisms. So far, there is only limited information available about the natural host spectrum of filoviruses. Various species of African fruit bats were found to be seropositive or RT-PCR-positive for EBOV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Leroy1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Pourrut1">[53]</xref>, however, as yet Ebola viruses have not been isolated from bats. In contrast, Towner and colleagues reported the successful isolation of MARV from the Egyptian fruit bat <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Towner2">[54]</xref>. Since this bat species is also discussed as a potential reservoir for EBOV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Pourrut1">[53]</xref>, it remains unclear if Marburg and Ebola viruses differ in their host tropism. Recently, the Asian EBOV species <italic>Reston ebolavirus</italic> (REBOV), which is thought to be non-pathogenic for humans, was isolated from pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Barrette1">[55]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the REBOV clade has evolved separately from the African Ebola viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Barrette1">[55]</xref>. Interestingly, REBOV VP24 was also shown to interfere with the nuclear translocation of STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Reid2">[34]</xref>, indicating that the ability of VP24 to counteract IFN signaling was evolved among Ebola viruses prior to the separation of the African and Asian species. Notably, VP24 contributes to the host specificity of ZEBOV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Volchkov1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Ebihara1">[25]</xref>. Whether VP40 plays a similar role in MARV host tropism has yet to be determined; however, it is intriguing that a mouse-adapted MARV acquired amino acid changes in VP40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Panchal1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>The effects of MARV infection and MARV VP40 expression on IFNα/β, IFNγ and IL-6 signaling mirror the impact of Jak1 knock-out on these pathways. In cells lacking Jak1, no STAT or Jak phosphorylation was observed upon IFNα/β or IFNγ treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Muller1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, the absence of Jak1 profoundly affects the IL-6 pathway as elimination of Jak1 was sufficient to fully abrogate any detectable phospho-STAT1 and greatly reduce phospho-STAT3 following IL-6 addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Rodig1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Guschin1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, MARV infection and individual expression of MARV VP40 closely mirror this phenotype, where following IL-6 addition, phospho-STAT1 was undetectable but residual phospho-STAT3 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Further studies will reveal to what extent the observed residual STAT3 phosphorylation may mediate IL-6 signaling.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with a model in which MARV VP40 targets Jak1 function, either directly or indirectly, although the possibility remains that MARV VP40 can also impair signaling of other Jak family kinases. A possible indirect mechanism of the observed inhibition could be a modulating effect of MARV VP40 on PTPs targeting Jak kinases. Recently, it has been reported that transgenic mice with reduced expression of the PTP CD45 were protected against lethal EBOV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Panchal1">[56]</xref>. Interestingly, CD45 acts as a negative regulator of Jak1 in cells of hematopoietic origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Xu1">[57]</xref>. However, our data suggest that PTPs are not involved in MARV-mediated inhibition of Jak1 signaling in cells of non-hematopoietic origin. Therefore, it is of interest to further extend those studies and to analyze Jak/STAT signaling in human hematopoietic cells in the context of MARV and EBOV infection.</p>
<p>The observed inhibitory effects of MARV VP40 on both IFNα/β-induced gene expression and the antiviral effects of IFNβ may explain the capacity of MARV to prevent cellular responses to exogenously-added IFNα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kash1">[30]</xref>. In this respect, MARV VP40 appears to serve the same purpose as the EBOV VP24 proteins which also counteract IFNα/β signaling. It is likely that counteracting IFNα/β signaling has a significant impact on viral pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, because, despite the presence of viral VP35 proteins that suppress IFNα/β production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Basler1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Basler2">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Cardenas1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Prins1">[60]</xref>, filovirus replication <italic>in vivo</italic> results in significant IFNα production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Hensley1">[61]</xref>. The presence of IFNα/β signaling inhibitors likely also contributes to the relative insensitivity of filoviruses to IFNα/β as an antiviral therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Jahrling1">[50]</xref>. IFNγ also has antiviral properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Lanford1">[62]</xref>, however, suppression of IFNγ signaling may also modulate adaptive immune responses to infection. For example, human cytomegalovirus down-regulates Jak1 expression in a proteasome-dependent manner, and although a specific viral gene product that mediates this effect has not been defined, this function prevents the IFNγ-induced upregulation of MHC class II on infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Miller1">[63]</xref>. Another viral protein that interacts with Jak1 and blocks the type I IFN signaling pathway is the measles virus V protein, but the consequence of this function for adaptive immunity has not been defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Caignard1">[64]</xref>. The possible impact of MARV infection and MARV VP40 expression on other cytokine signaling pathways involving Jak1 remains to be defined. Given the prominent role of Jak1 in numerous pathways, the impact of MARV VP40 on cytokine signaling may be quite broad.</p>
<p>Filovirus VP40 proteins are matrix proteins sufficient to drive budding of virus-like particles, and they are thought to be the driving force for the budding of infectious virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Noda1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kolesnikova1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Urata1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Harty1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Ruigrok1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kolesnikova3">[67]</xref>. The finding that MARV VP40 also serves as an inhibitor of IFN signaling is surprising and novel. Another example of a negative-strand RNA virus matrix protein that inhibits IFN responses is the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) matrix protein (M). VSV M inhibits innate immune responses, including IFNβ production, by a mechanism different from MARV VP40, inhibiting host cell transcription as well as nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of cellular mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Ahmed1">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Ferran1">[69]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Black1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Her1">[71]</xref>.</p>
<p>Host factors that interact with filovirus VP40 proteins have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Timmins1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Urata1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Harty1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Yasuda1">[72]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-McCarthy1">[73]</xref>. The most fully characterized interactions occur via the VP40 late domain which facilitates budding and release of virus particles. ZEBOV VP40 possesses two late domains, a PTAP motif and an overlapping PXXP motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Noda1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Harty1">[65]</xref>. These mediate interaction with Tsg101, Nedd4, and Rsp5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Timmins1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Harty1">[65]</xref>. MARV VP40 possesses a single PPPY motif that allows interaction with Tsg101 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Urata1">[18]</xref>. To address the potential role of these well-characterized motifs in MARV VP40 inhibition of Jak/STAT signaling, a 16-PPPY-19 to 16-AAAA-19 mutant MARV VP40 was generated. As previously described, this mutation severely impaired MARV VP40 budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Urata1">[18]</xref>. Yet this mutation had no detectable impact on MARV VP40 inhibition of IFNα/β signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000721-g008">Fig. 8B and C</xref>). Therefore, the late domain is dispensable for the IFN signaling function of VP40, and the budding and signaling functions of MARV VP40 appear to be separable. Of note, IFN-induced cellular inhibitors of filovirus VP40 budding have recently been described. These include the IFN stimulated ISG15 and tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kaletsky1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Sakuma1">[74]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Okumura1">[75]</xref>. ISG15 is an IFN-induced protein which inhibits budding of EBOV VP40. ISG15 inhibits the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, which interacts with EBOV VP40 through the PPXY motif to promote VP40 ubiquitination and budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Harty1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Okumura1">[75]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Malakhova1">[76]</xref>. Tetherin is constitutively-expressed in some cell types but is also IFN-inducible. Its expression can prevent release of VLPs produced following expression of EBOV or MARV VP40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kaletsky1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Sakuma1">[74]</xref>. Co-expression of EBOV GP has been shown capable of counteracting this antiviral function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Kaletsky1">[26]</xref>. Whether MARV GP can also inhibit tetherin has not yet been addressed; however, because MARV VP40 can inhibit IFN signaling, it appears to have a built-in capacity to resist IFN-induced mechanisms that target viral budding.</p>
<p>This study has identified an important difference in the biology of MARV and EBOV, defined a novel function for the MARV VP40 matrix protein and suggests that MARV may inhibit multiple Jak1-dependent cytokine signaling pathways. Future studies will determine whether the different means by which EBOV and MARV counteract cell signaling pathways result in significant differences in the pathologenesis of these viruses. Determining the molecular mechanisms by which MARV VP40 blocks signaling may facilitate development of new anti-MARV therapies.</p>

At 48 hours post-transfection, cell culture supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 200×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion in NTE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) at 160,000×<italic>g</italic> for 2 hours at 4°C. Supernatants were aspirated and the pellets containing the virus-like particles (VLPs) were resuspended in NTE buffer. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). VLPs and lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by western blotting, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000721-Ciancanelli1">[80]</xref>.</p>
