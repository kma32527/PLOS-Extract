<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a leading cause of congenital birth defects, as well as a cause for ocular and neurological diseases in humans. Its cytoskeleton is essential for parasite replication and invasion and contains many unique structures that are potential drug targets. Therefore, the biogenesis of the cytoskeletal structure of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is not only important for its pathogenesis, but also of interest to cell biology in general. Previously, we and others identified a new <italic>T. gondii</italic> cytoskeletal protein, TgMORN1, which is recruited to the basal complex at the very beginning of daughter formation. However, its function remained largely unknown. In this study, we generated a knock-out mutant of TgMORN1 (<italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic>) using a Cre-LoxP based approach. We found that the structure of the basal complex was grossly affected in <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites, which also displayed defects in cytokinesis. Moreover, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites showed significant growth impairment <italic>in vitro</italic>, and this translated into greatly attenuated virulence in mice. Therefore, our results demonstrate that TgMORN1 is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the parasite posterior end, and provide direct evidence that cytoskeleton integrity is essential for parasite virulence and pathogenesis.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The disease toxoplasmosis is the result of uncontrolled growth and proliferation of the intracellular parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, which is pathogenic for most warm-blooded animals. If growth of the parasite is blocked, then it does not cause disease, even though it may persist in the host as a chronic infection. Proper assembly of the cytoskeleton of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is known to be essential for its growth, and consequently required for virulence. In this study, we investigated the function of a novel cytoskeletal protein, TgMORN1, in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. TgMORN1 is a major component of the basal complex, a novel cytoskeletal assembly located at the posterior end of the parasite. We found that TgMORN1 is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the parasite posterior end and is important for ensuring successful separation of daughters at late stage of parasite replication. In addition, infection with parasites deficient in TgMORN1 not only failed to kill mice but also provided protective immunity against a lethal challenge infection, indicating the importance of TgMORN1 in <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is one of the most successful human parasites, infecting ∼30% of the total world population. It is the most common cause of congenital neurological defects in humans, and an agent for devastating opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. <italic>T. gondii</italic> is also a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, which contains thousands of species of obligate intracellular parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Levine1">[1]</xref>. Like <italic>T. gondii</italic>, many of these parasites (such as <italic>Plasmodium spps</italic>, the causative agents for malaria) pose serious health threats to human beings. The damage caused by these parasites absolutely depends on their ability to replicate. For instance, <italic>T. gondii</italic> causes severe lytic cerebral and ocular lesions when the immune system fails to control its proliferation. Massive proliferation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites often results in hemolytic anemia, parasite-mediated destruction of red blood cell; and cerebral malaria, caused by parasite-engorged erythrocytes clogging blood vessels in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Zuckerman1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Ehrhardt1">[4]</xref>. An understanding of the growth and division of these parasites is therefore crucial for developing effective therapies. The <italic>T. gondii</italic> cytoskeleton provides the framework for organellar partitioning, maintains cell shape and drives invasion, thus is essential for parasite survival and proliferation. Furthermore, it is rich in structural features that are unique to the parasites, thus highly attractive potential drug targets for designing parasite specific drugs.</p>
<p>The cytoskeleton of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is complicated but highly ordered. Each parasite contains one cytoskeletal apical complex (made of 3 ring structures and 14 filaments of a novel tubulin polymer), and 22 cortical microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Nichols1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu1">[6]</xref>. Overlying the microtubules is a regular two-dimensional (2D) meshwork formed by intermediate-filament like proteins, subtended beneath a tri-layer membrane containing a highly ordered 2D array of intra-membranous particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Dubremetz1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu2">[12]</xref>. Its actin cytoskeleton is extremely dynamic. Most of its actin are kept in the monomeric form, and only undergo very transient polymerization in extracellular parasites for driving parasite motility and invasion into the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Dobrowolski1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Wetzel1">[15]</xref>. The entire daughter cytoskeleton is assembled afresh in a reproducible temporal sequence within the mother during each round of parasite replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Sheffield1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Nishi1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, we located a number of new cytoskeletal proteins, including TgMORN1 (<underline>M</underline>embrane <underline>O</underline>ccupation and <underline>R</underline>ecognition <underline>N</underline>exus 1), TgCentrin2, and TgDLC- a member of the dynein light chain family, to a novel cytoskeletal structure at the extreme basal end of the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu3">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Gubbels1">[20]</xref>. Due to its unique location and molecular composition, we named this structure “the basal complex” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu3">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu4">[19]</xref>. We also discovered that although it will eventually become the extreme basal end of the parasite, the basal complex is initially constructed at the very beginning of daughter formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and in juxtaposition to the future apical end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu3">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu4">[19]</xref>. It first appears as a TgMORN1-containing ring that caps the growing ends of the daughter cortical cytoskeletons. The cap is maintained throughout daughter development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and eventually constricts into a cone at the basal end of the parasite when the daughter parasite becomes mature. It was a great surprise to find that the basal complex is formed so early, and equally surprising that it is initiated at the same site where the very first elements of the future apical complex are laid down. This highly suggestive combination of unexpected timing and unexpected location prompted the hypothesis that components of the basal complex might play some unknown critical role in the assembly of the daughter cortical cytoskeleton.</p>

<p>To address the role of the basal complex in <italic>T. gondii</italic> physiology, we decided to dissect the function of TgMORN1, as it is a major basal complex component and is also the earliest basal complex component identified so far. We found that TgMORN1 formed rings and fibers when ectopically expressed in bacteria, supporting the notion that it might function as a structural protein. We also made a knock-out mutant of TgMORN1 (<italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic>) and discovered that the structure of the parasite posterior end was grossly altered upon the loss of TgMORN1. Interestingly, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites displayed cytokinesis defects, apicoplast segregation defects and growth defects <italic>in vitro</italic>. In mice, these parasites not only were avirulent but also provided protective immunity against a lethal challenge infection.</p>

<p>The MORN-domain is a structural module conserved from bacteria to human. MORN-domain containing proteins have been found in large protein complexes and are thought to mediate protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Takeshima1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Shetty1">[25]</xref>.

<title>Generation of TgMORN1 knockout parasites using Cre-LoxP based strategy</title>
<p>To further understand its function, we decided to generate a knockout mutant of TgMORN1. Several attempts to eliminate TgMORN1 expression by one-step homologous recombination in RHΔHXGPRT (RHΔHX) parasites failed (unpublished results). These failures were not due to low homologous recombination frequency, as a parasite line in which endogenous TgMORN1 gene was replaced by homologous recombination with “LoxP-TgMORN1-HXGPRT-LoxP” was obtained fairly easily in the same set of experiments (one out of nine clones screened was positive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the loss of TgMORN1 confers serious growth disadvantage to the parasite. In the “LoxP-TgMORN1-HXGPRT-LoxP” parasite line, the TgMORN1 coding sequence was flanked by two LoxP sites, allowing for the excision of the [TgMORN1-(HXGPRT expression cassette)] fragment after the transient transfection of a plasmid expressing Cre-eGFP into the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). 6-thioxanthine (6-TX) selection was then applied to select for parasites that had lost HXGPRT activity, and five TgMORN1 negative clones (out of total 41 clones screened by immunofluorescence using a rat anti-TgMORN1 antibody) were obtained. Genomic PCR and western blot analysis confirmed the disruption of the <italic>TgMORN1</italic> locus and the complete loss of TgMORN1 protein expression in the TgMORN1 knockout parasite (<italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g002">Figure 2B&amp;C</xref>).</p>

<title>The loss of TgMORN1 affects the organization of the parasite posterior end</title>
<p>It was immediately noticeable that the posterior ends of the <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites were highly irregular and heterogeneous and that the distribution of the width of IMC1 basal gap among these parasites was much more wide-spread than those of the parental strain (<italic>LoxP-TgMORN1-HXGPRT-LoxP</italic>) and the complement (<italic>ΔTgMORN1/eGFP-TgMORN1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The morphologies of <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites posterior ends can be clustered into three major groups. About 37% of the parasites had a basal IMC1 gap that was more than 1 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; white arrowheads), much wider than the average of the basal IMC1 gap of the parental strain, which was ∼0.65 µm. In the second group (∼35%), the basal IMC1 gap was either small or nonexistent, but the posterior ends of the parasites still appeared to be significantly wider than that of the parental strain, giving the parasite a “triangular” shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; white arrow). In the third group (∼28%), the width of the parasite posterior end looked normal, however, irregular basal IMC structure was often present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; purple arrow). Likely a direct result of distorted parasite shape, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites never formed a “rosette”- a common organization of wild-type parasites in vacuoles containing more than 8 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These defects were fully corrected in the <italic>ΔTgMORN1/eGFP-TgMORN1</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>).

<p>As TgMORN1 is the earliest component recruited to the basal complex identified so far, we examined how the loss of TgMORN1 affected the localization of several other basal complex components. In <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites, eGFP-TgCentrin2 basal complex localization was undetectable, although the localization of eGFP-TgCentrin2 to the apical complex, the centrioles and the peripheral annuli was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, when eGFP-TgDLC was expressed in <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites, it was incorporated into the apical complex and spindle pole/centriole assembly as in the parental strain, but an eGFP-TgDLC concentration could not be detected at the parasite posterior end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). There could be two plausible explanations for the undetectability of an eGFP-TgCentrin2 or TgDLC basal concentration in <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites. It is possible that these two proteins failed to be recruited to the parasite basal complex because of the loss of TgMORN1. Alternatively, these proteins could spread to larger area in the disorganized parasite posterior end, which would dilute the signal, rendering it undetectable.</p>

<p>To assess the defects in parasite replication in <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites, we examined their intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

For the parental strain or <italic>ΔTgMORN1/eGFP-TgMORN1</italic> parasites, less than 0.5% of the total vacuoles contained parasites displaying similar defects.

<p>To examine if <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites are defective in organelle biogenesis, we examined the segregation of the apicoplast, the mitochondrion as well as the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of the secretory organelles: dense granules, micronemes, and rhoptries. While we did not detect any significant defects in the segregation or synthesis of other organelles in these parasites, we found that parasites in ∼24% of the vacuoles contained no apicoplast (revealed by an antibody recognizing the Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP), an apicoplast protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Waller1">[28]</xref>), indicating a modest apicoplast segregation defect (n = 250, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The Cre-LoxP based knock-out strategy</title>
<p>Several knock-out strategies have been developed to study protein function in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. One-step homologous replacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Donald1">[29]</xref> has been used to study the function of many non-essential genes. For single-copy essential genes, however, no viable knock-out mutant strain can be obtained using this method, because <italic>T. gondii</italic> grown in lab culture is asexual and contains a haploid genome. In fact, for any gene the loss of which results in ∼20% reduction in growth rate per cell cycle, it is practically impossible to acquire a knockout mutant using this method, as after ∼21 cell cycles (i.e. ∼7 days, the usual timeframe for drug selection before cloning), the percentage of the knockout parasite in the population will drop to less than ∼0.03% (0.8<sup>21</sup>×0.03; 0.03 is the ratio of homologous vs nonhomologous events estimated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Donald1">[29]</xref>). The failure to generate TgMORN1 knock-out mutants using one-step homologous replacement led us to implement the Cre-LoxP recombination technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Sauer1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Brecht1">[31]</xref> (Personal Communications, Drs Gusti Zeiner, Michael Reese and John Broothroyd at Stanford University). There are two potential advantages of this strategy compared with the previously developed methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Donald1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Meissner1">[32]</xref>. First of all, it can be used for generating knock-out for genes whose function is sensitive to its expression level, because in the “LoxP-GENEX-HXGPRT-LoxP” intermediate, the expression of the target gene is driven by its endogenous promoter. Secondly, this strategy makes it easier to obtain a clonal population of knock-out mutants that have severe growth defects, because the loss of the target gene via recombination by Cre recombinase simultaneously results in the loss of HXGPRT, which allows for the enrichment of the knockout mutants through a subsequent 6-TX selection that highly inhibits the growth of parasites where recombination has not occurred.</p>

<title>The function of TgMORN1</title>
<p>The initiation, construction and the maturation of different parts of <italic>T. gondii</italic> cytoskeleton occur in a highly reproducible sequence. We have previously demonstrated that the basal complex was assembled at the beginning of daughter construction, prompting our hypothesis that the basal complex might play a guiding role in the initiation of the parasite cortical cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu3">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu4">[19]</xref>. We were surprised to see, however, that although TgMORN1 is a prominent component of the basal complex, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites managed to construct a cortical cytoskeleton functional enough to support parasite survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. This indicates that if the basal complex dictates the initiation of the daughter cortical cytoskeleton, it involves basal complex components other than TgMORN1. The prediction is that if such protein exists, its recruitment to the basal complex should be early and independent of TgMORN1.</p>
<p>Once the daughters are constructed, they need to be properly segregated to become a functional entity. We have previously proposed that the basal complex might play a role in this maturation step based on the correlation between the timing of the basal complex constriction and that of cytokinesis initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu4">[19]</xref>. The phenotypes of <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites support this hypothesis. The architecture of the posterior end in these parasites was clearly perturbed, which correlated with a significant increase in defective cytokinesis. This might be a direct result of losing TgMORN1, a major structural protein in the basal complex. Alternatively, the indirect effect on the localization of other basal complex components, such as TgCentrin2, might also play a role in producing this structural defect, as we found previously that TgCentrin2 containing basal structure underwent contraction when the intracellular calcium concentration was elevated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Hu4">[19]</xref>. We do not know at this time if TgMORN1 itself plays an active role in recruiting these basal complex components or if the basal structure formed by TgMORN1 provides a necessary platform for protein association. These defects in the biogenesis of the basal complex are likely the direct cause for the inefficient daughter parasite separation in <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites. Moreover, TgMORN1 most likely works with other proteins in the basal complex to drive cytokinesis, as the “penetrance” of the cytokinesis defect was not complete in the TgMORN1 deficient parasites. Besides cytokinesis defects, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites displayed a modest apicoplast segregation defect, which also likely contributed to the growth defects of these parasites, as “apicoplast-less” parasites were shown to have a “delayed-death” phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-He1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Mazumdar1">[35]</xref>. It was proposed that the apicoplast is anchored to the centrosome during apicoplast division based on the close proximity between these two organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Striepen1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Vaishnava1">[37]</xref>. It will be interesting to elucidate in the future whether a direct connection between these two organelles exists and if TgMORN1 plays a role in the formation/maintenance of such a connection, or the apicoplast segregation defect in <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites is an indirect result of other defects in these parasites.</p>
<p>In sum, we have implemented a new knock-out strategy that is generally applicable to studying the functions of genes that are important for parasite growth. In addition, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> mutant will provide a convenient background to generate multi-gene knockouts for systematic dissection of the function of the basal complex and the interaction among its proteins. It will also facilitate mutagenesis analysis to understand the structural role of the MORN domain in general. Finally, our study provides direct evidence that cytoskeleton integrity is essential for parasite virulence and pathogenesis, as TgMORN1 deficiency has a profound effect on parasite virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Plasmids construction</title>
<p>The constructs for generating the parental strain: “LoxP-TgMORN1-HXGPRT-LoxP” parasite were produced using PTKO2_II as the backbone, and PTKO2_II was constructed based on PTKO (a kind gift from Drs Gusti Zeiner, Michael Reese and John Broothroyd at Stanford University). PTKO contains total two LoxP sites and two multiple cloning sites (MCS), with one MCS (MCS1) placed at the 5′ end of the first LoxP site and the second MCS (MCS2) placed at the 3′ end of the second LoxP site. In PTKO2_II, an additional MCS (MCS3) (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AGATCTGTTTAAACGCGATCGCGGTCCGAGGCCT</named-content>) was added to the 3′ end of the first LoxP site in PTKO, and 3′ portion of MCS1 in PTKO was modified to (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GGTACCCTCGAGGATATCTACGAATTC</named-content>). To construct PTKO2_II, a 521bp DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000754.s002">Table S1</xref>) containing these changes was synthesized and cloned into PUC-57 (Genscript, Inc, Piscataway, NJ), digested with KpnI and SpeI, and ligated into PTKO to replace the corresponding KpnI-SpeI fragment on PTKO. To construct the “LoxP-TgMORN1-HXGPRT-LoxP” plasmid, first, a 2.1kb fragment located to the 3′ end of TgMORN1 coding sequence in the genome was amplified using HK180 and HK181 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000754.s002">Table S1</xref>), digested with NheI and ApaI and ligated into NheI and ApaI sites of PTKO2_II (<italic>c.f.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which resulted in the plasmid PTKO2_II_3′UTR. Secondly, a ∼2.3kb fragment located to the 5′ end of TgMORN1 coding sequence in the genome was amplified using primers HK182 and HK183 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000754.s002">Table S1</xref>), digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and ligated into EcoRI and KpnI sites of PTKO2_II_3′UTR (<italic>c.f.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000754-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which resulted in the plasmid PTKO2_II_TgMORN1_5_3′UTR.

<p>Single BL21(DE3)pLysS bacterial colonies containing pQE30-6xHIS-TgMORN1 plasmid were grown overnight in LB-amp-cap at 37°C. Cultures were then diluted 1∶20 in 2 liter LB-amp-cap and grown till OD<sub>600</sub> reached ∼0.6–0.8 before the addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to 1 mM. Cultures were then grown for additional 4 hours at 37°C. Cells were then pelleted at 6,000 rpm for 25 minutes, resuspended in 40 ml of cold lysis buffer (8 mM Tris-Ac pH 7.5, 3 mM Trisbase, 100 mM KAc, 1 mM MgAc) containing 9.6g of cell lytic express (∼8 vials, Cat# C1990, Sigma), 1 µM TAME (Cat# T4626, Sigma) and 1 µM PMSF (Cat# P7626, Sigma), and incubated at 4°C for ∼60 minutes. Cells were sonicated∼five times for 30 seconds each with 1 minute cooling between each cycle, then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. 1.9 ml packed Talon resin (Cat# 635501, Clontech) equilibrated with lysis buffer was then added to the supernatant and gently mixed at 4°C for 1 hour. The resin was then washed with lysis buffer with 10mM imidazole 4 times and eluted with ∼1.5 ml 1XLDS sample buffer and reducing reagents buffer (Cat# NP0007, Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Generation and affinity purification of TgMORN1 antibody</title>
<p>Eluted 6XHIS-TgMORN1 proteins (see above) were loaded on 4–12% Bis-Tris gel and gel slices containing 6XHIS-TgMORN1 were then used to inject rats for antibody production (Cocalico Biological, Inc). The affinity purification of TgMORN1 antibody was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Beckers1">[42]</xref>. Briefly, PVDF membrane blot with immobilized recombinant 6XHIS-TgMORN1 was blocked in 1% “Blotto”(Cat# 1152709001, Roche) in TBS (20mM Tris base pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl) for 30min; diluted rat anti-TgMORN1 serum (1∶10, diluted in 0.5%“Blotto” in 1xTBS+ 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBS-T)+10mM Na N3) was then incubated with the blot for overnight at room temperature (∼18–20hours). The blot was then washed twice in 1xTBS-T for 15 minutes, and once in 1×PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. Absorbed antibody was then eluted by incubating with 0.2M glycine pH 2.5 at room temperature for 3 minutes. The pH of the eluted antibody solution was then neutralized by adding 0.09V of 1M Trisbase (pH unadjusted). NaN<sub>3</sub> was then added to the solution to 10mM. The purified antibody was stored at 4°C.</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>For each sample, 5×10<sup>6</sup> extracellular parasites were lysed by incubating in 1× SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) sodium deodeoyl sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol and ∼0.5 mg of bromophenol blue) containing 50 mM DTT at 100°C for 10 minutes. Western blot was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Heaslip1">[38]</xref>. Affinity purified rat anti-TgMORN1 was diluted 1∶10 and mouse-anti-tubulin B-5-1-2 (Cat# T6074, Sigma, U.S.A) was diluted 1∶4,000 in TBS-T containing 0.5% (v/v) blocking buffer (Cat# 1152709001, Roche). Goat anti-rat IgG HRP (Cat# NA935V, GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) was diluted 1∶1000, and goat anti-mouse/rabbit HRP (Cat# 1152709001, Roche) were diluted 1∶20,000 in TBS-T containing 0.5% blocking buffer.</p>

<title>Immunofluoresence</title>
<p>Intracellular parasites were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 1×PBS for 15 minutes, permeabilized with 0.25 or 0.5% TX-100 in 1×PBS for 15 minutes, then blocked with 1 or 3% BSA in 1×PBS (blocking buffer) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in primary and subsequently secondary antibody solutions (diluted in blocking buffer) for 60 minutes each. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-IMC1, 1∶1000 (A kind gift from Dr. Gary Ward, University of Vermont); rabbit anti-ACP (Kind gifts from Dr. Manami Nishi at McGill University and Dr. Dhanasekaran Shanmugam at University of Pennsylvania) 1∶500 or 1∶10; affinity purified rat anti-TgMORN1, 1∶10.

<title>Light microscopy</title>
<p>3D image stacks were collected at room temperature at z-increments of 0.3 µm on an Applied Precision Delta Vision imaging station constructed on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope base. A 100× oil immersion lens (NA = 1.4) and immersion oil at refractive index 1.518 were used for all the imaging. Deconvolved images were computed using the point-spread functions and software supplied by the manufacturer. All fluorescent images were maximum intensity projections of deconvolved 3D stacks unless otherwise stated. The brightness and contrast of images used in the final figures were optimized for color prints.</p>

<title>Measuring the width of basal IMC1 gap in parental, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> and <italic>ΔTgMORN1/eGFP-TgMORN1</italic> parasites</title>
<p>Measurement was performed on parasites in vacuoles containing one or two parasites. Specifically, parasites were labeled with IMC1 antibody as described above. 3-D stacks were acquired as described above, and images focused at the mid-section of the parasite were used for measuring the width of basal IMC1 gap in the parasites using Softworx (Applied Precisions, Inc.).</p>

<title>Invasion and motility (trail) assays</title>
<p>Invasion assays were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Huynh1">[43]</xref> with the following modifications. 1×10<sup>7</sup> extracellular parental, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> or <italic>ΔTgMORN1/eGFP-TgMORN1</italic> parasites were added to confluent HFF monolayers and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Cells were fixed in 3.1% formaldehyde and 0.06% glutaraldehyde (diluted in PBS) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Extracellular parasites were labeled with mouse anti-SAG1 antibody (Cat #11-132, Argene, North Massapequa, NY, diluted 1∶500) and visualized with goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 (1∶1,000). Cells were then permeabilized with 0.25% TX-100 diluted in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature and intracellular and extracellular parasites were labeled with mouse anti-SAG1 and visualized with goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1∶1000). All antibody incubations were performed for 30 minutes. The number of invaded (green only) parasites was calculated by subtracting the number of extracelluar (dual-labeled) parasites from the total number of parasites on the coverslip. Images were taken from 6 randomly chosen fields at 10× magnification and counting was performed using MetaMorph® software. Results were from three independent experiments. Motility assays were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Dobrowolski1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<title>Cytokinesis and Intracellular replication assay</title>
<p>Equal numbers of parental, <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> or <italic>ΔTgMORN1/eGFP-TgMORN1</italic> parasites were added to confluent HFF monolayers and grown for 12, 18, and 24 hours. Immunofluoresence assay with rat anti-TgDIP13 diluted 1∶400 (for visualizing the apical complex), mouse anti-IMC1 diluted 1∶500, and DAPI diluted to 1µg/ml was performed as described above. To assess the effect of TgMORN1 deficiency on cytokinesis, the number of vacuoles containing at least one parasite displaying cytokinesis defects was counted for a total of 200 vacuoles per time point in each of 3 independent experiments. The counting was restricted to the vacuoles with fewer than 16 parasites, because in larger parasitophorous vacuoles <italic>ΔTgMORN1</italic> parasites were too disorganized for assessing the level of cytokinesis defect accurately.</p>
<p>Replication assays were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000754-Mital1">[44]</xref>. The number of parasites/vacuole in 200 vacuoles per time point (18, 24, 30, and 40 hours) was counted in each of 3 independent experiments. Parasites that failed cytokinesis were counted as two. For the 40-hour time point, vacuoles containing one and two parasites were not included in the counting, as they were most likely secondary vacuoles formed by parasites that egressed from large primary vacuoles and reinvaded.</p>
