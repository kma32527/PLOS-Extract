<p>Immunity to one of the four dengue virus (DV) serotypes can increase disease severity in humans upon subsequent infection with another DV serotype. Serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate DV infection of myeloid cells <italic>in vitro</italic> by promoting virus entry via Fcγ receptors (FcγR), a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). However, despite decades of investigation, no <italic>in vivo</italic> model for antibody enhancement of dengue disease severity has been described. Analogous to human infants who receive anti-DV antibodies by transplacental transfer and develop severe dengue disease during primary infection, we show here that passive administration of anti-DV antibodies is sufficient to enhance DV infection and disease in mice using both mouse-adapted and clinical DV isolates. Antibody-enhanced lethal disease featured many of the hallmarks of severe dengue disease in humans, including thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, elevated serum cytokine levels, and increased systemic viral burden in serum and tissue phagocytes. Passive transfer of a high dose of serotype-specific antibodies eliminated viremia, but lower doses of these antibodies or cross-reactive polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies all enhanced disease <italic>in vivo</italic> even when antibody levels were neutralizing <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, a genetically engineered antibody variant (E60-N297Q) that cannot bind FcγR exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against ADE-induced lethal challenge. These observations provide insight into the pathogenesis of antibody-enhanced dengue disease and identify a novel strategy for the design of therapeutic antibodies against dengue.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease of humans, with over 3 billion people at risk for infection and 50–100 million infections in tropical and subtropical regions each year. Dengue virus (DV) causes a spectrum of clinical disease ranging from an acute debilitating, self-limited febrile illness (DF) to a life-threatening vascular leakage syndrome, referred to as dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). There are four serotypes of DENV; infection with one serotype is thought to protect against re-infection with the same serotype, but may either protect against or enhance infection with one of the other three serotypes. Epidemiological and <italic>in vitro</italic> data has implicated anti-DENV antibodies in mediating pathogenesis of a second DENV infection. However, it is unclear which antibody conditions are protective and which exacerbate disease <italic>in vivo</italic>, in part because no animal model of antibody-enhanced dengue disease has been available. Here, we present the first animal model of antibody-enhanced severe DENV infection. Importantly, this model recapitulates many aspects of human disease, including vascular leakage, elevated serum cytokine levels, reduced platelet count, and disseminated infection of tissue phagocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this model by showing that a genetically modified anti-DENV antibody that fails to bind the Fcγ receptor has prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against lethal DENV challenge <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The four serotypes of dengue virus (DV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses responsible for 50–100 million human infections annually. Primary infection in individuals over the age of one year with any DV serotype is usually asymptomatic or results in self-limited dengue fever (DF), but secondary infection with another DV serotype carries an increased risk of severe disease, including life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Rothman1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Halstead1">[2]</xref>. Fatal disease is characterized by increased vascular permeability leading to hemoconcentration and hypovolemic shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-WHO1">[3]</xref>. The increased severity of secondary infections is believed to result, at least in part, from antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DV infection, in which FcγR engagement by antibody-virus immune complexes facilitates virus entry into susceptible myeloid cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Halstead2">[4]</xref>. A role for ADE in human dengue pathogenesis is supported by observations that maternally-derived anti-DV antibodies increase the risk of DHF in infants during primary infection with DENV2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kliks1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Chau1">[6]</xref>. Antibody-mediated increases in DV viremia have been demonstrated in macaques, but a limited number of antibody conditions were examined, and exacerbation of dengue disease by passively transferred antibodies was not observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Halstead3">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Goncalvez1">[8]</xref>. Consequently, fundamental questions about the immunology and pathogenesis of ADE have remained unanswered, and small animal models for testing antiviral interventions in the context of ADE have not been available.</p>
<p>Recently, we derived a mouse-adapted DV2 strain, D2S10, that produces a TNF-α-dependent fatal vascular permeability syndrome in interferon-α/β and γ-receptor-deficient (AG129) mice 4–5 days after intravenous (iv) infection with 10<sup>7</sup> plaque forming units (pfu) of virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Shresta1">[9]</xref>. DV infection in AG129 mice reproduces important features of human DV infection, including similar tissue and cellular tropism, viremia, vascular leakage, and elevated serum cytokine levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Shresta1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Balsitis1">[12]</xref>. Antibodies elicited by DV infection are a mixture of serotype-specific and serotype-cross-reactive antibodies, including long-lasting neutralizing antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kyle2">[13]</xref>. Memory immune responses are present after primary DV infection, and serotype cross-protective immunity was observed in three different sequential infection scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kyle2">[13]</xref> and data not shown). Thus, we utilized the AG129 model to examine the effects of serotype cross-reactive antibodies on DV2 infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this report, we demonstrate lethal enhancement of DV infection and disease by both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. We also show that ADE functions to increase the viral burden in blood and tissues, resulting in a vascular permeability syndrome that is similar to that seen in mice with a higher inoculum in the absence of immune antibody and that shares clinical features of human dengue disease. Finally, we confirm the critical role of FcγR interaction in ADE <italic>in vivo</italic> and provide proof-of-principle for a pre- and post-exposure treatment strategy utilizing genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies that can no longer bind FcγR.</p>

<title>Lethal enhancement of dengue disease by anti-DV serum</title>
<p>Serum containing anti-DV1 antibodies was collected from AG129 mice 8 weeks after subcutaneous inoculation with 10<sup>5</sup> pfu of DV1 strain 98J. Heat-inactivated anti-DV1 serum exhibited a 50% neutralizing titer (NT<sub>50</sub>) against DV2 strain D2S10 of 1∶296 and against DV1 98J of 1∶1,069 using a flow-based neutralization assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kraus1">[14]</xref>, peak enhancement titers of 1∶75 against DV2 D2S10 (fold-enhancement 14.8%) and 1∶225 against DV1 98J (fold-enhancement 10.7%) in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ADE assay with FcγR-bearing human K562 cells, and ELISA titers of 400 and 3200 against purified DV2 and DV1, respectively (data not shown). In addition, no residual DV1 could be isolated following inoculation into C6/36 mosquito cells (data not shown). The effects of anti-DV1 serum on DV2 infection were investigated after intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 100 µl of either naïve mouse serum (NMS) or anti-DV1 serum, followed 24 hours later by iv challenge with 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> pfu of DV2. Lethal infection controls received 10<sup>7</sup> pfu of DV2, and all mice were monitored for mortality for 10 days. While no mortality was observed in NMS-recipient mice infected with 10<sup>6</sup> pfu or less of DV2, 92–100% of anti-DV1 recipients died after inoculation with 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> pfu of DV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000790-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000790.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>) between 4 and 5 days post-infection. In both the 10<sup>7</sup> pfu infection controls and anti-DV1 recipients infected with 10<sup>5</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup> pfu, lethal disease was accompanied by fluid accumulation in visceral organs characteristic of the vascular permeability syndrome induced by DV2 D2S10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Shresta1">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000790-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).

<title>Anti-DV antibody increases systemic viral burden</title>
<p>Viral burden was subsequently compared between anti-DV1 and NMS-recipient mice infected with 10<sup>5</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of DV2.

<p>Mice were administered naïve serum (NMS) or anti-DV1 serum and infected iv with 10<sup>5</sup> pfu DV2 the following day. Controls were mock-infected or infected with 10<sup>7</sup> pfu DV2 iv. <bold>A.</bold> Tissues were collected from all mice (n = 3–6 per group) at day 3.5, formalin-fixed, and processed into paraffin sections. Serial sections from each tissue were stained with anti-DV NS3 antibody E1D8 (NS3) or an isotype control mouse IgG2a (IgG2a data not shown), and multiple sections of each tissue type were thoroughly examined for staining. Positive staining for NS3 is brown while hematoxylin counterstain is blue. Strong cytoplasmic staining observed with E1D8, but not IgG2a control antibody, was considered DV-specific when observed in infected mice but not uninfected controls. NS3<sup>+</sup> cells in lymph node, small intestine, and large intestine exhibited morphology and location consistent with tissue macrophages under all infection conditions (arrowheads). In liver, NS3<sup>+</sup> cells were consistent with tissue macrophages and/or endothelial cells.

However, lower doses of both anti-DV1 and anti-DV2 serum caused lethal enhancement, showing that serotype-specific as well as serotype-cross-reactive antibodies can also enhance infection <italic>in vivo</italic> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000790-g004"><bold>Figure 4A and B</bold></xref>). To assess the ability of the BHK PRNT<sub>50</sub> assay to predict <italic>in vivo</italic> protection and enhancement in this mouse model, neutralizing activity was measured in the sera of mice immediately prior to infection with D2S10. Serum was collected approximately 18 hours post-transfer of anti-DV antibodies, and 4 hours prior to infection. Similar to human studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Endy1">[22]</xref>, lethal enhancement occurred even in mice that had detectable neutralizing antibodies, although no lethality was observed in mice with PRNT<sub>50</sub> values of &gt;200.</p>

<p>Since FcγR engagement is required for ADE <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Boonnak1">[23]</xref>, we hypothesized that eliminating the ability of antibodies to bind to FcγRs would prevent ADE <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<p>We followed up these studies using a mAb genetically engineered to eliminate FcγR binding. MAb E60 is a flavivirus cross-reactive neutralizing mouse IgG2a antibody that, similar to 4G2, binds to an epitope in the fusion peptide of domain II on the E protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Crill1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Oliphant1">[25]</xref>.

Whereas both E60-mIgG2a and E60-hIgG1 consistently caused antibody-dependent mortality 4 to 5 days post-infection, equivalent doses of E60-N297Q caused neither morbidity nor mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000790-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>).

<p>The N297Q mutation also abolishes binding to complement component C1q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Tao1">[27]</xref>.

E60-A330L does not bind C1q but retains binding to FcγR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Stavenhagen1">[28]</xref>, and we confirmed this by surface plasmon resonance (data not shown).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding the immunopathogenesis of DV infection has been severely hampered by the lack of a small animal disease model. Thus, studies of ADE have been limited to epidemiological observations and <italic>in vitro</italic> experimentation. Here, we present the first model of antibody-enhanced lethal dengue disease <italic>in vivo</italic>. This work describes a long-sought mouse model for investigation of dengue pathogenesis, characterizes a clinically important mechanism of immunopathogenesis, has implications for vaccine development, and identifies a possible antibody-based antiviral strategy to treat life-threatening DV infection.</p>
<p>Numerous attempts have been made to establish a mouse model of dengue disease and have been limited by the relatively low susceptibility of mice to DV infection. Previous models have included intracerebral inoculation of DV or injection of very high (&gt;10<sup>9</sup> PFU) doses of virus into immunocompetent mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Atrasheuskaya1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Chen1">[30]</xref>; infection of SCID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Lin1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Wu1">[34]</xref> or NOD/SCID or RAG2γ (c)<sup>−/−</sup>mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Bente1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kuruvilla1">[36]</xref> implanted with human cells or cell lines; and use of various immunodeficient strains of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Hotta1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Shresta2">[38]</xref>. The most common outcome is neurovirulent disease, with a few recent exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Bente1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kuruvilla1">[36]</xref>. Of these, the AG129 mouse model has proven both useful and tractable, as it is permissive to infection with all four DV serotypes, displays relevant tissue and cellular tropism, produces long-lasting serotype-specific and serotype-cross-reactive anti-DV antibodies of a balanced isotype ratio, and generates a vascular leakage syndrome that in many respects resembles human dengue disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Shresta1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Schul1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Kyle2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Balsitis1">[12]</xref>. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the lack of IFN receptors limits reproduction of some facets of human disease, especially in relation to cytokine profiles or infection conditions that are modulated by IFNs. However, the many similarities with specific features of human DV infection and the critical role for FcγR in ADE <italic>in vivo</italic> that we demonstrate here support the use of the AG129 model for specific avenues of dengue research. Interestingly, IFN-receptor deficient mice (A129) have recently been successfully adapted for other mosquito-borne viruses, including both Chikungunya and Yellow Fever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Couderc1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Meier1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> ADE models have also been established for other viruses, including Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus (MVEV), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), and Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Weiss1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Takano1">[46]</xref>, in which passive transfer of antibody increases viral titers and/or mortality. These models show several parallels with our model of antibody-enhanced DENV infection: with FIPV, immune sera are able to enhance macrophage infection and disease during subsequent challenge with the same FIPV serotype in kittens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Weiss1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Takano1">[46]</xref>, and with MVEV, JEV, and YFV, enhanced mortality was observed in mice administered flavivirus cross-reactive polyclonal antibodies or non-neutralizing YFV-specific monoclonal antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Barrett1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Wallace1">[45]</xref>. However, none of these pathogens are associated with antibody-enhanced disease in humans. By modelling ADE with a pathogen known to cause antibody-enhanced disease in humans and using a model that displays a variety of relevant disease phenotypes, this report extends previous work on ADE to the ability to model human disease parameters and aid in the development of therapeutics.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> evidence of ADE of DV infection was first described by Halstead <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Halstead3">[7]</xref> following the passive transfer of antibodies in the rhesus macaque. Similar data was recently obtained by Gonçalvez <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Goncalvez1">[8]</xref>, where passive transfer of the serotype-cross-reactive mAb 1A5 enhanced DV4 viremia over a ∼30-fold concentration range (0.22–6 mg/kg). While both of these studies described elevated viremia, neither resulted in a clinical phenotype with parallels to human disease. Here, we describe enhancement of a mouse-adapted strain of DV2 by serotype-specific and cross-reactive sera as well as by monoclonal antibodies. Importantly, characterization of antibody-dependent dengue disease in the AG129 mouse maintains several parallels with severe disease in humans. Hallmark features of human DHF/DSS are vascular leak, higher viral burden, increased levels of serum cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-10, and platelet depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Rothman2">[47]</xref>. All of these features were observed in our mouse model of ADE. Moreover, the magnitude of DV enhancement also mimics that seen in humans and non-human primates. We observed a 20-fold increase in viremia triggered by ADE; DV viremia in humans is reported to be 10- to 100-fold higher in DHF cases than in DF cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Vaughn1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Libraty1">[49]</xref>, and ADE in macaques increases viremia 5–100 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Halstead3">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Goncalvez1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, in all of the disease parameters we examined, there was no apparent difference between lethality resulting from antibody-enhanced infection with a sublethal viral dose and lethality resulting from direct inoculation with a 100-fold higher viral dose. Thus, this model did not reveal any fundamental difference in the mechanisms of pathogenesis between antibody-enhanced and non-enhanced infection; rather, lethality here appears to be a result of higher viral burden, regardless of how such a burden was achieved.</p>
<p>To ensure that enhanced disease in the AG129 model was not solely a feature of the mouse-adapted strain, mice were infected with clinical isolates DV1 Western Pacific-74 and DV2 TSV01 in the presence of anti-DV antibodies, and enhanced viremia was observed in both cases. The lack of mortality in infections with these viruses is likely a result of the lower viral burden established by non-adapted strains even in the presence of enhancing antibody. Interestingly, mild fluid accumulation was also observed in the gastrointestinal organs in a subset of mice experiencing enhanced infection of non-adapted DV. As only a small fraction (0.5%) of human secondary DV infections results in severe disease, and some DV strains are more virulent than others based on genetic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Leitmeyer1">[50]</xref>, the observed spectrum in disease severity is not surprising, but rather parallels the human condition.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical (IHC) characterization of the cellular tropism associated with ADE using NS3-specific antibodies indicated infection in cells with morphology consistent with dendritic cells and tissue macrophages in the lymph node, small intestine, large intestine and bone marrow. Further characterization by flow cytometry supported the IHC data and demonstrated infection, as evidenced by both anti-E and anti-NS3 staining, in cells with surface markers of monocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow and sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver. By both methodologies, the infected cell types identified in the murine model agree with those cells defined as the natural targets of DV in the human host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Balsitis1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Jessie1">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, the infected cell types did not change between an enhanced and non-enhanced DV infection; rather, quantification by both IHC and flow cytometry indicated an increase in the number of infected cells. Taken together, antibody-enhanced disease appears to result in increased infection in the natural targets of DV infection and resulting pathogenesis that does not significantly differ from the disease that results when a 100-fold higher dose of DV is used in the absence of enhancing antibody.</p>
<p>In human infants who have acquired maternal anti-DV antibody, severe dengue can occur even when calculated neutralizing antibody titers against the secondary infecting serotype are &gt;1∶100 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Simmons1">[51]</xref>. Similarly, children with detectable neutralizing antibody against the infecting virus strain can develop DHF during secondary DV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Endy1">[22]</xref>. These studies indicate that the <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assay using BHK21 cells is not a consistent correlate of protection in humans. Similarly, our PRNT<sub>50</sub> assays performed on serum samples from mice after antibody transfer but before virus challenge demonstrated that despite <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing activity at the time of infection, anti-DV1 sera, anti-DV2 sera, and 4G2 all enhanced infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Enhanced disease was consistently observed in antibody-recipient mice with pre-infection neutralizing titers of &lt;1∶200, but not greater. Thus, substantial neutralizing antibody levels appear to be required to prevent severe disease in this model. Of note, the passive transfer and primary infection scheme used does not examine anamnestic B and T cell immune responses, and thus, more accurately models DHF/DSS in infants with primary DV infection rather than secondary DV infections.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> evidence had previously indicated that an interaction between the Fc portion of the antibody and the FcγR was necessary for ADE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000790-Goncalvez1">[8]</xref>; however, this hypothesis had never been corroborated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using two different reagents – F(ab)′2 fragments of 4G2 and the N297Q variant of hE60-IgG1, we demonstrate that binding of the Fc portion of the antibody to the FcγR is required for ADE-induced disease. Further analysis with F(ab)′2 or the N297Q variant showed a reduction in viral titer below the level in mice receiving PBS in place of mAb. Thus, under conditions where the antibody cannot bind the FcγR, the F(ab) portion of the antibody can neutralize infection. These data also demonstrate that antibodies directed to the fusion loop in E domain II are capable of neutralizing DV infection independently from effector functions mediated by FcγR and C1q. Because the N297Q mutation also ablated the C1q binding site, we tested a second hE60 variant, hE60-A330L, that contained a mutation disrupting the complement C1q receptor binding site, but not the FcγR interaction. Mice receiving the hE60-A330L variant succumbed to an enhanced DV infection. This confirms that interaction of the anti-DENV mAb with the FcγR, and not binding of C1q, is essential for ADE <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Given the promising data with the hE60-N297Q variant, we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this antibody. When given as prophylaxis together with an enhancing amount of anti-DV1 serum, hE60-N297Q was completely protective. Although interesting, a DENV prophylactic is not likely to be a clinically useful reagent. However, when given 24 hours after an enhanced DENV infection, E60-N297Q completely protected against mortality; likewise, tissue viral load and systemic TNF-α levels in these mice at 3.5 days post-infection were significantly reduced. Two different doses of E60-N297Q, 20 and 50 µg, were administered 48 hours post-infection and resulted in 50% and 80% survival, respectively. Given the condensed timeframe of DENV pathogenesis in the AG129 model, E60-N297Q or similar therapeutic mAbs may have a broader time window for intervention and efficacy in humans or other animal models that display more protracted kinetics of DV infection.</p>
<p>In summary, we report the first animal model of lethal antibody-mediated enhancement of DV infection, describe virologic and pathologic changes induced by ADE, and define antibody conditions for protection and ADE in passive antibody transfer recipients. Furthermore, we show that antibodies engineered to prevent FcγR interaction exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against DV infection, and thus have potential as a novel antiviral strategy against DV.</p>
