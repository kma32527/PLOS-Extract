<p>During long-term cystic fibrosis lung infections, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> undergoes genetic adaptation resulting in progressively increased persistence and the generation of adaptive colony morphotypes. This includes small colony variants (SCVs), auto-aggregative, hyper-adherent cells whose appearance correlates with poor lung function and persistence of infection. The SCV morphotype is strongly linked to elevated levels of cyclic-di-GMP, a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates the transition between motile and sessile, cooperative lifestyles. A genetic screen in PA01 for SCV-related loci identified the <italic>yfiBNR</italic> operon, encoding a tripartite signaling module that regulates c-di-GMP levels in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Subsequent analysis determined that YfiN is a membrane-integral diguanylate cyclase whose activity is tightly controlled by YfiR, a small periplasmic protein, and the OmpA/Pal-like outer-membrane lipoprotein YfiB. Exopolysaccharide synthesis was identified as the principal downstream target for YfiBNR, with increased production of Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides responsible for many characteristic SCV behaviors. An <italic>yfi</italic>-dependent SCV was isolated from the sputum of a CF patient. Consequently, the effect of the SCV morphology on persistence of infection was analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using the YfiN-mediated SCV as a representative strain. The SCV strain exhibited strong, exopolysaccharide-dependent resistance to nematode scavenging and macrophage phagocytosis. Furthermore, the SCV strain effectively persisted over many weeks in mouse infection models, despite exhibiting a marked fitness disadvantage <italic>in vitro</italic>. Exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics significantly decreased both the number of suppressors arising, and the relative fitness disadvantage of the SCV mutant <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the SCV persistence phenotype may play a more important role during antimicrobial chemotherapy. This study establishes YfiBNR as an important player in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> persistence, and implicates a central role for c-di-GMP, and by extension the SCV phenotype in chronic infections.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During long-term chronic infections of cystic fibrosis patients, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> adapts to the lung environment, generating various different morphotypes including small colony variants (SCVs), small, strongly adherent colonies whose appearance correlates with persistence of infection. The SCV morphology is strongly associated with increased levels of the signaling molecule cyclic di-GMP. In this study we investigated the connection between cyclic di-GMP, SCV and persistence of infection. Following a genetic screen for mutants that displayed SCV morphologies, we identified and characterized the YfiBNR system. YfiN is a membrane-bound cyclic di-GMP producing enzyme, whose activity is tightly controlled by YfiR and YfiB. Cyclic di-GMP produced by YfiN boosts exopolysaccharide synthesis, generating an SCV morphotype upon YfiR-mediated release of YfiN repression. The resulting YfiN-mediated SCV morphotype is highly resistant to macrophage phagocytosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting a role for the SCV phenotype in immune system evasion. Consistent with this, YfiN de-repression increased the persistence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in long-term infections in a mouse model. The observation that the addition of antibiotics decreased the number of suppressors, and the relative fitness disadvantage of the YfiN-mediated SCV morphotype in liquid culture, suggested that SCV-mediated persistence might be favored during antimicrobial chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many bacterial pathogens are able to establish long-term chronic infections within their respective hosts. The strategies and mechanisms employed by pathogens to persist against attacks by the host immune system and the action of antimicrobial substances are still relatively poorly understood. An appreciation of these processes is needed to develop strategies that help to avoid complications with antibiotic resistance development and infection relapses associated with prolonged colonization of host tissue. The opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is responsible for chronic infections in the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and for much of the associated morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Govan1">[1]</xref>. During long-term lung colonization, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> undergoes phenotypic and genetic adaptation resulting in the progressive loss of virulence and the development of increased persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Smith1">[2]</xref>. As a manifestation of this process, distinct adaptive colony morphotypes of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> appear in CF sputum sample isolates. These include mucoid colonies, which overproduce the exopolysaccharide alginate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Govan1">[1]</xref>, and small colony variants (SCVs), slow-growing isolates characterized by several phenotypes including auto-aggregation, attachment to surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler1">[3]</xref> and enhanced exopolysaccharide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kirisits1">[4]</xref>. The appearance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> SCVs in CF sputum samples correlates with antibiotic resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Reinhardt1">[6]</xref>, poor lung function, and persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler3">[7]</xref>. Likewise, <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> SCVs are associated with increased serum resistance and fatal systemic infections post lung transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler4">[8]</xref>. These studies suggest that during the course of chronic lung infections, SCVs are selected for due to a fitness advantage in this unique environment, and that they might play an important role in the pathogenesis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lung infections.</p>
<p>Following early indications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-DArgenio1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Drenkard1">[10]</xref>, evidence has accumulated that the SCV morphotype is strongly linked to the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Meissner1">[11]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Starkey1">[13]</xref>. A recent study of CF patients showed clear links between c-di-GMP-related systems, and hence SCV, and chronic lung infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Smith1">[2]</xref>. C-di-GMP is an ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates the sessile-motile transition in a wide range of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Jenal1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Galperin1">[15]</xref>. C-di-GMP is produced from GTP by di-guanylate cyclases (DGC), and degraded to pGpG by phosphodiesterases (PDE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Ross1">[16]</xref>. These enzymes contain the conserved GGDEF and EAL domains, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Schmidt1">[17]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Ryjenkov1">[20]</xref>. GGDEF domains that harbor enzymatic activity generally contain two conserved motifs; the catalytic active (A) site, and the regulatory (I) site, required for non-competitive product inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Christen2">[21]</xref>. In general, elevated levels of c-di-GMP are associated with a sessile, cooperative lifestyle. Phenotypes expressed in this state include biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Gjermansen1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Spiers1">[23]</xref>, enhanced exopolysaccharide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Spiers2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Lee1">[25]</xref>, expression and production of attachment factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-DArgenio1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kulasekara1">[26]</xref>, loss of various forms of motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kazmierczak1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Simm1">[28]</xref>, and reduced virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kulasakara1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Tischler1">[30]</xref>. Conversely, low levels of c-di-GMP promote a unicellular, free-swimming lifestyle.</p>
<p>The c-di-GMP regulatory system in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is highly complex, with 33 predicted GGDEF and 17 EAL domain-containing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Galperin1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kulasakara1">[29]</xref>. These proteins are thought to modulate the intracellular c-di-GMP level and hence regulate the production of numerous outputs. These include the exopolysaccharides Pel, Psl and alginate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Lee1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Merighi1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman2">[32]</xref>, fimbrial adhesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kulasekara1">[26]</xref>, virulence and cytotoxicity factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kulasakara1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kuchma1">[33]</xref>, pili <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kazmierczak1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Huang1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Alm1">[35]</xref> and flagella function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Merritt1">[36]</xref>. Regulation of these output systems has been observed at the transcriptional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman2">[32]</xref> and post-translational levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Lee1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Merighi1">[31]</xref>. To date, the biological roles and mechanisms of action of several <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> c-di-GMP signaling systems have been investigated. These include the Wsp system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Bantinaki1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Guvener1">[38]</xref>, comprising a Che-like chemosensory system with a DGC response-regulator output, WspR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Bantinaki1">[37]</xref>.

This system is further implicated in pathogenicity, with links to cyanide-mediated toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Gallagher1">[39]</xref> and type-III secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kuchma1">[33]</xref>. The transition between reversible and irreversible attachment in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is regulated by the putative hydrolase SadB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Caiazza1">[40]</xref>, which promotes Pel exopolysaccharide production and represses swarming motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Caiazza1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Caiazza2">[41]</xref>. These processes are similarly co-regulated by the opposing enzymatic activities of SadC, a membrane-bound DGC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Merritt1">[36]</xref> and the PDE BifA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kuchma2">[42]</xref>.

<p>To investigate the role of c-di-GMP in the generation of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> SCV phenotype, we undertook a transposon mutagenesis screen in strain PA01 for genes whose disruption produced autoaggregative, Congo Red binding colonies. Three independent transposon insertions were found in <italic>yfiR</italic>, the first gene of the <italic>yfiBNR</italic> operon, which is highly conserved in many Î³-proteobacteria. Here we characterize the <italic>yfiBNR</italic> genes, and report that this conserved system represents a tripartite signaling module that regulates c-di-GMP levels in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in response to as-yet unknown environmental signals. YfiN acts as a membrane-integral DGC whose activity is tightly controlled by YfiR, a small periplasmic protein, and the OmpA/Pal-like outer-membrane lipoprotein YfiB. The primary downstream target for the cyclic-di-GMP produced by YfiBNR was identified as the Pel exopolysaccharide system, with transcription of <italic>pel</italic> genes being directly proportional to the inferred output level of YfiN. Disruption of the tight YfiN regulation via deletion of <italic>yfiR</italic> resulted in the generation of an SCV morphology in PA01. Consequently, the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> genotype was used as a representative SCV in cell culture assays and in a mouse model of persistent infection. Compared to PA01, the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant exhibited strong, exopolysaccharide-dependent resistance to macrophage phagocytosis. In addition, the SCV phenotype was shown to effectively persist in a subcutaneous catheter infection model. Together this establishes the YfiBNR module as an important player in the persistence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and implicates a role for c-di-GMP in chronic infections.</p>

Swimming, swarming, and twitching motility were severely impaired in Î<italic>yfiR</italic> compared to wild type PA01 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s004">Figure S1</xref>). Similarly to the SCV phenotype, these motility defects were fully complemented by expression of <italic>yfiR in cis</italic> or <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s004">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the nature of the YfiBNR system output, a His<sub>6</sub>-tagged version of YfiN lacking the 182 residues corresponding to the transmembrane region (truncated-YfiN-His<sub>6</sub>) was purified and tested for DGC activity. DGC activity was previously suggested for YfiN of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 based on HPLC analysis of over-expression strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kulasakara1">[29]</xref>. In accordance with these findings, truncated-YfiN-His<sub>6</sub> generated c-di-GMP from GTP, confirming that YfiN functions as a DGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). HPLC analysis of the effluent co-eluting with the purified truncated-YfiN-His<sub>6</sub> fraction indicated the presence of large amounts of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with the idea that the YfiN GGDEF domain contains a conserved high-affinity binding site utilized for allosteric product inhibition (I-site) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Christen2">[21]</xref>. These results indicated that the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV phenotype is a consequence of derepressed YfiN DGC activity. To confirm this, we determined the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP in wild type and mutant strains. In growing cells of PA01 wild type and a strain lacking YfiN (Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic>, see below) the concentration of c-di-GMP was 3.54Â±0.67 pmol/mg protein and 2.39Â±0.33 pmol/mg, respectively. In contrast, a strain lacking YfiR (289.30Â±36.53 pmol/mg) or over-expressing <italic>yfiN</italic> from a plasmid (1835.70Â±235.93 pmol/mg) showed a marked increase of c-di-GMP. Together, these data strongly suggest that YfiR functions to negatively regulate YfiN, and that the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV phenotype results from de-repression of YfiN DGC activity, leading to increased levels of c-di-GMP.</p>

<title>YfiB and YfiR inversely control YfiN activity</title>
<p>In order to understand the regulatory interplay of the YfiB, YfiN and YfiR proteins, a series of epistasis experiments were performed. In addition to the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant, Î<italic>yfiNR</italic> and Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> deletion strains were constructed. As expected, both strains displayed wild type colony morphology (data not shown) and reduced attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that YfiN contributes to surface attachment of PA01 wild type under the conditions tested, and that YfiN is the effector of the SCV phenotype in the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant. A series of <italic>yfiBNR</italic> alleles were then constructed and inserted into the att-Tn<italic>7</italic> locus of Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> (a strain that harbors a deletion of the entire <italic>yfi</italic> operon). In this way, the effects of all combinations of <italic>yfiB, yfiN,</italic> and <italic>yfiR</italic> mutations could be tested. Replacement of the full <italic>yfiBNR</italic> operon at att-Tn<italic>7</italic> yielded a phenotype indistinguishable from wild type PA01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>).

<p>A) Attachment of <italic>yfiBNR</italic> mutant strains. The bars marked âÎ<italic>yfiBNR</italic> Tn<italic>7</italic>::â depict Tn<italic>7</italic> complementation strains containing variants of the <italic>yfiBNR</italic> operon inserted into the <italic>att-</italic>Tn<italic>7</italic> site of Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic>. For these, âFLâ refers to the full-length <italic>yfiBNR</italic> operon, âA-siteâ refers to the <italic>yfiN</italic> active-site mutant D330A, and âI siteâ to the <italic>yfiN</italic> feedback-inhibition-site mutant R319A. Strains without an active copy of <italic>yfiN</italic> (light grey) display reduced attachment compared to those containing active copies of both <italic>yfiN</italic> and <italic>yfiR</italic> (white). Strains missing <italic>yfiR</italic> but containing <italic>yfiN</italic> (dark grey) showed a large increase in attachment. Immunoblots show the levels of YfiB and YfiN present in each strain. B) Colony morphology of selected Tn<italic>7</italic> complementation strains. Deletion of <italic>yfiR</italic> induces a small colony variant phenotype. Deletion of <italic>yfiB</italic> has no effect on morphology, either alone or combined with an <italic>yfiR</italic> deletion. C) Over-expression of <italic>yfiB in trans</italic> induces SCV colony morphology and stimulates PA01 attachment in an <italic>yfiN-</italic> and <italic>yfiR-</italic>dependent manner. <italic>yfiB</italic> expression is induced in Tn<italic>7</italic> complementation strains, which are labeled as in 3A. The colony morphologies of these strains with and without induction of <italic>yfiB</italic> expression are shown on the right.

<p>Comparison of the morphology and attachment of the Tn<italic>7</italic>-based complementation strains led to several observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Firstly, deletion of <italic>yfiN</italic>, or expression of an <italic>yfiN</italic> active site (A-site) mutant (<italic>yfiN<sub>D330A</sub></italic>) produced a wild type colony morphology and an attachment level around 60% of wild type, independent of the presence or absence of <italic>yfiR</italic> or <italic>yfiB</italic>. Secondly, deletion of <italic>yfiR</italic> produced the characteristic SCV morphology in any strain with a wild type version of <italic>yfiN</italic>. Deletion of <italic>yfiB</italic> did not affect attachment or colony morphology, and a Î<italic>yfiRB</italic> double mutant behaved similarly to a Î<italic>yfiR</italic> single mutant, suggesting that <italic>yfiR</italic> is epistatic over <italic>yfiB</italic> and that YfiB may function upstream of YfiR. Over-expression of <italic>yfiB in trans</italic> led to a two-fold increase in Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> Tn<italic>7</italic>::<italic>yfiBNR</italic> attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, âFLâ). This effect was dependent upon the presence of YfiR, and on a functional copy of YfiN; no attachment increase was seen upon <italic>yfiB</italic> expression in either strain Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> Tn<italic>7</italic>::<italic>yfiBN</italic>Î<italic>R</italic> or in strain Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> Tn<italic>7</italic>::<italic>yfiBN<sub>D330A</sub>R</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, âÎ<italic>yfiR</italic>â and âFL A-siteâ). These data support the hypothesis that YfiB functions upstream of YfiR. Thirdly, the stoichiometry of YfiR and YfiN appears to be critical for the tight control of the Yfi system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Basal level expression of <italic>yfiN</italic> from the plasmid p-<italic>ara-yfiN</italic> lead to increased levels of YfiN relative to YfiR, and to a SCV phenotype in PA01 wild type. This SCV morphology was suppressed by the introduction of a plasmid expressing <italic>yfiR</italic> (p-<italic>yfiR</italic>). When <italic>yfiN</italic> expression in this strain was induced with arabinose, levels of YfiN once again dominated, leading to an SCV phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, adding a second copy of <italic>yfiN</italic> to the PA01 wild type chromosome (inserted into the att-Tn<italic>7</italic> locus) produced an SCV phenotype with a lower level of attachment than Î<italic>yfiR</italic>, accounting for the chromosomal copy of <italic>yfiR</italic> present, while the wild type phenotype was maintained when additional copies of both <italic>yfiN</italic> and <italic>yfiR</italic> were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Finally, an <italic>yfiN</italic> I-site mutation (<italic>yfiN<sub>R319A</sub></italic>) only partially complemented wild type <italic>yfiN</italic>. Because immunoblot analysis showed reduced levels of the YfiN I-site mutant as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), this may be due to reduced stability of the mutant protein. Despite the reduced effectiveness of <italic>yfiN<sub>R319A</sub></italic>, we were unable to introduce this allele into a strain that lacked <italic>yfiR</italic>, suggesting that loss of both YfiR-mediated inhibition of YfiN activity and YfiN feedback control produces a highly toxic situation, similar to that observed for feedback negative mutants of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> DgcA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Christen2">[21]</xref>. This in turn implies that YfiN, in addition to its regulation by YfiR, is subject to tight feedback control via I-site binding of c-di-GMP. Together, these data strongly indicate that the diguanylate cyclase YfiN is subject to tight negative control by YfiR and that YfiB, directly or indirectly, counteracts this inhibitory effect.</p>

<title>YfiR is a periplasmic protein</title>
<p>Epistasis experiments indicated that YfiR plays an important role in regulating YfiN activity, possibly by relaying information from YfiB in the outer membrane to YfiN in the cytoplasmic membrane. Such a mechanism would predict that YfiR is located in the periplasm. To test this and due to the absence of an effective YfiR antibody, <italic>yfiR</italic> triple-M2 tagged (<italic>yfiR-M2</italic>) reporter strains were constructed. Insertion of the <italic>yfiR-M2</italic> allele into the att-Tn<italic>7</italic> locus of a Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant restored the wild type phenotype, indicating that YfiR-M2 is fully functional (data not shown). The subcellular location of YfiR-M2 was subsequently investigated upon fractionation of cell extracts by ultracentrifugation followed by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Because YfiB is predicted to localize to the outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Bendtsen1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Soding1">[72]</xref>, it was included as a control. As expected, YfiB almost exclusively localized to the insoluble, membrane-associated fraction. YfiR-M2 was found exclusively in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, a strain expressing both <italic>yfiR-M2</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> (PA01 <italic>yfiR-M2</italic> pAD6-Î©) was subjected to periplasmic extraction by osmotic shock, and the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. As expected for a cytosolic protein, GFP was detected in the whole-cell and spheroplast fractions only, confirming that cell fractionation did not result in spheroplast lysis. In contrast, YfiR-M2 was found exclusively in the periplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

The separate fractions are labeled as follows: C â=â whole cell sample, L â=â cell lysate, S â=â soluble fraction, M â=â membrane fraction. YfiB localizes to the membrane fraction, YfiR-M2 to the soluble fraction. B) Periplasmic localization of YfiR. Periplasmic fractionation was carried out with PA01 <italic>yfiR</italic>-M2 pAD6Î©, and YfiR-M2 and GFP were detected by immunoblot analysis. GFP localizes to the spheroplast (cytosolic/membrane) fraction, while YfiR-M2 localizes to the periplasmic fraction. C) <italic>In-vivo</italic> crosslinking of YfiR-M2. Whole cell samples of PA01 <italic>yfiR</italic>-M2, Î<italic>yfiN yfiR</italic>-M2, and Î<italic>yfiBN yfiR</italic>-M2 mutant strains were crosslinked by addition of formaldehyde and YfiR-M2 detected by immunoblot analysis. 0 â=â sample before crosslinking; 20â=â sample taken 20 min after formaldehyde addition; 20*â=â20 min sample, boiled to break crosslinks. Black arrows indicate major bands corresponding in size to an YfiR-M2 monomer (20 kDa) and an YfiR-M2 oligomer (40 kDa), respectively. D) Bacterial two-hybrid analysis of YfiN and YfiR interactions. Positive interactions produce a red color on MacConkey indicator plates. Clockwise from top left, the cartoons denote YfiN-YfiN, YfiR-YfiR and HAMP domain-YfiN interactions.

<p>To provide further evidence for the periplasmic location of YfiR, an <italic>yfiR-phoA</italic> fusion was analyzed. This construct was able to complement the SCV morphology of a Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s005">Figure S2B</xref>), indicating that the YfiR section of the fusion protein was fully functional. PA01 wild type containing the full length YfiR-PhoA fusion displayed strong phosphatase activity, with a large proportion of this activity localized to the periplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s005">Figure S2A</xref>). In contrast, an <italic>yfiR-phoA</italic> allele lacking the presumable YfiR export signal was unable to complement the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV morphology and showed little or no phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s005">Figure S2A, B</xref>). Finally, an <italic>yfiR-Mcherry</italic> fusion was constructed and shown to fully complement the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV phenotype (data not shown). When protein localization was visualized by fluorescence microscopy in PA01, the red fluorescent YfiR fusion protein was found exclusively in the cell perimeter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s005">Figure S2C</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that YfiR is indeed located primarily in the periplasm.</p>
<p>The genetic interaction between YfiB and YfiR together with their presumable location in the outer membrane and periplasm, respectively, prompted us to gather more direct evidence for a link between YfiB and YfiR function. <italic>In vivo</italic> cross-linking experiments were performed, in which YfiR-M2 containing strains were treated with formaldehyde followed by immunoblot analysis of the cross-linked lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In a wild type background, formaldehyde treated samples showed a clear shift of YfiR-M2 from the monomeric state (19.8 kDa, without the signal sequence) to a multimer of approximately 40â42 kDa. This multimer was absent in a strain that lacked both YfiB and YfiN (Î<italic>yfiBN yfiR-M2</italic>), but was present in a strain that only lacked YfiN (Î<italic>yfiN yfiR-M2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that YfiB, but not YfiN, is required for YfiR oligomerisation. Immunoblotting with YfiB antiserum failed to detect a band of similar size (data not shown). Whilst the nature of the YfiR multimer is currently unknown, its size is consistent with an YfiR-YfiR homodimer.</p>
<p>Bacterial-two hybrid analysis failed to provide evidence for direct interaction between YfiR and the isolated periplasmic or cytoplasmic domains of YfiN, and between YfiB and any other protein variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s003">Table S3</xref>). Given the different subcellular localization of these proteins some of these negative results might reflect limitations in the experimental procedure. A truncated variant of YfiR missing the predicted signal peptide (residues 1-34) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Bendtsen1">[70]</xref> interacted strongly with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with the results obtained from cross-linking experiments (see above). Also, while no interaction was observed with the full-length YfiN (data not shown), a truncated version of YfiN missing its transmembrane region (residues 1-182) formed strong interactions with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), arguing that, like other DGCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Paul2">[74]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-De1">[76]</xref>, YfiN functions as a dimer and that the membrane spanning part of YfiN negatively controls YfiN dimerisation. The isolated HAMP domain, but not the isolated GGDEF domain of YfiN also interacted with the truncated YfiN variant, suggesting that the HAMP domain is involved in YfiN multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that YfiB and YfiR are localized outside of the cell and together control YfiN activity.</p>

Disruption of <italic>pel</italic> (<italic>pelG</italic>::Tn) or <italic>psl</italic> (Î<italic>pslAB</italic>) strongly attenuated the SCV phenotype of a Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant, resulting in strains with altered colony morphologies and Congo Red binding on LB-agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), as well as significantly reduced attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, a <italic>pelG::Tn</italic> Î<italic>pslAB</italic> Î<italic>yfiR</italic> triple mutant exhibited a smooth colony morphology, a marked loss of Congo Red binding and complete abolishment of surface attachment.

Over-expression of <italic>wspR19</italic>, which encodes a constitutively active DGC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Aldridge1">[52]</xref> produced high levels of attachment, comparable to the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant.

<p>Electron micrographs of PA01 and Î<italic>yfiR</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s006">Figure S3</xref>) showed cells embedded in a dense matrix of thin fibres. This matrix was markedly thicker for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant, and the cells in this case appeared to form a more structured biofilm. In PA01, disruption of both <italic>pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> greatly reduced biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s006">Figure S3</xref>). In the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> background, disruption of <italic>pel</italic> did not abolish biofilm formation, but the biofilm that was formed displayed few extracellular fibres, suggesting that Pel is a component of the extracellular matrix. Î<italic>yfiR</italic> Î<italic>pslAB</italic> produced both a biofilm and extracellular fibres, but the latter in this case were irregularly distributed and had a âraggedâ appearance, in contrast to the thick, even matrix seen with the parental Î<italic>yfiR</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s006">Figure S3</xref>). Little or no biofilm formation was observed when both <italic>pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> were disrupted in either <italic>yfiR</italic> background (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that de-repression of YfiN leads to the activation of the Pel and Psl exopolysaccharide systems, and that most of the morphological and behavioral characteristics of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV are mediated by the up-regulation of Pel and Psl.</p>

<p>The clinical SCV phenotype is associated with persistence in CF lung infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler3">[7]</xref>. In addition, SCV is a highly aggregative phenotype associated with over-production of exopolysaccharide in both clinical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kirisits1">[4]</xref> and lab strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Friedman1">[77]</xref>. To determine whether <italic>yfiBNR</italic> mutations give rise to SCVs in CF lung infections, ten SCV strains isolated from the sputum of CF patients were transformed with pMR20-<italic>yfiR-M2</italic>. The SCV phenotype of one of these strains, ClinSCV-110, was abolished by <italic>yfiR-M2</italic> expression, similarly to the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s007">Figure S4</xref>).

<p>To assay the persistence behavior of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant and to test the hypothesis that persistence was related to the exopolysaccharide components of the biofilm, we analyzed the interaction of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant with both murine immune cells and external predators. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, incubated for 72 hours on minimal agar plates onto which drops of PA01 had been spotted grew to maturity with no apparent adverse effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, panel 1). In contrast, nematodes incubated with Î<italic>yfiR</italic> were starved, with many individuals in the dauer larva stage, a stage reflecting low food resources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, panel 2). When incubated for three hours on GFP-labeled cells, the gut of nematodes fed with PA01 was filled with green bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, panel 1 inset), while nematodes fed on Î<italic>yfiR</italic> showed almost no bacteria in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, panel 2 inset). Disruption of either the <italic>pel</italic> or <italic>psl</italic> operon alone was insufficient to overcome the resistance of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant to effective nematode scavenging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, panels 3-4). However, a Î<italic>yfiR pelG</italic>::Tn Î<italic>pslAB</italic> triple mutant was consumed readily; nematodes incubated with this strain grew to maturity in the same way as with wild type PA01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, panel 5).

<p>To investigate the interaction of Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant cells with professional phagocytic cells of the immune system, J774 macrophages were incubated with GFP-labeled PA01 variants. When incubated for three hours with PA01 wild type, 71.9Â±4.8% of the macrophages had taken up at least one bacterium. In contrast, only 5.6Â±2.3% of the macrophages had phagocytosed Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant cells, indicating that the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV phenotype confers substantial resistance to macrophage phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To investigate the contribution of the Pel and Psl systems to interference with internalization, the assay was repeated with Î<italic>yfiR pelG::Tn</italic> and Î<italic>yfiR</italic> Î<italic>pslAB</italic> mutant strains. The percentage of macrophages that had taken up at least one bacterium rose to 42.8Â±6.0% for the Î<italic>yfiR pelG::Tn</italic>, 27.0Â±4.5% for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> Î<italic>pslAB</italic>, and to 75.6Â±5.3% for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> Î<italic>pslAB pelG::Tn</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The observation that phagocytosis of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV mutant was fully restored upon disruption of the <italic>pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> loci not only provided further evidence that these exopolysaccharides represent one of the main cellular outputs for the YfiBNR system, but in agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Leid1">[78]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Conway1">[79]</xref> also confirms the notion that matrix engulfment enables bacterial cells to escape the host immune response.</p>
<p>In addition to interfering with internalization, the different <italic>yfi</italic>, <italic>psl</italic>, and <italic>pel</italic> mutants displayed markedly different surface attachment phenotypes in this assay. Clusters of extracellular Î<italic>yfiR</italic> (<italic>pel</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>psl</italic><sup>+</sup>) mutant cells observed in the macrophage phagocytosis assay showed a specific âspider-likeâ organization, where cells spread out from the central region of aggregation along a number of defined trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The pattern for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> Î<italic>pslAB</italic> mutant was markedly different in that cells randomly spread out from the central region in every direction, lacking the radial tracks seen for Î<italic>yfiR</italic> spreading. In contrast, the Î<italic>yfiR pelG::Tn</italic> mutant, although unable to form large clusters of aggregated cells, appeared to be organized into similar linear trajectories as the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). No particular cell arrangement was observed for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> Î<italic>pslAB pelG::Tn</italic> triple mutant, although few non-phagocytosed cells were seen for this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These observations suggest that Pel and Psl not only contribute to cell adherence, biofilm formation, and protection against phagocytosis, but also mediate a specific architecture of surface attached microcolonies.</p>
<p>Given the clear differences in physical interaction between macrophages and SCVs, we sought to test whether these differences were mirrored in the internal response of the immune cells. To test whether the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV phenotype affected macrophage activation or cytotoxicity, nuclear NF-ÎºB translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s008">Figure S5</xref>) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s009">Figure S6</xref>) was determined in J774 macrophages infected with PA01 wild type and mutant cells, respectively. No significant difference in macrophage activation was seen between samples infected with PA01 or the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant. When siderophore production was measured for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> strain, increased levels of pyoverdin and pyochelin were found compared with wild type PA01 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s010">Figure S7</xref>). An increase in the production of siderophores and other excreted âscavengerâ molecules would appear to be consistent with the persistence phenotype proposed for SCV strains. The Î<italic>yfiR</italic> strain also showed increased production of the phenazine pyocyanin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s010">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

<title>The Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV phenotype persists in a murine subcutaneous catheter infection</title>
<p>Although the auto-aggregative and slow growing SCV morphotypes are at a considerable disadvantage under conditions that permit rapid growth, they are able to persist <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler3">[7]</xref>. This phenomenon might be explained by conditions in the host environment (e.g. immune system attack or antimicrobial chemotherapy) that put an even higher burden on rapidly growing, non-adherent strains and thus provide selection for SCVs. To test this, we compared the competitive behavior of PA01 wild type and Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV strains <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. When grown in LB the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV strain was significantly outperformed by the wild type. Also, suppressors with wild type colony morphology quickly arose in every Î<italic>yfiR</italic> sample, forming the majority of the cell population after 18 hours incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The addition of increasing concentrations of tobramycin in the sub-inhibitory range led to a reduction of both wild type and Î<italic>yfiR</italic> cell numbers. However, wild type growth decreased at a much steeper rate and at 1.5 Âµg/ml tobramycin, no significant difference in cfu numbers was observed between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Likewise, in the presence of tobramycin the number of suppressors arising from Î<italic>yfiR</italic> dropped sharply with no suppressors arising at concentrations above 0.5 Âµg/ml of the inhibitor. Thus, the fitness disadvantage of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV is strongly reduced in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of tobramycin. Two observations indicate that this effect is not linked to some form of antibiotic tolerance of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV, but rather reflects converging fitness during slow growth under stressful conditions. Firstly, a similar relative increase of Î<italic>yfiR</italic> fitness compared to wild type was observed when cells were grown at reduced temperatures (data not shown). Secondly, no differences in MIC were seen between PA01 and Î<italic>yfiR</italic> for tobramycin or for any of the other antibiotics tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000804.s011">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant in a mouse catheter model with respect to its <italic>in vivo</italic> persistence behavior. Total bacterial numbers and colony morphologies were scored in the catheters and in the surrounding tissue four and eight weeks after infection with PA01 wild type, Î<italic>yfiR</italic> and Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> mutants, either individually or in competition. When strains were infected individually, total numbers of Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutants scored within the catheter were significantly lower after four weeks as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between the corresponding tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Likewise, in four week competition experiments, the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant was strongly outperformed by wild type in the catheter but less so in the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). After eight weeks of infection, viable counts of wild type cells were significantly reduced in the catheter compared with four-week infections. However, no significant drop in cfu/ml was noted for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant between four and eight weeks, accounting for an improved relative performance of the SCV mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In competition assays after eight weeks the wild type/Î<italic>yfiR</italic> ratio decreased relative to the four-week results in both catheter and tissue samples. While a small (non-significant) disadvantage was still seen for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant in the catheter, no such disadvantage was noted for the eight-week tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). The improved relative performance of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant appeared to be due to a reduction in the number of wild type cfus, rather than an increase in SCVs. Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> no suppressors of the SCV morphology arose for any of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant samples over the entire course of the experiment, in contrast to the rapid emergence of suppressors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). No significant differences were seen between wild type and the Î<italic>yfiBNR</italic> strain after four weeks, either in single infections or competition experiments (data not shown).</p>
<p>Together this demonstrates that the slow-growing Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV mutant, although suffering from a tremendous growth disadvantage, shows characteristic persistence behavior under antibiotic selection and during prolonged infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we identify and characterize YfiBNR, an important regulatory system involved in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation and <italic>in vivo</italic> persistence. Our research suggests that YfiB and YfiR are upstream regulatory components of the YfiN diguanylate cyclase, which represents the cellular readout of the system. Activation of YfiN results in c-di-GMP production, and the activation of several downstream targets affecting cell motility and exopolysaccharide production. We identify YfiR as a key player in containing YfiN activity. Mutants lacking YfiR strongly activate YfiN leading to a characteristic SCV phenotype distinguished by slow growth, reduced motility, a highly aggregative and wrinkled colony morphology, strong attachment to surfaces, and persistence <italic>in vivo</italic>. Epistatic and biochemical analyses led to a model for YfiBNR function and control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), wherein YfiR acts as small periplasmic protein that is able to tightly repress the activity of the membrane-localized DGC YfiN. YfiB counteracts YfiR-mediated repression of YfiN and hence leads to increased c-di-GMP production. YfiB is a homolog of the Pal family of lipoproteins that are anchored either in the inner or outer membrane and directly interact with the peptidoglycan structure via a conserved peptidoglycan-binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Parsons1">[69]</xref>. Because mutations of the <italic>tol-pal</italic> genes induce hypersensitivity to external stress-factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Godlewska1">[80]</xref>, it is possible that YfiB plays a role in sensing envelope stress, and, in response, stimulates an SCV response by relaying changes in the outer cell layer to YfiN via YfiR. The observation that DGCs like YfiN are active as dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Paul2">[74]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Wassmann1">[75]</xref>, together with the possible YfiB-dependent dimerisation of YfiR is consistent with the idea that YfiR represses YfiN activity by interfering with its oligomerisation state. In this model, YfiB activates YfiN by promoting the oligomerisation of YfiR, freeing YfiN to form active dimers and thus produce c-di-GMP. An interesting alternative regulatory mechanism for YfiN has recently been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Ueda1">[81]</xref>. In this scheme, YfiN activity is controlled by de-phosphorylation of the periplasmic domain by the tyrosine phosphatase TpbA. This mechanism could in principle work in parallel with YfiR/YfiB-mediated control of YfiN activity, or as part of the same regulatory pathway. Further experiments are required to fully address the modes of action of YfiB and YfiR, and the regulatory hierarchy of the Yfi system.</p>
<p>While the signals that activate the Yfi system remain to be identified, several of the downstream targets are well known. Genetic experiments indicated that YfiN-mediated induction of the Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides plays a central role in the SCV morphotype. Disruption of either exopolysaccharide operon led to a partial phenotype, while disruption of both systems produced colonies with wild type morphology. Transcription of <italic>pel</italic> was massively increased in the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> strain compared to wild type; much of the increase in Pel exopolysaccharide production in Î<italic>yfiR</italic> may be as a consequence of this increased transcription. Despite the substantial contribution of Psl to the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> phenotype, <italic>psl</italic> transcription was only modestly increased in this mutant, suggesting that c-di-GMP mediated Psl stimulation in Î<italic>yfiR</italic> may be at a different regulatory level. In an <italic>yfiBNR</italic> deletion strain, <italic>pel</italic> transcription and surface attachment drop by approximately 40% when compared to wild type, arguing that the Yfi system contributes significantly to Pel and Psl-dependent biofilm formation under standard laboratory conditions. In contrast to <italic>pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> transcription, <italic>cupA</italic> transcription was strongly repressed in the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant under the conditions tested. Similar reciprocal relationships between exopolysaccharide and fimbrial gene transcription have been noted previously in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Burrowes1">[82]</xref> and <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Tschowri1">[83]</xref>. The physiological relevance of this is unknown, although one may speculate that <italic>cupA</italic> repression is a compensatory response to the enhanced production of Pel and Psl in the SCV state. The patterns of biofilm formation and surface attachment observed suggested critical roles for Pel and Psl in the formation and organization of SCV colonies, respectively. The Î<italic>yfiR</italic> (<italic>pel</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>psl</italic><sup>+</sup>) mutant strain formed clusters of aggregated cells, from which cells radiated along defined trajectories. Whereas disruption of the <italic>pel</italic> operon appeared to primarily affect cell-cell association, a <italic>psl</italic> mutation did not affect the number or size of cell clusters, but rather their organization, with cells spreading out from the central region in an apparently random fashion. While Pel appears to provide the principal structural element of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> SCV biofilm, Psl may function more as a scaffold to mediate a specific biofilm architecture and to ensure organized and effective biofilm construction, in agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Ma1">[84]</xref>.</p>
<p>The control of Pel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis appears to be complex, as several c-di-GMP signaling components have been implicated with this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Starkey1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Lee1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Merritt1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Bantinaki1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Caiazza1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kuchma2">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Klebensberger1">[45]</xref>. Recently, Starkey and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Starkey1">[13]</xref> described two classes of lab-derived SCVs, which in many respects resemble the phenotype of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant. While the molecular nature of class B SCVs is unclear, members of class A could be complemented by <italic>wspF</italic>, arguing that they were caused by mutations that activate the WspR DGC pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Hickman1">[12]</xref>. Both classes of SCVs over-produce exopolysaccharides and display a transcriptional profile for <italic>pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> similar to that observed here for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV. Likewise, CupA fimbrial adhesins do not play a role in the SCV phenotype of either sub-class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Starkey1">[13]</xref>. Loss of function mutations in <italic>yfiR</italic> are thus prime candidates for class B SCVs. Clinical and lab-derived SCVs are physiologically similar, with a number of characteristic phenotypes in common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Kirisits1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Starkey1">[13]</xref>. Because of the relatively high frequency of loss of function mutations, both <italic>wspF</italic> and <italic>yfiR</italic> might be important targets for genetic adaptations leading to clinical SCV development. In support of this, <italic>wspF</italic> mutations have already been identified in long-term <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CF isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Smith1">[2]</xref>. Similarly, the SCV phenotype of strain ClinSCV-110 appears to derive from an <italic>yfi</italic> mutation. In addition to ClinSCV-110, another potential candidate for a clinical <italic>yfiR</italic> SCV has also been isolated, although the genetic basis for this SCV has not yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Meissner1">[11]</xref>. The clinical isolate SCV-20265 reverted to a wild type phenotype upon mutation of <italic>yfiN</italic>, strongly implicating the Yfi system in the generation of the SCV phenotype. Surprisingly, CupA adhesin is an important component of the SCV phenotype of SCV-20265, contrary to our findings for the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Meissner1">[11]</xref>. A possible explanation for this is that the downstream targets of YfiN in SCV-20265 may differ from those seen in the laboratory strain.</p>
<p>The SCV phenotype caused by de-repression of the YfiN DGC conferred a marked resistance to nematode scavenging and phagocytosis by macrophages. This phenotype was shown to be strongly dependent on exopolysaccharide production, with concomitant disruption of the <italic>pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> operons restoring the ability of nematodes to scavenge, and macrophage phagocytosis levels to those of wild type PA01. There is evidence to suggest that this resistance to phagocytosis derives from the protection offered to each individual cell by the exopolysaccharide, rather than being a consequence of cell aggregation. First, macrophages are able to take up particles larger than many of the SCV cell aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Cannon1">[85]</xref>. Second, in contrast to wild type cells, many single cells of the SCV strain remained un-internalized even after several hours of co-incubation with macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000804-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This phenotype is in agreement with the role of mannose receptors as major phagocytic receptors for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Speert1">[86]</xref>. Exopolysaccharides may sterically hinder binding or alter macrophage surfaces and internalization via mannose receptors. Enhanced resistance to the immune system may help to explain the persistence of SCV infections in the subcutaneous catheter infection model. Although bacterial counts of the SCV strain were initially lower due to the severe growth impediment of this strain, SCV cell numbers remained constant over eight weeks in both catheter and neighboring tissue samples. In contrast, numbers of wild type cells rapidly declined during the same time window. The exact molecular basis for SCV persistence <italic>in vivo</italic> is currently unclear. However, given the resistance to macrophage phagocytosis seen <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in the absence of complicating external factors such as antibiotic stress, it is tempting to speculate that the competitive advantage of SCVs compared with wild type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells in long term infections is due to immune evasion. The better relative performance of the YfiN-mediated SCV strain in tissue compared with catheters would suggest that exopolysaccharide protection against phagocytosis plays a more important role in the surrounding tissue, consistent with an increased exposure to the vascularized immune system. Cells in a bacterial biofilm have been shown to be highly tolerant of antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Gilbert1">[87]</xref>, with tolerance attributed to characteristics including biofilm structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Gordon1">[88]</xref>, persister cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Spoering1">[89]</xref> and slow growth rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Gilbert2">[90]</xref>. Resistance to phagocytosis and clearance, especially following aggressive antibiotic therapy when the bacterial load of an infection is lower, and the relative risk of exposure to immune cells is correspondingly higher, might thus contribute to the SCV persistence phenotype in CF patients.</p>
<p>Although the persistence effect of the <italic>ÎyfiR</italic> SCV strain observed in these experiments was significant, even after eight weeks of infection wild type counts were still comparable with those of the mutant. Likewise, no SCVs arose in the animals from wild type samples, contrary to the situation in CF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Haussler2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Reinhardt1">[6]</xref>. Longer periods of infection, higher infection load, and external challenges (e.g. antibiotic stress) may increase the competitive advantage of SCVs, resulting in a higher proportion of SCVs and the evolution of new SCV morphotypes from the wild type population. In support of this hypothesis, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of tobramycin was shown to significantly reduce the number of suppressors arising in an <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of the Î<italic>yfiR</italic> SCV strain, and at higher concentrations, decreased the relative fitness advantage of wild type PA01 over SCV. In addition, it is possible that the comparatively large number of persister cells found in biofilms could further increase the advantage of SCV-generating mutations in the presence of antibiotic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Spoering1">[89]</xref>. Work is ongoing to investigate these possibilities.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel c-di-GMP regulatory system, and investigated its role both in wild type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and in the SCV morphotype. While homologous systems have been mentioned previously in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Girgis1">[91]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000804-Giddens1">[92]</xref>, this work represents the first comprehensive experimental analysis of the YfiBNR system. The YfiN cyclase is tightly controlled by its upstream regulatory system, while loss of this control leads to the formation of a strong SCV phenotype. In the SCV form, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> adopts a hyper-adherent, aggregative lifestyle, with significant implications for immune evasion and ultimately for long term persistence of infection. Further research should determine the extent to which these findings are relevant to chronic colonization in patients with CF and implant-borne infections.</p>
