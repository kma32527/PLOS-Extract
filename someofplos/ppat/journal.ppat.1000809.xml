<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> RNAIII is the intracellular effector of the quorum sensing system that temporally controls a large number of virulence factors including exoproteins and cell-wall-associated proteins. Staphylocoagulase is one major virulence factor, which promotes clotting of human plasma. Like the major cell surface protein A, the expression of staphylocoagulase is strongly repressed by the quorum sensing system at the post-exponential growth phase. Here we used a combination of approaches <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> to analyze the mechanism used by RNAIII to regulate the expression of staphylocoagulase. Our data show that RNAIII represses the synthesis of the protein through a direct binding with the mRNA. Structure mapping shows that two distant regions of RNAIII interact with <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and that the mRNA harbors a conserved signature as found in other RNAIII-target mRNAs. The resulting complex is composed of an imperfect duplex masking the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and of a loop-loop interaction occurring downstream in the coding region. The imperfect duplex is sufficient to prevent the formation of the ribosomal initiation complex and to repress the expression of a reporter gene <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the double-strand-specific endoribonuclease III cleaves the two regions of the mRNA bound to RNAIII that may contribute to the degradation of the repressed mRNA. This study validates another direct target of RNAIII that plays a role in virulence. It also illustrates the diversity of RNAIII-mRNA topologies and how these multiple RNAIII-mRNA interactions would mediate virulence regulation.</p>

<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and is one of the main causes of community- as well as hospital-acquired infections. <italic>S. aureus</italic> produces a large number of virulence factors that are expressed in a coordinated manner and at appropriate time and space. To this end, a set of multiple <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators, including regulatory proteins and RNA, is brought into play. The ability of organisms to use RNA to modulate gene expression is a relatively new concept. This is the case for the largest regulatory RNA, <italic>S. aureus</italic> RNAIII, which controls the switch between the expression of surface proteins and excreted toxins. Here we used a combination of approaches <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> to analyze the mechanism used by RNAIII to regulate the expression of one major virulence factor, staphylocoagulase, which promotes clotting of human plasma. We found that RNAIII regulates the expression of staphylocoagulase through direct interactions with its mRNA. RNAIII binds to two distant regions of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA to arrest translation and in a coordinated manner, the endoribonuclease III recognizes the formed duplex to initiate degradation of the repressed mRNA. Staphylocoagulase belongs to the early expressed virulence factors, such as protein A, that are repressed by RNAIII using a similar dual mechanism. This study illustrates the diversity of RNAIII-mRNA topologies and how these multiple RNAIII-mRNA interactions would mediate virulence regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is ubiquitous in the environment and is a commensal organism found on human skin. This major human pathogen is the most common cause of hospital- and community-acquired infections. Therefore, <italic>S. aureus</italic> has developed a plethora of strategies to survive in various environmental niches. The broad range of human infections caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> is in part due to the production of a large number of virulence factors. These factors mediate cell and tissue adhesion, contribute to tissue damage and spreading, and protect the bacteria against the host immune defense system. Coordinated virulence gene expression is thought to be critical for infection and is orchestrated by multiple factors involving two-component systems, global regulatory proteins, and the quorum-sensing system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick2">[2]</xref>. Quorum-sensing regulation in staphylococci is mainly driven by the <italic>agr</italic> system, which was shown to exert a variety of functions in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick2">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Queck1">[3]</xref>. The <italic>agr</italic> system is composed of two divergent transcription units, RNAII and RNAIII. RNAII contains a density-sensing cassette (<italic>agr</italic>D and B) and a two-component sensory transduction system (<italic>agr</italic>A and C). Upon a threshold level of cell density, the response regulatory protein, AgrA, activates the transcription of its own operon and of the regulatory RNAIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick3">[4]</xref>. Recent data show the existence of two distinct <italic>agr</italic> regulatory circuits; one is RNAIII-independent and the other is RNAIII-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Queck1">[3]</xref>. Although RNAIII controls the expression of many virulence factors, the expression of several enzymes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms are downregulated by an unknown mechanism that is independent of RNAIII. Furthermore, AgrA directly activates the synthesis of several phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides at the transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Queck1">[3]</xref>. Hence, AgrA and RNAIII act in concert to regulate the synthesis of many proteins in response to cell density, interconnecting metabolism, and virulence gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Queck1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Dunman1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Somerville1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>RNAIII has a dual function because it acts as a mRNA that encodes a PSM peptide, Δ-hemolysin, and temporally controls the switch between early expression of surface proteins and late expression of several exotoxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick1">[1]</xref>. RNAIII belongs to the class of <italic>trans-</italic>acting RNAs, which regulate several mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-ToledoArana1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Waters1">[8]</xref>. The 5′ domain of RNAIII activates translation of <italic>hla</italic> mRNA (encoding α-hemolysin) by preventing the formation of an intramolecular mRNA structure that sequesters the <italic>hla</italic> ribosome binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Morfeldt1">[9]</xref>. The 3′ end and the central domain of RNAIII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) repress the synthesis of early expressed cell surface virulence factors (protein A, fibrinogen-binding protein) as well as the transcriptional regulator, Rot, the repressor of toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Geisinger1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>. We have previously shown that the 3′ domain of RNAIII, which is the most highly conserved domain, could also form base pairings with <italic>coa</italic> mRNA encoding staphylocoagulase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>. Staphylocoagulase is an extracellular protein produced by almost all clinical isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which specifically forms a complex with prothrombin, the so-called staphylothrombin, to promote fibrin formation in human plasma. Like the major cell surface protein A, the synthesis of staphylocoagulase is growth-phase dependent, and the protein is produced during exponential growth and rapidly repressed by the <italic>agr</italic> system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Lebeau1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>We show here that RNAIII is responsible for the <italic>in vivo</italic> repression of staphylocoagulase at the post-transcriptional level. This results from a direct interaction of two distant domains of RNAIII with <italic>coa</italic> mRNA. The complex is formed rapidly and is stable enough to prevent the binding of the ribosomal 30S subunit and, in addition, provides binding sites for the endoribonuclease III. Thus, <italic>coa</italic> mRNA belongs to the RNAIII-dependent repressed mRNAs that are regulated by a similar mechanism. This work and previous data also illustrate the variety of RNAIII-mRNA topologies that are sufficient to block the access of the ribosome at the initiation step.</p>

<title>RNAIII regulates the synthesis of staphylocoagulase at the post-transcriptional level</title>
<p>Sequence complementarity between RNAIII [nucleotides (nts) 391 to 437] and <italic>coa</italic> mRNA (nucleotides 15 to 52) suggested that the 3′ domain of RNAIII can repress <italic>coa</italic> expression at the post-transcriptional level through the formation of RNAIII-mRNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>. To validate the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of such a mechanism, we analyzed the expression of gene reporter constructs in various <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains that expressed the wild type RNAIII or truncated versions of RNAIII. The 5′ start of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was determined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) showing that the 5′ untranslated region contains 35 nucleotides upstream the AUG initiation codon. The entire leader regulatory region of the <italic>coa</italic> gene, including 88 nucleotides of the coding sequence, was cloned in-frame with the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene into the pTCV-<italic>lac</italic> shuttle vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Poyart1">[14]</xref>. This construct is under control of an <italic>agr</italic>-independent promoter (P<italic>rpo</italic>B). The β-galactosidase activity was determined in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain LUG1467 (wt, <italic>rnaIII</italic>+), which express RNAIII and in LUG1457 (Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic>), which carries a deletion of the <italic>rnaIII</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We also measured the synthesis of the β-galactosidase from the <italic>coa</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion in the strains lacking the <italic>rnc</italic> gene, encoding the endoribonuclease III (RNase III) (LUG1446, Δ<italic>rnc</italic>), or of <italic>hfq</italic> gene, encoding the Sm-like Hfq protein (LUG1445, Δ<italic>hfq</italic>). The β-galactosidase activity was reduced six-fold in the LUG1467 strain (wt, <italic>rnaIII</italic><sup>+</sup>) compared to the LUG1457 (Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic>) strain. Furthermore, Hfq had no significant effect on the RNAIII-dependent repression, while the deletion of <italic>rnc</italic> alleviated the repression of the <italic>coa</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>β-galactosidase activity detected from different gene fusions. β-galactosidase activity measured from P<italic>rpoB-coa (+1/+126)</italic>::<italic>lacZ</italic> fusions in various <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains: LUG1467 (<italic>rnaIII+</italic>, wt), LUG1446-Δ<italic>rnc</italic> (deletion of <italic>rnc</italic> gene encoding RNase III), LUG1445-Δ<italic>hfq</italic> (deletion of <italic>hfq</italic> gene), LUG1457 (Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic>), and LUG1457 transformed with the plasmid expressing the wild type RNAIII, the 3′ domain, RNAIII-Δ13 (RNAIII deleted of hairpin 13), or RNAIII-Δ7–9 (RNAIII deleted of hairpins 7 to 9), or with the plasmid containing no insert (pE194). The β-galactosidase activity was normalized for total cell density and is represented as a percentage of the uninhibited control (LUG1457). The results represented a mean of three independent experiments.</p>

<p>Experiments were also carried out on the LUG1457 strain (Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic>), complemented with different sets of plasmid pLUG274 expressing either the wild-type RNAIII, the 3′ end domain comprising nts 391 to 516, RNAIII-Δ13 (deletion of hairpin 13) or RNAIII-Δ7-9 (deletion of hairpins 7 to 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A control experiment was carried out with the plasmid pE194 with no insert. Unexpectedly, this plasmid slightly decreased the β-galactosidase levels compared to the LUG1457 (Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic>) strain. One explanation would be that the copy number of the pTCV-<italic>lac</italic> derivative was affected by the presence of the multicopy plasmid, pE194, even though both plasmids are compatible. However, derivatives of plasmid pE194 producing high levels of wild-type RNAIII, the 3′ domain, or RNAIII-Δ7-9 reproducibly decreased the synthesis of β-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Conversely, the expression of RNAIII-Δ13, which lacks the base-pairing complementarities with <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, did not alter β-galactosidase synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analyzed the steady-state level of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA in different <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains in late-exponential phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The mRNA was not detected in RN6390 (wt, <italic>rnaIII</italic><sup>+</sup>) while its level was significantly enhanced in the isogenic strain lacking <italic>rnaIII</italic> gene (Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic>). Of interest, in the Δ<italic>rnc</italic> strain, the level of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was reproducibly found to be slightly higher than in the parental wt strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). This result suggests that the RNase III-dependent degradation of the mRNA contributes in part to the disappearance of the mRNA pool. Complementation assays were also done with the mutant Δ<italic>rnaIII</italic> strain transformed with plasmids expressing several variants of RNAIII. The expression of the 3′ domain of RNAIII strongly reduced the level of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA while significant levels of the mRNA were still detected in the strain expressing RNAIII-Δ13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results strongly suggest that RNAIII and RNase III coordinately repress <italic>coa</italic> expression at the post-transcriptional level and that the hairpin 13 of RNAIII is essential for the repression.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>RNAIII binds to two distant regions of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>The predicted base-pairing between RNAIII and <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments suggested that the RNAIII-dependent repression of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was governed by direct RNAIII-mRNA pairing. We thus mapped the regions of interactions using enzymatic and chemical probing. The conformation of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was probed using RNase T1 (specific for unpaired guanines), RNase V1 (specific for helical regions), and several base-specific chemicals such as dimethylsufate (methylates N1A≫N3C), a carbodiimide derivative (modifies N3U≫N1G), and diethylpyrocarbonate (carboxyethylates N7A). Several experiments of RNA structure probing are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. The secondary structure model of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, which explains most of the probing data, is comprised of three stem-loop structures connected by unpaired residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The AU-rich hairpin I is of weak stability but is proposed to occur based on the enzymatic cleavage pattern. However, the coexistence of alternative structures in the region encompassing nucleotides 10 to 70 may explain the concomitant presence of RNase V1 cleavages and the reactivity of many nucleotides at one of their Watson-Crick positions. In contrast, the long hairpin structure III located in the coding region of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA is well supported by the enzymatic cleavage patterns and the non reactivity of the Watson-Crick position of A77 to U85 towards chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). Binding of RNAIII induced changes in the region encompassing the ribosome binding site (RBS, nucleotides U10 to A48). RNAIII protected the guanines of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence against RNase T1 as well as the nucleotides U10 to U18 and A40 to A48 against chemical modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). Concomitantly, RNAIII binding induced new RNase V1 cleavages at positions 39–41 and enhanced reactivity of A21, A24, A25, A29 to A31 at position N1, of A21 at position N7, and of U26 and U27 at position N3 in <italic>coa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). These reactivity changes in the RBS of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA most likely resulted from the binding of the hairpin 13 of RNAIII because its deletion in RNAIII conferred no additional effect on the accessibility of the RBS of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Binding of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA to the 3′ domain or to RNAIII induced correlated changes in hairpin 13. Strong protections were observed at G441 against RNase T1 and at positions 411–415 and 448–449 against RNase V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Concomitantly, increased RNase V1 cleavages were observed at positions 433–434 and 444. All these data are thus consistent with the formation of a RNAIII-mRNA duplex that sequestered the RBS of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This imperfect duplex involves two consecutive regions of 13 base-pairings interrupted by an internal loop and a bulged adenine 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Structure of the RNAIII-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA complex.</title>
<p>(A) Summary of the enzymatic cleavages and chemical reactivities of nucleotides of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA. Enzymatic cleavages are given as follows: RNase T1 (black arrow), and RNase V1 (white arrowhead) moderate, (black arrowhead) strong cleavage. Chemical modifications of cytosines at N3, and adenines at N1 by DMS, of uridines at N3 and guanines at N1 by CMCT, and of adenines at N7 by DEPC: full and dashed circled nucleotides are for strong and moderate reactivity, respectively. No symbol is for non reactive, nd is for not determined due to non-specific cleavages or pauses of RT in the incubation control. The reactivity of A at N7 is reported on the secondary structure shown in the insert. Reactivity changes induced by the binding of RNAIII are indicated as follows: black circles denote strong protection, enhancements and new RNase V1 cleavages are represented by asterisks. (B) Secondary structure model of the RNAIII-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA complex showing the reactivity changes induced by complex formation: RNase V1 (white and black arrowheads), RNase III cleavages (double arrow). Effect of RNAIII binding: Protected nucleotides are squared in black and the nucleotides, which become accessible, are squared in red. (C) The topology of the loop-loop interaction built by graphic modeling based on the probing data. The hairpin III of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA is in green and the hairpin 7 of RNAIII in red. The RNase III cleavages are shown in blue.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, we also found a second RNAIII binding site restricted to the apical loop III of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Binding of RNAIII reduced considerably the RNase T1 cuts at G94-97 and the modifications of the nucleotides UGGGAU98 mediated by the chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2B, E</xref>). Concomitantly, RNAIII binding induced several RNase V1 cuts at positions 96 to 98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These changes were abolished if the complex was formed between <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and the RNAIII deleted of hairpins 7 to 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>coa</italic> mRNA binding to RNAIII reduced significantly the reactivity of the nucleotides CCCA243 towards DMS in the apical loop 7 of RNAIII. These data are strengthened by the sequence complementarities between the apical loop III of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and the hairpin loop 7 of RNAIII and support the existence of a loop-loop interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). This interaction is, however, strongly dependent on the formation of the imperfect duplex because the reactivity changes in the hairpin loop III of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA were significantly decreased if complex formation was performed with RNAIII-Δ13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Molecular modeling of the RNA interaction between the two loops shows an almost continuous stacking from the 3′ side of the helix III of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, through the loop-loop intermolecular helix to the helix of the hairpin 7 of RNAIII. The two connecting loops of three and two nucleotides bridge the grooves of the newly formed helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, the data show that the mRNA-RNAIII complex is composed of a bipartite site, which implies the formation of an imperfect duplex and a loop-loop interaction.</p>

<title>The ribosome binding site of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA is the major recognition site for RNAIII</title>
<p>The contribution of the two binding sites toward complex formation was further evaluated by gel shift assays.

This experiment shows that <italic>coa</italic> mRNA binds to RNAIII or its 3′ domain with a K<sub>d</sub> value of around 10 nM. The deletion of hairpins 7 to 9 in RNAIII had only a two-fold effect on the dissociation constant (around 25 nM), while the deletion of hairpin 13 in RNAIII increased significantly the Kd value by one order of magnitude (around 150 nM).</p>

<p>(A) Determination of the apparent dissociation constant for RNAIII-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA complex. 5′-end-labeled <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was incubated alone (−) or with various concentrations of unlabeled wild type RNAIII, the 3′ domain, RNAIII-Δ7-9, and RNAIII-Δ13 (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 250 nM). The fraction of labeled <italic>coa</italic> mRNA associated with RNAIII or its derivatives was calculated from the counts in the corresponding band relative to the total counts in the lane. The Kd value was estimated as the concentration of RNAIII allowing 50% of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA binding.

<p>The initial rate of wild type RNAIII binding to 5′ end-labeled <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was estimated from a time-course analysis and resulted in an association rate constant of 1.1×10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

We then investigated whether deletion of hairpin 7 or hairpin 13 of RNAIII involved in the binding would affect binding rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The binding rate constant for the mutant RNAIII-Δ7-9-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA pair was identical to the wild type complex (9.35×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). However, for the mutant RNAIII-Δ13-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA pair, the value was significantly decreased by one order of magnitude lower (1.1×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). These experiments strongly suggest that initial pairings involved the hairpin 13 of RNAIII and that this motif confers stable binding to <italic>coa</italic> mRNA.</p>

<title>RNAIII binding to <italic>coa</italic> mRNA interferes with the formation of the initiation complex</title>
<p>Since RNAIII binds to the SD sequence of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, we analyzed whether RNAIII binding is sufficient to prevent the formation of the ternary initiation complex formed with the <italic>S. aureus</italic> 30S subunit, initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup>, and <italic>coa</italic> mRNA. Formation of the ternary complex, which blocked the elongation of a cDNA primer by reverse transcriptase, produced a toeprint at U49/A50, 15 nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Hartz1">[17]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Intriguingly, a second toeprint resulting from ribosome binding was also observed at A14; this weak toeprint was not detected with the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal 30S subunit (result not shown). Binding of RNAIII, RNAIII-Δ7–9 (deleted of hairpins 7 to 9), or RNAIII-Δ14 (deleted of hairpin 14) strongly decreased the two toeprint signals. This indicates that the regulatory RNAIII totally blocks access of the ribosome at the RBS site of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA. The inhibition was observed whether the RNAIII-mRNA complex was pre-formed or RNAIII was added together with the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). This shows that the resulting inhibitory complex is rapidly formed and sufficiently stable to prevent the formation of the ribosomal initiation complex. Using this assay, we were not able to analyze the contribution of the loop-loop interaction in the inhibition of ribosome binding because the primer used for elongation hybridized in the long hairpin loop III. However, the RNAIII-ΔH13 exerted no inhibitory effect on ribosome binding, showing that the specific RNAIII-mediated inhibition of ribosome binding to <italic>coa</italic> mRNA resulted mainly from the sequestration of the RBS by the hairpin 13 of RNAIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<title>RNase III cleaves the two distant mRNA-RNAIII interactions <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>As RNase III is required for efficient repression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we analyzed whether this enzyme can cleave the complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have shown previously that cleavage assays by RNase III can be a useful tool for probing <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA-RNA complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Chevalier1">[18]</xref>. The RNase III-dependent cleavages were probed on the 5′-end labeled RNAs as well as on the native RNAIII-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA complex using a purified His-tagged RNase III from <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5B–C</xref>). Only weak RNase III cleavages were observed in the free <italic>coa</italic> mRNA. When the 5′ end-labeled mRNA was incubated with RNAIII, four major cleavages occurred at positions 32, 34, 39, and 97 in the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5B–C</xref>). Binding of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA induced a RNase III-dependent cleavage at C241 of the labeled RNAIII (results not shown). Thus, the two regions of hybridization were susceptible to RNase III cleavages.</p>
<p>Using truncated versions of RNAIII and the isolated hairpin 7 or the 3′ domain, we were able to assign the partners involved in the RNAIII-mRNA complex. Indeed, the hairpin 7 only induced a specific RNase III-cleavage at position 97 of the mRNA, while the hairpin 13 binding promoted major cleavages at positions 32, 34, and 39 of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Furthermore, the complex formed between RNAIII-Δ7–9 and <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was cleaved efficiently by RNase III at positions 32, 34, and 39 of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Conversely, only one RNase III-mediated cleavage was detected at position 97 of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA bound to RNAIII-Δ13 or to hairpin 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5B–C</xref>). This cleavage was, however, weaker than the cleavage found in the wild type complex. These experiments correlate well with the probing data showing that the loop-loop interaction is stabilized by the duplex formed between the RBS of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and the hairpin 13 of RNAIII. In the irregular duplex, RNase III cleaves only from the mRNA side, whereas the enzyme induces cleavages on both strands of the loop-loop interaction leading to the classical two nucleotides 3′ overhang. Taken together, these data fully support the chemical and enzymatic probing showing that the hairpin 13 of RNAIII binds to the RBS of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, while the hairpin loop 7 forms limited base pairings with the coding sequence. The data further indicate that the loop-loop interaction adopts a topology that is appropriate for efficient RNase III binding and catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Chevalier1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>S. aureus</italic> produces a large variety of virulence factors that are required for the successful colonization of the host and that confer to the bacteria the ability to counteract the immune defense system of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick2">[2]</xref>. Among these virulence factors, staphylocoagulase primarily activates prothrombin, inducing the formation of a fibrin clot around the bacterial cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Kawabata1">[19]</xref>. Coating the bacteria with host proteins contributes to hiding the bacteria from the immune system and from phagocytosis. The expression of coagulase was shown to follow a temporal regulation, as do several adhesins and surface proteins that are expressed earlier than the secreted enzymes, immunotoxins, and cytotoxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Novick2">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, coagulase belongs to the early expressed virulence factors such as protein A, the fibrinogen-binding protein SA1000, and the SsaA-like protein SA2353, which were found to be repressed by the quorum sensing-controlled RNAIII. During the growth cycle, the level of RNAIII varies inversely with that of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Lebeau1">[13]</xref>. In addition, it was shown that the coagulase expression was both positively and negatively controlled by an <italic>agr-</italic> dependent mechanism. A functional <italic>agr</italic> element resulted in a relative elevation of the <italic>coa</italic> mRNA level at the early exponential phase of growth followed by a strong decrease of the mRNA level at the post-exponential phase of growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Lebeau1">[13]</xref>. We demonstrate here that the <italic>agr</italic>-dependent repression effect on <italic>coa</italic> mRNA is most probably the result of a direct binding of RNAIII to <italic>coa</italic> mRNA.</p>
<p>We show that RNAIII in conjunction with RNase III are required to fully repress the synthesis of staphylocoagulase at the stationary phase of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The primary effect of RNAIII would be to prevent translation initiation subsequently followed by the RNase III-dependent cleavage of the repressed mRNA. Since we have previously shown that RNase III binds efficiently to RNAIII, we propose that RNAIII-dependent translation repression and RNase III cleavage are coupled. Hence, these data, together with previous works, show that RNAIII represses the synthesis of coagulase, protein A, SA1000, SA2353, and Rot by a similar mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Geisinger1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>. In addition, probing the mRNA structure also shows that <italic>coa</italic> mRNA adopts a very similar structural organization to <italic>spa</italic> and SA1000 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The three mRNAs have short 5′ untranslated regions, which carry a 5′ hairpin structure with a strong SD sequence located in the apical loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). In the absence of RNAIII, these elements may confer to the mRNAs a high stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Huntzinger1">[11]</xref>. Indeed, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, stabilization of mRNAs was shown to be a consequence of the blocking of the 5′ end by a stalled initiating ribosome at a SD-like sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Mathy1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-DaouChabo1">[21]</xref> or by a stable 5′ hairpin structure and a strong RBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Hambraeus1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, the coordinated action of RNAIII and RNase III would be needed to irreversibly repress the synthesis of these virulence factors at an appropriate time.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays show that RNAIII binds to <italic>coa</italic> mRNA and its other mRNA targets with a rather high association rate constant. Efficient repression by non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), which act at the translational level, requires that the ncRNA binds to target mRNAs within a short time frame, i.e. before the formation of the stable ribosomal initiation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Brantl1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Wagner1">[16]</xref>.

We, however, do not rule out that another protein or RNase III could contribute to stabilize and/or facilitate the formation of the hybrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Huntzinger1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The regions of interaction in RNAIII and <italic>coa</italic> mRNA contained stem-loop structures that are indeed well appropriate for initial loop-loop interactions. The two conserved C-rich loops, 7 and 13, of RNAIII bind to the RBS and to the hairpin loop III in the coding sequence of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g006">6</xref>). These C-rich hairpin loops of RNAIII are also used to repress the other mRNA targets, although the topologies of the resulting inhibitory complexes are different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). RNAIII forms long duplexes with the RBS of <italic>spa</italic> and SA1000 mRNAs, while it forms two loop-loop interactions with the 5′UTR and the RBS of <italic>rot</italic> mRNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Huntzinger1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Here we show that the RNAIII-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA complex involves an imperfect duplex of two stretches of 13 base pairs separated by a bulged loop that sequestered the RBS, and a loop-loop interaction that took place in the coding region. In contrast to <italic>rot</italic> mRNA, in which the two loop-loop interactions were essential for <italic>in vivo</italic> repression, the sequestration of the RBS of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA is sufficient by itself to promote efficient repression <italic>in vivo</italic> and to prevent the formation of the ribosomal initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g006">6</xref>). Indeed, the loop-loop interaction is not essential for efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> repression and contributes only moderately to the stability of the inhibitory complex. Hence, the various topologies of the repressed RNAIII-mRNA complexes depend largely on the mRNA context.</p>
<p>The inhibitory RNAIII-<italic>coa</italic> mRNA complex also provided specific binding sites for the double strand-specific RNase III, which induced strong cleavages in the two regions of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA bound to RNAIII. Notably, the cleavage sites in the loop-loop interaction also occurred at a similar position in the two kissing interactions that took place in the <italic>rot</italic> mRNA-RNAIII complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>). The sequences of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA involved in the loop-loop interactions are very similar to <italic>rot</italic> mRNA, showing that similar signatures exist in various RNAIII-repressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Molecular modeling of the kissing interaction, which took into account the chemical and enzymatic probing data, revealed that the loop-loop interaction induces a coaxial stacking of the two intramolecular helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The overall topology is very similar to the RNA loop-loop structure obtained by NMR, which mimics the interaction between sense and antisense RNAs involved in the regulation of the ColE1 plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Lee1">[26]</xref>. Such a long helical structure might well be appropriate for the binding of the homodimeric enzyme, although the sequence of the kissing interactions might also be a specific binding determinant. Of interest, <italic>coa</italic> mRNA was shown to be completely depleted as soon as RNAIII was produced, and the deletion of <italic>rnc</italic> caused the accumulation of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Lebeau1">[13]</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Therefore, as we postulated previously, RNase III might initiate rapid degradation of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA, and the cleavage in the loop-loop interaction may also contribute to access to several other endo- or exoribonucleases for further degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000809-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Notably, at a similar position, <italic>spa</italic> and SA1000 mRNAs carry a long stem-loop structure in the coding sequence that is also cleaved efficiently by RNase III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Huntzinger1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). In addition, the depletion of the mRNA might also result from an indirect effect of RNAIII. Indeed, Rot protein was shown to activate the transcription of <italic>coa</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-SaidSalim1">[27]</xref>, while RNAIII represses the synthesis of Rot at the post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Geisinger1">[10]</xref>. Thus, the RNAIII-mediated repression of coagulase would occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels as it was shown for <italic>spa</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Geisinger1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Boisset1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-SaidSalim1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is not an exception that RNAIII utilizes conserved C-rich loops to target similar regions of various mRNAs that are functionally related. In <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, GcvB RNA represses translation initiation of multiple target mRNAs by binding to a C/A-rich motif present in all these mRNAs, which encode periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of ABC uptake systems for amino acids and peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Sharma1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Papenfort1">[29]</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> CyaR contains a hairpin loop with a conserved anti-SD sequence that is used to target the SD sequence of a subset of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Papenfort2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-DeLay1">[31]</xref>. Similarly to RNAIII, we recently found that other <italic>S. aureus</italic> ncRNAs carry a similar UCCC signature always present in an unpaired region, and through its unpaired C-rich motif, one of these RNAs binds to the RBS and represses the expression of several mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Geissmann1">[32]</xref>. <italic>S. aureus coa</italic> mRNA and the other mRNA targets of RNAIII carry a strong SD sequence located in an unpaired region that is quite appropriate for the docking of the 30S subunit, but also for the formation of initial contacts with the C-rich loop of RNAIII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000809.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Specificity for <italic>coa</italic> regulation is mainly given by the propagation of the intermolecular contacts to form a long imperfect duplex further stabilized by a loop-loop interaction in the coding sequence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study validates another direct target of RNAIII that plays a role in virulence. Our study further stresses that the RNAIII harbors highly conserved regions that provide a specific signature to generate interactions with the RBS of multiple mRNAs and that the mRNA context directs the topology of the inhibitory complexes. Recent works focusing on <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> show that regulatory RNAs that target mRNAs regulate gene expression through a variety of unusual mechanisms and bind to mRNA regions located far away from the ribosome binding site in the 5′UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Darfeuille1">[33]</xref>, in the coding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Bouvier1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Pfeiffer1">[35]</xref>, and in the 3′ end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000809-Opdyke1">[36]</xref>. Whether <italic>S. aureus</italic> has also evolved such a diversity of RNA-dependent regulatory mechanisms remains to be addressed.</p>
