</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most prevalent human fungal pathogen causing disease in immunocompromised individuals. One key virulence factor, shared by many other microbial pathogens, is its ability to undergo morphogenetic transitions between unicellular and filamentous forms, which interact differentially with the host immune system. Morphogenesis in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is controlled by several signaling pathways, of which the Protein Kinase A (PKA) nutrient sensing pathway is of pivotal importance. Here, we identify a role for a conserved histone deacetylase complex (Set3C) as a key negative regulator of PKA signaling, controlling both morphogenesis and virulence. The genetic removal of the Set3C histone deacetylase complex causes cells to hyperfilament both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and triggers the activation of PKA signaling. Moreover, cells lacking Set3 show strongly attenuated virulence in a mouse infection model. These results provide novel insights about the interplay of chromatin modification and signaling pathways, as exemplified by the control of morphogenesis of pleiomorphic fungi. Furthermore, our work establishes histone deacetylases as potential novel targets for antifungal drug discovery to improve therapeutic approaches combating life-threatening fungal infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a harmless commensal of the mucosal surfaces and gastrointestinal tract of most healthy individuals. However, it can cause severe superficial and disseminated infections, particularly when the immune system of the human host is compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Odds1">[1]</xref>. A major virulence trait of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the ability to switch between several distinct morphologies, including the unicellular yeast-like and the filamentous pseudohyphal and hyphal forms. Since several other fungal pathogens are also dimorphic or even pleiomorphic, including <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> or <italic>Coccidioides immiti</italic>, morphogenesis has been considered a key component of fungal virulence and host invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Rooney1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Gow1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>The switch from the yeast to filamentous forms in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is triggered by a broad range of environmental or host stimuli, including serum, an elevated growth temperature to 37°C <italic>in vitro</italic>, and more specific inducers such as N-acetylglucosamine or estradiol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Brown1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Ernst1">[5]</xref>. The control of this morphological transition involves several signaling pathways and transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Whiteway1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Liu1">[7]</xref>. The most prominent positive regulators are a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and its downstream transcription factor Cph1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Liu2">[8]</xref>, as well as the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its downstream target transcription factor Efg1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Lo1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Stoldt1">[10]</xref>. In addition, filamentation is also under negative control by the transcriptional repressor Tup1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Braun1">[11]</xref>. Tup1-mediated repression requires an interaction between Tup1 with sequence-specific DNA-binding factors such as Nrg1 and Rfg1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Braun2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Kadosh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Murad1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the yeast-filament transition, diploid <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells homozygous for the Mating Type Locus (<italic>MTL</italic>) can also reversibly switch between two distinct cell types termed white and opaque. White cells have a round, yeast-like shape and form dome-shaped colonies on solid agar, while opaque cells display an elongated morphology and form flattened colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Slutsky1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, white cells are unable to mate, whereas opaque cells are mating-competent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Miller1">[16]</xref>. Switching between the two phases is believed to enable <italic>C. albicans</italic> to better adapt to various host niches. For example, white cells are more virulent in a murine systemic infection model, whereas opaque cells colonize the skin more efficiently than white cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Kvaal1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Kvaal2">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>White-opaque switching is reversible and regulated by several transcription factors. The <italic>C. albicans</italic> diploid genome harbors the Mating Type Locus (<italic>MTL</italic>) with two alleles known as <bold>a</bold> and α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hull1">[19]</xref>. The master regulator of switching is <italic>WOR1</italic>, which in <italic>MTL</italic> heterozygous cells is stably repressed by a heterodimeric <bold>a</bold>/α repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Miller1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Huang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Zordan1">[21]</xref>. <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous white cells are devoid of detectable Wor1 expression. By contrast, opaque cells maintain high Wor1 levels for many generations due to multiple positive feed-back loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Zordan2">[22]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>EFG1</italic> is a key negative regulator of <italic>WOR1</italic>, since <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/Δ cells exist predominantly in the opaque phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Sonneborn1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Srikantha1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, we have shown that several histone-modifier enzymes, including the evolutionarily conserved Set3/Hos2 histone deacetylase complex (SetC) also modulate the white-opaque transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hnisz1">[25]</xref>. The related Set3 and Hos2 proteins in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are parts of a similar multiprotein complex (Set3C) that possesses histone deacetylase activity, with multiple functions, including meiosis-specific repression of sporulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Pijnappel1">[26]</xref>, promotion of Ty1 retrotransposons integration at tRNA genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Mou1">[27]</xref>, as well as signaling secretory stress through the PKC cell integrity pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Cohen1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we discover a unique and novel composite phenotype caused by the deletions of key subunits of the Set3/Hos2 complex in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. On solid media, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ mutants display a hyperfilamenous phenotype at elevated temperatures, and specifically in the opaque phase. Surprisingly, in the filamentous forms of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells, Efg1-dependent target genes are induced as a result of an activated cAMP/PKA pathway. Our results establish the Set3C as a PKA-antagonist that fine-tunes the threshold of the yeast-filament conversion. We also show that <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells display strongly attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic infection, which is associated with hyperfilamentation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Strikingly, we demonstrate that inhibition of histone deacetylation by trichostatin A exclusively phenocopies the lack of Set3C but not of any other histone deacetylase in <italic>Candida albicans.</italic> Hence, these data suggest a novel approach for developing antifungal drugs by manipulating the morphogenetic ability of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> through inhibition of chromatin modification.</p>

<p>The Set3 histone deacetylase complex (Set3C) of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> comprises of four core (Set3, Hos2, Snt1, Sif2) and three peripheral subunits (Hos4, Hst1, Cpr1), of which Hos2 and Hst1 display catalytic activities.

<p>Microscopic inspection revealed that wrinkled opaque colonies formed by <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells consisted of mostly filamentous structures with pseudohyphal characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Sudbery1">[29]</xref>. Namely, the cells were elongated and longer than wild type opaque cells, and constrictions were visible at mother-daughter cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s002">S2B</xref>). In addition, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ opaque cells expressed the filament-specific gene <italic>ECE1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Birse1">[30]</xref> at high levels, indicating an active filamentation program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the strong conservation of the yeast Set3C in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we tested whether hyperfilamentation occurs upon deletion of other subunit-genes of the putative complex. Opaque cells lacking the core subunit Hos2 also gave rise to wrinkled colonies consisting of mostly pseudohyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). On the other hand, opaque cells lacking the peripheral subunit Hst1 formed smooth colonies, whereas opaque <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ <italic>hst1</italic>Δ/Δ cells displayed wrinkled colonies, which reverted to smooth ones upon complementing the <italic>SET3-</italic>deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, in <italic>C. albicans</italic> the Set3C is likely to be of similar architecture as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Importantly, the data indicate that loss of a functional Set3C triggers hyperfilamentation of opaque phase cells.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>SET3</italic> promotes filamentation at an elevated temperature</title>
<p><italic>SET3</italic> has been previously identified in a large-scale haploinsufficiency screen as a modulator of filamentation in <italic>MTL</italic> heterozygous <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Uhl1">[31]</xref>. Thus, we constructed several independent hetero- and homozygous <italic>SET3</italic> deletion strains in an <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α background, and compared the morphologies of wild type and deletion mutants on several standard liquid and solid laboratory media. Most notably, the <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ strain displayed hyperfilamentous growth on solid YPD at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). YPD at 30°C was used as standard medium supporting yeast phase growth, whereas YPD supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) were standard conditions that promote filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutants showed a mild hyperfilamentation phenotype on filament-inducing Lee and Spider plates at 37°C.

<p>Microscopic inspection revealed that wrinkled <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ colonies on YPD plates at 37°C consisted of mainly filaments characterized by parallel cell walls and perpendicular septa, the hallmarks of true hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s002">S2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Sudbery1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, under these conditions, filament-specific <italic>ECE1</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ colonies were upregulated, confirming an active filamentation program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Cells lacking the putative core subunits Hos2, Snt1 and Sif2 also gave rise to wrinkled colonies consisting of mostly true hyphae on YPD at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells expressed <italic>ECE1</italic> at comparable levels as <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, <italic>hst1</italic>Δ/Δ cells formed smooth colonies under these conditions. Moreover, the <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ <italic>hst1</italic>Δ/Δ double mutant formed wrinkled colonies, which was reverted upon restoring <italic>SET3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), confirming the notion of a conserved Set3C architecture in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>As expected, the hyperfilamentation on YPD at 37°C was independent of <italic>MTL</italic>-zygosity. Indeed, <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> wild type and mutant white phase strains showed the same characteristics as the respective <italic>MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), supporting the general view that the same genetic mechanisms regulate filamentation in both <italic>MTL</italic> heterozygous and <italic>MTL</italic> homozygous white phase cells.</p>
<p>If loss of Set3C function is the cause of the hyperfilamenting phenotype, biochemical inhibition of the catalytic activity should mimic the loss of the catalytic subunit. Therefore, we examined the morphological development of wild type <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Yoshida1">[32]</xref>. Surprisingly, we found that 10 µg/ml TSA supplementation of solid YPD medium strongly induced filamentation at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). We then examined single deletion <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains lacking all putative histone deacetylase under identical growth conditions in the absence of TSA. Most strikingly, only the loss of the Set3 and Hos2 deacetylase genes induced the yeast-hyphae morphogenetic conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). These results demonstrate that inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by TSA is phenocopied by the loss of the Set3 and Hos2 core subunits of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> Set3C but not of any other histone deacetylase. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that lack of a functional Set3C causes a hyperfilamentation phenotype in <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ mutants.</p>
<p>Several transcription factors involved in morphogenesis, including the positive regulator <italic>EFG1</italic>, as well as the negative regulators <italic>NRG1</italic> or <italic>SSN6,</italic> are themselves regulated at the transcriptional level upon serum-induced yeast-to-hypha transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Braun2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hwang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Tebarth1">[34]</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether repression of <italic>SET3</italic> or <italic>HOS2</italic> is associated with the morphological conversion of wild type cells. However, we found no significant differences between <italic>SET3</italic> and <italic>HOS2</italic> mRNA levels in yeast and hyphal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results confirm that a mechanism other than transcriptional inactivation of <italic>SET3</italic> or <italic>HOS2</italic> must constitute a trigger driving yeast-to-hypha conversion.</p>

<p>The epistasis relations excluded the involvement of a Cph1-dependent mechanism contributing to the effect of <italic>SET3</italic> and <italic>HOS2</italic> deletions, but <italic>EFG1</italic> remained as a possibility. In addition, we also wanted to investigate whether the lack of <italic>SET3</italic> or <italic>HOS2</italic> interferes with the function of Tup1, a known transcriptional repressor promoting yeast-phase growth in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Braun1">[11]</xref>.

<p><italic>RBT2</italic> is a gene repressed by Tup1.

<p>Finally, <italic>SOD5</italic> is expressed at low levels in yeast phase but is induced in an <italic>EFG1</italic>-dependent manner in serum-induced hyphae, and induction is maintained in <italic>tup1</italic>Δ/Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Martchenko1">[40]</xref>.

<p>Is the hyperfilamentation phenotype of white <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells on YPD at 37°C also reverted by adenine supplementation? Unfortunately, it is not possible to address this question directly, because the yeast extract present in YPD contains adenine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Kaiser1">[41]</xref>.

<title>The <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells have a hyperactive cAMP/PKA pathway</title>
<p>Why are the Efg1-dependent target genes activated upon disruption of the Set3C? Efg1 receives input information from two signaling cascades. First, Efg1 is a downstream target of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Briefly, this pathway transmits nutritional signals and involves the activation of the adenylyl-cyclase Cdc35 initiating cAMP synthesis, thereby activating PKA. <italic>C. albicans</italic> harbors two functional PKA catalytic subunits, Tpk1 and Tpk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Biswas1">[42]</xref>. Second, Mkc1, the central MAP kinase of the protein kinase C (PKC) cell integrity pathway sensing cell wall damage, is also proposed to regulate Efg1-dependent morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Kumamoto1">[43]</xref>. Consequently, we tested the contribution of PKA and PKC signaling to the hyperfilamenting phenotypes of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess activation of the PKC pathway, we performed Western blot analysis of the active, phosphorylated form of Mkc1. As expected, under filament-inducing conditions, both wild type and <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells harbored activated and thus phosphorylated Mkc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Surprisingly, a high level of phosphorylated Mkc1 was also apparent in the <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ colonies after three days of incubation on YPD at 37°C, indicating a hyperactive PKC pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, we subsequently found that a lack of <italic>SET3</italic> was epistatic to the deletion of <italic>MKC1</italic>, since the <italic>mkc1</italic>Δ/Δ <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ double mutant displayed filamentous growth on solid YPD at 37°C similar to the <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These data demonstrate that although the PKC pathway appears active in <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells on YPD at 37°C, it is not the cause, but rather a consequence of the active filamentation program.</p>
<p>To address whether an active cAMP/PKA pathway is required for the hyperfilamenting phenotype of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells, we performed epistasis experiments of <italic>SET3</italic> with <italic>CDC35</italic> encoding the adenylyl-cyclase, as well as <italic>TPK1</italic> and <italic>TPK2</italic> encoding the two PKA catalytic subunits. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, lack of <italic>CDC35</italic> prevented both serum- and temperature-induced filamentation of wild type and <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells which was reverted upon supplementing the media with 10 mM cAMP. These data demonstrates that hyperfilamentation of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells requires a functional cAMP/PKA pathway. On the other hand, deletion of <italic>SET3</italic> was epistatic to the deletion of either <italic>TPK1</italic> or <italic>TPK2</italic>, yet these results can be explained by the functional redundancy of the two PKA genes.</p>
<p>To link hyperfilamentation in the absence of Set3C with an increased activity of the cAMP/PKA pathway, we measured the trehalose content of wild type and mutant cultures. Trehalose is a disaccharide present in many yeast species; it is degraded by the neutral trehalase enzyme, which is activated by PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Thevelein1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Uno1">[45]</xref>. As expected, we did not observe differences in the trehalose contents of wild type, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ::<italic>SET3</italic> and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells after growth for two and three days on solid YPD at 30°C supporting yeast phase growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Surprisingly, we failed to detect any differences between the four strains on solid YPD at 37°C, where <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells readily filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s005">S5A</xref>). However, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells contained around 3-fold less (P&lt;0.05) trehalose than wild type or <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ::<italic>SET3</italic> heterozygous colonies when grown for three days on filament-inducing, FCS-supplemented plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s005">S5A</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that differences in trehalose levels between yeast cells and filamentous forms may not be detectable because the colonies contain a mixture of both (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Consequently, we developed a filtration-based method to separate the yeast-phase and filamentous cells of colonies, to yeast and hyphal fractions. Strikingly, we found about 4-fold more trehalose in the yeast fraction when compared to the hyphae fraction (P&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) derived from the same colonies of wild type, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ::<italic>SET3</italic> cells when grown on filament-inducing FCS medium at 37°C. Hence, a decreased trehalose content may reflect a history of PKA-activation, once the yeast-filament conversion has been initiated. In good agreement with this suggestion, a similar decrease in trehalose content was also detectable between the yeast and hyphal fractions of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells grown on YPD medium at 37°C (P&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>To directly assess whether at some stage of differentiation an elevated PKA activity can be detected in the hyperfilamentous <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells, we performed PKA activity assays using total cell extracts derived from wild type, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ::<italic>SET3</italic> cells grown on YPD at 37°C. In these experiments, a fluorescently labeled peptide is phosphorylated by PKA, followed by electrophoretic separation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides and quantification by spectrophotometry (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s005">Figure S5B</xref> and details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Surprisingly, we detected about 2-fold higher PKA activity of the yeast fraction of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells when compared to the wild type (P&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), indicating that this fraction contains a subset of cells harboring an elevated level of active PKA, although this difference is undetectable when comparing whole colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the hyperfilamentous phenotype of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells requires functional cAMP/PKA signaling; differentiated hyphae are associated with a decrease in trehalose, while a subset of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells harbor an elevated level of active PKA when compared to wild type cells.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested if suppression of hyperfilamentation in <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells by exogenous adenine can be rescued by stimulating the cAMP/PKA pathway with exogenous cAMP. Surprisingly, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells indeed displayed a hypersensitive morphogenetic potential in the presence of both exogenous adenine and cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that both adenine and the Set3C can modulate cAMP/PKA signaling, albeit through antagonistic mechanisms.</p>

<title>Non-fermentable carbon sources revert hyperfilamentation of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells</title>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a known substrate of the cAMP/PKA pathway is glucose.

Consequently, we tested if limiting cAMP/PKA signaling by non-fermentable carbon sources reverts the hyperfilamentation of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells. Indeed, the hyperfilamentation effect was only observed if cells were grown on saccharides whose enzymatic degradation yields glucose. By contrast, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells reverted to wild type morphologies in the presence of the non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g007">Figure 7</xref>). A similar suppression was observed when the cells were grown on raffinose as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Since yeasts, including <italic>Candida</italic> species do not have a β-lactamase enzyme, they fail to degrade raffinose (consisting of a glucose, galactose and fructose molecule) to fermentable monosaccharides. These results demonstrate that metabolic conditions normally associated with low cAMP/PKA signaling are sufficient to revert the hyperfilamentation effect of the <italic>SET3</italic>-deletion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The Set3C is a cAMP/PKA-antagonistic repressor of filamentation</title>
<p>Here, we identify the Set3C, an evolutionary conserved histone deacetylase complex, as a repressor of the cAMP/PKA pathway regulating the yeast-to-hypha conversion in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. We provide several lines of evidence that the hyperfilamentation resulting from removing the Set3C is linked to interference with the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. First, deletion of the pathway genes <italic>CDC35</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> is epistatic to the deletion of <italic>SET3</italic> or <italic>HOS2</italic>. Although, <italic>SET3</italic> appears epistatic to both PKA genes <italic>TPK1</italic> and <italic>TPK2,</italic> it can be explained by the functional redundancy of the Tpk1 and Tpk2 enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Bockmuhl1">[47]</xref>. Second, we found that differentiated hyphae contain around 4-times less trehalose than yeast-phase cells. Thus, trehalose content is a possible readout to detect the history of PKA activation during the yeast-to-hypha conversion of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Seemingly contradicting this suggestion, an elevated PKA activity level was detected in the yeast phase fraction of filamentous wrinkled <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ colonies; however, this discrepancy appears logical because of the shortcomings of the filtering procedure used for the separation of morphologies. Namely, in filamentous colonies the differentiated hyphae stick together, yet short filaments are still passing through the filter pores and are found in the yeast fraction (data not shown). We believe that during growth on solid surfaces, a subset of cells reaches a yet undefined age or metabolic state, and then commit to the yeast-to-hypha conversion through activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. This subset of cells that are “poised” to initiate germ tube formation is enriched in the yeast fraction of the filamentous colonies, thus enabling detection of subtle differences in PKA activity. Third, growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, which is associated with low cAMP/PKA signaling, is sufficient to revert the hyperfilamentation effect of the <italic>SET3</italic>-deletion.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed two distinct filamentation phenotypes of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells to elucidate the mechanism of action of the Set3C, and we propose the following model, which we refer to as the “threshold shift model” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In wild type cells, the cAMP/PKA pathway and its target transcription factor Efg1 regulate morphogenesis in response to several environmental stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Lo1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Stoldt1">[10]</xref>. Naturally, molecules triggering morphogenetic conversions do not show a homogenous concentration <italic>in vivo</italic>; therefore, the regulatory pathway must have a certain <italic>sensitivity</italic> to input signals, which in the case of the cAMP/PKA pathway, is determined by (at least) two factors: the concentration of key regulatory components inside the cell and a Set3C-dependent attenuation mechanism. For instance, <italic>EFG1</italic> is rapidly downregulated upon yeast-to-hyphae conversion by serum and elevated temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Stoldt1">[10]</xref>. Efg1 binds to its own promoter, and in the absence of Efg1, the endogenous <italic>EFG1</italic> promoter is activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Tebarth1">[34]</xref>. This auto-inhibitory loop appears crucial for a stable commitment to hyphal growth, because ectopic overexpression of <italic>EFG1</italic> causes hyphal cells to revert to yeast growth by lateral budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Tebarth1">[34]</xref>. At the same time, the results presented in this study suggest that in the absence of a functional Set3C, the cAMP/PKA pathway responds to milder stimuli to initiate conversion to the filamentous growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g008">Figure 8A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>In our belief, this simple “threshold shift” model is coherent with both phenotypes of the <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant for the following reasons. First, white phase <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells grow predominantly as hyphae on YPD at 37°C as opposed to the wild type cells growing as yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s002">S2A</xref>). In this system, YPD at 30°C, YPD 37°C and YPD+serum at 37°C in this order represent three conditions on the horizontal axis of the model analogous to a stimulus-gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Wild type cells, whose cAMP/PKA signaling has wild type <italic>sensitivity,</italic> perceive the YPD at 37°C as being below the threshold required for hyphal conversion. By contrast, <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutants perceive YPD at 37°C as an environment whose inductive effect is already above the threshold required to switch to hyphal growth. Second, opaque phase <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutants grow predominantly as pseudohyphae on Lee's medium at 25°C as opposed to <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ white cells as well as wild type white or opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this system, however, Lee's medium at 25°C already represents an environmental scenario close to the threshold point, which is supported by the fact that Lee's medium at 37°C drives hyphal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Birse1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Sharkey1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Bedell1">[48]</xref>. Why do <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells filament only in the opaque but not in the white phase? Opaque cells express <italic>EFG1</italic> at lower levels than white cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Sonneborn1">[23]</xref>, because in opaque cells <italic>EFG1</italic> is repressed directly by the master opaque regulator Wor1, and indirectly by the transcription factor Czf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Zordan2">[22]</xref>. Therefore, filamentation of opaque <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells is most probably resulting from the increased cAMP/PKA pathway sensitivity due to the lack of Set3C, and the inhibition of the <italic>EFG1</italic> locus by Wor1 and Czf1 mimicking the effect of the <italic>EFG1</italic>-autoinhibitory loop (the latter being absent in the white phase). Notably, Lee's medium at 25°C is not a strong enough signal to induce true hyphal growth. This is in complete agreement with a recently proposed hypothesis, according to which weak filament-inducing signals turn on a set of genes required for pseudohyphal growth, while a stronger signal of the same nature turns on a set of additional genes triggering hyphal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Carlisle1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>At which level of the pathway does the Set3C act on the molecular level? Recently, it was shown that <italic>C. albicans</italic> Efg1 binds to the promoters of filament-specific genes in both yeast and hyphal cells, and recruits the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex and the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex upon hyphal induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Lu1">[50]</xref>. Given that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Set3C possesses histone deacetylase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Pijnappel1">[26]</xref>, and that all subunits of the complex show strong evolutionary conservation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000889-t001">Table 1</xref>), it seems reasonable to propose that Set3C interferes with Efg1-dependent gene expression in <italic>C. albicans</italic> by effecting the chromatin status at Efg1 target loci. On the other hand, the PKA hyperactivity in <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells as judged from trehalose quantification and PKA activity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>) apparently contradicts this notion, and implies that the Set3C acts either at the level or upstream of PKA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Nevertheless, a chromatin-based regulatory effect at Efg1 target loci would still be possible, if Efg1 coordinated a feed-back mechanism affecting the activity of PKA. We are developing molecular tools to address these possibilities directly. In this context, it is interesting to note that in a previous study, we found the histone methyltransferase <italic>SET1</italic> to be epistatic to <italic>SET3</italic> or <italic>HOS2</italic> to regulate white-opaque switching in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hnisz1">[25]</xref>. We interpreted these data in a way that the PHD domain of Set3 recognizes methylation marks generated by Set1 at its target loci. Indeed, such a recognition was subsequently demonstrated in <italic>S. cerevisiae, in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Kim1">[51]</xref>. Consequently, since deletion of <italic>SET1</italic> and <italic>SET3</italic> showed a synergistic effect in repressing filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), it is reasonable to hypothesize that at genetic loci where Set3C antagonizes filamentation, it does not depend on the methylation marks generated by Set1. Alternatively, it is also possible that the Set3C targets as yet unknown transcription factor(s), rather than histone proteins. This will have to be explored in more detail in future studies.</p>

<title>Adenine as a morphogenetic signal</title>
<p>Along with serum and nitrogen-limitation, filamentation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> can be triggered by numerous specific stimuli, including human hormones, N-acetylglucosamine and bacterial peptidoglycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Brown1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Xu1">[52]</xref>. We identify adenine as a potential signal that also has a modulatory effect on the yeast-filament conversion <italic>in vitro</italic>. Namely, exogenous adenine attenuated the hyperfilamentation phenotypes of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells and suppressed the upregulation of filament-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000889.s004">S4</xref>). Similar to the Set3C, adenine may also influence cAMP/PKA dependent signaling events in a negative way, since cAMP supplementation in the presence of adenine rescued the phenotype of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Since adenine in itself did not have an influence on the morphogenesis or marker gene expression in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g005">Figure 5</xref>), it appears likely that its importance as a metabolic factor is limited to specific conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>, which are partially mimicked by the disruption of the Set3C. In this context, it is interesting to note that limitation of nicotinic acid (like adenine, a NAD precursor) in a urinary tract infection model regulates cell adhesion through a chromatin-dependent mechanism in the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Domergue1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, although the specific nature of the adenine signal will have to be explored in further studies, it provides an additional argument that both white and opaque filamentation phenotypes of <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutants are caused by an interference with the same genetic mechanism. In addition, we have shown earlier that exogenous adenine also modulates opaque-to-white transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hnisz1">[25]</xref>, which, together with the results provided here, indicate the need to study the role of purine-metabolism in the regulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> morphogenesis.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Morphogenesis as a virulence factor</title>
<p>Most human fungal pathogens including <italic>Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> or <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> are dimorphic. Therefore, morphogenesis has been extensively studied as a potential virulence trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Rooney1">[2]</xref>. For example, locking <italic>Candida albicans</italic> cells in the yeast form by the combined deletion of <italic>CPH1</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> abolishes virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Lo1">[9]</xref>. Likewise, locking cells in a filamentous form by deleting <italic>TUP1</italic> had a similar effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Braun1">[11]</xref>. These data led to the general view that virulence is determined by the ability to change morphologies rather than the individual growth forms <italic>per se</italic>. Although this view is widely accepted, supporting evidence remains indirect, because the mutants tested so far are either locked in a specific growth form or display pleiotropic alterations of other cellular functions unrelated to morphogenesis. For instance, deletion of the transcriptional repressor <italic>NRG1</italic> locks cells in a filamentous state and <italic>nrg1</italic>Δ/Δ cells are avirulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Murad1">[14]</xref>. Deletion of the hypha-specific cyclin <italic>HGC1</italic> locks cells in the yeast form and the <italic>hgc1</italic>Δ/Δ mutant is also avirulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Zheng1">[54]</xref>. Deletion of the transcriptional repressor <italic>SSN6</italic> permits yeast and pseudohyphal growth, but not true hyphal growth. Lack of <italic>SSN6</italic> affects generation time, and <italic>ssn6</italic>Δ/Δ cells are avirulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hwang1">[33]</xref>. The most direct evidence addressing the contribution of a specific growth form to virulence came from two recent studies on the transcription factors <italic>UME6</italic> and <italic>NRG1.</italic> The ectopic overexpression of <italic>UME6</italic> converted cells to the hyphal growth mode <italic>in vivo</italic> rendering cells hypervirulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Carlisle1">[49]</xref>. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of <italic>NRG1</italic> inhibited hyphal growth <italic>in vivo</italic> causing attenuated virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Saville1">[55]</xref>. These studies demonstrated the pivotal role of the hyphal morphology during infection.</p>
<p>In this study we describe a novel phenotype caused by the ablation of key components of the Set3C. The <italic>C. albicans set3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant is able to maintain both normal yeast and filamentous growth modes but is hyperfilamenting both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Strikingly, the s<italic>et3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant shows attenuated virulence in a murine systemic infection model. However, we cannot rule out that loss of <italic>SET3</italic> alters expression of other yet unknown virulence genes whose functions are unrelated to morphogenesis. We are currently performing whole genome microarray analyses to address this possibility. Nevertheless, the virulence defect of s<italic>et3</italic>Δ/Δ cells <italic>in vivo</italic> as yet appears to highlight the importance of maintaining the yeast phase growth during certain stages of dissemination in the host. Since mice infected with s<italic>et3</italic>Δ/Δ cells recover from the infection more efficiently than mice infected with wild type cells, it appears that the adequate timing for filamentation in a given niche is crucial for full virulence. The ability to maintain the unicellular yeast morphology in host environments being important for virulence is not surprising, since several pleiomorphic pathogens are virulent mainly in the yeast form. For instance, both in the case of <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, yeast phase cells are required for human infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Rooney1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Hull2">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regardless of other possible defects caused by impaired Set3C function, targeting the complex with specific deacetylase inhibitors can have a unique therapeutic potential. In fact, impairing the morphogenetic ability has been postulated as a promising area for antifungal drug discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Saville1">[55]</xref>. Trichostatin A (TSA), a known histone deacetylase inhibitor was recently shown to alter drug sensitivity and to inhibit serum-induced morphogenesis of some <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Simonetti1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Smith1">[58]</xref>. In addition, a novel fungal Hos2-inhibitor has entered clinical trials to prove therapeutic potential used in combination with the antifungal fluconazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Turner1">[59]</xref>. Here, we show that TSA is a potent trigger of the yeast-to-hyphae conversion of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Most importantly, out of all putative histone deacetylase genes, only the deletion of Hos2, the second catalytic subunit of the Set3C can phenocopy TSA treatment, providing compelling evidence that inhibition of the Set3C by TSA is causing the morphogenetic defects. Currently, we are investigating a possible therapeutic potential of TSA and related compounds to modulate morphogenesis and virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we establish the Set3C as a novel key regulator of morphogenesis in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. We propose that compromising the complex activity leads to a “threshold shift” in the susceptibility to morphogenetic signals, and a consequent virulence defect. Since the complex appears well conserved from yeast to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Guenther1">[60]</xref>, it will be fascinating to investigate the roles of the Set3C in the morphogenesis and virulence of other fungal pathogens. Indeed, the homologues of <italic>SET3</italic> and <italic>HOS2</italic> have recently been indentified as factors enhancing virulence of the human fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000889-Liu3">[61]</xref>. Taken together, our results emphasize the role of morphogenesis as a virulence factor and highlight the role of chromatin in regulating the activity of signaling pathways to orchestrate developmental changes in a simple eukaryotic model system.</p>

Transcript levels were normalized against the expression level of <italic>RIP1</italic>. qRT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicates and RNA isolated from two independent cultures were analyzed. Data are shown as mean + SD. FCS denotes YPD supplemented with 10% FCS. (A) The expression of <italic>ECE1</italic> is strongly induced in <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells even on YPD at 37°C, which is a mild inducing stimulus for wild type cells. However, <italic>ECE1</italic> expression is abolished once <italic>EFG1</italic> is deleted both in wild type and <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ or <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells. Double asterisk indicates statistical significance of P&lt;0.01 between <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and wild type or <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ and wild type cells cultured under the same conditions (Student's t-test). (B) The expression profile of <italic>FRE2</italic> reveals at least three regulatory inputs. First, <italic>FRE2</italic> repressed by Tup1, because <italic>tup1</italic>Δ/Δ cells express <italic>FRE2</italic> in higher levels than wild type cells under all conditions tested. Second, <italic>FRE2</italic> is serum-induced in an <italic>EFG1</italic>-dependent manner. Third, <italic>FRE2</italic> expression is induced by serum by a mechanism other than <italic>EFG1</italic>-signalling. Most notably, the effect of <italic>EFG1</italic>-deletion appears epistatic to the <italic>SET3</italic> and <italic>HOS</italic>-deletions. (C) <italic>DDR48</italic> is repressed by Tup1, but not by Set3 or Hos2 under all conditions tested. (D) <italic>ECE1</italic> expression is strongly induced in opaque phase <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ cells, but the induction is suppressed by deletion of <italic>EFG1</italic> or by supplementing the medium with 100μg/ml adenine.

<p>Additional trehalose and PKA activity measurements to link hyperreactivity of cAMP/PKA signalling to deletion of <italic>SET3</italic>. (A) Trehalose content of colonies grown on the indicated media. <italic>set3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>hos2</italic>Δ/Δ cells apparently contain less trehalose on FCS plates after three days, indicating high PKA activity. Asterisk indicates statistical significance of P&lt;0.05 relative to wild type cells of the same phase cultured under identical conditions (Student's t-test). (B) Protein kinase activities of cell extracts derived from the indicated colonies. “T”: total, “Y”: yeast, “H”: hyphal fraction. The phosphorylated PepTag PKA substrate migrates towards the kathode, whereas the unphosphorylated form migrates towards the anode. The measured activity appears specific for PKA, since it is further inducible by addition of cAMP, and is inhibited by the H-89 inhibitor. 2ng of purified PKA of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase assay kit (Promega) was used as a control to titrate the inhibitor. The spectrophotometric quantification of the upper panel is found on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000889-g006">Figure 6E</xref>.</p>
