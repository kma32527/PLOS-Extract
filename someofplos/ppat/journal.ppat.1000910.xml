<p>HCV (hepatitis C virus) research, including therapeutics and vaccine development, has been hampered by the lack of suitable tissue culture models. Development of cell culture systems for the growth of the most drug-resistant HCV genotype (1b) as well as natural isolates has remained a challenge. Transfection of cultured cells with adenovirus-associated RNA<sub>I</sub> (VA RNA<sub>I</sub>), a known interferon (IFN) antagonist and inhibitor of dsRNA-mediated antiviral pathways, enhanced the growth of plasma-derived HCV genotype 1b. Furthermore, persistent viral growth was achieved after passaging through IFN-α/β-deficient VeroE6 cells for 2 years. Persistently infected cells were maintained in culture for an additional 4 years, and the virus rescued from these cells induced strong cytopathic effect (CPE). Using a CPE-based assay, we measured inhibition of viral production by anti-HCV specific inhibitors, including 2′-C-Methyl-D-Adenosine, demonstrating its utility for the evaluation of HCV antivirals. This virus constitutes a novel tool for the study of one of the most relevant strains of HCV, genotype 1b, which will now be available for HCV life cycle research and useful for the development of new therapeutics.</p>

<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a persistent infection that can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. Interferon (IFN)-based treatments are ineffective for some HCV genotypes. HCV research has been hampered by the lack of suitable cell culture systems. With the discovery of a unique HCV genotype 2a isolate that can replicate in the human liver cell line Huh7, some obstacles were overcome. However, there remains the need of systems to grow IFN-resistant genotypes and serum-derived isolates. Here we show that the presence of adenovirus-associated RNA<sub>I</sub> (VA RNA<sub>I</sub>), a known IFN antagonist, permitted establishment of a persistent infection of genotype 1b in VeroE6 cells that were passaged weekly for more than 2 years. The persistent virus induces strong cytopathic effect (CPE), a feature that allowed the development of a CPE-based assay to test HCV-specific inhibitors, neutralization by anti-HCV immunoglobulins and by anti-CD81 antibody, and HCV-specific siRNA. Our system provides the first persistent culture of genotype 1b virus and a convenient assay that can be used for therapeutics development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus that infects approximately 170 million people worldwide. Chronic HCV infection can lead to serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapy with pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin is expensive, associated with serious side effects and only effective in about 50% of treated patients. Of the six major genotypes of HCV, the relatively IFN-resistant genotypes 1a and 1b predominate in the United States, Japan and Western Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Simmonds1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent developments have advanced the HCV research field whereby a single virus isolate (cloned from a patient with a rare case of fulminant hepatitis C), JFH-1, or derivatives of that isolate have been shown to robustly replicate in the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Lindenbach1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Wakita1">[3]</xref>. Full-length replicons constructed by adding the structural coding regions from another genotype 2a virus, J6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Lindenbach1">[2]</xref>, were shown to not only replicate in culture, but to efficiently produce infectious viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Lindenbach1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Zhong1">[6]</xref>. Replication of the J6/JFH-1 virus in Huh7 cells was more robust in a derivative cell line, termed Huh7.5, which was selected from replicon-containing Huh7 cells after curative treatment with IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Zhong1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Sumpter1">[7]</xref>. An infectious system based on the use of a Vero cell line and the pHCV-WHU-1 consensus clone (genotype 1b) was reported to produce high levels of HCV genome (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> copies/ml) with the aid of T7 polymerase provided by recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Guo1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the current cell culture systems utilize viruses that were initially replicon-derived from the JFH-1 isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Lindenbach1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Heller1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Pietschmann1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Mateu1">[15]</xref>, from HCV genotype 1b consensus clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Guo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Pietschmann2">[16]</xref> or from the HCV genotype 1a prototype virus (H77-S) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Yi1">[10]</xref>, there remains the need for a system that would be permissive for a wide variety of HCV strains found in nature. Human hepatocytes (including fetal hepatocytes) have been reported to support virus replication after RNA transfection or infection with patient sera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Aly1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Farquhar1">[18]</xref>. However, the use of primary cells has several technical limitations because they proliferate poorly <italic>in vitro</italic> and divide only a few times. Primary cultures could be maintained for longer periods of time only if the cells were immortalized by introducing oncogenes, a procedure that typically results in changes of the hepatocyte characteristics and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Aly1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>One approach to overcoming the obstacle of limited HCV growth in culture is to identify the mechanism of restriction. Activation of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) production is a key step in the innate response to viral infection and to the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesized during replication of many viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Jacobs1">[19]</xref>. Several cellular dsRNA-binding proteins have been implicated in the IFN-response to infection. For instance, we have previously identified the adenosine deaminase that acts on dsRNA (ADAR1) as an IFN-α/β-induced protein that is a potent inhibitor of HCV replicon growth in cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>. ADAR1 converts adenosines in viral RNA to inosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Morse1">[21]</xref>, rendering the RNA inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>. Both ADAR1 and the IFN-induced dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) are inhibited by the small adenovirus-associated RNA (VA RNA<sub>I</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-OMalley1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Lei1">[23]</xref>. When VA RNA<sub>I</sub> is transfected into replicon containing Huh7 cells, it increases replication by 40-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>, suggesting that these IFN-induced proteins impose critical limitations to HCV replication.</p>
<p>In this study, we achieved growth of an HCV genotype 1b isolate by inoculating IFN-deficient cells with human plasma from an infected patient. Viral replication was stimulated further with the addition of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, and led to the creation of a cell line persistently infected with HCV. More interestingly, the virus isolated from these cultures has the potential to induce cytopathic effects in the persistently infected VeroE6 cells and cause massive cell death in Huh7.5 cells.</p>

<p>Based on our previous finding that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> enhanced HCV replication in the replicon system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>, we hypothesized that virus growth in cell culture may also be inhibited by IFN-induced pathways. Our approach was to employ VeroE6 cells, which contain a homozygous-allelic deletion of the IFN-α/β genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Diaz1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Mosca1">[25]</xref>, yet retain the ability to express IFN-induced genes such us ADAR1 and PKR, which can be activated during virus infection. Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding VA RNA<sub>I</sub> (pVA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Clarke1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Gunnery1">[27]</xref>), and then inoculated once with HCV genotype 1b infectious human plasma, LB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Saldanha1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Yu1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>) or with genotype 1a infectious chimpanzee serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Kolykhalov1">[30]</xref> (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000910.s003">Text S1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000910.s002">Table S1</xref></bold>). Normal human serum was used as a negative control. Infected cells were passaged (division ratio of 1∶6) every seven days for 20 weeks with weekly pVA re-transfection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000910-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). HCV RNA was detected sporadically in the virus-infected cells after week 20. Nevertheless, passages were continued weekly in the absence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>. Surprisingly, after 2 years of passage in culture in the absence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, HCV RNA was detected consistently, indicating that the virus was able to establish a persistent infection. No virus was detected after 20 weeks in the control experiment that was infected with normal human serum. The possibility that the positive PCR results were due to RNA carry-over is extremely low since the cells had been diluted ∼1.94×10<sup>96</sup> after 2 years in culture. <underline>LB</underline>-plasma <underline>p</underline>ersistently <underline>i</underline>nfected <underline>Ve</underline>roE6 cells (LB-piVe cells) were screened with anti-human- and anti-monkey-specific primers to ensure that the cultures were not contaminated with human cells (data not shown).</p>

The results suggest that the addition of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> may broaden cellular tropism by allowing persistent growth and replication of HCV from plasma in non-hepatic VeroE6 cells.</p>
<p>Western blot analysis of LB-piVe (after two rounds of cell panning) and J6/JFH-1-infected cell extracts demonstrates that HCV proteins were expressed at detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g001"><bold>Figure 1E and F</bold></xref>). Because the proportion of immunofluorescent cells was low, we then compared the levels of viral RNA in filter-clarified supernatants from LB-piVe panned cells versus J6/JFH-1-infected Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g001"><bold>Figure 1G</bold></xref>). J6/JFH-1 yielded 9.2×10<sup>7</sup> RNA copies/ml, while LB-piVe yielded 1×10<sup>4</sup> RNA copies/ml; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g001"><bold>Figure 1G</bold></xref>). Persistent infection could only be maintained at a low viral titer, as attempts to obtain the higher viral yields by cell panning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g001"><bold>Figure 1B and D</bold></xref>) resulted in viral instability due to cell cytolysis (data not shown).</p>

<title>Quantitation of viral titers by a CPE (cytopathic effect)-based assay</title>
<p>Interestingly, we observed evidence of CPE in LB-piVe cells after 2 years in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref><bold>, right</bold>). To demonstrate that the virus from the persistently-infected cells was infectious, filter-clarified culture supernatants from LB-piVe cells were used to inoculate naïve Huh7.5 cells. The infected Huh7.5 cells demonstrated enhanced CPE compared to the parental LB-piVe cells, and resulted in gross cell death after 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref><bold>, right</bold>).

The level of CPE observed in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref><bold>, micrographs</bold>) was directly related to the amount of viral RNA in the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref><bold>, histogram</bold>). Taken together, our results show that viral infectivity can be transferred from the persistently infected cell line, LB-piVe, to naïve hepatic cells and that the level of CPE correlates with the level of input viral RNA.</p>

<p>Based on these unique characteristics of LB-piVe, we developed a CPE-based end-point dilution assay for quantification of viral titers.

Five days post-infection (dpi), cells were observed by light microscopy and those wells showing CPE were assigned a positive result.

<title>Virus neutralization</title>
<p>To further confirm that the CPE was linked to virus infection, we employed the end-point dilution assay (based on visualization of cell death) to study virus neutralization. Huh7.5 cells were first incubated with antibodies to the putative viral receptor CD81 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Cormier1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Pileri1">[34]</xref> and then infected with serial dilutions of filter-clarified supernatants of LB-piVe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>) or J6/JFH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Viral titers were determined as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. This study showed that anti-CD81 antibodies reduced genotype 1b LB-piVe viral titers by ∼1×log<sub>10</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>), similar to that observed for the genotype 2a virus J6/JFH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Pre-incubation of LB-piVe virus with HCV-specific immunoglobulin intravenous (HCIGIV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Yu2">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>) or anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Dubuisson1">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>) also inhibited virus growth similarly. However, pre-incubation of LB-piVe virus or J6/JFH-1 with normal IGIV or an isotype-matched negative control antibody did not affect viral titers. It may be noted that the anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies were generated to genotype 1a recombinant E2 proteins, including the hypervariable region. Consequently, their ability to neutralize a genotype 1b virus could be limited to some extent as reflected by the 60% decrease in viral titers observed. These neutralization experiments demonstrate that Huh7.5 cell death resulted from the transfer of virus from the LB-piVe cells, and that infection and viral spread in Huh7.5 cells was blocked by the addition of HCV-specific antibodies.</p>

<p>We then explored the utility of the CPE-based assay to screen therapeutics by treating virus-infected cells with HCV inhibitors. We used a well characterized inhibitor of the HCV polymerase, 2′-C-Methyl-D-Adenosine (2′-C-Me-A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-LePogam1">[37]</xref>.

<p>When LB-piVe cells were treated with IFN, the virus continued to replicate. We measured LB-piVe viral titers in cells that were treated with 0, 10, 100 or 1000 IU/mL of IFN for 24, 48 and 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>). LB-piVe titer decreased slightly only at 72 hr with 100 or 1000 IU/mL, but the values were not significantly lower than for 48hr. In contrast, J6/JFH-1 titer decreased by 5-fold when treated with 10 IU/mL for 48 hr and there was no detectable virus with 1000 IU/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref>). To ensure that the LB-piVe cells had not become insensitive to IFN treatment, we measured LB-piVe titers in Huh7.5 cells that were also treated with IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4G</bold></xref>). There was no significant effect on LB-piVe titers by treating the Huh7.5 cells with IFN for 5 days at 10 IU/mL and no change after treatment with 1000 IU/mL. A decrease of 0.2 log<sub>10</sub> was observed when comparing 10 IU/mL vs 1000 IU/mL over 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4G</bold></xref>). This small difference may be attributed to the long incubation period. These results indicate that the LB-piVe virus and not the persistently infected cells are relatively IFN resistant as would be expected for a natural genotype 1b virus isolate. To ensure that the virus had not acquired IFN resistance through passage in culture, we compared the effects of IFN treatment on the parental virus (LB) with the persistent virus in VeroE6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4H</bold></xref>). There was little effect after treating the LB virus for 24, 48 or 72 hr, demonstrating that this parental genotype 1b strain was relatively IFN resistant, as expected.</p>
<p>These inhibition studies demonstrated that the LB-piVe virus was sensitive to HCV-specific inhibitors and that the CPE-based assay provides an easy and quantitative method for measuring the efficacy of antiviral compounds. Furthermore, the LB-piVe virus behaved like the wild-type parental virus and maintained its relative IFN resistance.</p>

The relative amount of HCV RNA in pVA-transfected cells versus pVA-untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>) increased 60-fold after 8 days of transient infection in VeroE6 cells.

It may be noted here that the CT values of GAPDH employed as a normalization control in these experiments, were consistent among cells in the presence or absence of pVA. Thus, the dramatic increase in viral RNA in VeroE6 cells may be due to factors other than the variation in transcript levels of GAPDH reported in liver cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Diamond1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Waxman1">[43]</xref>.

<p>Incubation of transiently infected cells with an RNA polymerase inhibitor helped to assess the level of viral RNA in the absence of viral replication. We treated the parental virus with 2′-C-Me-A, which resulted in similar HCV RNA levels when cells were transfected with either WT- or mutant-VA RNA<sub>I</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>). Initially there was a decrease in viral RNA (time 0 = input RNA). VA RNA<sub>I</sub> was not able to stimulate replication in the presence of an inhibitor of HCV polymerase. Additionally, the level of viral RNA did not increase in the presence of wild-type VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, suggesting that viral RNA stability was also not affected by the presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> in the absence of replication. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows that in the presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, viral RNA titer goes down and then levels off; while in the absence of wild-type VA RNA<sub>I</sub> it continues to decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). When the experiment is done in the presence of 2′,C-Me-A, the RNA titer decreases and levels off, independent of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This is consistent with the mechanism of 2′,C-Me-A, which inhibits new RNA synthesis, however, in this experiment the viral RNA is not degraded 100-fold (<italic>c.f.</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). We interpret these data as follows: 1) in the absence of viral replication (in 2′,C-Me-A-treated cells), there is less degradation of the viral RNA; 2) in the absence of viral replication (in 2′,C-Me-A-treated cells) there is also the absence of dsRNA (positive strand plus negative strand); and 3) therefore, dsRNA-activated proteins, including ADAR1, would not be activated, leaving VA RNA<sub>I</sub> with no effect on stability. This is consistent with our ongoing studies that show that only wild-type VA RNA<sub>I</sub> (that which can bind PKR or ADAR1) is capable of stimulating the replicon (Taylor, unpublished results). Taken together, these results suggest that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> in the early stages of infection may affect the stability of the viral RNA, either by altering the degradation rate of new HCV RNA molecules or by inhibition of an RNA degradation pathway that may be modulated by viral replication. However, we also cannot exclude the possibility that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> alters the HCV RNA synthesis rate in the absence of a polymerase inhibitor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated that the addition of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, a known IFN antagonist and inhibitor of dsRNA-mediated antiviral pathways, permitted the persistent growth of a plasma-derived HCV in a cell line that lacks IFN genes. Most of the current knowledge of HCV biology and pathogenesis has been derived from the use of the unique JFH-1 cell culture system, which now allows the study of the complete virus life cycle, including entry, assembly and release. The limitation of this model, however, is that robust viral growth is restricted only to hepatic-derived cell lines such as Huh7.5 and Huh7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-vonHahn1">[44]</xref> and only by a genotype 2a replicon-derived virus. The establishment of an alternative model to characterize other HCV genotypes from infected individuals is still needed and is critical for the development of efficient viral therapies to control the disease.</p>
<p>By passaging genotype 1b virus-infected VeroE6 cells for 20 weeks in the presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> and more than 2 years without VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, we generated a persistently infected cell line that expresses HCV antigens at levels high enough to be detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–F</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000910-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). We found that the LB-piVe virus is highly cytotoxic, and is capable of inducing massive Huh7.5 cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g002"><bold>Figure 2B, C and E</bold></xref>); indicating that the virus produced in the persistently infected cells is infectious to hepatocytes. CPE could be blocked by antibodies to CD81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>), by anti-HCV-specific immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>) and by anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>), confirming the link between cell death and viral infection. While neutralization was not as potent using the anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies, we believe that this may be due to the antibodies being raised against recombinant genotype 1a proteins. The genotype differences in the E2 proteins (including hypervariable domains) may be reflected in loss of epitope recognition, thus explaining the 0.6 log<sub>10</sub> decrease in viral titer.</p>
<p>The LB-piVe virus-mediated CPE has the advantage that it can be assessed visually, and quantified easily and rapidly. This represents a significant improvement over the current genotype 2a HCVcc systems that utilize FFU assays, RT-PCR or reporter assays for quantitation, which are both laborious and time-consuming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Iro1">[45]</xref>. In addition, we have demonstrated the utility of this system in virus neutralization studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g003"><bold>Figure 3A, C and D</bold></xref>) and in testing virus inhibition by well characterized HCV-specific antivirals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4A, C, E and G</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>CPE was observed in VeroE6 cells and more-exaggerated CPE was found when filterable supernatants were used to infect Huh7.5 cells. While it was possible to enhance viral titer by panning the LB-piVe cells, and effectively increasing the number of virus-infected cells, the new culture could not survive after several passages. We suspect that the virus cannot be maintained in a culture that demonstrates massive CPE, such as that seen in Huh7.5 cells. This may be the reason that we were unable to obtain persistently infected Huh7.5 cell line, while VeroE6 cells can support persistent HCV infection due to a low-level display of CPE.</p>
<p>HCV- associated cell death has also been reported in Huh7.5.1 cells after infection with JFH-1 when HCV RNA levels reached a maximum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Walters1">[46]</xref>. Gene expression profiling of HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells showed both the presence of activated caspase-3 and induction of cell death-related genes, suggesting an association of virus infection with cytopathic effects. Although not yet resolved, it has been postulated that HCV could mediate direct apoptosis by deregulating the cell cycle, which may contribute to liver injury in infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Walters1">[46]</xref>. While still requiring further studies and more comparisons between human pathology and cell culture, we suggest that the LB-piVe system may very well mimic a natural HCV infection in humans and could represent a useful tool to study the intricate process of viral pathogenesis.</p>
<p>VeroE6 cells were also permissive for replication of genotype 2a J6/JFH-1 virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Lindenbach1">[2]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g005"><bold>Figure 5A–C</bold></xref>). VA RNA<sub>I</sub> boosted replication and spread in these cells, as shown by the increase in the HCV RNA yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g005"><bold>Figure 5D, E</bold></xref>). This may be attributable to an increase in viral RNA stability and possibly reflects the type of interplay between host and virus. The presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> allowed for broadened cell tropism by HCV to include non-hepatic cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000910-t001"><bold>Tables 1</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000910.s002">S1</xref></bold>), perhaps due to its ability to circumvent the IFN-induced antiviral response. The full-extent of the mechanisms employed by VA RNA<sub>I</sub> towards overcoming the negative effects of IFN is currently unknown. VA RNA<sub>I</sub> is important to adenovirus infection and confers virus stability in the presence of IFN and IFN-induced proteins. It has been suggested that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> has an effect on HCV RNA stability by inhibition of the IFN-induced protein, ADAR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>. When we compared the relative amount of HCV RNA in VA RNA<sub>I</sub>-transfected cells versus -untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006"><bold>Figure 6B, C</bold></xref>) that were infected with HCV-positive human plasma LB, we observed a 60-fold increase in VeroE6 cells. Interestingly, a precipitous decline in HCV RNA was observed in these cells in the absence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>). Thus, VA RNA<sub>I</sub> has an effect in the VeroE6 cells, at least during the first 8 days of infection. We have yet to evaluate possible defects in the RIG-I pathway observed previously in Huh7.5 cells and likely to play a role in early infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Saito1">[47]</xref>. The fact that we did not observe any increase in the relative amount of HCV RNA in Huh7.5 cells after VA RNA<sub>I</sub> transfection followed by infection with the parental genotype 1b serum-derived virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g006"><bold>Figure 6B and C</bold></xref>), was unexpected. We suspect that the relatively stable amount of viral RNA reflects extremely low viral replication of the LB virus in Huh7.5 cells. These findings are supported by the evidence that we could not establish a persistently infected cell-line with Huh7.5 cells, suggesting that VeroE6 cells were more permissive for persistent infection, perhaps due to the lack of IFN genes.</p>
<p>VA RNA<sub>I</sub> was not able to rescue the virus during 2′-C-Me-A treatment and does not stimulate replication nor does it protect the virus from an antiviral that targets the HCV polymerase. We used this RNA polymerase inhibitor to evaluate RNA stability in the absence of viral RNA replication. Since VA RNA<sub>I</sub> only increased the HCV RNA in the presence of viral replication, we believe that it may perhaps inhibit cellular factors that are activated during viral replication (<italic>e.g.</italic>, dsRNA-binding proteins) and cause instability of the virus. It's possible that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> interacted with, and therefore blocked ADAR1 and PKR pathways. This would be consistent with our previous findings showing that the HCV replicon was stimulated by knock-down or inhibition of ADAR1 or PKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>. Additionally, the inhibition of RNA replication (including loss of negative strand RNA) should inhibit the formation of dsRNA intermediates, thus avoiding the activation of dsRNA-activated proteins that can lead to viral instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Saunders1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor3">[54]</xref>. Again, we cannot exclude the possibility that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> enhanced viral replication in the absence of the polymerase inhibitor. Taken together, these data suggest that VA RNA<sub>I</sub> may possibly contribute to establishing a persistent infection in VeroE6 cells; however, the presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub> alone is not enough to overcome the cellular antiviral response in Huh7.5 cells. IFN-deficient VeroE6 cells probably provide a more ideal environment for a virus that is, usually, IFN responsive. We suspect that this may be due to the decreased expression of IFN-induced proteins which may actively inhibit HCV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Taylor1">[20]</xref>. Both Huh7.5 cells and VeroE6 cells express PKR and ADAR1, but only the VeroE6 cells lack the IFN genes that induce these proteins. We found that even the persistent virus was stimulated by the presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, suggesting that some of the dsRNA-activated proteins were still expressed and were inhibitory to the virus.</p>
<p>In patients, in general, genotype 2 and 3 viruses are more sensitive to current antiviral therapy than the genotype 1 viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Pawlotsky1">[55]</xref>. Genotype 1b is thought to be the most IFN resistant and the most prevalent in North America, Europe and Japan. However, the HCV replicons (genotype 1b) and J6/JFH1 virus are sensitive to IFN in cell culture. It is not clear why viruses respond to IFN differently <italic>in vivo</italic> versus <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since HCV grows well in VeroE6 cells, especially when assisted by VA RNA<sub>I</sub>, we suggest that endogenous IFNs may limit HCV replication in cell culture.</p>
<p>We suspect that the LB-piVe virus, like the parental LB from which it was derived, was relatively resistant to IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4E, H</bold></xref>), a property that has not yet been reported in infectious cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000910-g004"><bold>Figure 4G</bold></xref>). While it warrants further investigation, it may be possible that we were able to obtain this virus because VA RNA<sub>I</sub> was present in the early stages of infection and inhibited the antiviral response generated by viral RNA replication. Our results on the enhancement of virus replication by VA RNA<sub>I</sub> are clearly consistent with evasion of the antiviral response, and correlate with the observation that susceptibility of human primary hepatocytes to HCV infection could be improved by impairing expression of other IFN signaling factors such us interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Aly1">[<bold>17</bold>]</xref>. We suggest that in the early stages of cell culture infection, before viral proteins are in sufficient quantity, the innate immune pathways are active and control infection (RIG-I, PKR, ADAR1, RNaseL, etc.). However, once the virus is given a chance to accumulate, it can overcome these mechanisms of host control, either through the E2, NS5A or NS3 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Gale1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000910-Vyas1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our findings have raised some interesting questions. Future studies with IFN-sensitive viruses, complemented with known IFN-resistant HCV proteins (such as NS5A and E2) using sequences from the LB-piVe virus, are planned. Additionally, the LB-piVe virus will be ideal for evaluating the genes responsible for conferring IFN resistance. We plan to construct an infectious clone and a replicon based on this virus with the aim of evaluating individual genes. At the same time, alignments with the IFN-resistant parental strain of LB with IFN-sensitive genotype 1b replicons may enable the identification of important amino acids that determine IFN resistance. Transient transfection experiments complementing the IFN-sensitive replicons will be among the experiments that will provide insights into the identification of the features that may confer IFN resistance by this genotype 1b virus.</p>
<p>In summary, here we demonstrate that wild-type HCV genotype 1b viruses from human plasma can replicate in African green monkey kidney cells, VeroE6, and that replication of viral genotypes 1a and 2a can be stimulated by the presence of VA RNA<sub>I</sub>. This is a new approach to culturing HCV and the first report of a cell culture system that represents a convenient assay for studying genotype 1b. This is an improvement in terms of utility for research, as the virus can be titrated without employing error-prone, quantitative RT-PCR methods nor arduous immunocytochemistry-based focus forming assays. The availability of the LB-piVe virus raises an exciting possibility; potentially opening a new era of HCV research through the use of a new model system. Moreover, a persistently infected cell line that exhibits CPE provides a novel assay that may be conducive to high throughput development and screening of new antivirals.</p>
