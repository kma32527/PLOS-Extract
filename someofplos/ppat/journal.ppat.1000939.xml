<p>Ergosterol is an important constituent of fungal membranes. Azoles inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis, although the cellular basis for their antifungal activity is not understood. We used multiple approaches to demonstrate a critical requirement for ergosterol in vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase function, which is known to be essential for fungal virulence. Ergosterol biosynthesis mutants of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> failed to acidify the vacuole and exhibited multiple <italic>vma</italic><sup>−</sup> phenotypes. Extraction of ergosterol from vacuolar membranes also inactivated V-ATPase without disrupting membrane association of its subdomains. In both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic>, fluconazole impaired vacuolar acidification, whereas concomitant ergosterol feeding restored V-ATPase function and cell growth. Furthermore, fluconazole exacerbated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> surges triggered by the antimicrobial agent amiodarone, and impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration in purified vacuolar vesicles. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the synergy between azoles and amiodarone observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, we show the clinical potential of this synergy in treatment of systemic fungal infections using a murine model of Candidiasis. In summary, we demonstrate a new regulatory component in fungal V-ATPase function, a novel role for ergosterol in vacuolar ion homeostasis, a plausible cellular mechanism for azole toxicity in fungi, and preliminary <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for synergism between two antifungal agents. New insights into the cellular basis of azole toxicity in fungi may broaden therapeutic regimens for patient populations afflicted with systemic fungal infections.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Systemic fungal infections impose a significant threat to public health and therapeutic options to treat these diseases remain limited. Azoles represent the largest category of anti-fungal drugs and repress fungal growth by inhibiting biosynthesis of ergosterol, an important constituent of fungal membranes. Despite the wide use of azoles in the clinic for decades, the cellular basis for their antifungal mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we use a range of genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches to reveal a requirement for ergosterol in vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase function. V-ATPase plays essential roles in diverse cellular processes, and is required for fungal virulence. Concomitant ergosterol feeding restores vacuolar acidification and growth in cells treated with fluconazole. These results suggest that the critical requirement for ergosterol in V-ATPase function may underlie the antifungal activity of azoles. Moreover, we show in a mouse Candidiasis model that combining an ion homeostasis-disruptive drug with azole is an effective approach to treat fungal infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathogenic fungal species, including <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> among others, cause infections ranging from mucocutaneous disorders to life-threatening invasive diseases that can involve any organ. In the past two decades, expanding populations of immunocompromised patients and increased use of invasive devices and implants have led to an increase in the incidence of fungal infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Corti1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Nucci1">[2]</xref>. Currently, four major categories of antifungal therapeutics are available to treat invasive fungal infections: polyenes, azoles, echinocandins and flucytosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Pappas1">[3]</xref>. Azole drugs are the most widely deployed in clinics, and inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the fungal-specific sterol. The primary molecular target of azole drugs is Erg11p (Entrez GeneID: 856398), a P450 cytochrome that catalyzes 14α-demethylation of lanosterol in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Hitchcock1">[4]</xref>. Besides azoles, a number of other drugs such as allylamines and morpholines used in medicine and agriculture also inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Ryder1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Marcireau1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ergosterol is an important constituent of membrane lipids, similar to vertebrate cholesterol, and modulates the fluidity, permeability and thickness of the membrane. These sterols preferentially associate with sphingolipids in microdomains that have been postulated to have important roles in membrane organization and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Maxfield1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Munro1">[8]</xref>. Ergosterol is most abundant in the plasma membrane and has been implicated in several cellular processes including sporulation, pheromone signaling and plasma membrane fusion during mating and endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-HeesePeck1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Jin1">[10]</xref>. Discernable amounts of ergosterol have also been found in membranes of intracellular organelles including peroxisomes, mitochondria, vacuoles and ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Schneiter1">[11]</xref>. Some studies have ascribed a regulatory role at these intracellular compartments, including homotypic vacuole fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kato1">[12]</xref>, mitochondrial biogenesis and inheritance, and protein sorting along exocytosis and endocytosis pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Thorpe1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Umebayashi1">[14]</xref>. The absence of ergosterol in mammals and suppression of fungal proliferation by a battery of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors emphasize the importance and utility of ergosterol as an effective target in antifungal chemotherapy. Yet, despite nearly two decades of use and the general recognition of the importance of ergosterol to fungal cells our understanding of the specific cellular processes disrupted by ergosterol deprivation following azole therapy remains minimal.</p>
<p>The limited categories of antifungal agents and emergence of resistance to existing antimycotics have prompted a search for compounds with alternative modes of action. The anti-arrhythmia drug, amiodarone, was recently documented to exhibit fungicidal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Courchesne1">[16]</xref>. This cationic amphipathic compound inserts into the lipid bilayer where it elicits membrane hyperpolarization, and influx of H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Maresova1">[17]</xref>. Within minutes, amiodarone also elicits a transcriptional response to starvation and blocks cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Zhang1">[18]</xref>. A screen of the yeast haploid deletion library for amiodarone hypersensitivity revealed multiple <italic>vma</italic> genes encoding subunits of the vacuolar membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>. The V-ATPase is critical for generation of a pH gradient that drives secondary transporters to maintain cellular ion homeostasis. Since the fungicidal activity of amiodarone appears to be tightly coupled to ion stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Muend1">[19]</xref>, hypersensitivity of <italic>vma</italic> mutants was ascribed to defects in ion homeostasis. Notably, deletion mutants of several <italic>erg</italic> genes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway were also identified in the screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, although the underlying mechanism for their amiodarone hypersensitive phenotype was unclear. Meanwhile, a screen of the yeast haploid deletion mutant library for strains with alterations in vacuolar pH revealed that <italic>erg</italic> mutants, like <italic>vma</italic> mutants, had severely alkaline vacuoles (Brett, C.L., Rao. R. <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). A separate study showed that sphingolipid, the other major membrane lipid component found associated with ergosterol in detergent-resistant microdomains, was required for the structural integrity of V-ATPase domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Chung1">[20]</xref>. In light of these observations, we investigated a potential link between ergosterol and V-ATPase function, which led to a mechanistic basis for the antifungal activity of azole drugs. As a first step in exploiting our observations for improved management of invasive fungal diseases, we assessed the efficacy of combining fluconazole with ion homeostasis-disruptive agent amiodarone in a murine Candidiasis model.</p>

<title>Mutants defective in ergosterol biogenesis exhibit multiple <italic>vma<sup>−</sup></italic> phenotypes</title>
<p>A genome-wide screen of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> haploid deletion collection for hypersensitivity to the antifungal agent amiodarone revealed multiple <italic>vma</italic> and <italic>erg</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>. Given our previous observation that amiodarone triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> influx leading to fungal death from ion stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Muend1">[19]</xref> and the importance of V-ATPase in ion homeostasis, we considered the possibility that ergosterol may be important for V-ATPase function. A systematic examination of viable <italic>erg</italic> null mutants (<italic>erg2Δ</italic> [Entrez GeneID: 855242], <italic>erg3Δ</italic> [Entrez GeneID: 850745], <italic>erg6Δ</italic> [Entrez GeneID: 855003] and <italic>erg24Δ</italic> [Entrez GeneID: 855441]) revealed multiple <italic>vma<sup>−</sup></italic> phenotypes, with <italic>erg24Δ</italic> displaying the most severe defects. In addition to hypersensitivity to amiodarone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), <italic>erg24Δ</italic> was unable to grow at alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), a defining phenotype of <italic>vma</italic> mutants indicative of the inability to acidify vacuoles. Furthermore, <italic>erg24Δ</italic> exhibited hypersensitivity to Zn<sup>2+</sup> toxicity and to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, consistent with broad ion homeostasis defects characteristic of <italic>vma</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g001">Fig. 1C–D</xref>). Yeast strains defective in trafficking of chitin synthase, including <italic>vma</italic> mutants, are more sensitive to toxicity from calcofluor white, an antimicrobial agent that binds to cell wall chitin. We showed that <italic>erg24Δ</italic> shared calcofluor white hypersensitivity with <italic>vma2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Poor growth of <italic>vma</italic> mutants on high concentrations of non-fermentable carbon sources has been ascribed to oxidative stress from respiration. Although <italic>erg24Δ</italic> was able to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, growth was significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Overall, the novel observation that ergosterol biogenesis mutants largely phenocopy <italic>vma</italic> mutants suggests that cellular ergosterol content may be important for the function of V-ATPase.</p>

<title>Ergosterol is critical for V-ATPase function</title>
<p>V-ATPase hydrolyzes ATP and acidifies vacuolar compartments. To assess a possible requirement for ergosterol in V-ATPase function, we first measured the vacuolar pH in <italic>erg</italic> mutants using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF. The acetoxy methyl ester of BCECF is taken up by cells and de-esterified in the vacuole where it accumulates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Ali1">[21]</xref>. While the vacuolar pH of wild-type cells was 6.0, vacuoles of <italic>vma2Δ</italic> (Entrez GeneID: 852424) cells were significantly more alkaline, around pH 7, as would be expected for loss of proton pump capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Vacuolar pH of all viable <italic>erg</italic> mutants closely resembled that of the <italic>vma</italic> mutant, as shown for <italic>erg24</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Next, we purified intact vacuolar vesicles from wild type, <italic>erg24Δ</italic> and <italic>vma2Δ</italic> strains, and compared V-ATPase function, including rates of proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis. There was no V-ATPase activity detectable in <italic>vma2</italic>Δ vacuoles as expected, whereas <italic>in vitro</italic> ATPase and H<sup>+</sup> pumping activity were both diminished to about 40% of wild type levels in <italic>erg24</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Examination of sterol profiles in purified vacuoles confirmed the presence of ergosterol in wild type vacuoles and its absence in <italic>erg24</italic>Δ (not shown). Taken together, these results provide evidence for a role for ergosterol in V-ATPase activity.</p>

<p>The P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Pma1 (Entrez GeneID: 852876) has been documented to associate with ergosterol enriched domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Bagnat1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Lee1">[23]</xref>. Upon glucose activation, it pumps protons out of cells to acidify the extracellular medium. To assess the effect of ergosterol depletion on Pma1 function, we examined extracellular acidification upon glucose activation in <italic>erg24Δ</italic> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, the kinetics of medium acidification was substantially similar between the wild type and <italic>erg24Δ</italic>, while a previously characterized PMA1 mutant, <italic>pma1-105</italic>, reported to have a 65% reduction in activity, exhibited slower acidification rate as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Perlin1">[24]</xref>. These data suggest that ergosterol is not required for Pma1 function and support the specificity of the ergosterol effect on V-ATPase.</p>
<p>To investigate the mechanism underlying the requirement of ergosterol for optimal V-ATPase function, we first asked if V-ATPase localization was altered in the <italic>erg24</italic>Δ mutant. The V-ATPase is made up of 14 subunits organized into the V<sub>o</sub> sector, integral to the membrane, and the cytoplasmic V<sub>1</sub> sector that reversibly dissociates from the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kane1">[25]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g003">Figure 3A &amp; 3B</xref> show that representative subunits from the V<sub>o</sub> sector (Vph1-GFP) and the V<sub>1</sub> sector (Vma5-GFP) colocalized with the vacuolar membrane stain (FM4-64) in <italic>erg24Δ</italic> cells, similar to the isogenic wild type. It was possible that the ergosterol biogenesis defect significantly decreased V-ATPase expression or caused the dissociation of V<sub>1</sub> from V<sub>o</sub> domain. However, analyses of representative V-ATPase subunits in vacuolar vesicles purified from the wild type and <italic>erg24Δ</italic> showed similar expression levels and V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>o</sub> ratios that were identical between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g003">Fig. 3C &amp; 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>The oligosaccharide Methyl-β-Cyclodextrin (MβCD) extracts sterols from cellular membranes. We observed a dose dependent loss of V-ATPase activity following treatment of purified vacuolar vesicles with MβCD, which could be blocked by preloading cholesterol into MβCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Both ATP hydrolysis rates and H<sup>+</sup> pumping declined at similar rates, suggesting an inhibition of the intact V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub> complex. This was verified by immunoblot analysis of vacuolar membranes collected by centrifugation after MβCD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>): we did not observe a loss of either V<sub>1</sub> (Vma2p) or V<sub>o</sub> (Vph1p) subunits, suggesting that the two sectors remain associated after ergosterol extraction. In contrast, a previous study pointed to a role for sphingolipids in maintaining structural integrity of the V-ATPase enzyme complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Chung1">[20]</xref>. We conclude that ergosterol constitutes a critical component in the lipid membrane environment for V-ATPase function.</p>

<title>The antifungal drug fluconazole disrupts V-ATPase function</title>
<p>Azole drugs exert their fungistatic effect by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis, specifically targeting lanosterol demethylase (Erg11p), which is the enzymatic step immediately upstream from Erg24p. Despite the wide spread use of azole antifungals, our understanding of the specific cellular pathways disrupted by azoles is limited. In addition to ergosterol depletion, fluconazole treatment results in accumulation of lanosterol (substrate of Erg11p) and its derivative 14-methyl-3,6 diol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Watson1">[26]</xref>. Based on analysis of sterol profiles in fluconazole susceptible and resistant strains, it was concluded that 14-methyl-3,6 diol toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Watson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kelly1">[27]</xref> was responsible for azole-mediated growth arrest. To specifically assess the functional effect of ergosterol depletion following azole treatment, we used the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain WPY361 with a gain-of-function mutation in <italic>UPC2</italic> (Entrez GeneID: 851799), <italic>upc2-1</italic>, that allows overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters required for uptake of exogenously added sterol under aerobic condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Li1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Wilcox1">[29]</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000939-t001">Table 1</xref> shows that growth inhibition caused by fluconazole treatment in WPY361 can be reversed by exogenous supply of ergosterol. To examine whether ergosterol feeding represses endogenous sterol metabolism and reduces accumulation of intermediates and derivatives, we analyzed sterol profiles in <italic>upc2-1</italic> cells after six hours of exposure to fluconazole and exogenous ergosterol. As expected, fluconazole alone caused reduction of ergosterol content (nine-fold) and accumulation of lanosterol and a major derivative, likely to be 14-methyl 3,6-diol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000939.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Compared with cells treated with fluconazole alone, cells treated with fluconazole and ergosterol had three-fold higher ergosterol content, yet the level of lanosterol and its derivatives remained the same (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000939.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). These data indicate that ergosterol feeding did not reduce accumulation of intermediates and derivatives. Thus, depletion of ergosterol, rather than the toxicity of intermediates and derivatives, is a plausible mechanism for the antifungal activity of fluconazole.</p>

<p>Based on our evidence that ergosterol was required for optimal V-ATPase function, we predicted that azole treatment would similarly impair activity of the V-ATPase.

<p>To extend these observations in the human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, we monitored vacuolar uptake of the fluorescent weak base quinacrine.

We observed robust quinacrine fluorescence in <italic>C. albicans</italic> vacuoles, colocalizing with FM4-64 staining of vacuolar membranes. Fluconazole treatment drastically reduced vacuolar accumulation of quinacrine in most cells, indicative of impaired vacuolar acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Additionally, trafficking of FM4-64 to the vacuolar membrane was impaired, consistent with endocytosis defects seen in <italic>vma</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Poltermann1">[30]</xref>.

<title>Impairment of V-ATPase function by azoles underlies synergism with amiodarone</title>

<p>The proton gradient established by the V-ATPase drives vacuolar sequestration of excessive cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by H<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange mechanisms. The importance of the V-ATPase is demonstrated by the inability of purified vacuolar vesicles to sequester <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> following treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). As predicted by our hypothesis, vacuolar vesicles purified from <italic>erg24Δ</italic> or fluconazole-treated wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> both showed similar impairment in their ability to sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>).

AMD treatment doses were presented at 5.0 and 25 mg/kg, while FLC doses were 0.5 and 1 mg/kg with treatments given once daily for three days after the first dose. In the absence of amiodarone, there was a significant dose-dependent effect of FLC on <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ratio of geometric means of the cfu count per 1 mg/kg of FLC was 0.5914, p = 0.01). In the absence of FLC, amiodarone did not confer a significant antifungal activity at the concentrations tested (ratio of geometric means of the cfu count per 1 mg/kg of amiodarone was 0.9996, p = 0.95). Yet in combination with fluconazole, the two doses of amiodarone significantly reduced <italic>C. albicans infection</italic> above and beyond the dose-dependent effect of fluconazole (ratio of geometric means of CFU with amiodarone versus without, for the same dose FLC = 0.4969, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000939-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In fungal cells, V-ATPase acidifies intracellular compartments including the vacuole, endosomes, and late-Golgi. Mutants lacking V-ATPase exhibit characteristic phenotypes of growth sensitivity to alkaline pH, calcofluor white, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and metal ion stress, and are unable to grow on high concentrations of non-fermentable carbon sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kane1">[25]</xref>. We show that mutants defective in ergosterol biosynthesis exhibit most of these characteristic <italic>vma<sup>−</sup></italic> phenotypes. Furthermore, we showed a reduction of vacuolar acidification by ergosterol depletion, restoration of vacuolar acidity by ergosterol feeding, and used biochemical assays of H<sup>+</sup> pumping with purified vacuolar vesicles to collectively demonstrate the requirement of ergosterol for optimal V-ATPase function. This functional link explains simultaneous identification of multiple ergosterol biosynthesis genes (<italic>erg</italic>) and V-ATPase subunit genes (<italic>vma</italic>) in a number of genome-wide screens, including sensitivity to low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, alkaline stress, and acid stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Yadav1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kawahata1">[35]</xref>. V-ATPase mutants and ergosterol biosynthesis mutants also share defects in endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-HeesePeck1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Perzov1">[36]</xref>. Additionally, in pathogenic fungal species, both <italic>vma</italic> and <italic>erg</italic> mutants are avirulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Poltermann1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Jia1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Erickson1">[37]</xref>. Disruption of V-ATPase function by ergosterol deprivation provides a mechanistic basis for these similarities.</p>
<p>To investigate the underlying basis for the requirement of ergosterol in V-ATPase function, we first checked the localization and abundance of V-ATPase in <italic>erg24Δ</italic>. Fluorescent microscopy and immunoblot analysis ruled out possible mislocalization and reduced abundance of V-ATPase in <italic>erg24Δ</italic> vacuolar membrane. In yeast, the V-ATPase complex undergoes rapid reversible dissociation into non-functional V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>o</sub> sectors in response to glucose withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kane2">[38]</xref>. A study with Baby Hamster Kidney cells suggested that increasing ratio of Intact V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>o</sub> along the endocytic pathway effectively increased acidity along the compartments in the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Lafourcade1">[39]</xref>. Analyses of immunoblot results in this study show that V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>o</sub> domains are still associated, and V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>o</sub> ratio remains unchanged upon ergosterol deprivation by treating cells with fluconazole and treating vacuolar vesicles with MβCD. These data rule out dissociation of V<sub>1</sub> from V<sub>o</sub> domain as the cause of reduced V-ATPase function, and indicate that ergosterol directly modulates the activity of V-ATPase. Sphingolipid, another major component of lipid raft, was thought to affect V-ATPase function by maintaining the structural integrity of V-ATPase because V<sub>1</sub> subunits (Vma1p, Vma2p and Vma5p) dissociate from V<sub>o</sub> domain during Ficoll gradient procedure in the sphingolipid mutant <italic>sur4Δ</italic>. In contrast, Vma2p remained associated with Vph1p after Ficoll gradient procedure in <italic>erg24Δ</italic> mutant and after ergosterol extraction by MβCD in the wild type. Thus, these two key membrane lipid components play distinct roles in maintaining V-ATPase function.</p>
<p>The precise molecular basis of V-ATPase regulation by ergosterol remains to be determined. In mammalian cells, V-ATPase has been shown to associate with cholesterol-rich microdomains, with loss of vesicular acidification reported upon treatment with β-methylcyclodextrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Yoshinaka1">[40]</xref>. A number of studies showed that inhibitors could interact with lipid bilayer and affect V-ATPase function by restricting its structural flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Dixon1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Pali1">[42]</xref>. Mechanisms proposed to explain the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by membrane lipids include lowering of free energy of activation and proper packing at protein-protein interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Michelangeli1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Cornelius1">[44]</xref>. Altered sterol compositions are known to affect membrane packing and rigidity: fluorescence anisotropy probes have revealed increased membrane fluidity and permeability upon fluconazole treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Abe1">[45]</xref>, consistent with alterations in activity of membrane-localized pumps and transporters, and a critical role for ion homeostasis mechanisms in drug treated cells. It is also possible that ergosterol may affect V-ATPase function indirectly by modulating regulatory interactions with other proteins. The complex multi-subunit structure of V-ATPase and its intimate association with sterols and spingolipids indicate that sophisticated regulatory mechanisms must be in place to ensure proper assembly, configuration, and communication among these components. Ergosterol depletion may affect other membrane functions besides vacuolar acidification. The plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Pma1, is a major efflux mechanism for protons, and is also found associated with ergosterol-rich microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Bagnat1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Lee1">[23]</xref>. However, we found that Pma1-mediated proton pumping function was not altered in <italic>erg24Δ</italic>, in contrast to the pronounced effect seen on the V-ATPase. This suggests that membrane proteins have specific lipid requirement for their functions.</p>
<p>While the molecular target of azole drugs, Erg11p, has been extensively characterized, not much is known about the cellular basis of fungal growth inhibition. Inhibition of Erg11p by fluconazole results in accumulation of lanosterol and its derivative 14-methyl-3,6 diol. In azole resistant <italic>erg3</italic> mutants, 14-methyl fecosterol accumulates upon treatment with fluconazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Watson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kelly1">[27]</xref>. This has led to the notion that toxicity of sterol derivatives such as 14-methyl-3,6 diol mediates the action of fluconazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Abe1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Lamb1">[46]</xref>. We exploited the ability of a recently described <italic>upc2-1</italic> mutation that allows uptake of ergosterol under aerobic conditions to distinguish between the effects of byproduct accumulation and ergosterol depletion on cell growth. The ability of exogenous ergosterol to reverse growth inhibition by fluconazole supports a plausible alternative hypothesis that antifungal activity of azoles is due to ergosterol depletion. Although we ruled out a corresponding decrease in lanosterol and other derivatives in the ergosterol fed cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that a specific ratio of ergosterol to other sterols may counter potential toxic effects. This possibility could be tested by varying ratios of sterols in <italic>upc2-1</italic> feeding experiments; however, 14-methyl-3,6 diol is not commercially available and its potential toxicity cannot be directly assessed at this time. Furthermore, our results warrant more careful examination of the role of 14-methyl fecosterol in the potential compensation of ergosterol function in membranes.</p>
<p>Some reports suggest a role for ROS in the toxicity of azoles to fungal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Kobayashi1">[47]</xref>. It is worth noting that cellular ROS level in these studies was measured with the fluorescent dye DCFH-DA (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate) which has also been documented to respond to pH alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Swamy1">[48]</xref>. Given the effect of azole drugs on pH homeostasis, the role of ROS in azole-induced growth inhibition may need to be re-evaluated.</p>
<p>The far-reaching effect of V-ATPase is illustrated by diverse phenotypes exhibited by V-ATPase mutants. By disrupting the function of V-ATPase through ergosterol deprivation, azole drugs can affect a wide range of cellular processes, including cation homeostasis, protein sorting, processing and degradation. Importantly, V-ATPase function and vacuolar processing of virulence factors are required for pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Poltermann1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Erickson1">[37]</xref>. Although we cannot preclude additional cellular targets of azole toxicity, disruption of V-ATPase function is sufficient to repress growth and attenuate fungal virulence and is likely to be a critical mechanism underlying antifungal activity of azole drugs.</p>
<p>Amiodarone exhibits antimicrobial activity against a wide range of fungi and protozoa through disruption of H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Courchesne1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Benaim1">[49]</xref>. Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed azoles were synergistic with amiodarone against fungal pathogens, <italic>e.g. C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gupta1">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, amiodarone interacts with fluconazole synergistically against fluconazole-resistant clinical isolates of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Guo1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Afeltra1">[51]</xref>. Moreover, the synergy of amiodarone and posaconazole has been shown on the protozoan <italic>T. cruzi</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Benaim1">[49]</xref>. Uncovering the mechanism underlying this synergism may provide insight guiding the design of more potent antifungal therapy.</p>
<p>Data in this study show that ergosterol is required for the optimal function of V-ATPase, a central player in maintaining H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Therefore, depletion of ergosterol would be expected to exacerbate the disruption of H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis upon amiodarone treatment. Indeed, upon ergosterol depletion either by <italic>erg</italic> mutations or by azole treatment, <sup>45</sup>Ca uptake by purified vacuolar vesicles was reduced while cytosolic H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> surges increased upon exposure to amiodarone. Thus, we conclude that disruption of V-ATPase function in maintaining cation homeostasis by azoles contributes to the synergy between azoles and amiodarone.</p>
<p>Recently, we demonstrated that a combination of amiodarone and fluconazole in <italic>C. albicans</italic> resulted in dampening of the transcriptional response to either drug alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Gamarra1">[52]</xref>. This effect could potentially stunt cellular stress responses occurring downstream of drug toxicity and thereby contribute to synergistic effects of the drugs. These data reveal an additional mechanism contributing to the synergism that is distinct from the ion homeostasis defects presented here. We and others have argued that non-overlapping but complementary insights can be obtained from phenotype versus transcriptional profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000939-Zhang1">[18]</xref>. Thus, genes involved in membrane integrity and ion homeostasis such as <italic>VMA</italic> and <italic>ERG</italic>, determine phenotype of growth sensitivity to amiodarone. These genes tend to be constitutively expressed, have a non redundant function and represent pathways upstream of the transcriptional response. On the other hand, genes that are differentially regulated in response to drug appear to play a collective, rather than individual, response to adaptation to stress. Taken together, these mechanisms contribute to a more complete picture of the complex cellular response to drug toxicity. Finally, in this study, we evaluated the clinical potential of combining fluconazole and amiodarone in treating fungal infections in a murine Candidiasis model. The synergy demonstrated in this experiment is proof-of-principle that combining azoles with agents disruptive to cation homeostasis is a promising approach to better manage fungal infections.</p>

<title>Murine candidiasis model and antifungal assessment</title>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (age, 6 to 8 weeks; weight, 17 to 20 g) (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used throughout the experiments. The mice were housed in micro-isolator cages with five animals per group and had access to food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were conducted in the PHRI-UMDNJ Research Animal Facility. Disseminated infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ATCC 36082) was induced by injection of 5.0×10<sup>5</sup> blastoconidia (∼5 times the median lethal dose) in 0.1 ml of sterile saline via the lateral tail vein of female BALB/c mice. Therapy was initiated 3 hours after challenge. Mice were treated with vehicle, Fluconazole (LKT Laboratories Inc., St. Paul, MN) (0.1 to 60 mg/kg of body weight/dose), Amiodarone (Henry Schein Animal Health, Melville, NY) (5.0 or 25 mg/kg of body weight/dose) or Fluconazole (0.1 to 60 mg/kg of body weight/dose) + Amiodarone (5.0 or 25 mg/kg of body weight/dose) administered intraperitoneally once a day for a total of 4 days. On day 4 post-infection, kidneys from euthanized mice (5 per group, unless specified) were aseptically removed, weighed, and homogenized in sterile saline using an IKA Works ULTRA TURRAX Tube Disperser Workstation (IKA Works Inc., Wilmington, NC). Serial dilutions of homogenized kidneys were plated onto YPD agar plates containing chloramphenicol (70 µg/ml) and ampicillin (50µg/ml) to eliminate bacterial cross-contamination. Culture plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h, after which the CFU were counted and the number of CFU per gram of tissue was calculated. The method was sensitive for detection of ≥10 CFU/g. The culture-negative plates were counted as having 0 CFU/g.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The association of <italic>C. albicans</italic> proliferation with treatment group was assessed using multiple linear regression of log-transformed CFU counts. Preliminary model fit analysis was conducted to confirm that a parsimonious model which included dose-response slopes for AMD and FLZ, and a term for synergistic effect of dual drug treatment fit the data as well as the saturated model, where each of the nine treatment and dosage combinations were independent predictors (likelihood ratio test p = 0.47). The regression coefficients for drug dose are interpreted as slopes of the dose response curves. For the synergistic term, the exponentiated coefficient is the ratio of geometric means of the CFU for any given dose of each drug when the other drug is present versus when the other drug is absent. The significance of the association of CFU with predictors was assessed using Wald t-statistics for the regression coefficients.</p>
