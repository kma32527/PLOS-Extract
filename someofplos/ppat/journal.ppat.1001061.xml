<p>Hypervirulent strains of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> have emerged over the past decade, increasing the morbidity and mortality of patients infected by this opportunistic pathogen. Recent work suggested the major <italic>C. difficile</italic> virulence factor, TcdB, from hypervirulent strains (TcdB<sub>HV</sub>) was more cytotoxic in vitro than TcdB from historical strains (TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>). The current study investigated the in vivo impact of altered TcdB tropism, and the underlying mechanism responsible for the differences in activity between the two forms of this toxin. A combination of protein sequence analyses, in vivo studies using a <italic>Danio rerio</italic> model system, and cell entry combined with fluorescence assays were used to define the critical differences between TcdB<sub>HV</sub> and TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Sequence analysis found that TcdB was the most variable protein expressed from the pathogenicity locus of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. In line with these sequence differences, the in vivo effects of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> were found to be substantially broader and more pronounced than those caused by TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. The increased toxicity of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> was related to the toxin's ability to enter cells more rapidly and at an earlier stage in endocytosis than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. The underlying biochemical mechanism for more rapid cell entry was identified in experiments demonstrating that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> undergoes acid-induced conformational changes at a pH much higher than that of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Such pH-related conformational changes are known to be the inciting step in membrane insertion and translocation for TcdB. These data provide insight into a critical change in TcdB activity that contributes to the emerging hypervirulence of <italic>C. difficile</italic>.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is a spore-forming bacterium that contaminates hospitals and infects patients undergoing antibiotic therapy. <italic>C. difficile</italic> is now the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea in developed countries. Most concerning has been the recent increase in mortality of <italic>C. difficile</italic> patients due to the emergence of a hypervirulent strain of this pathogen. Results from the current study suggest this change in disease severity may be due to new strains producing a variant form of <italic>C. difficile's</italic> major virulence factor, TcdB. The findings indicate TcdB from hypervirulent strains targets a much broader range of cells in vivo and is able to translocate into target cells more quickly than TcdB from historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. The more rapid cell entry by TcdB from hypervirulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> appears to be due to the toxin's capacity to undergo conformational changes necessary for membrane translocation at a higher pH than TcdB from historical strains. To date, very little has been learned about the underlying reasons for the increased virulence of emerging <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains. These findings provide insight into this problem and suggest variations in TcdB activity could be an important contributing factor to the hypervirulence of emerging strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe, first described by Hall and O'Toole over 75 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Hall1">[1]</xref>; however, the organism was not associated with human disease until 1978 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-George1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Chang1">[3]</xref>. Over the past three decades <italic>C. difficile</italic> has become a major nosocomial pathogen and is the leading cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Bartlett1">[4]</xref>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> associated disease (CDAD) is routinely treated by supportive therapy and regimens of vancomycin and metronidazole, but treatment of CDAD has become more difficult due to the emergence of hypervirulent (NAP1/BI/027) strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Muto1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Loo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-McDonald1">[7]</xref>. Elucidating the major differences between historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> and the NAP1/BI/027-related strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> is critical to understanding how this serious human pathogen continues to emerge.</p>
<p>The phenotypes of hypervirulent and historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> are different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-McDonald1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Warny1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Akerlund1">[9]</xref>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> NAP1/BI/027 produces more toxin and sporulates with higher efficiency than historical strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Loo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-McDonald1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Warny1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Akerlund1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-MacCannell1">[10]</xref>. NAP1/BI/027 strains also produce a binary toxin, CDT, which is thought to enhance colonization of <italic>C. difficile</italic> by triggering the formation of microtubule protrusions on cells of the gastrointestinal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Geric1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Goncalves1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Schwan1">[13]</xref>. Finally, <italic>C. difficile</italic> NAP1/BI/027 strains are resistant to fluoroquinolones due to mutations in DNA gyrase genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-McDonald1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Bourgault1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Drudy1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Drudy2">[16]</xref>. The extent to which one or more of these differences between the two strains contributes to hypervirulence has not been determined.</p>
<p>Recent work from Stabler and colleagues identified several genetic variations between epidemic and historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Stabler1">[17]</xref>. For example, the historical <italic>C. difficile</italic> strain, 630, was found to contain 505 unique coding sequences compared to hypervirulent strains. This analysis also identified differences in flagellar genes, metabolic genes, phage islands, and transcriptional regulators. Of interest to our work was the finding that TcdB from <italic>C. difficile</italic> hypervirulent strains had a greater cytopathic effect on a variety of cell types than TcdB isolated from a <italic>C. difficile</italic> historical strain. The steps in cellular intoxication that account for these differences in TcdB activity, and whether in vivo tropism varies between the historical and hypervirulent TcdB have not been reported.</p>
<p>TcdB (∼269 kDa) is a 2366 residue single polypeptide toxin encoded on a <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) that also includes genes for two regulators (TcdC and TcdR) of toxin expression, a putative holin (TcdE), and TcdA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Tan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Hammond1">[19]</xref>. TcdB has at least four functional domains that contribute to cell entry and glucosylation of small-GTPases within the cytosol of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Just1">[20]</xref>. TcdB's glucosyltransferase domain is included in the first 516 residues of the toxin, which also includes a conserved DXD motif (Asp286/Asp288) and Trp102, which form a complex with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and UDP-Glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-EichelStreiber1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Faust1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Hofmann1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Busch1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Busch2">[25]</xref>. A substrate recognition domain is located between residues 365–516 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Hofmann2">[26]</xref>. The cysteine protease domain at residues 544–955 is necessary for autoproteolytic activity and delivery of the enzymatic domain into the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Rupnik1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Reineke1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Egerer1">[29]</xref>. A putative membrane-spanning domain resides between residues 956–1128, yet whether this domain is required for intoxication is not known. Finally, the fourth functional domain of TcdB is located within the carboxy-terminal region of the toxin, and is predicted to interact with receptors on target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Dingle1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Wren1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-EichelStreiber2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-vonEichelStreiber1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Sequence variations in one or more of the functional domains of TcdB could account for the differences in cytotoxicity between historical and hypervirulent isolates. In the current work we test this hypothesis and demonstrate that TcdB from hypervirulent strains exhibits broader tropism in vivo. We also demonstrate TcdB from hypervirulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> undergoes hydrophobic conformational changes at a higher pH than toxin from the historical strain, and this correlates with more rapid cell entry. These findings provide insight into a possible mechanism through which hypervirulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> causes more severe illness than historical strains of this organism.</p>

<title>Sequence comparison of the functional domains of TcdB from a historical strain (TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>) and TcdB from a hypervirulent strain (TcdB<sub>HV</sub>)</title>
<p>The carboxy-terminal sequence of TcdB varies between isolates of <italic>C. difficile,</italic> including hypervirulent and historical strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Stabler1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Stabler2">[34]</xref>. Yet, whether sequence variations are more extensive in TcdB compared to other genes in the PaLoc or if the sequences outside of the carboxy-terminal domain of TcdB also varied among different strains of C. <italic>difficile</italic> has not been reported.</p>
<p>We compared the sequences of proteins encoded within the PaLoc of <italic>C. difficile</italic> 630 (a non-NAP1/BI/027 strain) and <italic>C. difficile</italic> R20291 (a 027 strain). The sequence of TcdR, a positive regulator of toxin expression was found to be 100% identical between the two strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. TcdE, the putative holin encoded in the middle of the PaLoc exhibited 99% identity and 100% similarity between the two strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. The enterotoxin, TcdA, exhibited 98% identity and 99% similarity between the two strains. The gene encoding TcdC from the hypervirulent strain encodes a stop codon and contains a deletion, which made it difficult to precisely compare this protein in the two strains. However, at the DNA level the gene was 95% homologous in the intact coding regions of <italic>tcdC</italic>. In contrast to these almost exact identities of TcdR, TcdE, and TcdA from the two strains, the amino-acid sequence of TcdB from the two strains was found to have the most variation with 92% identity and 96% similarity.</p>
<p>We next compared the functional regions of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The enzymatic region of TcdB (encompassing residues 1–543) was found to be 96% identical and 98% similar between the two strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Residues critical for catalytic activity, W102 and the DXD motif, did not vary between the two forms of TcdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The substrate specificity domain of TcdB (residues 365 to 516) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Hofmann2">[26]</xref> exhibited 99% identity and 100% similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The autoproteolytic region (residues 544 to 955) was found to contain 96% identity and 98% similarity. Moreover, the reported catalytic triad (D587, H653, and C698) was conserved between the two forms of TcdB. Interestingly however, the analysis found a rearrangement of a second cysteine residue in this region of TcdB. TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> contains a cysteine at residue 870, but this residue is a tyrosine in TcdB<sub>HV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Conversely, TcdB<sub>HV</sub> has a cysteine residue at 1477, but this was found to be a glycine residue in TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. The third putative functional domain of TcdB is between residues 956 and 1644, and encodes a hydrophobic region thought to mediate membrane insertion. Comparison of this region found 91% identity and 96% similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Representation of sequence variation between TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub>.</title>
<p>The illustration depicts TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> (top) and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> (bottom) divided into functional domains: glucosyltransferase (A), cysteine protease (B), translocation (C), and receptor binding (D). (A) Trp 102 and the DXD motif of the glucosyltransferase domain are conserved between TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub>. The amino acids making up the substrate recognition region (SR) show 99% similarity between the strains, and the overall amino acid identity of the domain is 96%. (B) The catalytic triad of the cysteine protease domain remains unchanged between TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub>, and the overall identity of the domain is 96%. TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> contains a cysteine at residue 870, while TcdB<sub>HV</sub> contains a tyrosine at residue 870. (C) Amino acid identity of the translocation domain is 91%, with a 97% sequence identity occurring in the hydrophobic region (HR). TcdB<sub>HV</sub> contains two cysteines in this domain, which are not found in this region of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. (D) TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> share an identity of 88% in the putative receptor binding domain. Gray boxes symbolize the CROP (clostridial repetitive oligopeptide) regions, 4 large repeats and 18 small repeats. White boxes indicate TcdB<sub>HV</sub> CROPs that have less than 80% similarity to TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>.

<p>In line with earlier reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Stabler1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Stabler2">[34]</xref> the carboxy-terminal region, encompassing residues 1645 to 2366, exhibited the highest degree of sequence variation in the toxin. The carboxy-terminal region showed 88% identity and 95% similarity between the two forms of TcdB. The number of CROP regions is identical, with TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> containing 24 regions based on the YF consensus motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Dingle1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-EichelStreiber2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-vonEichelStreiber2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-AlbesaJov1">[36]</xref>. However, eight of these regions in TcdB<sub>HV</sub> were found to exhibit less than 80% sequence identity to TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>In vivo assessment of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub></title>
<p>We next used a zebrafish model to compare the in vivo effects of the two forms of this toxin. Our group has previously utilized the zebrafish embryo as a model to examine the effects of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> in real time, and found that this toxin had potent cardiotoxic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Hamm1">[37]</xref>. The zebrafish provides a distinct advantage for the purpose of examining tissue damage and tropism because it is possible to visualize these events directly with this model.</p>
<p>Zebrafish embryos were arrayed in a 48-well plate in embryo water and TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> or TcdB<sub>HV</sub> across a range of concentrations was applied to the individual wells. At 24 h following treatment, a minimum of 20 zebrafish larvae per condition were examined by light microscopy for physiological changes, tissue damage, and viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Extensive necrosis was evident in all embryos exposed to TcdB<sub>HV</sub>, with broad tissue damage caused to the yolk sac, body, and head at concentrations as low as 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g002">Fig. 2B and 2D</xref>). Furthermore, all zebrafish treated with TcdB<sub>HV</sub> succumbed to the effects of the toxin within 48 h. In contrast, treatment with TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> resulted in more specific damage at the cardiac region in approximately 75% of embryos, and was not immediately lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Incubation with higher doses of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> or for longer periods of time increased toxicity but did not alter the physiological damage from this toxin. These findings indicate that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> impacts a broader number of cell types in vivo compared to TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. However, corresponding to our previous report TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> preferentially targets cardiac cells in the zebrafish embryo system.</p>

<p>Recent studies determined the relative cytotoxicity of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> and TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> on eight different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Stabler1">[17]</xref>. Because this analysis did not include cells of cardiac lineage, we compared the two toxins on HL-1 cells, which are derived from mouse cardiac tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Claycomb1">[38]</xref>. We also examined the effects of the two toxins on CHO cells for a relative comparison to the cardiomyocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, similar to previous observations, TcdB<sub>HV</sub> was more cytotoxic to CHO cells (TCD<sub>50</sub> 2.37×10<sup>−13</sup> M) than was TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> (TCD<sub>50</sub> 2.53×10<sup>−11</sup> M). In contrast, TcdB<sub>HV</sub> was not more cytotoxic on cardiomyocytes and displayed a very similar activity to TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Upon further investigation of the cardiomyocytes, the cytotoxicity of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> was found to be slightly lower than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> (p&lt;0.05) with a TCD<sub>50</sub> approximately 10-fold higher (3.37×10<sup>−10</sup> M) than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> (TCD<sub>50</sub> 2.80×10<sup>−11</sup> M). These data indicate that while TcdB<sub>HV</sub> has a broader cell tropism and is most likely more cytotoxic overall, TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> cardiotropism is more pronounced between the two forms of this toxin.</p>

As an approach to this problem we took advantage of a previously described system used for heterologous delivery of proteins and protein fragments into the cytosol of target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Ballard1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Spyres1">[40]</xref>. This system is composed of the cell entry components of anthrax lethal toxin. Briefly, protective antigen (PA) delivers lethal factor (LF) into the cytosol of mammalian cells. The heterologous delivery system is derived from the amino-terminus of LF (LFn), which interacts with PA and can be delivered into cells, but lacks enzymatic activity. In our experiments, the DNA fragment encoding the enzymatic domain of TcdB was genetically fused to <italic>lfn</italic>, yielding a DNA construct that expresses the cell entry portion of LF with the enzymatic component of TcdB. This heterologous delivery system allowed us to regulate the cell entry of the enzymatic component of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> and TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> so that these domains were identical in the way in which they entered the cell. We predicted that if the differences in cytotoxicity were due to factors other than intracellular activity of these forms of TcdB, then the fusions should exhibit identical cytotoxic effects.</p>
<p>The results of the PA, LFn-TcdB fusion experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. CHO cells were treated with a fixed amount of PA (500 nM) plus a range of concentrations of LFnTcdB<sub>HV(enz)</sub> or LFnTcdB<sub>HIST(enz)</sub> in order to generate a standard killing curve for this assay. As controls, CHO cells were treated with PA, LFnTcdB<sub>HV(enz)</sub>, or LFnTcdB<sub>HIST(enz)</sub> separately. Following 24 h of treatment the cells were assayed for viability using WST-8 colorimetric assay and the percent survival was plotted versus concentration of the fusion protein. Treatment with each of the components alone had no effect on cell viability in this assay (data not shown). Treatments with PA plus LFnTcdB<sub>HV(enz)</sub> or PA plus LFnTcdB<sub>HIST(enz)</sub> resulted in similar (p&lt;0.05) cytotoxicity at each of the concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). To confirm that PA was not limiting in these experiments, cytotoxicity of the fusions was tested with 10-fold higher amounts of PA, and this additional amount of PA did not change the level of cytotoxicity for either fusion (data not shown). The results from this experiment suggested that the differences in the cytotoxicity of LFnTcdB<sub>HV(enz)</sub> and LFnTcdB<sub>HIST(enz)</sub> were not due to variations in intracellular activities of the enzymatic domains.</p>

<title>Flow-cytometry analysis of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> interaction with CHO cells and cardiomyocytes</title>
<p>The results from the experiment using an identical method of cell entry, suggested the differences in cytotoxicity might be associated with early steps in cell binding and cell entry. To address this hypothesis, we compared the interaction of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> and TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> with cultured cells. Cultured cells were incubated with Alexa-647-labeled TcdB<sub>HV</sub> or Alexa-647-labeled TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and the extent of toxin binding was determined by flow cytometry. This analysis was performed on CHO cell and HL-1 cardiomyocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, CHO cells and HL-1 cells exhibited a higher degree of fluorescence when incubated with labeled TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> than when incubated with labeled TcdB<sub>HV</sub>. A biphasic profile was detected in CHO cells with a smaller population of cells exhibiting a distinct, reduced, toxin-binding pattern. In contrast, binding to cardiomyocytes was uniform and revealed a profile expected for a single population of cells.</p>

<p>Experiments were next performed to determine the apparent Kd for binding of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub>. Interestingly, within the constraints of these experimental conditions we were not able to achieve saturable binding of either form of the toxin to target cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g005">Fig. 5C</xref> shows a nearly linear correlation between the increase in toxin concentration and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HL-1 cells despite reaching toxin concentrations of over 300 nM. Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g005">Fig. 5C</xref> further emphasizes the extremely low level of interaction of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> with target cells in comparison to the high MFI achieved with TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. These data suggest that cell binding involves a higher order and more complex process than expected for a single receptor-ligand interaction.</p>

<title>Rates of cell entry differ between TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub></title>
<p>Experiments were next performed to assess the difference in the rates of cell entry between the two toxins. In previous work on historical TcdB, we found that lysosomotropic inhibitors could completely block cytopathic effects of the toxin for up to 16 h, even if added up to 20 min following exposure of the cells to the toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-QaDan1">[41]</xref>. These findings indicate interaction with the cell, uptake, and then translocation into the cytosol requires at least 20 min and acidification of endosomes is necessary. To determine if TcdB<sub>HV</sub> differed from TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> in rates of cell entry, cultured CHO cells were treated with the two forms of the toxin and a lysosomotropic agent was added to the cells at time-points ranging from 5 to 60 min following treatment with toxin. The lysosomotropic agent was also added prior to or at the same time cells were treated with the toxins. The effect of the lysosomotropic agent was then assessed by determining the level of cytopathic effects (CPE) either 2 h or 12 h after treatment with the toxin. For this experiment CPE was determined rather than cytotoxicity due to toxicity of ammonium chloride at the later time points necessary for cytotoxicity assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, based on the extent of cell rounding, there appeared to be a clear difference in the rates of translocation between TcdB<sub>HV</sub> and TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Unlike our earlier findings on TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>, the cytotoxic effects of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> could not be prevented when the lysosomotropic agent was added as soon as 10 min following treatment with the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Furthermore, addition of the lysosomotropic agent within 10 min of treatment of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> only provided a slight delay in CPE, as all inhibitor treated cells showed complete rounding by 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). In contrast, the CPE of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> could be prevented by adding the inhibitor up to 30 min following treatment with the toxin. These findings indicate TcdB<sub>HV</sub> translocates to the cytosol more rapidly than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>.</p>

<title>Hydrophobic transitions occur at a higher pH in TcdB<sub>HV</sub></title>
<p>Previous studies from our group found that acidic pH triggers hydrophobic transitions in TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-QaDan1">[41]</xref>. Studies by Barth et al. found that this hydrophobic transition in TcdB correlated with membrane insertion by the toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Barth1">[42]</xref>. These conformational changes corresponded to the decrease in endosome pH that led to translocation of the toxin into the cytosol. Thus, it was reasonable to suspect that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> translocates more quickly into the cytosol because the hydrophobic transition was induced at a higher pH and thus at an earlier stage of endocytosis. To address this possibility, in the next series of experiments we identified the pH dependent conformational transitions of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> by observing changes in TNS fluorescence when the toxin was incubated at various pHs. To identify whether TcdB<sub>HV</sub> exhibits differential transitions compared to TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>, the proteins were preincubated with 150 µM TNS at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, and then analyzed for changes in TNS fluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, TcdB<sub>HV</sub> exhibited a significant increase in hydrophobicity at pH 5.0, while TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> did not undergo this transition until pH 4.0. Further examination of a narrower pH range revealed that a significant shift occurred between pH 5.4 and 5.6 in TcdB<sub>HV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). In comparison, TNS fluorescence of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> at these pHs was just above background levels.</p>

<p>These pH transitions were also studied using the inherent fluorescence of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> from the emission of tryptophan residues. Unfolding of the hydrophobic region should expose portions of the protein to a more aqueous environment, quenching tryptophan fluorescence. Environmental changes surrounding the tryptophan residues over a broad range of pH are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g008">Fig. 8A and 8B</xref>. A gradual quenching of fluorescence was detected in TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> from pH 7 to pH 4, while the tryptophan emission spectra of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> indicated a sudden shift between pH 5 and pH 6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g008">Fig. 8D</xref> reveals that this shift took place between pH 5.4 and 5.2, similar to the increase in TNS fluorescence seen at pH 5.4.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study we compared the sequences and activities of TcdB from hypervirulent and historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Because TcdB has been shown to be the major virulence factor of <italic>C. difficile</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Lyras1">[43]</xref>, we reasoned that changes in the activity of this toxin could have a profound impact on the severity of disease. The findings support this notion, as TcdB<sub>HV</sub> exhibited a broader tropism and higher potency than TcdB<sub>HIST.</sub> Among the possible explanations for this increased toxicity are the observations that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> enters cells more rapidly than TcdB<sub>HIST,</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> undergoes conformational changes at a higher pH than TcdB<sub>HIST.</sub></p>
<p>Based on the sequence comparisons and the results of the experiments using the heterologous delivery system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g003">3</xref>), it appears that the differences in tropism and cytotoxicity are due to changes in regions outside of the enzymatic domain. Rapid cell entry could lead to more efficient cell killing by providing the toxin an endocytic condition in which the toxin is not subject to possible destruction by lysosomal proteases. The data from the lysosomotropic inhibitor assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) support the idea that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> does not reside within the endosome as long as TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Among the possible reasons for more rapid cell entry is a differential sensitivity to levels of IP<sub>6</sub> that trigger autoproteolytic processing associated with translocation. We also noted a difference in the sequence of the hydrophobic region of TcdB, and if, as has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-QaDan1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Barth1">[42]</xref>, this region mediates membrane insertion, such differences could allow TcdB<sub>HV</sub> to insert into the membrane at an earlier stage of cell entry. We reasoned that if this possibility were true, there should be a difference in the pH-induced transitions of the two forms of TcdB, with the hydrophobic regions of TcdB<sub>HV</sub> becoming exposed at a pH higher than the pH necessary for triggering this transition in TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. The results from the TNS experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) indicate that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> is able to undergo the hydrophobic transition at a higher pH than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>, providing further evidence that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> has higher translocation efficiency than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Studies looking at the environment surrounding tryptophan residues of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> at lower pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) support the idea that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> undergoes a structural change at higher pH than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Additionally, these experiments revealed that the transition of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> occurs gradually, while TcdB<sub>HV</sub> demonstrates sudden shifts upon lowering the pH. This could be indicative of a more efficient unfolding of TcdB<sub>HV,</sub> which may contribute to an enhanced ability to traverse the endosomal membrane. Our current working model is that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> is able to translocate at an earlier point in endocytosis and this contributes, at least in part, to a more efficient intoxication.</p>
<p>We also recognize that the expanded tropism, along with more efficient cell entry could combine to enhance the in vivo toxicity of TcdB<sub>HV</sub>. The results from the zebrafish experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001061-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) indicate TcdB<sub>HV</sub> targets a broader array of cells in vivo than does TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Defining the specific tropism in the murine model or an infection model is more difficult, but it is reasonable to consider the possibility that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> is more lethal because the toxin targets an extensive variety of cell types systemically. Unfortunately, the TcdB receptor has been difficult to identify. Several attempts by our group to identify the TcdB receptor using standard techniques that have been successful with other toxins have failed. The results from the flow analyses in the current study suggest that the interaction of TcdB with the cell surface does not fit a single ligand-receptor model; this observation may explain why it has been so difficult to identify a receptor for this toxin. We were not able to achieve saturable binding, and interestingly TcdB<sub>HV</sub> interacted less efficiently than TcdB<sub>HIST,</sub> despite the fact that TcdB<sub>HV</sub> is clearly more cytotoxic than TcdB<sub>HIST</sub>. Undoubtedly, future studies on characterizing this complex interaction with target cells will provide important insight into a novel mechanism of TcdB intoxication.</p>
<p>Previous work by Razaq et al. found that C. difficile BI/NAP1/027 strains were more lethal than historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Razaq1">[44]</xref>. As mentioned in the introduction of this paper, there are several differences in the phenotypes of the hypervirulent and historical strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. NAP1 strains sporulate at a higher efficiency and are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Both of these characteristics may make the NAP1 strains more difficult to manage in the hospital setting and increase the frequency of disease, but are unlikely to increase virulence. Likewise, the binary toxin has been shown to enhance colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Schwan1">[13]</xref>, but clinical data have revealed little correlation between the increase in disease severity and production of this toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Rupnik2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Barbut1">[46]</xref>. In addition, previous work found binary toxin to be enterotoxic, but strains producing binary toxin alone did not cause disease in hamsters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Geric2">[47]</xref>. Clearly, an increase in toxin production such as that reported for NAP1 strains could enhance virulence, but a recent report suggests that the <italic>tcdC</italic> mutation in epidemic strains does not always correlate with the overexpression of TcdA and TcdB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Murray1">[48]</xref>. Based on the findings from the current study, we suggest that variations in TcdB sequence and activity could be an important determining factor in the hypervirulence of NAP1 strains.</p>
<p>The recent work of Lyras et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-Lyras1">[43]</xref> found that TcdB is critical to <italic>C. difficile</italic> virulence in a hamster model of CDAD. Thus, variations in the antigenic region (e.g. carboxy terminus) of TcdB could allow repeated <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections of the same host by strains with antigenic variants of this toxin. In a recent publication by He and colleagues it was estimated that <italic>C. difficile</italic> diverged into a distinct species between 1.1 and 85 million years ago, and has gone through remarkable genetic variation over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001061-He1">[49]</xref>. The authors also posited that immune selection could have influenced the genetic variation, and they examined candidate immunogenic proteins that might fit this profile and 12 such proteins were identified. TcdB was not among these candidate proteins. It is unclear whether TcdB fits the criteria established for a positively selected core gene of <italic>C. difficile</italic> in this study, but it is reasonable to suspect the gene may have varied to avoid immune responses and this hypervariability enriched for a more potent form of the toxin. It is worth noting that while the protein identity was around 92%, the DNA homology was 93%. Nearly all of the residue changes occur as a single nucleotide substitution that result in amino acid substitutions. This further suggests a possible change in the sequence of TcdB that has been selected through an enhancement in virulence and perhaps by immune evasion.</p>

Cells scored positive for CPE only when fully rounded, and the percent CPE was calculated as % rounded cells<sub>test</sub> - % rounded cells<sub>control</sub>, where control refers to cells treated with media alone.</p>

<title>TNS assays and tryptophan analysis</title>
<p>2-(<italic>p</italic>-Toluidinyl) naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (TNS; Invitrogen) solutions were prepared to a final concentration of 150 µM in pH specific buffers. For pHs ranging from 4.0 to 6.0, 100 mM NaCl-100 mM ammonium acetate-1 mM EDTA was used. For pH 6.0 to 7.0, 100 mM NaCl-100 mM MES-1 mM EDTA was used. For pH 7.0 to 8.0, 100 mM NaCl- 100 mM HEPES-1mM EDTA was used. 40 pmol of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> or TcdB<sub>HV</sub> was added to the buffer/TNS mixture in a final volume of 2.5 mL and allowed to incubate for 20 min and 37°C. Each sample was analyzed on a Fluorolog R928P PMT fluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with an excitation of 366 nm and an emission scan of 380 to 500 nm with a slit width of 2.0. Tryptophan fluorescence of TcdB<sub>HIST</sub> and TcdB<sub>HV</sub> was also compared in the same manner, using an excitation of 270 nm and an emission scan of 310 nm to 400 nm.</p>
