<p>In spite of decades-long studies, the mechanism of morphogenesis of plus-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the genus <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, including poliovirus (PV), is not understood. Numerous attempts to identify an RNA encapsidation signal have failed. Genetic studies, however, have implicated a role of the non-structural protein 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> in the formation of poliovirus particles. Here we report a novel mechanism in which protein-protein interaction is sufficient to explain the specificity in PV encapsidation. Making use of a novel “reporter virus”, we show that a quasi-infectious chimera consisting of the capsid precursor of C-cluster coxsackie virus 20 (C-CAV20) and the nonstructural proteins of the closely related PV translated and replicated its genome with wild type kinetics, whereas encapsidation was blocked. On blind passages, encapsidation of the chimera was rescued by a single mutation either in capsid protein VP3 of CAV20 or in 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> of PV. Whereas each of the single-mutation variants expressed severe proliferation phenotypes, engineering both mutations into the chimera yielded a virus encapsidating with wild type kinetics. Biochemical analyses provided strong evidence for a direct interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 of PV and CAV20. Chimeras of other C-CAVs (CAV20/CAV21 or CAV18/CAV20) were blocked in encapsidation (no virus after blind passages) but could be rescued if the capsid and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> coding regions originated from the same virus. Our novel mechanism explains the specificity of encapsidation without apparent involvement of an RNA signal by considering that (i) genome replication is known to be stringently linked to translation, (ii) morphogenesis is known to be stringently linked to genome replication, (iii) newly synthesized 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> is an essential component of the replication complex, and (iv) 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has specific affinity to capsid protein(s). These conditions lead to morphogenesis at the site where newly synthesized genomes emerge from the replication complex.</p>

<p>Enteroviruses are single, plus-stranded RNA viruses that contain a large number of closely related pathogens. Human enteroviruses cause altogether &gt;3 billion human infections per year, inflicting diseases ranging from benign (common cold) to very serious (poliomyelitis). Enterovirus replication has been studied for decades yet the mechanism of genome selection during encapsidation, a key step open for chemotherapeutic intervention, remains unknown. Attempts to identify a genomic “packaging signal”, instructing the genome to engage with capsid proteins in morphogenesis, have failed. We have used the similarities and dissimilarities of two closely related subspecies of enteroviruses, poliovirus and coxsackie A viruses (CAVs), and constructed chimeras in which the capsid coding region was interchanged. A chimera, with the CAV capsid domain and the poliovirus two non-structural domains of the polyprotein, synthesized its genome with wt kinetics yet was blocked in morphogenesis. Genetic and biochemical studies of chimeras led to the discovery that the non-structural protein 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (essential part of the replication complex) and capsid protein VP3 must directly interact for morphogenesis to proceed. This has led us to propose a novel mechanism by which the specificity of enterovirus morphogenesis is governed by protein-protein rather than RNA-protein interaction at the site of genome synthesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Morphogenesis is a crucial step at the end of the virus' life cycle that provides newly synthesized genomes with a protective shell to survive in the extracellular environment yet assures attachment to and penetration into subsequent host cells. Morphogenesis of viral genomes must be specific because encapsidation of non-progeny nucleic acid is wasteful for the virus, for which reason elaborate mechanisms have evolved to discriminate against nucleic acids other than its own genome.</p>
<p>Here we describe our studies of the morphogenesis of a group of single, plus-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, a family of viruses containing a large number of human and animal pathogens. Poliovirus (PV), the prototype enterovirus, has been extensively studied for a century and although much is known about its virion structure, uptake into host cell, genome structure and macromolecular events of replication, the mechanism of particle assembly is only poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Semler1">[1]</xref>. The key requirement of morphogenesis, namely the specific selection of viral genomes, has also remained obscure. We have discovered a novel mechanism for enteroviruses in which the specificity of encapsidation is facilitated by protein-protein interaction. It should be noted that this mechanism is different from the one used by some other RNA viruses such as hepatitis B virus and alphaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Bartenschlager1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Frolova1">[3]</xref>. The specificity of encapsidation with these viruses is dependent on an RNA encapsidation signal and RNA/protein interactions.</p>
<p>Enteroviruses synthesize only one protein, the polyprotein, which is cleaved by two virus-encoded proteinases, 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup>/3CD<sup>pro</sup>, into intermediates expressing specific functions (e.g. 3CD<sup>pro</sup>) and into mature proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). After its release from the polyprotein by 2A<sup>pro</sup>, the precursor of the structural proteins (P1) interacts with cellular chaperone Hsp90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Geller1">[4]</xref>, a requirement for its subsequent processing by 3CD<sup>pro</sup> into capsid proteins VP0, VP3 and VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-YpmaWong1">[5]</xref>. These cleavage products will spontaneously form a 5S protomer (VP0, VP3, VP1) that can oligomerize to the 14S pentamer (VP0, VP3, VP1)<sub>5</sub>; twelve pentamers, subsequently, assemble into a 75S empty capsid [(VP0, VP3, VP1)<sub>5</sub>]<sub>12</sub>, also called procapsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Hellen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Racaniello1">[7]</xref>. It is not known at what stage progeny genomes interact with the capsid precursors. They may be inserted into the procapsid or, alternatively, pentamers may condense around RNA emerging from the replication complex. Either process will yield provirions {[(VP0, VP3, VP1)<sub>5</sub>]<sub>12</sub>RNA} <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jacobson1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Nugent1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Pfister1">[10]</xref> that mature to virions when VP0 is cleaved to VP4 and VP2 by a mechanism possibly involving an RNA-dependent autocatalytic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Hellen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Racaniello1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<p>The encapsidation process in PV morphogenesis is highly restricted to newly synthesized plus strand progeny RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Molla1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Nugent2">[12]</xref>. Under normal conditions of replication in HeLa cells, cellular RNAs, PV mRNA lacking VPg or viral VPg-linked minus strand RNA are excluded from mature viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Hellen1">[6]</xref>. Numerous studies aimed at determining the specificity of encapsidation by searching for an RNA packaging signal have been unsuccessful. The very long 5′NTR of PV can be replaced with that of the distantly related coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Johnson1">[13]</xref> or CVB4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Barclay1">[14]</xref> yielding virions containing chimeric genomes that proliferate with PV wild type (wt) kinetics. Similarly, the cloverleaf of PV can be changed to that of HRV2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Xiang1">[15]</xref>, or the PV IRES has been exchanged with IRESes from other picornaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Gromeier1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Alexander1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Wimmer1">[18]</xref> and even with that of HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Lu1">[19]</xref> without yielding impaired encapsidation phenotypes. The 3′NTR of PV, in turn, has been exchanged with that of HRV14, a single stem-loop structure with no apparent similarity in structure and sequence to that of PV. This chimera too proliferated with wt kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Rohll1">[20]</xref>. This makes it highly unlikely that the 5′- and 3′-NTRs of poliovirus contain packaging determinants. The genomic sequence encoding the capsid P1 precursor cannot harbor an encapsidation signal since the entire P1 encoding region can be deleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Kajigaya1">[21]</xref> or replaced by foreign genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Barclay1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Porter1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Porter2">[23]</xref>. Such PV replicons, all of which can replicate, can be efficiently encapsidated with PV capsid proteins in <italic>trans</italic>. Recent experiments from this laboratory, employing a “scrambled” sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Mueller1">[24]</xref> of the P2 coding region (scramble of synonymous codons) have eliminated this region too from carrying an encapsidation signal (Song, Mueller, Ward, Skiena, Futcher, Paul and Wimmer, manuscript in preparation). Finally, genetic modification of the PV VPg coding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Reuer1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Cao1">[26]</xref> or engineering PVs carrying VPg sequences of other picornaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Reuer1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Cheney1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Paul1">[28]</xref> have also eliminated the VPg coding sequence as providing an encapsidation signal. VPg, however, may still play a role in encapsidation (see below). Currently it seems unlikely that poliovirus or other enteroviruses (including the rhinoviruses that have recently been classified as enteroviruses) harbor an RNA signal that would instruct the capsid components to bind to and enclose the viral genome in a specific manner. Only one member of the extended family of <italic>Picornaviridae,</italic> Aichi virus (<italic>Kobuvirus</italic> genus), was reported to contain a 5′-terminal RNA stem loop with a role in particle assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Sasaki1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among the nonstructural proteins of PV, 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and 3CD<sup>pro</sup>, have been reported to be involved in packaging although no mechanism(s) is known. Studies with an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation/RNA replication system, which produces viable viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Molla1">[11]</xref>, have suggested that 3CD<sup>pro</sup> functions at a late step in the assembly process just before or during the maturation cleavage of VP0 to VP2 and VP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Franco1">[30]</xref>. Protein 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> of PV has been implicated in virion capsid formation through genetic analysis of a cold-sensitive mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Li1">[31]</xref> or by determining escape mutants from drug (hydantoin) inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Vance1">[32]</xref>. The multifunctional 329 amino acids-long 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> is the most complex and least understood nonstructural proteins of enteroviruses. The functions of this protein that are highly conserved among picornaviruses, include, in addition to encapsidation, host cell membrane rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Cho1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Egger1">[34]</xref>, genome replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Paul2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Rodriguez1">[36]</xref> and even uncoating of viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Li2">[37]</xref>. Based on sequence analyses the protein has been classified as a member of the superfamily III helicases, which contain 3 conserved motifs (A–C), including two classical ATP binding motifs (A and B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Gorbalenya1">[38]</xref>.

The N-terminal part of the protein contains a RNA binding domain and an amphipathic helix, which is involved in membrane binding and oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Rodriguez1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Adams1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Paul3">[43]</xref>. Another amphipathic helix, a RNA binding domain and a cysteine rich domain that binds zinc are located near the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Teterina1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Pfister3">[45]</xref>. In infected cells 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> appears to be associated with viral RNA in the replication complexes on the surface of membranous vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Bienz1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Available evidence suggests that genome replication is a precondition of PV encapsidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Molla1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Nugent2">[12]</xref>. Electron-microscopic studies, which showed that RNA replication complexes co-localize with capsid precursors on membranous vesicles during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Pfister4">[47]</xref>, supported these observations. Nugent et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Nugent2">[12]</xref> hypothesized that encapsidation specificity may be determined by the spatial arrangement of replication complexes with the capsid precursors. This intriguing hypothesis lacked an essential component: what brings the capsid precursors into the vicinity of the replication complexes since PV replicons lacking the P1 domain altogether can be efficiently encapsidated in <italic>trans</italic>?</p>
<p>Human enteroviruses have been divided into several clusters based on genotype relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. PV types 1–3, and eleven C-cluster coxsackie A virus serotypes share the C-cluster, also referred to as C-cluster human enteroviruses (C-HEVs). Their difference in affinity to cellular receptors, PVs using CD155 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Mendelsohn1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Koike1">[50]</xref> while C-CAVs using ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Newcombe1">[51]</xref>, accounts for significant capsid dissimilarities between the member viruses of this species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Hogle1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Xiao1">[53]</xref>. In contrast, the differences between the non-structural proteins of PV vs C-CAVs are less pronounced. We have used the similarities and dissimilarities between PV and C-CAVs to separate RNA replication from encapsidation by constructing chimeric viruses in which capsid precursor P1 and/or 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> have been exchanged. All of the chimeric viruses studied here replicated their genomes with wt kinetics in tissue culture cells but were blocked in encapsidation, a phenotype that we examined by genetic analyses. We present genetic evidence suggesting a specific interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3, which is essential for genome encapsidation. The genetic evidence of the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>-VP3 interaction was further substantiated by biochemical assays. We propose that the primary determinant of encapsidation specificity in the enterovirus life cycle is protein-protein interaction.</p>

<p>To test the RNA replication efficiency of chimeric viruses, we used novel reporter viruses, which contain the Renilla luciferase gene fused to the N-terminal of the P1 coding region of the chimeric genomes. The same strategy (three-step overlapping PCR), described above, was used to introduce the Renilla luciferase gene into the N-terminal of P1 the coding region of the chimeric genomes (Supplementary Table 3 &amp; 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001066.s001">Text S1</xref>).

<title>Rationale for generating PV and CAV chimeras to study enterovirus encapsidation</title>
<p>The lack of evidence for an RNA packaging signal in enterovirus proliferation has prompted us to study the specificity of encapsidation by searching for possible protein-protein interactions needed for this process. Previous studies have shown that chimeric constructs of the PV polyprotein with exchanges of varying coding regions of closely related picornaviruses can be utilized to analyze determinants of viral macromolecular interactions and replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Dewalt1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Cornell1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Bell1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Teterina2">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Li3">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Lu2">[62]</xref>. PV and C-CAVs share a high degree of amino acid identity in their nonstructural proteins but are not closely related in their capsid sequences probably because they evolved to use different cellular receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. In a chimera with the capsid of one C-HEV and the nonstructural proteins of another C-HEV, this difference may produce specific morphogenesis phenotypes due to incompatibility or poor interaction between capsid and nonstructural proteins. In our previous work, we have already observed that the replacement of the PV type 1 Mahoney (PVM) capsid with that of its closest relative, CAV20, resulted in a quasi-infectious virus, C<sub>20</sub>PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. In C<sub>20</sub>PP, the first letter refers to the origin of the P1 region, the 2nd and 3rd letters refer to the origins of the P2 and P3 regions, respectively. The quasi-infectious phenotype means that a step in the life cycle of C<sub>20</sub>PP is so severely debilitated that only escape variants can be recovered from transfections with RNA transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. The molecular basis of the defective phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP was not elucidated but could be proteolytic processing of the capsid precursor, genome replication or encapsidation.

<title>C<sub>20</sub>PP is defective in encapsidation</title>
<p>We first provided evidence that the quasi-infectious phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP was not due to abnormal translation or protein processing resulting from poor compatibility between the heterologous capsid and the 3CD<sup>pro</sup> polypeptide in C<sub>20</sub>PP. Translation of RNA transcripts of wt and chimeric constructs in a HeLa cell-free extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Molla1">[11]</xref> showed normal translation and protein processing patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The search for the block of C<sub>20</sub>PP proliferation led us to develop a novel reporter virus in which the PV open reading frame (ORF) of the Renilla Luciferase (R-Luc) protein was fused to the N-terminus of the viral polyprotein. In the course of the infection the R-Luc is cleaved off from the viral polyprotein at an engineered 3CD<sup>pro</sup> proteinase cleavage site. Due to the small size of the inserted R-Luc gene this virus was stable for 1 passage after transfection and, thus, suitable for our experiments. This construct is similar to a previously described recombinant coxsackie B3 virus that stably expressed eGFP in tissue culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Feuer1">[63]</xref>. The advantage of using our reporter virus over conventional reporter replicons, in which the P1-coding sequence is replaced by the luciferase gene, is that it can distinguish between a defect in replication and encapsidation. A reporter viral genome (with the R-Luc sequence) that is unable to encapsidate itself will exhibit normal RNA replication levels as evidenced by a wt-like Renilla luciferase signal after RNA transfection. However, it would not generate infectious progeny and, consequently, passage to fresh cells will fail, leading to the loss of the luciferase signal.</p>
<p>We have made such reporter viruses from both the parental wt CAV20 and the chimeric C<sub>20</sub>PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). RNA transcripts were transfected into HeLa H1 cells both in the absence and presence of 2 mM GnHCl, a potent inhibitor of PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Wimmer1">[18]</xref> and CAV20 RNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Wimmer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. Luciferase activity was determined at 16-hr post transfection either in the presence of GnHCl (+GnHCl) throughout the incubation period that allows us to measure the translation of the transfecting RNA, or in the absence of GnHCl (−GnHCl) when the luciferase signal is increased because of RNA synthesis. The ratio of the luciferase signals –GnHCl/+GnHCl indicates the extent of genome replication. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2D</xref> there was a 100 fold increase of the luciferase signal at −GnHCl compared to +GnHCl with both wt R-Luc-CAV20 and R-Luc-C<sub>20</sub>PP viruses, an observation indicating robust RNA synthesis under these conditions. Lysates of transfected cells were then inoculated to fresh HeLa H1 cells as 1<sup>st</sup> passage either in the presence or absence of GnHCl. Eight hours post infection the luciferase activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The high level of luciferase activity obtained after the first passage of the R-Luc-CAV20 virus indicated the formation of virions that had encapsidated the wt genome in the course of transfection. In contrast, no luciferase signal could be detected after passage of the lysate harboring the R-Luc-C<sub>20</sub>PP chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). We conclude that the genome of the C<sub>20</sub>PP chimera, although competent in RNA replication, cannot form infectious progeny, e.g. it is defective in genome encapsidation. The reason for the defect in encapsidation, however, remains elusive.</p>

<title>The encapsidation defect of chimera C<sub>20</sub>PP is rescued either by a mutation in capsid protein VP3 or by a mutation in the nonstructural protein 2C<sup>ATPase</sup></title>
<p>As mentioned above, the C<sub>20</sub>PP chimera is quasi-infectious. Variants that escaped the block in encapsidation were found only after three blind passages following transfection. This indicated the emergence of mutation(s). To identify the rescuing mutation(s), we plaque purified two viruses that had emerged after three passages from two independent transfections with C<sub>20</sub>PP transcripts. RT-PCR and sequence analyses of the viral genomes revealed two independent single mutations that mapped to the coding region of either VP3 (E180G) or 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (N252S).

<title>The double mutation (VP3<sup>E180G</sup>&amp;2C<sup>N252S</sup>) fully rescues C<sub>20</sub>PP to a wt encapsidation phenotype</title>
<p>The phenotypes of C<sub>20</sub>PP-VP3<sup>E180G</sup> and C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup> did not change after further passages, e.g. all attempts to isolate variants with improved proliferation phenotypes failed (data not shown). This prompted us to engineer both the VP3<sup>E180G</sup> and 2C<sup>N252S</sup> mutations into C<sub>20</sub>PP (C<sub>20</sub>PP-DM). Variant C<sub>20</sub>PP-DM expressed phenotypes (virus titer and plaque size) almost the same as that of wt CAV20 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g003">3A</xref>). Currently, we cannot explain why in our experiments the C<sub>20</sub>PP-DM-like variant did not evolve during passaging of C<sub>20</sub>PP.</p>
<p>To confirm the rescue of the encapsidation defect of C<sub>20</sub>PP by the mutations in VP3 and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, we constructed reporter viruses R-Luc-C<sub>20</sub>PP-VP3<sup>E180G</sup>, R-Luc-C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup> and R-Luc-C<sub>20</sub>PP-DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). All three produced strong luciferase signals after transfection of their genomic RNAs into HeLa H1 cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). After a passage into fresh HeLa H1 cells, the luciferase activity was highly impaired with C<sub>20</sub>PP but was found to be partially rescued if the virions carried the single 2C<sup>N252S</sup> or VP3<sup>E180G</sup> mutation or fully rescued by the double mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, although a single mutation can partially rescue the proliferation phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP, the double mutation 2C<sup>N252S</sup>/VP3<sup>E180G</sup> in the genome of the chimera is capable of producing a proliferation phenotype similar to that of wt CAV20. This observation, confirms the previous genetic data by Vance et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Vance1">[32]</xref> that the coding region of 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> is linked to encapsidation. More importantly, the cooperative activity of VP3 with 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> suggests that capsid protein VP3 functions through a direct interaction with 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> in encapsidation. As indicated before, the coding sequence of 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, however, can be eliminated as carrying an encapsidation signal. The <italic>cre</italic>, the only known essential RNA structure in coding sequence of 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, are highly homologous in sequence between PV and CAV20. Moreover, scrambling of the P2 RNA sequence has no influence on PV proliferation if the essential <italic>cre</italic> is transplanted to the 5′NTR (Song, Mueller, Ward, Skiena, Futcher, Paul, and Wimmer, manuscript in preparation). It is, thus, likely that VP3 and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> or their precursors cooperate by protein-protein interaction, a novel mechanism for specific genome encapsidation of enteroviruses.</p>

<title>A CAV20-like 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> rescues the encapsidation defect of C<sub>20</sub>PP</title>
<p>It should be noted that the mutation in 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, which rescues in part the encapsidation of C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup>, is an N/S change in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> at position 252 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Amino acid sequence alignment demonstrated that CAV20 has a Gly at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), an observation indicating that a CAV-20 like, uncharged residue might be favorable at this position. Thus, since C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup> expressed a severe encapsidation phenotype, it was of interest to determine whether a C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252G</sup> mutant would yield a chimera equal or superior in encapsidation to C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup>. Similar to C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup>, the N252G mutation in the PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> only partially rescued the encapsidation phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The observed N/S mutation in a naturally selected escape mutant can be explained by the reasoning that the CAV20-like N/G change in codon N252 would have required two nucleotide changes (<underline>AA</underline>T/<underline>GG</underline>T) while the N/S mutation entails only a single nucleotide change (A<underline>A</underline>T/A<underline>G</underline>T). Overall, the CAV20 like single amino acid change at 252 of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> was favorable but not sufficient to fully rescue the VP3-related function of the PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> protein in encapsidation.</p>
<p>Based on this observation, we reasoned that the replacement of the entire 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> coding region in C<sub>20</sub>PP with its CAV20 counterpart should yield a chimera whose protein/protein interaction required for encapsidation would be sufficient and, thus, yield a virus with proliferation phenotypes similar to that of wt CAV20. Therefore, we generated a chimera designated as C<sub>20</sub>P(C<sub>20</sub><sup>2C</sup>)P that showed CPE after transfection with a virus titer comparable to that of wt CAV20 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g004">4B</xref>). These results provide further support for the hypothesis that the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> protein is a partner required for encapsidation. It should be noted that the chimera C<sub>20</sub>P(C<sub>20</sub><sup>2C</sup>)P had a growth phenotype more similar to that of the wt CAV20 virus than the chimera C<sub>20</sub>PP-2C<sup>N252S</sup> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g004">4B</xref>), an observation indicating that sequences besides residue 252 in 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> are also important for function during viral encapsidation.</p>

In order to test whether the lethal phenotypes of the two chimeric viruses were due to the same encapsidation defect as that of C<sub>20</sub>PP, we constructed reporter viruses of CAV18 and of the chimeras C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>21</sub>C<sub>21</sub> and C<sub>18</sub>C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>20</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) just as that of CAV20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

<p>To test whether the lethal proliferation phenotypes of the two chimeras (C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>21</sub>C<sub>21</sub> and C<sub>18</sub>C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>20</sub>) are related to an incompatibility between the capsid and the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> proteins derived from different parental viruses, we constructed new chimeras [C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>21</sub>(C<sub>20</sub><sup>2C</sup>)C<sub>21</sub>, C<sub>18</sub>C<sub>20</sub>(C<sub>18</sub><sup>2C</sup>)C<sub>20</sub>] in which the capsid and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> proteins were derived from the same origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The resulting chimeras all showed CPE after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and the virus titers were comparable to that of the parental viruses (data not shown). The finding that the lethal growth phenotypes of the chimeras were fully rescued when the capsid and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> were derived from the same origin serves as further support of our hypothesis that 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and capsid proteins communicate with each other during the process of encapsidation. So far, we have not been able to determine, by continued passage, the necessary amino acid changes in the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> protein of CAV20 and CAV21 to allow encapsidation of the C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>21</sub>C<sub>21</sub> and C<sub>18</sub>C<sub>20</sub>C<sub>20</sub> chimeras.

<title>A direct interaction between proteins 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 is revealed by biochemical assays</title>
<p>The genetic evidence described above strongly suggested a direct interaction between the capsid proteins and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, which is required for encapsidation. To confirm this interaction, we carried out a GST-pull down assay with purified PV proteins GST-2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and His-VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 2). The same assay was performed with purified GST protein as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 1). Our results clearly showed that PV GST-2C<sup>ATPase</sup> interacts directly with the PV His-tagged VP3 protein. To provide further proof that direct interaction between VP3 and 2C<sup>ATPas</sup> is required for the encapsidation process, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed with VP3 and 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> proteins in three different combinations: CAV20 VP3 &amp; CAV20 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, CAV20 VP3 &amp; PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, CAV20 VP3 (E180G) &amp; PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (N252S), which correspond to those observed in wt CAV20, nonviable chimera C<sub>20</sub>PP, and rescued C<sub>20</sub>PP-DM, respectively. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcribed RNA transcripts of 2C and VP3 coding sequences in different combinations were co-translated in HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 4–6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Molla1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Liu1">[55]</xref>. Using PV 2C polyclonal antibody, which recognizes PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and CAV20 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> with the same efficiency (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Emini1">[56]</xref>, CAV20 VP3 was co-immunoprecipitated readily by CAV20 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (100%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 1) but only weakly by PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (32%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 2). The extent of interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 was quantified using a PhosphorImager and is expressed as percentage of the level observed in the CAV20 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and CAV20 VP3 Co-IP reaction. These results indicated a strong, direct interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 of the same origin (CAV20) but not between PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and CAV20 VP3, a combination that yielded the nonviable C<sub>20</sub>PP chimera. In contrast, the interaction between PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (N252S) and CAV20 VP3 (E180G) proteins was restored (78%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 3) when the two mutations were incorporated into PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and CAV20 VP3, respectively, This observation, which correlates with the rescue of the nonviable phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP by the two mutations, strongly support the notion that sufficient protein-protein interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 is essential for the encapsidation process. The same Co-IP assays were also performed with α-actin antibody and empty resin as controls to ensure that the interactions were not due to non-specific binding of the proteins to the antibody or to the resin (data not shown). It should be noted that there was an extra protein band shown below the band of 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> in each of the input lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 4–6, indicated by asterisk), which was possibly generated from the internal initiation or premature termination of the translation of RNA transcripts of 2C coding sequences. Apparently these incomplete translation products could not be recognized by the 2C antibody since protein bands disappeared after Co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 1–3). These results confirm the specificity of the Co-IP assay in which the detection of the VP3 protein was due to its co-immunoprecipatation with the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> protein, recognized by anti-2C<sup>ATPase</sup> antibody.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism of picornavirus genome encapsidation has been a conundrum for many years. In previous studies on poliovirus morphogenesis, mostly <italic>trans</italic> encapsidation experiments were performed to determine the specificity of PV morphogenesis. In <italic>trans</italic> encapsidation experiments, the capsid proteins are offered from a different molecular entity to the parental genome either by coinfecting picornaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Barclay1">[14]</xref>, by the vaccinia system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Porter1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Porter2">[23]</xref> or by expression from co-transfected cDNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jia1">[64]</xref>. However, differences in the experimental design also affect the outcome of the experiments. Jia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jia1">[64]</xref> have reported <italic>trans</italic>-encapsidation of PV replicons into capsids of coxsackie B3, human rhinovirus 14, and coxsackie B24 viruses. These data, however, are in contrast to those of Porter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Porter2">[23]</xref> and Barclay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Barclay1">[14]</xref>, who failed to <italic>trans</italic> encapsidate the reporter PV replicon by super-infecting with CAV21.</p>
<p>In the current study, we have used a novel system to study encapsidation of closely related enteroviruses, the C-cluster enteroviruses (C-HEVs). They consist of two classes of virus serotypes: PV and C-CAVs. We have made use of differences between these viruses to investigate the effect of capsid exchanges on C-HEV morphogenesis. By studying a variety of C-HEV chimeric viruses in which the capsid P1 precursors were exchanged, we now present direct evidence for the involvement of 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> in enterovirus morphogenesis via direct interaction with capsid protein VP3. Different from <italic>trans</italic> encapsidation assays, in which the capsid proteins are offered from a different molecular entity to the parental genome, our experiments were designed to measure <italic>cis</italic> encapsidation of genomes, in which the capsid is provided (generated) by the chimeric genome itself. It appears that in these chimeras the non-structural proteins are more discriminatory to capsid proteins because they are required to proteolytically process the heterologous capsid precursor. In addition, the quality and quantity of the heterologous capsid proteins produced might not be ideal for the chimeric genome. As we have shown here, favorable conditions for encapsidation are rarely met in the chimera, even if the viruses are as closely related as PV and CAV20.</p>
<p>In a previous study on genetic recombination between PV and C-CAVs, we observed that capsid chimera C<sub>20</sub>PP initially could not grow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>, an observation indicating that it harbors defect(s) debilitating the viral replication life cycle. Translation in HeLa cell extracts showed, however, that both translation and proteolytic processing of the CAV20 capsid precursor in C<sub>20</sub>PP was unimpaired. This is not surprising since the 3CD<sup>pro</sup> proteins of poliovirus and CAV20 are closely related in amino acid sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref> and because the 3CD<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites within the P1 precursor of PVM and CAV20/21 are well conserved (Supplementary Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001066.s001">Text S1</xref>). These two facts reduce the likelihood of a processing defect of the foreign capsid precursor prior to packaging. In contrast, a chimera consisting of the PV capsid and the coxsackie virus B3 (CBV3) nonstructural domains was not only dead but it also revealed a processing defect of the PV capsid precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Vega1">[65]</xref>. CBV3 is an enterovirus belonging to the B-cluster, and its genetic kinship with PV is much more distant than that between PV and CAV20. Thus, CBV3 3CD<sup>pro</sup> proteinase was apparently unable to properly cleave the PV capsid precursor. Similar results were obtained with a chimera of PV in which the 3C-coding region was derived from HRV14. The foreign proteinase was not capable of recognizing the PV-specific processing sites within the capsid precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Dewalt1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>The robust RNA replication phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP demonstrated here with the use of a new reporter virus construct suggested to us that this chimera might be quasi-infectious with respect to encapsidation. This was proven to be correct since viable viruses were found upon blind passages of C<sub>20</sub>PP but they harbored mutations. The virus isolates from two independent transfections contained a mutation either in 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (N252S) or in VP3 (E180G). Either of these single mutations was able to partially rescue the defective encapsidation and growth phenotype of C<sub>20</sub>PP. Introducing both mutations together into the C<sub>20</sub>PP genome fully rescued packaging and resulted in normal production of progeny virus. It is noteworthy that we never found both mutations in a single isolate even after eight passages. Perhaps the mutations conferred to the variants too little of an advantage to be selected under the conditions of the experiments. As discussed earlier, an involvement of essential RNA sequences in the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 coding sequences during the process of encapsidation can be excluded. A direct interaction between the 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 proteins, suggested by the genetic experiments, was confirmed by biochemical assays using either purified or <italic>in vitro</italic> translated PV and CAV20 proteins. It should be noted that 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> also functions in the viral life cycle in the form of its precursor 2BC<sup>ATPase</sup>. A requirement of an interaction between 2BC<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 for packaging is, however, unlikely since 2B is less homologous between PV and CAV20 in sequence than 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and the exchange of the mature 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> protein alone is sufficient for full rescue. We are currently investigating whether the interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3 involves the mature VP3 polypeptide or one of the capsid intermediates during viral assembly and/or maturation.</p>
<p>The encapsidation defect of C<sub>20</sub>PP could also be rescued by replacing the entire 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> coding sequence of PV with that of CAV20. Additional experiments indicated that the lethal growth phenotypes of other CAV/CAV capsid chimeras could also be reversed by replacing their 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> coding sequence with that of the capsid donor virus. It is noteworthy that these observations are not contradictory to the scenario of another chimera previously described. PC<sub>20</sub>C<sub>20</sub>, which, in contrast to C<sub>20</sub>PP, possesses a chimeric genome encoding PV capsid and CAV20 nonstructural protein sequences, grows as well as wt PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. We have previously proposed that the evolutionary direction is from C-CAV to PV within C-HEVs resulting in a receptor switch from ICAM-1 to CD155 during the speciation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Jiang1">[48]</xref>. If so, the newly emerged PV capsid may still be compatible with 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> of the C-CAV ancestors and achieve sufficient interaction required for encapsidation.</p>
<p>Our data also clarify some unanswered questions about previous <italic>trans</italic> encapsidation experiments using poliovirus replicons containing a reporter gene in the capsid-coding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Barclay1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Porter2">[23]</xref>. Those studies showed that CAV21 was not able to encapsidate a PV replicon even though co-infection of cells with CAV21 resulted in high levels of replication of both CAV21 and the PV replicon. The most likely reason for those results is that the CAV21 capsid, similar to CAV20 capsid, fails to properly interact with PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>. From their studies with hydantoin, Vance et al., have suggested that 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> might have a role in encapsidation by an association of the progeny RNA with the capsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Vance1">[32]</xref>. In other experiments with the same drug, however, Oh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Oh1">[66]</xref> have recently proposed that hydantoin inhibits the release of the progeny RNA from the replication complex prior to encapsidation. Whether the interaction between 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and VP3, as we have observed in our studies, is required during or just before the union of the RNA with capsid proteins remains to be determined.</p>

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001066-g008">Figure 8</xref>, we present a model of morphogenesis that is based, admittedly, on much speculation. We currently propose that in the context of the membrane-associated replication complex 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> will directly interact with a 14S pentamer via VP3. The pentamer will then bind the newly emerging, VPg-linked genomic RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Nugent1">[9]</xref> while the assembly of the virion proceeds in close contact with the membranous environment.

<p>It is likely that our model will be applicable to most, if not all, picornaviruses as well as to other families of plus strand RNA viruses.

This signal by itself, however, is not sufficient to confer encapsidation specificity since it can be replaced by a similar stem loop from hepatitis A virus, a member of the genus <italic>Hepatovirus</italic> of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, and the resulting chimera expresses a severe proliferation phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Cheney1">[27]</xref>. On the other hand different genera of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> may have evolved different strategies of encapsidation. This is not entirely unlikely considering the fundamentally different strategies that different genera of <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> are using to control genome translation (cap-dependent vs. IRES-dependent initiation of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Liu2">[78]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our model does not explain, however, how VPg-linked minus-stranded poliovirus RNA is discriminated against in encapsidation. Previous studies have reported that several picornaviral 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> proteins bind specifically to the 3′-end of minus strand RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Banerjee1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Banerjee2">[80]</xref>. However, the importance of this interaction, if any, for encapsidation is unlikely. Normally, plus strands are produced in great excess over minus strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Novak2">[81]</xref>, a phenomenon thought to lead to the depletion of free minus strands by forming the replicative form (RF) or replication intermediates (RI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Wimmer1">[18]</xref>. If the balance between the plus and the minus strands is disturbed, free minus strands may emerge from the replication complex and they may then be encapsidated. Indeed, encapsidation of both plus and minus strand genomic RNAs was observed in non-cytopathogenic CBV3 that were isolated from persistently infected murine hearts and cardiac myocyte cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001066-Kim1">[82]</xref>. It is possible that the non-cytopathogenic CBV3 produces minus stranded RNA in excess such that it will emerge from replication complexes where capsid precursors are waiting to encapsidate them. Whether the “cap” of a positively charged VPg on both plus or minus strands plays a role in this process remains to be seen.</p>
