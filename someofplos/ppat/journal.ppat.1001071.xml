<p>UNC93B1 associates with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7 and TLR9, mediating their translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endolysosome, hence allowing proper activation by nucleic acid ligands. We found that the triple deficient ‘3d’ mice, which lack functional UNC93B1, are hyper-susceptible to infection with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. We established that while mounting a normal systemic pro-inflammatory response, <italic>i.e.</italic> producing abundant MCP-1, IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ, the 3d mice were unable to control parasite replication. Nevertheless, infection of reciprocal bone marrow chimeras between wild-type and 3d mice with <italic>T. gondii</italic> demonstrated a primary role of hemopoietic cell lineages in the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>UNC93B1</italic> mutant mice. The protective role mediated by UNC93B1 to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection was associated with impaired IL-12 responses and delayed IFNγ by spleen cells. Notably, in macrophages infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, UNC93B1 accumulates on the parasitophorous vacuole. Furthermore, upon <italic>in vitro</italic> infection the rate of tachyzoite replication was enhanced in non-activated macrophages carrying mutant <italic>UNC93B1</italic> as compared to wild type gene. Strikingly, the role of UNC93B1 on intracellular parasite growth appears to be independent of TLR function. Altogether, our results reveal a critical role for UNC93B1 on induction of IL-12/IFNγ production as well as autonomous control of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replication by macrophages.</p>

<p>One third of the human population in the world is chronically infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii.</italic> While the majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic, toxoplasmosis is a major cause of congenital disease, abortion, and a life-threatening opportunistic disease in immunocompromised individuals. Early activation of the innate immune system and cytokine production by myeloid cells is required for establishment of protective immunity to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. In mice, a mutation in the <italic>UNC93B1</italic> gene abolishes signaling via the intracellular innate immune receptors, namely Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7 and 9, thus, named triple-deficiency (3d) mice. Our results demonstrate that the hyper-susceptibility of 3d mice to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is associated with impaired IL-12 production, delayed IFNγ production, and uncontrolled parasite replication in macrophages. Overall, our study reveals a critical role for UNC93B1 in the immunological control of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a widespread obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, which establishes itself in the brain and muscle tissues, persisting for life in humans and other vertebrate hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Hill1">[1]</xref>. One of the most distinctive aspects of <italic>T. gondii</italic> life cycle is the establishment of an often benign chronic infection, which is dependent on the parasite's ability to elicit a strong and persistent cell-mediated immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Hill1">[1]</xref>. Severe forms of toxoplasmosis are often seen in humans with an immature or suppressed immune system. In particular, cytokines that activate macrophage effector functions, such as IFNγ and TNFα, are critical in mediating host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Denkers1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense conserved molecules from all classes of microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Akira1">[3]</xref>, including those from protozoan parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gazzinelli1">[4]</xref>. Studies employing MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which are deficient in the function of most TLRs (except for TLR3), suggest that TLRs are critical in many aspects of host:protozoan parasite interaction, including the initiation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Campos1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Scanga1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Muraille1">[7]</xref>. The initial activation of the innate immune system leads to the immediate activation of anti-microbial effector mechanisms. In addition, innate immune activation gives way, over time, to the development of Th1 lymphocytes and host resistance to protozoa, including <italic>T. gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gazzinelli1">[4]</xref>. TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, and TLR11 have been shown to be important cognate innate immune receptors involved in the recognition of <italic>T. gondii</italic> derived components, such as glycosilphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-DebierreGrockiego1">[8]</xref>, CpG DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Minns1">[9]</xref> and profilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Plattner1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Yarovinsky1">[11]</xref>. However, the deficiency of each of these TLRs, and even the loss of two TLRs, as is the case with TLR2/TLR4 double knockout mice, leads to a relatively minor phenotype after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, as compared to the results obtained with infected MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Scanga1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The “endosomal TLRs”, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, recognize microbial RNA and DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Alexopoulou1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Diebold1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Heil1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Hemmi1">[15]</xref>. In addition to its well-described function in the recognition of CpG motifs, TLR9 has been shown to play an important role in the recognition of parasite DNA and host resistance to infection by several different protozoan parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Drennan1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Bartholomeu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Parroche1">[18]</xref>. However, the combined role of nucleotide-sensing TLRs in host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> has not been explored. Tabeta and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref> identified a mutant mouse line by forward genetic screening that they named “3d”, so called because of its deficiency in response to TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 ligands (mouse TLR8 do not respond to single stranded RNA). The 3d mouse was shown to have altered UNC93B1 function, an endoplasmic reticulum protein with distant homology to an ion transporter in worms. UNC93B1 is now known to be essential for signaling through mouse TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, and the consequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Casrouge1">[20]</xref>. The combined deficiency of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs results in altered host resistance to microbial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Akira1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Casrouge1">[20]</xref>. Specifically, UNC93B1 associates and mediates the translocation of the nucleotide-sensing TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the endolysosomal compartment, allowing their proper activation by microbial RNA and DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Brinkmann1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Kim1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we show that although mounting a normal systemic pro-inflammatory response, the 3d mice are extremely susceptible to infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Nevertheless, we provide evidence of a critical role of UNC93B1 in mediating IL-12 as well as early IFNγ production during acute infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Its well known that active host cell invasion by <italic>T. gondii</italic> leads to formation of a high pH-parasitophorous vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Sibley1">[23]</xref>, parasite replication and parasitism, whereas passive internalization of the parasite by phagocytosis results in parasite elimination in the lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Joiner1">[25]</xref>. We also found that in macrophages infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, UNC93B1 translocates to the parasitophorous vacuole, rather than to the predicted phagolysosomes. Finally, our results demonstrate that the lack of functional UNC93B1 results in enhanced tachyzoite replication in macrophages. Altogether, our experiments reveal a role for UNC93B1 on IL-12 production induced by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, as well as an unprecedented TLR-independent role for UNC93B1 on host cell control of <italic>T. gondii</italic> replication, which combined are of central importance for the <italic>in vivo</italic> resistance to infection with this intracellular protozoan parasite.</p>

<title>Extreme susceptibility of 3d mice to acute infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> is associated with enhanced parasite replication and unimpaired systemic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines</title>
<p>We found that the 3d mice are highly susceptible to infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, suggesting the possibility that the combined action of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 is critical for host resistance to infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. However, we used as a control the double MyD88/TRIF-null mice, which are deficient in all TLR responses. While very susceptible, we found that upon infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> the double MyD88/TRIF deficient mice were somewhat more resistant than the 3d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). While this difference was not dramatic, it was consistent, suggesting that UNC93B1 may also mediate host resistance to this parasitic infection by a novel mechanism, independent of TLR function.</p>

<p>As measured by real-time PCR, enhanced parasite replication was observed in different peripheral organs (<italic>i.e.</italic> spleen, liver, and lungs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), despite of unimpaired systemic IFNγ and TNFα production from 3d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Figs. 2A and 2B</xref>). This is remarkable in view of the long established role for these cytokines in triggering macrophage effector functions and mediating host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic>. In agreement with the real-time PCR data, analysis of the cells collected from the peritoneal cavity of infected animals showed significant higher numbers of infected cells in 3d animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g001">Figs. 1C and 1D</xref>). Phenotypic analysis revealed that 55–75% of the cells recruited to the peritoneal cavity of 3d animals expressed the surface marker CD11b. Of these, 75% were neutrophils (CD11b<sup>+</sup>, Ly6G<sup>+</sup>, F4/80<sup>−</sup>) and the remaining 25% were inflammatory monocytes (CD11b<sup>+</sup>, Ly6C<sup>high</sup>, Ly6G<sup>−</sup>, F4/80<sup>low</sup>). Although infected neutrophils were observed, they rarely contained more than two parasites, whereas four or more tachyzoites were typically observed in monocyte/machophage-like cells. Thus, enhanced susceptibility to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection was associated with uncontrolled parasite replication within monocyte/macrophage-like cells in peritoneal cavity of 3d mice.</p>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001071.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>In order to further investigate the role of nucleotide-sensing TLRs in resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we infected the TLR3<sup>−/−</sup>, TLR7<sup>−/−</sup> and TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice, as well as the single knockout mice deficient in each of the two main adaptors required for TLR function, TRIF and MyD88. Our results showed that except for the MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which were very susceptible to infection, all of the other mice lineages had a similar survival curve and cyst numbers, in comparison to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and data not shown).</p>
<p>We anticipated that the lack of endosomal TLR function would result in impaired cytokine production during infection. However, to our surprise, we found that upon infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, except for impaired IL-12p40 production, 3d mice showed high levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IFNγ, and TNFα in their sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Fig. 2, A–B</xref>). Similarly, splenocytes from 3d mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> demonstrated unimpaired <italic>ex-vivo</italic> cytokine production (data not shown). While infected MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> and MyD88/TRIF double deficient mice had decreased serum levels and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> production of several cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and data not shown), unimpaired cytokine production of IL-12p40, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-6 and MCP-1 were confirmed in the sera from TRIF<sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), TLR3<sup>−/−</sup>, TLR7<sup>−/−</sup>, and TLR9<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001071.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Together, these initial results suggest that the extreme susceptibility of the 3d mouse to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is due to an additional function of UNC93B1 that is not related to the regulation of endosomal TLRs.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Enhanced susceptibility of 3d mice to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is mediated by cells from hemopoietic lineage</title>
<p><italic>T. gondii</italic> is a promiscuous parasite that infect any nucleated host cells of both hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic origin. Thus, its replication could be controlled by metabolites secreted by activated macrophages or, alternatively, directly by cytokine-induced microbicidal mechanisms triggered within infected non-phagocytic cells. To distinguish between these two basic mechanisms of cell-mediated immunity, reciprocal bone marrow chimeras were constructed between wild-type and 3d mice and their survival assessed following challenge with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The reverse chimeras were generated employing wild type (B6.SJL) and 3d mice, which hemopoietic cells express CD45.1 and CD45.2 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001071.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). Notably, transplanted mice, which possess hemopoietic cells from 3d mice, became non-responsive to any of the TLR7 and TLR9 agonists, but sustained cytokine response (TNFα and RANTES) to LPS and Concanavalin A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001071.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). Finally, infectious challenge of reciprocal chimeras demonstrated that expression of wild type, functional UNC93B1, in the hemopoietic, but not in the non-hemopoietic compartment was necessary for host resistance to infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These findings are consistent with data indicating the primary expression of UNC93B1 in murine cells from myeloid origin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.gnf.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=81622" xlink:type="simple">http://biogps.gnf.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=81622</ext-link>).</p>

Because UNC93B1 has also been suggested to be involved on antigen presentation and T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>, we evaluated the expansion and expression of activation markers on antigen presenting cells (<italic>i.e</italic>., CD11b<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup>), as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. CD11b<sup>+</sup> as well as CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells from 3d mice expressed significant amounts of activation markers, <italic>e.g.</italic> MHC class I and II, CD40, CD80 and CD86, which were intermediary between cells from wild type and MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, spleens of 3d mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> contained 20–40% less CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD25, CD69 and CD154 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). While these differences in wild-type vs. infected 3d mice were statistically significant, the impairment in activation of cells was far more pronounced in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), whose splenocytes showed no signs of expansion after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (data not shown). The percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>T as well as CD8<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes producing IFNγ was similar when comparing wild type and 3d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), whereas the total number of IFNγ -producing T cells was significantly smaller in infected 3d as compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with the low serum levels of IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and partial impairment on activation of antigen presenting cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), we observed a largely impaired IL-12 production by spleen cells from infected 3d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, top panel).

<p>IFNγ is thought to be the most critical cytokine in controlling <italic>T. gondii</italic> replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Denkers1">[2]</xref>, and mediates the IL-12 role on host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gazzinelli2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gazzinelli3">[27]</xref>. Despite the fact that MyD88 knockout and MyD88/TRIF double deficient animals displayed a similar impairment on IL-12 production as the 3d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Figs. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g006">6B–C</xref>), and an even more dramatic defect on IFNγ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g006">6B–C</xref>), the 3d mice consistently showed a more pronounced susceptibility to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Therefore, we believe that the delay of IFNγ production could not be solely responsible for the profound susceptibility phenotype observed on 3d mice. Thus, we sought to determine if cells from 3d mice were properly responding to IFNγ. We observed normal STAT1 phosphorylation, an essential component for IFNγ signaling, in 3d mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Furthermore, 3d macrophages responded normally to IFNγ by producing high levels of TNFα, IL-12, and IL-6 when stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> in combination with LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001071.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Similarly, activation with IFNγ resulted in the enhanced expression of MHC I, MHC II and CD40 in macrophages from 3d mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001071.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, we found no evidence that the response to IFNγ is affected in mice lacking functional UNC93B1.</p>

<title>UNC93B1 accumulates around the parasitophorous vacuole in host cells infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic></title>
<p>Since we found large amounts of parasite within the peritoneal cavity of 3d mice, despite of the high levels of IFNγ, we decided to investigate the ability of macrophages expressing UNC93B1 to control tachyzoite growth <italic>in vitro. T. gondii</italic> can actively invade host cells or it can be actively internalized by professional phagocytic cells. The fate of the parasite inside the host cell depends on the way the parasite is internalized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Morisaki1">[28]</xref>. Active invasion normally results in generation of a unique organelle known as the parasitophorous vacuole, which is incompetent to fuse with lysosomes. The parasitophorous vacuole consequently has a high pH and is not stained by LysoTracker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Sibley1">[23]</xref>. In contrast to active invasion by the parasite, phagocytosis directs the parasite to the phagolysosome, which has a low pH, and leads to elimination of the parasite.</p>
<p>We next evaluated the association of UNC93B1 with <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites in infected host cells. We began by generating immortalized macrophage cell lines from the UNC93B1 mouse. These lines were then genetically engineered to express either YFP-tagged wild-type UNC93B1 or YFP-tagged UNC93B1<sup>H412R</sup> (the non-functional mutant expressed by the 3d mouse). Both cell lines expressed high levels of UNC93B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Macrophage cell lines expressing the wild-type form, but not the mutated UNC93B1<sup>H412R</sup>, recovered cytokine responses to agonists for TLR9 and TLR7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). In non-activated cells, UNC93B1 was observed as a resident ER protein, and did not co-localize to LysoTracker positive acidic compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001071.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Confocal microscopy revealed that after infection, there was an enrichment of UNC93B1 around the internalized parasites in cell lines that expressed the wild-type, but not the mutated/non-functional protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>Unprimed immortalized macrophages from wild type, 3d and double MyD88/TRIF knockout mice were infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> (ME-49 strain) expressing luciferase reporter gene at a ratio of one parasite per cell, and parasite growth evaluated 48 hs later, by measuring luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Our experiments demonstrated that parasite replication was more pronounced in cells from 3d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). In contrast, when we compared parasite replication in macrophages from wild type versus MyD88/TRIF double knockout mice, no difference was observed in parasite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Finally, we performed a detailed analysis of parasite growth in bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type and 3d mice, evaluating the numbers of vacuoles per cells and tachyzoites per parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001071-g008">Figs. 8C and 8D</xref>). The results of this experiment demonstrate a lower number of parasitophorous vacuoles containing 2 or 4 tachyzoites (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), and a significantly higher number of vacuoles containing 8 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) or 16 parasites when comparing macrophages from wild type and 3d mice. The number of parasitophorous vacuoles per infected cell was similar (1.72±0.22) in both cell types. Altogether, these results indicate that UNC93B1 mediates host cell resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> through a mechanism that controls parasite replication in the parasitophorous vacuole and is independent from both TLR activation and the anti-parasitic effects of IFNγ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>UNC93B1 is a critical mediator of the translocation of nucleotide-sensing TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 from the ER to endolysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Kim1">[22]</xref>. Here, we tested the 3d mouse, which has a non-functional UNC93B1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>, to evaluate the combined role of nucleotide sensing TLRs in controlling initial activation of innate immunity and host resistance to infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Despite the fact that none of single TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9 knockout yield an altered phenotype on cytokine response or enhanced susceptibility, we found that 3d mice are extremely susceptible to infection with <italic>T. gondii.</italic> Therefore, our results raise the possibility that combined action of nucleotide sensing TLRs is critical for host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>Much to our surprise, the MyD88/TRIF null mice, which are devoid of all TLR functions and show impaired production of pro-inflammatory cytokines when infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, were consistently more resistant to infection than the 3d mice. Furthermore, except for IL-12, 3d mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> mounted a normal systemic pro-inflammatory response, while the MyD88/TRIF double knockouts did not, indicating that the immunological response to infection was fundamentally different. Nevertheless, animals bearing UNC93B1 mutation succumbed to infection as a result of unchecked tachyzoite replication, similar to IFNγ<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-SchartonKersten1">[30]</xref>. Thus, while we cannot exclude that the combined action of intracellular TLR 3, 7 and 9 contributes to host resistance against <italic>T. gondii</italic>, our hypothesis is that UNC93B1 also mediates host resistance against <italic>T. gondii</italic> through an additional mechanism, which is TLR-independent.</p>
<p>Considering the UNC93B1 involvement on antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>, we first investigated whether antigen presenting cells (APCs), CD4<sup>+</sup> T, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were properly activated in 3d mice. Our results show that production of IL-12 as well as expression of activation markers by APCs was significantly impaired in 3d mice infected with <italic>T. gondii.</italic> Intriguingly, the IFNγ levels were similar in the sera, splenocyte cultures and peritoneal cavity, when comparing 3d and WT mice at day 8 post-infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. While the percentage of T cells producing IFNγ in splenocytes from infected 3d was comparable to infected C57BL/6 mice, the total numbers of IFNγ producing-CD4+ T as well as -CD8+ T cells were lower in de 3d mice. Regardless, mice deficient in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or in the so-called transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP-1) protein, while more susceptible to infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, often survive 30–40 days post-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Brown1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Goldszmid1">[32]</xref>. Thus, our data suggest that defective antigen cross-presentation and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation are not the primary events accounting for the extreme susceptibility of 3d mice to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Importantly, our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments suggest that UNC93B1 is an important mediator of IL-12 production during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. We also addressed this question <italic>in vitro</italic> and observed that exposure of macrophages from 3d or MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice to live ME49 tachyzoites resulted in impaired production of IL-12, as compared to macrophages from WT mice. Since IL-12 is a key mediator of IFNγ production during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gazzinelli2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gazzinelli3">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-ReiseSousa1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue2">[34]</xref>, it is surprising that IFNγ responses, as discussed above, were close to normal in the infected 3d mice. Therefore, we performed experiments at earlier time points and observed that production of IL-12 and IFNγ was significantly impaired in the peritoneal cavity and peritoneal cavity/spleens from 3d mice at 3 and 5 days post-infection, respectively. These findings could be explained as a result of combined deficiency of nucleotide sensing-TLRs, since no phenotype is observed in each of the single TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9 knockout mice.</p>
<p>Consistently, experiments performed in our laboratory and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Sukhumavasi1">[35]</xref> demonstrate that despite of severe impairment IL-12 production in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> mice, IFNγ is still produced at 8 days post-infection, and yet, mice are highly susceptible to ME-49 infection. Similarly, different studies demonstrate that except for IL-12, infection with the highly virulent RH strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> elicits elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gavrilescu1">[37]</xref>. However due to the inherent ability of RH parasites to rapidly replicate and disseminate, infected animals are still unable to control parasite burden and die during the acute phase of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue3">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Gavrilescu1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Even though the observed defect on IL-12/IFNγ axis seems to be sufficient to render animals more susceptible to <italic>T. gondii</italic>, our results clearly indicate that an additional TLR independent-function mediated by UNC93B1 contributes for the extreme susceptibility of 3d mice, when compared to MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> or MyD88/TRIF double knockouts infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Notably, from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments we had no evidence that cells from 3d mice have a defect in responding to IFNγ. Thus, we next investigated the ability of host cells from UNC93B1 mutant mice to control parasite replication. The fate of <italic>T. gondii</italic> inside the host cell relies upon the mechanism of entry. Passive internalization by phagocytosis directs parasites to the lysosomal compartment, leading to tachyzoite elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Joiner1">[25]</xref>. Upon active invasion, <italic>T. gondii</italic> establishes itself in the parasitophorous vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Jones1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Jones2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Mordue4">[40]</xref>, which avoids fusion with lysosomes, allowing parasite survival. Interestingly, we found that UNC93B1 is recruited from the ER to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), rather than to the expected endolysosomal compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Kim1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>In spite of being considered a non-fusogenic compartment, few host cell proteins are found at the membrane of parasitophorous vacuole containing tachyzoites. Specific proteins appear to be selectively recruited from the host cell plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Charron1">[41]</xref>, or after host cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Martens1">[42]</xref>. In addition, the ER is known to be in close contact with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Sinai1">[43]</xref>, and fusion between the ER and parasitophorous vacuole containing live parasites has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Goldszmid2">[44]</xref>. Notably, UNC93B1 was shown to translocate from ER to the endolysosomal compartment upon cell stimulation with TLR agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Kim1">[22]</xref>. Notwithstanding, here we show that UNC93B1 is recruited from the ER to the parasitophorous vacuoles. It is likely that the recruitment of UNC93B1 to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane occurs during the process of ER fusion, given that UNC93B1 is an ER resident protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Brinkmann1">[21]</xref>. The transfer of ER proteins to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane seems to be selective, since neither the mutant form of UNC93B1 nor TLR9 (not shown) were found to be enriched around the parasitophorous vacuole. Dissociation of the intracellular traffic of UNC93B1 and TLR9 has also been suggested by Ewald and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Ewald1">[45]</xref>, as they observed that forced expression of UNC93B1 at the plasma membrane was not accompanied by relocation of TLR9. Certainly, the process that involves selection or exclusion of specific host proteins, including UNC93B1 and nucleotide sensing TLRs, to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, is likely to be a key event in the successful establishment of parasitism, and remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Most of the mechanisms involved in the control of intracellular replication of <italic>T. gondii</italic> have been studied in IFNγ-activated macrophages. For example the downstream effects of GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Zhao1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Zhao2">[47]</xref>, production of reactive nitrogen intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-SchartonKersten2">[48]</xref>, tryptophan degradation in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Pfefferkorn1">[49]</xref> or autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Andrade1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Ling1">[51]</xref> are all IFNγ-inducible mechanisms involved in controlling and/or killing of <italic>T. gondii</italic> replication. Markedly, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic>, macrophages from 3d mice present a normal response and are perfectly able to control tachyzoite replication when activated with IFNγ. Consistently, the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates as well as and expression and translocation of IFNγ-inducible GTPases (<italic>i.e.</italic> Irga6, Irgb6, Irgm1 and Irgm3) or formation of autophagic vacuoles (data not shown) are not impaired in macrophages from 3d mice activated with IFNγ.</p>
<p>Remarkably, our results demonstrate an uncontrolled parasite replication in macrophages from 3d mice infected <italic>in vivo</italic> with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, despite an unimpaired IFNγ response. Further, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic> the 3d mutation renders non-activated macrophages more susceptible to intracellular tachyzoite replication. Even though the difference in parasite numbers is modest, when comparing macrophages from WT and 3d mice, it may reflect large differences <italic>in vivo</italic>, where multiple rounds of parasite replication during a long period of time will result in exponential parasite growth. To support our interpretation, other studies also show that small but significant differences in parasite replication <italic>in vitro,</italic> reflects dramatic differences in parasite growth and virulence <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-ElHajj1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Taylor1">[53]</xref>. It is difficult to imagine how this phenomenon could be related to the effects of the UNC93B1 mutation on TLR signaling, since the rates of parasite replication in non-activated macrophages from MyD88/TRIF null mice were similar to that observed in the same cells derived from wild-type mice. Thus, UNC93B1 effects on parasite control appear to be independent of what are thought important immune mediators of host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic>, such as TLRs, IFNγ and TNFα.</p>
<p>To establish itself inside a host cell <italic>T. gondii</italic> has to acquire metabolites from intracellular stores. Indeed, UNC93B1 is a distant ortholog to an ion transporter from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-delaCruz1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Greenwald1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Levin1">[56]</xref>. Despite this homology, a similar function has not been described for UNC93B1 in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Tabeta1">[19]</xref>. Alternatively, nutrient can be acquired from channels present at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, which allow free diffusion of small metabolites up to 1300 Da <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Schwab1">[57]</xref>; lipids may be acquired through the closely apposed mitochondrial and ER membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Sinai1">[43]</xref>; and parasite seems to exploit the host endolysosomal system via sequestration of host organelles into invaginations present at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001071-Coppens1">[58]</xref>. Therefore, it is also possible that UNC93B1 regulates metabolite/nutrient acquisition by <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, and hence interferes with parasite replication.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study reveals a critical anti-parasitic role for UNC93B1. This role appears to involved in at least two steps: (i) control of IL-12 and early IFNγ response, which may be a result of combined TLR3/TLR7/TLR9 deficiency; and (ii) UNC93B1 enrichment in the membranes surrounding the parasitophorous vacuole containing <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, which mediates control of parasite growth in a TLR- and IFNγ-independent manner. Altogether our results indicate that UNC93B1 plays a critical role on innate immune response and host resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</p>
