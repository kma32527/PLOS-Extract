<p>The genome of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, was published five years ago, yet identification of all genes and their transcripts remains to be accomplished. Annotation is challenged by the organization of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into long unidirectional gene clusters with no knowledge of how transcription is initiated. Here we report a single-nucleotide resolution genomic map of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> transcriptome, adding 1,114 new transcripts, including 103 non-coding RNAs, confirming and correcting many of the annotated features and revealing an extensive heterogeneity of 5′ and 3′ ends. Some of the new transcripts encode polypeptides that are either conserved in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>Leishmania major</italic> or were previously detected in mass spectrometry analyses. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was sensitive enough to detect transcripts at putative Pol II transcription initiation sites. Our results, as well as recent data from the literature, indicate that transcription initiation is not solely restricted to regions at the beginning of gene clusters, but may occur at internal sites. We also provide evidence that transcription at all putative initiation sites in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is bidirectional, a recently recognized fundamental property of eukaryotic promoters. Our results have implications for gene expression patterns in other important human pathogens with similar genome organization (<italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic> sp.) and revealed heterogeneity in pre-mRNA processing that could potentially contribute to the survival and success of the parasite population in the insect vector and the mammalian host.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Identifying genes essential for survival in the host is fundamental to unraveling the biology of human pathogens and understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis. The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> causes devastating diseases in humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa, and the publication in 2005 of the genome sequence provided the first glance at the coding potential of this organism. Although at present there is a catalogue of predicted protein coding genes, the challenge remains to identify all authentic genes, including their boundaries. We used next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to map transcribed regions and RNA polymerase II transcription initiation sites on a genome-wide scale. This approach allowed us to improve and correct the current annotation, to reveal a widespread heterogeneity of RNA processing sites (<italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation) and to estimate that most genes are expressed at levels corresponding to 1 to 10 mRNAs per cell. Our data indicate that different transcript forms representing the same gene are present stochastically within the mRNA population. This unanticipated scenario may contribute to determining gene expression landscapes to adapt to different environments in the parasite life cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the milestones towards an understanding and possible treatment of human African trypanosomiasis was the publication of the genome sequence of its causative agent, the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Berriman1">[1]</xref>. The availability of the potential coding capacity provided a first opportunity to comprehensively annotate the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome. This initial analysis of the 11 megabase-sized chromosomes predicted 9,068 protein-coding genes, including about 900 pseudogenes. As of April 2010, the catalogue of annotated protein-coding genes has increased to 10,533 (TriTrypDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Aslett1">[2]</xref>, yet a major challenge remains to identify all authentic genes, including their boundaries. Such information is central to determining the timing and regulation of gene expression in different developmental stages and the identification of functional elements.</p>
<p>The genomes of <italic>T. brucei</italic> and related trypanosomatids are organized into long unidirectional gene clusters that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into polycistronic primary transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Clayton1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Palenchar1">[6]</xref>. However, the sites and mechanism of transcription initiation and termination for protein-coding genes are largely unknown. Individual mRNAs are matured by coupled <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-LeBowitz1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA) donates the 39-nt SL sequence that is attached to the 5′ end of all mRNAs and provides the 5′ cap structure for the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Perry1">[9]</xref>. This intermolecular splicing mechanism is an ancient trait in eukaryotes and is found in many protozoa, nematodes, chordates and other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Hastings1">[10]</xref> and involves molecular mechanisms similar to <italic>cis</italic>-splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Liang1">[11]</xref>. The sequence signals that determine the <italic>trans</italic>-splice acceptor site appear to consist only of AG dinucleotide at the site for exon junction preceded by a polypyrimidine tract of varying length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Liang1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Benz1">[13]</xref>. Additional nucleotides downstream of the splice site appear to modulate the efficiency of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-LopezEstrano1">[14]</xref>, however, only a few cases have been studied. <italic>Trans</italic>-splicing is spatially and temporally coupled to polyadenylation of the upstream mRNA in the polycistron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-LeBowitz1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Ullu1">[15]</xref>. Poly(A) tail addition has been shown to occur at one of several closely spaced positions with a possible preference for A residues, based on a limited set of cDNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Benz1">[13]</xref>. Computational approaches have been used to predict <italic>trans</italic>-splice and polyadenylation sites in <italic>T. brucei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Benz1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Gopal1">[16]</xref> and when we started this study, there were no comprehensive studies of <italic>bona fide</italic> pre-mRNA processing sites in trypanosomatids. Thus, the emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies offered a unique opportunity to provide a complete catalogue of 5′ and 3′ end processing sites and to validate the annotated features of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome at the transcript level. In the current study, as well as in a recent publication by Siegel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel2">[17]</xref>, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to generate a <italic>T. brucei</italic> transcriptome map at single-nucleotide resolution.</p>

<title>Data sets obtained by RNA-Seq</title>
<p>To map transcribed regions in <italic>T. brucei</italic> on a genome-wide scale, we used the RNA-Seq approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Wang1">[18]</xref>. Starting with poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA isolated from insect-form (culture-form adapted) <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> YTat 1.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Ruben1">[19]</xref>, double-stranded cDNA was generated conventionally with either random hexadeoxynucleotide or oligo(dT) primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We sequenced four libraries, namely two biological samples, each random-primed and oligo(dT)-primed (RNA-Seq data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive - SRA at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi</ext-link> - under accession no. SRA012290). Pair-wise comparison of all sets resulted in Pearson correlation coefficients exceeding 0.99 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s001">Figure S1</xref>), thus giving us a total of 30,860,548 sequence reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001090-t001">Table 1</xref>). 25,245,618 reads (82%) aligned to the reference <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> TREU 927 genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Berriman1">[1]</xref> by allowing up to two mismatches in the first 28 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001090-t001">Table 1</xref>) with 16,651,856 reads (54%) mapping to a unique region in the genome. As expected based on similar approaches in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Nagalakshmi1">[20]</xref>, this strategy resulted in an enrichment of RNA-Seq tags towards the 3′ end of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To complement this bias, we took advantage of the unique structure of trypanosome mRNAs and devised a modified procedure for RNA-Seq. Briefly, total RNA was depleted of rRNAs by treatment with Terminator exonuclease, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamers and we then used the SL sequence present at the 5′ end of all trypanosome mRNAs to generate double-stranded cDNA with an SL-specific primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Three technical replicates were sequenced (Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.9) resulting in 33,338,202 total reads with 31,794,274 reads (95%) aligning to the genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001090-t001">Table 1</xref>) with a clear preference for the 5′ end of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Even though our RNA-Seq tags were obtained from a closely related <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> subspecies, overall 89% of the sequences aligned to the reference <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> TREU 927 genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001090-t001">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, none of the tags aligned to the gene coding for the Tn10 transposase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which is present in the genome sequence assembly, but is the result of an artifact of BAC construction and thus is not a part of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Berriman1">[1]</xref>.</p>

In addition, our annotation was aided by the availability of end tags, i.e. 2,434,466 SL- and 328,881 poly(A)-containing reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001090-t001">Table 1</xref>). This strategy allowed the precise mapping of both ends of 8,960 mRNA molecules with representative examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. 898 previously annotated genes had very few reads and thus we were unable to precisely define their transcript boundaries. Most genes in this group are subtelomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes and pseudogenes (620), expression site-associated genes and pseudogenes (104), as well as unlikely ORFs, sequence orphans and conserved proteins (174). Our 5′-end mapping identified 532 genes (5.9% of all genes) with misannotated translation start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s003">Figure S3</xref> and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s017">Table S1</xref>) and RT-PCR experimentally confirmed that the ORFs of two genes on chromosome VIII were indeed shorter than currently annotated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Furthermore, 805 annotated genes (not included in the total number of genes) did not produce a transcript of their own (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s018">Table S2</xref>), but were often part of the 5′UTR or 3′UTR of a transcript from a neighboring gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s004">Figure S4</xref>), which we corroborated by Northern blot analysis for two such scenarios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s004">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified 441 genes that have unambiguous alternative processing in the 5′UTR (47 genes) or 3′UTR (394 genes), thus generating a full-length transcript, as well as a shorter ORF-containing and a putative non-coding transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s005">S5</xref> and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s019">Table S3</xref>). For instance, Tb927.4.4370 and Tb927.4.4490 fall into this category and by Northern blot analysis three distinct transcripts, as predicted by RNA-Seq, are easily detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). The functional significance of the UTR-internal transcripts remains to be investigated, since they have limited coding potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s006">Figure S6E</xref>) and it was inconclusive whether one such transcript derived from the 3′UTR of Tb927.4.4370 was associated with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>
<p>The genome assembly of <italic>T. brucei</italic> lists four putative introns with two being experimentally validated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Ivens1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Mair1">[22]</xref>. Using the program TopHat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Trapnell1">[23]</xref>, which aims to identify splice junctions, and confirmed by manual inspection, we only detected the experimentally validated introns in the genes for poly(A) polymerase (Tb927.3.3160) and an ATP-dependent DEAD/H RNA helicase (Tb927.8.1510) and found no evidence for additional introns in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome (data not shown) in line with a similar conclusion by Siegel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data also shed light on the synthesis of annotated small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), whose genes are always oriented in the same direction as neighboring protein coding genes and are known to be transcribed by Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Dunbar1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Liang2">[25]</xref>. It appeared that snoRNAs are initially produced as long precursors with mRNA features, i.e. SL at the 5′ end and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end, and these precursors may contain one or more snoRNA sequences. We noticed 27, 9 and 5 instances where snoRNAs mapped in 3′UTRs, predicted ORFs and 5′UTRs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Particularly intriguing is the scenario where 7 snoRNAs are embedded in the ORF of Tb927.3.1900 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s007">Figure S7C</xref>), since these snoRNAs are expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Liang2">[25]</xref> and the predicted protein was detected in two separate proteomic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Bridges1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Broadhead1">[27]</xref>. This unusual organization will need to be investigated further.</p>
<p>The above mapping of gene boundaries provided a platform to delineate and measure 5′ and 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s020">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s021">S5</xref>). The median length of 5′UTRs in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is 130 nt with a range from 39, with the SL abutting the initiation codon, to ∼2,500 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas a similar analysis of 3′UTRs revealed a median length of 388 nt with a range of 10 to ∼6,000 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The median lengths are in agreement with those described in Siegel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel2">[17]</xref> of 128 nt and 400 nt for the 5′ and 3′UTRs, respectively. It is important to point out that in this study the 39-nt SL was included in the 5′UTR length calculation, whereas Siegel et al. opted to exclude the SL from their analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel2">[17]</xref>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, by taking advantage of the quantitative nature of RNA-Seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Wang1">[18]</xref>, we were able to estimate RNA levels in the insect-form <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> YTat 1.1 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s022">Table S6</xref>). We determined the signal in a 500-bp window immediately downstream of the first <italic>trans</italic>-splice site and, using the measured PGKB mRNA level as a reference point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Haanstra1">[28]</xref>, we estimated that 75% of the genes generate between 1 and 10 mRNA molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Our copy number estimates (median is 3 mRNAs per cell) for cultured procyclic <italic>T. brucei</italic> are comparable to data obtained for yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Velculescu1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Holstege1">[30]</xref> and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Carter1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<title>Novel coding and non-coding RNAs</title>
<p>We detected 1,114 new transcripts (12% of total) not originating from a previously annotated ORF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s023">Table S7</xref>). They are <italic>trans</italic>-spliced and polyadenylated and the range of size and expression level closely resembles that of transcripts mapped to annotated ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g001">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s009">S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s023">Table S7</xref>). Setting a lower limit of 25 amino acids, 1,011 transcripts have the potential to encode one or more ORF with a considerable number having a predicted signal peptide (4.2%). In particular, 27 newly identified transcripts contain ORFs that are conserved and annotated in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and/or <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s024">Table S8</xref>) and an additional 23 new transcripts encode potential polypeptides that are conserved, but not annotated in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and/or <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s025">Table S9</xref>). For instance, three novel transcripts on chromosome VIII, clearly detectable by Northern blot analysis, encode ribosomal protein L41 and two newly mapped transcripts on chromosome XI encode polypeptides that are conserved, but not annotated in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Tb10.NT.122 is a novel transcript on chromosome X with the longest predicted ORF encoding 32 amino acids. This transcript co-sedimented with polyribosomes on a sucrose density gradient and shifted to lighter fractions under conditions where translation was inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), indicating a likely association with the translational apparatus. Finally, by searching the proteome data set of Panigrahi et al. that did not map to annotated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Panigrahi1">[32]</xref>, we identified 19 novel transcripts where the predicted ORF had one or more matches with peptides identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s026">Table S10</xref>), thus providing evidence that at least some of these new proteins are made.</p>
<p>Of the 1,114 novel transcripts, 9.2% (103) did not contain ORFs 25 amino acids or longer and ranged in size from 154 nt to 2,229 nt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s027">Table S11</xref>). Although some of these transcripts might potentially code for a peptide, since the shortest verified coding sequence in eukaryotes is 33 nt, i.e. 11 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Kondo1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Galindo1">[34]</xref>, it is worth noting that the six largest transcripts, each longer than 1,000 nt, have no coding potential at all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s027">Table S11</xref>).</p>

<title>Heterogeneity of RNA processing sites</title>
<p>The depth of our coverage of 5′ end tags (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001090-t001">Table 1</xref>) allowed us to expose a genome-wide picture of <italic>trans</italic>-splice sites, which turned out to be quite promiscuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Out of the 8,592 transcripts with at least 10 SL tags at the primary site, only 926 (11%) had a single site for SL addition, whereas 5,327 transcripts (62%) had between two and four 3′ <italic>trans</italic>-splice sites and 2,339 transcripts (27%) had five or more sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figures 3A and B</xref>). Additional sites were mainly located downstream of the primary site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and occasionally mapped within the 5′ region of ORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s028">Table S12</xref>). To validate this unexpected result, we first inspected <italic>trans</italic>-splice site usage at the α-tubulin gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s010">Figure S10</xref>). The most prominent site mapped by RNA-Seq coincided with the site identified by previous analysis of cDNAs, but minor sites were also evident. Next, we selected four genes representing the spectrum of heterogeneity and cDNAs generated by RT-PCR reproduced the multiple or highly homogenous SL addition sites seen by RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>

<p>We were unable to identify any significant difference in the sequence signatures surrounding homogeneous and heterogeneous splice sites (data not shown) and there was only a very limited correlation between splice site heterogeneity and abundance of the corresponding transcript (data not shown). The only highly conserved sequence signals that appeared to define a 3′-<italic>trans</italic>-splice site in <italic>T. brucei</italic> are the well-known AG dinucleotide immediately upstream and the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) further upstream of the splice site, as well as the exclusion of G residues at position -3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), which has been suspected previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel1">[12]</xref>. An AG dinucleotide was found at 98% of the major splice sites, whereas minor sites had an AG in 75% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s020">Table S4</xref>). At present we do not know whether this observation is of functional significance. Since two major sites with an apparent AA or GG dinucleotide in the 927 genome reference strain turned out to have <italic>bona fide</italic> AG splice acceptor sites in our strain used for RNA-Seq (data not shown), we cannot exclude the possibility that many of these variant non-AG sites are due to strain differences. The PPT starts 0 to ∼200 nt (median is 43) upstream of the splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>), its median length is 18 nt with a range from 7 to 79 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and its composition showed a clear preference for Ts over Cs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), in agreement with a comprehensive mutagenesis study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel1">[12]</xref>. The median distance between the <italic>trans</italic>-splice site and the upstream polyadenylation site is 142 nt and in 50% of the cases is between 123 and 178 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), highlighting the tight spatial coupling of the two RNA processing events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-LeBowitz1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Polyadenylation sites (PAS) in <italic>T. brucei</italic> transcripts appeared even more heterogeneous than <italic>trans</italic>-splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s029">Table S13</xref>). A representative example is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s010">Figure S10</xref>, where the processing sites in between the β and α-tubulin genes are summarized. The most prominent RNA-Seq sites correlated with experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>, but this methodology also revealed an unanticipated extent of heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in 3′-end formation was not too surprising, since it is known that a poly(A) tail can be added at any one of several closely spaced positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Benz1">[13]</xref>. Polyadenylation occurs preferentially at an A residue (before or after; our data cannot distinguish) in the transcript that is often followed by a second A, and our results showed a preference for T-rich sequence in the vicinity of the site for poly(A) tail addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>RNA-Seq tags map putative Pol II transcription initiation sites</title>
<p>An intriguing observation was the presence of a limited number of polyadenylated transcripts that appeared to be significantly underrepresented or even absent in our SL library data sets.

Such transcripts can be detected as heterogeneous species by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and a large fraction of them appeared to be uncapped and have a single phosphate at their 5′ end, as judged by their susceptibility to degradation by Terminator exonuclease (a 5′ monophosphate-dependent enzyme) and alleviation of this susceptibility by a preceding phosphatase treatment (compare lanes 2, 8 and 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, at most suspected ends of Pol II transcription units, we detected transcripts of extremely low abundance, i.e. less than one molecule per cell, that possess a SL sequence, but lack poly(A) tails, as judged by their absence in our poly(A)-enriched libraries (data not shown). [The transcripts without SL sequence or a poly(A) tail were not included in the total number of genes or in the number of novel transcripts.] Transcripts present near putative Pol II start sites lacking the SL but containing a poly(A) tail, as well as those with an SL but missing the poly(A) tail at possible Pol II termination sites, are best explained by the known coupling of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-LeBowitz1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>.

<p>The SL-lacking RNAs described above could represent remnants of primary Pol II transcripts, i.e. RNA fragments from the very 5′ end of long polycistronic precursors that have either been processed by an unknown mechanism to expose a 5′-monophosphate or have been subjected to trimming of their triphosphate ends to a 5′-monophosphate. To explore this possibility, we generated and sequenced a cDNA library enriched for 5′-triphosphate RNA ends, the hallmark of a 5′ end generated by an RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s012">Figure S12</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current annotation of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome relied heavily on bioinformatic approaches, since to date a mere 5,133 ESTs are available. Thus, our initial goal in the work presented here was to map gene boundaries at the transcript level and to provide experimental support for annotated features. We used RNA-Seq to generate a <italic>T. brucei</italic> transcriptome map at single-nucleotide resolution and confirmed many of the gene models, but also uncovered numerous cases of misannotated translation initiation codons, annotated ORFs not producing a distinct transcript and an abundance of novel transcripts, including ones which appear to be non-coding. Remarkably, we were also able to map, on a genome-wide scale, putative Pol II transcription start sites in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s030">Table S14</xref>). Our results corroborate a recent study where it was shown that such chromosome locations are marked by specifically modified and variant histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Thomas1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel3">[36]</xref>. In addition, we detected both sense and antisense transcription originating from these genome loci, with sense transcripts at higher levels than antisense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This finding matches a scenario described for mammalian CpG promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Carninci1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Core1">[40]</xref>, where transcription is divergent and initiates over a broad genomic region. Moreover, our RNA-Seq data for 5′-triphosphate-enriched RNAs showed reads mapping throughout Pol II transcription units in the sense and antisense orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s013">Figure S13</xref>) and thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that these are actual transcription initiation sites similar to the ones described in exons/3′ UTRs in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Carninci1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the major benefits of RNA-Seq is its capability to accurately determine transcript boundaries. Our mapping of conventional 5′ and 3′ ends of <italic>T. brucei</italic> mRNAs revealed an abundant heterogeneity in <italic>trans</italic>-splice and polyadenylation sites. Whereas the heterogeneity of poly(A)-addition sites was somewhat anticipated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Matthews1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Benz1">[13]</xref> and to a lesser extent this scenario has been observed as local heterogeneity of polyadenylation positions in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Nagalakshmi1">[20]</xref> and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Pauws1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Pickrell1">[42]</xref>, the degree of variability we encountered for <italic>trans</italic>-splice sites was quite unexpected. Although <italic>trans</italic>- and <italic>cis</italic>-splicing are mechanistically related, our finding highlights a fundamental difference between these two processes. <italic>Cis</italic>-splicing occurs predominantly within ORFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Roy1">[43]</xref> and, thus, is subjected to evolutionary pressure to maintain an intact coding sequence. This apparent accuracy of intron excision is likely accompanied by rapid destruction of aberrantly spliced mRNAs by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Conti1">[44]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>trans</italic>-splicing mainly takes place upstream of ORFs and appears to follow more relaxed rules for the selection of a nucleotide for the second <italic>trans</italic>-esterification reaction of splicing. As a consequence, the observed heterogeneity in <italic>T. brucei</italic> of both <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation generates a collection of mRNAs with the same coding potential, but with UTRs (3′ or 5′) of varying length, sometimes in the order of hundreds of nucleotides. This fluidity in generating mRNA ends is quite unusual, particularly in an organism where the regulation of gene expression has been attributed to occur mainly at the post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Clayton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Palenchar1">[6]</xref>. Importantly, the degree of heterogeneity of both <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation varies and different genes exhibit RNA processing patterns spanning from one extreme - a single detectable processing site - to the other, where no single site is used preferentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, our data set is in good agreement with that of Siegel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel2">[17]</xref>. The overlap between the mapped <italic>trans</italic>-splice sites is excellent with most genes having a very high correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s014">Figure S14A</xref>). There is a weak overlap between the polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s014">Figure S14B</xref>). This is most likely a reflection of the inherent difficulty to identify PAS due to the pervasive heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and the prevalence of low-complexity sequences in the 3′UTR. Thus, our stringent filtering only yielded 2,081 PAS assignments with confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001090-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, the mRNA abundance comparison (for the 6,728 transcripts present in both studies) is good with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.697 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s015">Figure S15</xref>), considering the different <italic>T. brucei</italic> subspecies, as well as differences in culture conditions, mRNA isolation procedures, RNA-Seq cDNA library preparation protocols and methods of estimating the abundance.</p>
<p>Evidence and theorization over the past decade has resulted in a widespread appreciation of the benefits of stochastic models of gene expression over purely deterministic ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Kaern1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Larson1">[47]</xref>. We estimate that 75% of <italic>T. brucei</italic> genes are expressed at levels between 1 and 10 mRNAs per procyclic cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001090.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In addition, it is evident from our data and corroborated by Siegel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Siegel2">[17]</xref> that the majority of genes produce different transcript forms created by heterogeneity in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation and bearing or lacking 5′ and/or 3′ UTR sequences that could influence the efficiency of RNA stability and/or translation. The possibility for regulation of pre-mRNA processing site choice clearly exists, however it remains to be seen whether alternative splicing or polyadenylation are part of a regulated process. Since transcription is one of the main intrinsic noise sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Larson1">[47]</xref> and Pol II transcription in trypanosomatids appears to be uniform across individual polycistronic transcription units (and likely the entire Pol II transcriptome), heterogeneity in the sites for pre-mRNA processing provides an additional source of intrinsic stochasticity to compensate for the uniformity in transcription. Interestingly, it appears that heterogeneity of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing is a specific characteristic of trypanosomatids, since it was not described in the transcriptome analysis of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Hillier1">[48]</xref>, an organism with prevalent <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in which most <italic>trans</italic>-spliced genes are individually transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001090-Consortium1">[49]</xref>. Our results have implications for gene expression patterns in other important human pathogens and point to heterogeneity in pre-mRNA processing (rather than transcription) as the main intrinsic source of stochasticity in gene expression for these protozoan parasites.</p>

<title>Processing of 5′ end reads</title>
<p>Over 2.5 million reads from the SL-primed library contained the entire splice-leader sequence at their 5′ ends. This sequence was removed, leaving 43 nucleotides, and the first 28 nucleotides were aligned to the genome reference, with a maximum of 2 allowed mismatches and one alignment reported per read. Unless indicated, all read manipulations, as well as the genome-wide site analyses, were performed with custom scripts written either in Perl or for a combination of the R statistical software with the bioinformatics-centric Bioconductor tools installed.</p>

<title>Processing of 3′ end reads</title>
<p>Reads consisting primarily of A or T nucleotides (more than 31 out of 35 total nucleotides) were removed from the 3′ end-enriched libraries. Next, contiguous A or T stretches, 5–15 letters long, were trimmed off the 5′ or 3′ ends of the sequences, respectively. Trimmed reads, ranging in length from 15–30 nucleotides, represented putative 3′ end-reads and were aligned to the genome reference. In order to distinguish poly(A) tails from RNA transcribed from contiguous As in the genome, alignments were only considered to represent polyadenylation sites, if the end-read contained a longer stretch of A's than was present in the genome.</p>

<title>Analysis of 5′-triphosphate-end-enriched libraries</title>
<p>Preparation of the 5′-triphosphate-end-enriched library produced two sets of reads, categorized by the position of the 14-nt sequence representing the 5′ transcript end (the “end-sequence”). The first set, corresponding to the top strand contained the 24 nt adapter (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GCACCATATAACCGCTTCCTTGAG</named-content>) at the beginning of the read, followed by the end-sequence, spanning nucleotides 25 through 38. The second set contained reverse complement of the end-sequence in the left-most 14 nt, followed by the same reverse complement of the 24 nt adapter. These 14 nt end sequences were extracted from the two sets of reads, and the second set was reverse complemented, to produce the end-reads.

<title>Measurement of transcript abundance</title>
<p>A relative measure of transcript abundance was derived from the number of reads (not including end-reads) that aligned within a 500-nucleotide window, extending into the gene from the 5′ end of the transcript for the SL-library and from the 3′ end for the poly(A) library.</p>

<title>Transcript-end calculations</title>
<p>We eliminated from the analysis transcripts in which the maximal number of reads per splice site was less than 10. We developed a metric, <italic>dispersion</italic>, to capture and summarize the positional information about the splice sites of each gene. Essentially, dispersion is the weighted average of the distance between each site to the most popular site:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Assume a gene has N splice sites. Define <italic>c<sub>i</sub></italic> as the number of reads of site <italic>i</italic> and <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> as the position of the site. Denote <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001090.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and let i<sup>*</sup> represent the splice site with the maximal number of reads.

</disp-quote>
<p>Similarly, the average 5′ UTR length is the weighted average of the distance of all splice sites from the start codon. Symbolically:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>if the position of the start codon is r<sub>s</sub>, the average 5′UTR is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001090.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For UTR analyses, except where noted, splice sites downstream of the annotated start codon are not included in the sum (and C is the sum only over splice sites upstream of the start codon). Misannotated or unannotated transcripts were not considered for this analysis. We used a similar approach for analysis of polyadenylation sites, 3′UTRs.</p>

<p>A novel transcript with limited coding potential is possibly associated with polyribosomes. (A) Cell extracts prepared in the presence of pactamycin (an antibiotic that promotes apparent polyribosome dissociation through inhibition of the formation of complete translation initiation complexes) or cycloheximide (an antibiotic that arrests polyribosomes by interfering with ribosome translocation) were subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. RNA was purified from individual gradient fractions, separated on a denaturing agarose gel, transferred and cross-linked to a nylon membrane, and large rRNAs were visualized by staining with methylene blue. Shown is every other fraction from the gradient.

Define (in each study) the probability to observe the i'th site, p<sub>i</sub>, as the number of reads for that site divided by the total number of reads for the gene.
