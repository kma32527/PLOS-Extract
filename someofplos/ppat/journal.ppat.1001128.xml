<p>The cycle inhibiting factors (Cif), produced by pathogenic bacteria isolated from vertebrates and invertebrates, belong to a family of molecules called cyclomodulins that interfere with the eukaryotic cell cycle. Cif blocks the cell cycle at both the G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M transitions by inducing the stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21<sup>waf1</sup> and p27<sup>kip1</sup>. Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 as a target of Cif. Cif co-compartmentalized with NEDD8 in the host cell nucleus and induced accumulation of NEDD8-conjugated cullins. This accumulation occurred early after cell infection and correlated with that of p21 and p27. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that Cif interacted with cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes (CRLs) through binding with the neddylated forms of cullins 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B subunits of CRL. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitylation assay, we demonstrate that Cif directly inhibits the neddylated CUL1-associated ubiquitin ligase activity. Consistent with this inhibition and the interaction of Cif with several neddylated cullins, we further observed that Cif modulates the cellular half-lives of various CRL targets, which might contribute to the pathogenic potential of diverse bacteria.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Among the arsenal of virulence factors used by bacterial pathogens to infect and manipulate their hosts, cyclomodulins are a growing family of bacterial toxins that interfere with the eukaryotic cell-cycle. Cif is one of these cyclomodulins produced by both mammalian and invertebrate pathogenic bacteria. Cif blocks the host cell cycle by inducing the accumulation of two regulators of cell cycle progression: the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. To decipher the mode of action of Cif, we performed yeast two-hybrid screenings. We show that Cif binds to NEDD8 and induce accumulation of neddylated cullins early after infection. Cullins are scaffold components of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which ubiquitinate proteins and target them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. We demonstrate that Cif directly inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of these CRLs and consequently the targeting of p21 and p27 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Targeting at NEDD8 represents a novel strategy for modulation of host cell functions by bacterial pathogens. By inhibiting the most prominent class of ubiquitin-ligases, Cif controls the stability of a cohort of key regulators and impinge on not only cell cycle progression but also on many cellular and biological processes such as immunity, development, transcription, and cell signaling.</p>

Crystal structures of Cif from <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>P. luminescens</italic> revealed that Cif proteins possess a conserved putative catalytic triad composed of a cysteine, a histidine and a glutamine, and belong to the cysteine protease superfamily, a diverse group of enzymes with protease, acetyltransferase, deamidase, transglutaminase, and other biochemical activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Yao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Crow1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Hsu1">[10]</xref>. Although the specific enzymatic activity of Cif has not been identified, the active site is essential for Cif cytostatic activity since mutation of the triad residues leads to the loss of phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Yao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Jubelin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Hsu1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Upon injection into host cells, Cif triggers a cytopathic effect characterized by cell cycle arrests both in G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phase transitions and, in certain cell lines, the reorganization of the actin network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Marches1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Nougayrede2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-DeRycke1">[12]</xref>. The cell cycle arrest induced by Cif is irreversible and leads eventually to delayed cell death by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-SambaLouaka2">[13]</xref>. The inhibition of the cell cycle is independent of the DNA damage response and p53 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Taieb1">[14]</xref>, but correlates with the accumulation of the <underline>c</underline>yclin-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>k</underline>inase (CDK) inhibitors p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup> and p27<sup>kip1</sup> (hereafter referred as p21 and p27 respectively) that inactivate CDKs whose activities are required for entry in both S- and M-phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-SambaLouaka3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Cayrol1">[16]</xref>. This accumulation of p21 and p27 results from protein stabilization, suggesting that Cif interferes with their 26S proteasome-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-SambaLouaka3">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, degradation of intracellular proteins is processed mainly by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Ciechanover1">[17]</xref>. This highly regulated mechanism leads to conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to protein substrates, targeting them to the 26S proteasome for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Pickart1">[18]</xref>. Substrate specificity is determined by E3 ligase enzymes that recognize targets to be ubiquitinated. The most prominent class of E3s is the superfamily of <underline>c</underline>ullin-<underline>R</underline>ING <underline>l</underline>igases (CRLs) that are multi-subunit complexes based on cullin protein scaffolds. Among the different mechanisms regulating the activity of CRLs, conjugation of the cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (neddylation) stimulates the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, thereby enhancing their subsequent proteolysis by the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Duda1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Saha1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Rabut1">[21]</xref>. Degradation of many proteins involved in the control of cell cycle progression, including p21 and p27, is regulated by CRL activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Nakayama1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>To decipher the mode of action of the cyclomodulin Cif, we performed yeast two-hybrid screenings and identified NEDD8 as a specific Cif interaction partner. Cif co-compartmentalized with NEDD8 in the host cell nucleus and induced an accumulation of NEDD8-conjugated cullins that correlated with the accumulation of p21 and p27. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that Cif interacted with the neddylated forms of cullin-RING complexes. Morevover, <italic>in vitro</italic>, Cif inhibited NEDD8-modified Cullin1/Fbw7-associated ubiquitin ligase activity. Thus, Cif manipulates the host ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation by interfering with NEDD8-conjugated CRLs.</p>

<title>Cif interacts with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8</title>
<p>To identify eukaryotic targets of Cif, yeast two-hybrid screenings were performed using the wild-type form of <italic>E. coli</italic> Cif protein, an inactive cysteine mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Hsu1">[10]</xref> and two distinct cDNA libraries from human placenta and human colon. The <underline>n</underline>eural precursor cell <underline>e</underline>xpressed, <underline>d</underline>evelopmentally <underline>d</underline>own-regulated <underline>8</underline> protein (NEDD8) was the sole common putative eukaryotic interacting partner detected in each screening. In the two-hybrid, the highest confidence score, which reflects the reliability and biological significance of each interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Yu1">[23]</xref>, was obtained for NEDD8 interacting with the cysteine mutant, suggesting that inactivation of the Cif catalytic site could stabilize the interaction with NEDD8.</p>
<p>As a first step to validate the interaction between Cif and NEDD8, hexa-histidine tagged Cif (wild type or cysteine mutant) and NEDD8 were co-expressed in a laboratory <italic>E. coli</italic> strain and His-Cif was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. As a control, NEDD8 was also expressed in absence of His-Cif. Detection of NEDD8 in the eluted fractions from both wild type Cif and cysteine mutant purifications confirmed that Cif interacted with NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Mirroring the yeast two-hybrid experiments, the cysteine mutant was more efficient to pull-down NEDD8 in the bacterial co-expression assay. In addition, Cif and NEDD8 co-eluted in the same fractions by gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since NEDD8 is 60% identical and 80% homologous to ubiquitin, we also tested whether Cif could bind ubiquitin. In contrast to NEDD8, ubiquitin did not co-elute with His-Cif in the bacterial co-expression assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), demonstrating the specificity of Cif binding to NEDD8.</p>

<title>Cif interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hexa-histidine tagged wild-type Cif (WT), Cif cysteine 109 mutant Cys-to-Ser (C/S), Cif deleted for amino-acids 70-85 mutant (Δ70-85) or Cif Δ70-85 Cys-to-Ser mutant(Δ70-65 C/S) and NEDD8 or ubiquitin (Ub) proteins were co-expressed in bacteria, and then His-Cif proteins were purified from bacterial lysates using nickel affinity. Whole extracts and eluted fractions were probed with indicated antibodies. (<bold>B</bold>) Wild-type His-Cif and NEDD8 were co-expressed in bacteria and His-Cif was purified using nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography. The peak in the chromatograph corresponds to the His-Cif complex. NEDD8 and the corresponding fractions were visualized using SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue. (<bold>C</bold>) Glutathione sepharose matrix was mixed with 100 µg of GST or GST-Cif Cys-to-Ser mutant purified proteins and then incubated with a lysate of HEK293T cells expressing a FLAG-NEDD8 construct. 100 µg or 250 µg of cells extract were used to obtain a GST constructs/cell extract ratio of 1∶1 and 1∶2.5 respectively. Cells extract (input) and eluted fractions were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies. FLAG-NEDD8 fusion protein is indicated with an arrow.</p>

<p>As a second approach to confirm the interaction of Cif with NEDD8, lysates from HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged NEDD8 were used to perform glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments. The glutathione-sepharose matrix was first loaded with purified GST-Cif (cysteine mutant) fusion protein or GST alone as control, and then incubated with cell extracts. In contrast to the GST control, GST-Cif captured FLAG-NEDD8 and apparently FLAG-NEDD8-modified proteins present in the HEK293T extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that Cif interacts specifically with the NEDD8 protein.</p>
<p>While members of the Cif family exhibit a low level of sequence similarity, crystal structure determination of Cif from <italic>E. coli</italic> and the xenologs from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>P. luminescens</italic> revealed that all proteins are structurally well-conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Yao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Crow1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Hsu1">[10]</xref>. These studies have shown a head-and-tail domain arrangement. The tail corresponds to the N-terminal part of the protein. The C-terminal head-domain, which contains the catalytic triad, adopts an overall fold similar to cysteine proteases. Interestingly, deletion of the protruding α4 helix in the N-terminal part of Cif from <italic>B. pseudomalei</italic>, which is unlikely to affect the structural integrity of protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Yao1">[5]</xref>, abolishes the cell cycle arrest, suggesting that this domain could mediate substrate recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Yao1">[5]</xref>. Therefore, we constructed an <italic>E. coli</italic> Cif mutant deleted for residues 70 to 85 corresponding to the α4 helix (CifΔ70-85). The CifΔ70-85 mutant, like the Cif cysteine mutant, was translocated into host cells upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, removal of the α4 helix of Cif, even in combination with the cysteine mutation that increases <italic>in vitro</italic> NEDD8 binding efficiency, prevented association with NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the CifΔ70-85 mutant did not induce actin stress fibers, nucleus enlargement, cell cycle arrest, or p21 and p27 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g002">Fig 2B–C</xref>). Together these results suggest that interaction with NEDD8 via residues 70–85 is required for Cif-induced cell cycle arrest.</p>

<title>Cytopathic activities of wild-type Cif, Cif C/A and CifΔ70-85 mutants.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Translocation efficiency of Cif wild-type and mutant proteins were assessed as follow: HeLa cells were loaded with CCF2/AM substrate and were infected 1 h 30 with E22Δ<italic>cif</italic> hosting plasmids expressing the different Cif-TEM1 fusions and intracellular β-lactamase activity was detected by measuring cleavage of the CCF2/AM substrate.

Experiments were performed in triplicate and error bars represent standard errors of the mean. The multiplicity of infection (moi) and corresponding cell cycle arrest phenotype are indicated. Note that infection at moi of 25 with low level of translocation of wild-type Cif was sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest. (<bold>B</bold>) G<sub>1</sub>/S synchronized HeLa cells were infected 1.5 h with E22Δ<italic>cif</italic> expressing the different Cif proteins, washed and incubated with antibiotic for 20-72 h.

<title>Cif co-compartmentalizes with NEDD8 in the host cell nucleus</title>
<p>Determination of Cif trafficking upon bacterial injection into host cells may provide clues to specify cellular functions hijacked by Cif. We therefore examined the subcellular localization of Cif into infected host cells by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Optical sections revealed that Cif accumulated mostly in the host cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). A similar distribution of the inactive Cif cysteine mutant was observed. As a second step, we investigated whether Cif and NEDD8 co-localized in cells. Experiments were performed with stable HeLa Tet-on cells producing GFP-Cif (wild-type or cysteine mutant) fusion proteins. The distribution of the GFP signal showed that, as during infection experiments, wild-type Cif and the inactive cysteine mutant were mostly detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Kamitani1">[24]</xref>, immunodetection of NEDD8 showed its predominant localization also in the nucleus. Consistent with the nuclear localization of both proteins, dual GFP-Cif and NEDD8 labeling resulted in a partial coincident nuclear staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<title>Cif induces accumulation of neddylated proteins in host cells</title>
<p>To investigate the biological significance of the Cif/NEDD8 interaction, we monitored the level of neddylated proteins in cells infected with wild type EPEC or strains deleted for the Cif gene (Δ<italic>cif</italic>). Immunoblotting with anti-NEDD8 antibodies revealed that the level of neddylated protein(s) with an apparent size of ∼80 kDa increased in cells infected with wild-type EPEC, but not with the Δ<italic>cif</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Accumulation of these neddylated proteins was detectable as soon as the end of infection (0 h) and was still observable 24 h post-infection. The increased level of neddylated proteins correlated with accumulation of p21 and p27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The rapid accumulation of NEDD8-conjugated proteins was also observed in non-transformed rat small intestine epithelial IEC-6 cells and in human colon HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This accumulation correlated with their cell cycle arrest upon infection with EPEC expressing Cif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-SambaLouaka3">[15]</xref>. Consistent with Cif and NEDD8 cellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), cell fractionation revealed that the 80 kDa neddylated proteins were mostly detected in the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Cif alone was sufficient to modulate the level of neddylated proteins since eukaryotic expression of the wild-type GFP-Cif in the Tet-on cells also led to accumulation of the 80 kDa NEDD8-conjugated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The Cif from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, the most divergent xenolog of Cif, also induced accumulation of the 80 kDa neddylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, the level of NEDD8-conjugated proteins did not increase in cells infected with bacteria expressing Cif mutated on the catalytic cysteine, or the Cif mutant deleted for the α4helix (CifΔ70-85). Thus, a functional Cif was required for neddylated protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that Cif alters the neddylation pattern in host cells and provokes an early accumulation of NEDD8-conjugated protein(s) in the nucleus of infected cells.</p>

<title>Neddylated cullins 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B accumulate in the presence of Cif</title>

The slower migrating species corresponded to the signal detected with the anti-NEDD8 antibody, and treatment of cell extracts with the NEDD8 protease 1 (NEDP1) induced disappearance of both the higher molecular form of cullins and the corresponding NEDD8 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that these slower migrating proteins were neddylated cullins.

<title>Cif interacts with neddylated cullin-RING complexes</title>
<p>We next examined whether Cif interacted with the neddylated forms of cullins. After infection of HeLa cells with EPEC expressing His-tagged Cif protein from <italic>E. coli</italic> (wild-type, Δ70-85 or C/A mutants), His-Cif proteins were immunoprecipited with anti-His antibodies coupled to magnetic beads and the different fractions were analyzed by western-blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). High molecular weight proteins detected with the anti-NEDD8 antibody co-eluted with the wild-type Cif protein. These data raised the possibility that Cif interacts with NEDD8-conjugated proteins. We next verified whether these neddylated proteins targeted by Cif were members of the cullin family. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows that many cullins (CUL1 to 4B) were found in the eluted fraction from the wild-type Cif precipitate. Interestingly, only the slowly-migrating neddylated forms of the cullins were recovered in the wild-type Cif eluates. These data suggest that Cif interacts with cullins through their NEDD8 modification. In contrast to our previous result showing that the Cif cysteine mutant interacted with NEDD8 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g001">Fig. 1A–B</xref>), the Cif mutant did not co-elute with neddylated cullins in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, after loading more concentrated amounts of the histidine-eluted fractions, western blot assays showed a weak (compared to wild-type His-Cif) but specific (compared to empty vector) signal using anti-cullin 2 and 4B antibodies in the His-Cif cysteine mutant immunoprecipitated fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Most likely, this weak signal reflects the low level of neddylated cullins observed in absence of active Cif, although it is also possible that the cysteine mutation partially impairs Cif ability to interact with neddylated cullins. These findings demonstrate that Cif induces the accumulation of neddylated cullins and also interacts with the NEDD8-conjugated form of these cullins.</p>

<title>Cif inhibits in vitro ubiquitylation activity of a NEDD8-modified CRL</title>
<p>Given that Cif associates with NEDD8-modified cullin-RING complexes, we wished to test the effects of Cif in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay monitoring ubiquitylation activity of a neddylated CRL.

When Cif is preinubated with a neddylated SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> (NEDD8∼CUL1-Rbx1-Skp1-Fbw7<sup>ΔD</sup>), ubiquitylation of the cyclin E phosphopeptide was inhibited in a manner that depended on the putative Cif active site cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). This inhibition also required preincubation of Cif with the neddylated CRL complex, prior to initiating the ubiquitylation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), indicating that Cif probably acts through a progressive process rather than an immediate effect.

Thus, it seems likely that inhibition relies on Cif enzymatic activity toward the neddylated CRL, and not toward other components of the ubiquitylation reaction.

<title>Cif blocks the degradation of various CRL substrates in cells</title>
<p>Given Cif association with cullin-RING complexes, and inhibition of <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitylation activity for a CUL1-based CRL, we wondered whether Cif might exert such inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> to block the degradation of various CRL substrates. To address this, the total levels of several known CRL substrates were monitored during a time course following HeLa cell infection with EPEC expressing the wild-type Cif or the Cif cysteine mutant. Western blot analyses showed that, p21, p27 (CUL1-Skp2 substrates), phospho-IκB (a CUL1-βTrCP substrate) and RhoA (a CUL3-BACURD substrate) accumulated in the presence of Cif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). The total levels of other potential targets (Cdt1 and β-catenin) were only slightly modified in presence of Cif (data not shown). To evaluate the effect of Cif on these CRL substrates in a more sensitive assay, the half-lives of Cdt1 (a CUL4-DDB1-CDT2 substrate) and β-catenin (a CUL1-βTrCP substrate) were analyzed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Both Cdt1 and β-catenin appeared to be stabilized by wild-type Cif, but not the cysteine mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001128-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). We also examined the half-lives of substrate adaptors of CUL1, Skp1 and Skp2.

Here, we have shown that Cif binds to NEDD8 and neddylated cullins, inducing their accumulation early after infection. Cullins are scaffold proteins nucleating Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin-Ligases (CRLs), and neddylation activates cullins to modulate numerous cell functions, including cell cycle progression by targeting p21 and p27 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Nakayama1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Petroski1">[32]</xref>. In this study, we show that Cif can directly inhibit the ubiquitin ligase activity of a neddylated CUL1-associated complex, which correlates with the Cif-mediated accumulation of p21 and p27. Consistent with Cif's association with different neddylated cullins, we observed a stabilization of substrates from a range of CRLs. The mode of action of Cif represents a novel strategy for modulation of a broad range of host cell functions by bacterial pathogens.</p>

<title>Cif inhibits the ubiquitin ligase function of CRLs</title>
<p>NEDD8 conjugation of cullins is a major form of CRL regulation. Neddylation activates CRL-mediated substrate ubiquitylation by inducing a drastic conformational change of the C-terminal part of the cullin that frees the RBX1 RING, and thereby imparts catalytic geometries to an associated E2 enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Duda1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Bosu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Merlet1">[33]</xref>. Here, we report that Cif associates with the neddylated form of CUL1 to 4B, and that pre-incubation of Cif with a neddylated SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> complex inhibits its ligase activity. This latter result suggests that Cif acts on one or several components present in this reconstituted ubiquitylation assay. Whether Cif uses an enzymatic activity to usurp the CRL functions, and/or poisons the complex by binding to neddylated cullins is still elusive. However, the fact that preincubation of wild-type Cif with the neddylated SCF-Fbw7 is necessary to inhibit the ubiquitin ligase activity, and that Cif mutated on the cysteine residue of the catalytic triad is not inhibitory, support a predominant role for the putative enzymatic activity of Cif, which is (based on structure data) a member of the superfamily of cysteine protease, acetyl transferases, deamidases or transglutaminases. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed an absence of association of Cif-bound CUL1 with Skp1-Skp2 adaptators. This Cif-induced loss of substrate recognition subunits would further lead to CRL inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, how Cif could induce dissociation/prevent association of Skp1-Skp2 from cullins, or how this effect is related to CRL inhibition by Cif remains to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Cif induces cellular accumulation of neddylated cullins</title>
<p>CRLs transit through different stages of assembly, sequestration, neddylation, and deneddylation. To be fully active, CRLs undergo an activation cycle in which cullins oscillate between neddylated and non-neddylated (potentially sequestered by CAND1) states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Bosu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Merlet1">[33]</xref>. Based on our results, we propose a model in which Cif interferes with this cycle and thus locks CRLs in a neddylated but inactive state. Cif appears to block many steps in the CRL activation cycle. First, we observe that CAND1, Skp1 and Skp2 are not associated with Cif-associated CRLs. Cullin neddylation may correlate with lack of CAND1 binding. Second, the levels of CRL substrates, and substrate-binding adaptors, may also influence cullin neddylation. A regulatory negative feed-back loop via cullin de-neddylation was reported to modulate CRL activity once substrate level decreases under a critical threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Chew1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, Bornstein and collaborators reported that supplementation of Skp1-Skp2 and substrate to extracts of HeLa cells synergistically increased the level of neddylated CUL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Bornstein1">[35]</xref>. We found Cif-inhibition of CRLs also to correlate with the accumulation of numerous substrates and increased half-life of Skp2, which might secondarily result in accumulation of neddylated cullins, even though Cif-associated neddylated cullins are depleted of Skp1-Skp2 and presumably also inactivated. Finally, it is also possible that Cif interferes with cullin deneddylation. Since Cif treatment also inactivates neddylated cullins, their accumulation may essentially shut down both CRL assembly cycles as well as CRL ubiquitylation activities.</p>

<title>Cif stabilizes numerous targets of CRLs</title>
<p>CRLs represent the largest subfamily of E3s and therefore play regulatory roles in numerous and diverse cellular functions.

Indeed, Cif induces not only cell cycle arrest but also stress fibers formation in certain cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Marches1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Jubelin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Nougayrede2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-DeRycke1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Taieb1">[14]</xref>.

We showed that Cif increases the half-life of Cdt1, thus providing a mechanistic link for the DNA re-replication that occurs in a fraction of HeLa cells 2 or 3 days post-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Marches1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Taieb1">[14]</xref>. Cif also increases the stability of β-catenin whose level is important in the Wnt signaling pathway that is involved in homeostatic self-renewal in a number of adult tissues including intestinal epithelium, and in colon carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Clevers1">[41]</xref>. Finally, we have also shown in this study that Cif inhibits the degradation of phospho-IκB, an inhibitor of the NF-κB pro-inflammatory response. Further experiments will be necessary to investigate thoroughly the role of Cif in these pathways and to evaluate whether this effector could participate to escape the host immune response and plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Cif, a unique tool to study CRL regulation</title>
<p>Many bacterial toxins or microbial products mimic or modulate the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Hicks1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Spallek1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Angot1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Rytkonen1">[45]</xref>. For instance, deneddylation of CRL and consequently down-regulation of the NF-κB pathway have been proposed to explain the ability of intestinal bacterial communities to regulate the inflammatory tolerance of the mammalian intestinal epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-CollierHyams1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Kumar1">[47]</xref>. Similarly, a deneddylase encoded by Epstein-Barr virus promotes viral DNA replication by regulating the activity of cullin-RING ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Gastaldello1">[48]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, inhibition of CRLs through a pathogen's protein binding to NEDD8 has never been reported in the pathogenesis of bacterial or viral infections. The requirement that CRLs be activated by NEDD8 conjugation on the cullin proteins offers an “achilles heel” for modulating this entire subfamily. Owing to this remarkable property, Cif appears as a unique tool to dissect the regulation of CRL-dependent ubiquitylation and neddylation processes and more generally, to investigate many host-signaling pathways including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, immune and inflammatory responses, antigen processing or cytoskeleton dynamics.</p>

Candidate prey fragments were sequenced and compared to the GenBank database using BLASTN. A predicted biological score was used to assess the reliability of each interaction. This score takes into account (i) the redundancy and independency of prey fragments as well as the distributions of reading frames and stop codons in overlapping fragments, (ii) the interactions found in all the screens performed at Hybrigenics using the same library.

The neddylated SCF<sup>Fbw7ΔD</sup> ubiquitylation substrate peptide was synthesized and purified by reversed-phase HPLC by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude (Memphis, TN, USA), and corresponds to the high-affinity phosphodegron sequence from Cyclin E, with the sequence KAMLSEQNRASPLPSGLLT*PPQS*GRRASY (* = phosphorylation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Kleiger1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001128-Pierce1">[31]</xref>. The peptide N-terminal sequence is acetylated, and the C-terminus is linked to a biotin moiety. Polyubiquitylation without Cif preincubation was assayed at room temperature with 200 nM NEDD8 modified SCF<sup>Fbw7ΔD</sup>, 0.5 µM Cdc34B, 50 µM ubiquitin, 1 nM–1 µM Cif as indicated (wild-type or catalytically-inactive Cys-to-Ala mutant), 2 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> BSA and 5 µM biotin-conjugated cyclin E phosphopeptide in 30 mM Tris-HCL, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM ATP, pH 7.6, and started with 250 nM UBA1. Reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by western blot with anti-biotin antibodies (Rockland, 100-4198). For the preincubation time-courses, 1 µM Cif was mixed with 200 nM NEDD8 modified SCF<sup>Fbw7ΔD</sup> for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of other reaction components, and reactions were stopped at the indicated times. For the titration experiments, a range of concentrations of Cif were incubated with 200 nM NEDD8 modified SCF<sup>Fbw7ΔD</sup> for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of other reaction components, and reactions were stopped after 10 min.</p>
