<p>Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported through the secretory pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.</p>

<p>Enveloped viruses infect cells by fusing their membrane with that of the host cell. Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen whose membrane fusion is triggered by low pH during virus entry into the cell. However, newly synthesized DENV must also transit through a low pH environment during virus exit. DENV is believed to escape premature fusion in the exit pathway via the small viral protein pr, which is processed and associates with virus after biosynthesis, and is released from the virus particle in the neutral pH extracellular environment. Here we have reconstituted the interaction of pr with the DENV fusion protein E using soluble protein components. The interaction has a low pH optimum and inhibits membrane insertion of the fusion protein. The recombinant pr peptide can “add back” to fully infectious mature DENV and block virus fusion and infection. We found that mutation of a critical conserved histidine on the fusion protein inhibits the interaction of E and pr, and makes the virus susceptible to low pH-induced inactivation during exit. This work characterizes the mechanism of pr protection, and suggests that the conserved multifunctional pr-E interaction may be an important target for anti-viral strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The emergence and resurgence of human viral pathogens can be traced to a complex variety of causes including increased urbanization, human contact with animal reservoirs, a decrease in effective public health systems, and the spread of insect vectors that disseminate some viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Morens1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Mackenzie1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Weaver1">[3]</xref>. Flaviviruses are a genus in the Flaviviridae family and include important emerging and resurgent human pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and yellow fever virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Mackenzie1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lindenbach1">[4]</xref>. Flaviviruses are transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, and can cause severe human diseases characterized by encephalitis, meningitis, and hemorrhages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Mackenzie1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Weaver1">[3]</xref>. More than one third of the world's population lives in dengue fever endemic areas, and there are an estimated 50–100 million cases of dengue infection and 500,000 cases of the more lethal complication, dengue hemorrhagic fever, per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Gubler1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Halstead1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Kyle1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-WHO1">[8]</xref>. There are currently no antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. DENV vaccine development is underway but is problematic due to the presence of four DENV serotypes and the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Mackenzie1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Halstead1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Whitehead1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Morens2">[10]</xref>. Antiviral therapies could thus be an important alternative for DENV and for viruses such as WNV in which the cost and potential side effects of vaccination must be weighed against the relatively low number of human cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Mackenzie1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Flaviviruses are small, highly organized enveloped viruses with a spherical shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lindenbach1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Mukhopadhyay1">[11]</xref>. They contain a positive-sense RNA genome packaged by the viral capsid protein. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the viral membrane protein E. Flaviviruses infect cells by receptor engagement at the plasma membrane, endocytic uptake, and a membrane fusion reaction triggered by the low pH of the endosome compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-vanderSchaar1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-vanderSchaar2">[13]</xref>. The viral E protein binds the receptor and drives the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes to initiate virus infection. The pre-fusion structure of the E protein ectodomain (here referred to as E′) shows that E contains three domains composed primarily of β-sheets: a central domain I (DI) connecting on one side to the elongated domain II (DII) with the hydrophobic fusion loop at its tip, and connecting via a flexible linker on the other side to the immunoglobulin-like domain III (DIII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Rey1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Modis1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Modis2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Nybakken1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Kanai1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Zhang1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g001">Figs. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001157.s001">S1</xref>). Although these regions are not present in the truncated E′ ectodomain, DIII connects to a stem domain and C-terminal membrane anchor (TM). The E protein in mature infectious flavivirus is organized in homodimers that lie tangential to the virus membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Kuhn1">[20]</xref>. Within each dimer the E proteins interact in a head to tail fashion, with the fusion loop of each E protein hidden in a hydrophobic pocket formed by DI and DIII of the dimeric E partner.</p>

<p>A) Linear diagrams of the DENV2 prM-E proteins and the truncated DENV2 pr and E proteins used in this work (not to scale). Domain and construct boundaries are marked, with numbering based on the individual proteins in the DENV2 New Guinea C (NGC) strain. The sequences appended to the diagrams contain the <italic>Strep</italic> (ST) affinity tag(s) used for protein purification (underlined), joined in the case of two <italic>Strep</italic> tags by a flexible linker region (STST). Pr was expressed in 293T cells and contains prM residues 1–86 plus N-terminal GS residues from the vector and the STST tag. The DI/II and E′ proteins were expressed in S2 cells and contain E residues 1–291 and 1–395, respectively, plus ST or STST tags. DIII was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and contains E residues 289–430, comprising the linker, DIII, helix 1 and conserved sequence (LDIIIH1CS). The names in parentheses are the detailed nomenclature from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>.

<p>The E protein mediates virus-membrane fusion by refolding to a hairpin-like E homotrimer with the fusion loops and TM domains at the same end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Modis3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Bressanelli1">[22]</xref>. This reaction involves low pH-triggered dissociation of the homodimer, fusion loop insertion into the endosome membrane, formation of a core trimer composed of DI and DII, and the foldback of the DIII and stem regions towards the target membrane and their packing against the core trimer. The prefusion and postfusion conformations of the flavivirus E fusion protein are structurally and functionally similar to those of the E1 fusion protein from the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lescar1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Roussel1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Gibbons1">[25]</xref>, and these fusion proteins are often referred to as “class II” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-SanchezSanMartin1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Harrison1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Kielian1">[28]</xref>. In addition to the ectodomains whose trimer structures are described above, truncated fusion proteins composed of domains I and II (DI/II) can reconstitute SFV and DENV core trimer formation on target membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-SanchezSanMartin2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>. Such core trimers act as specific targets for DIII binding, thus recapitulating the protein-protein interactions during class II trimerization and hairpin formation.</p>
<p>Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported as virus particles through the secretory pathway and released by exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lindenbach1">[4]</xref>. Given the low pH that is present in the Golgi complex and trans-Golgi network (TGN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Paroutis1">[31]</xref>, how do flaviviruses avoid inactivation during their transport? The particles are assembled in the ER as immature non-infectious viruses containing heterodimers of the precursor membrane protein (prM) and E protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lindenbach1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-SanchezSanMartin1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Wengler1">[32]</xref>. Subsequent exposure to low pH in the secretory pathway triggers a dramatic rearrangement to E homodimers and makes the prM protein accessible to furin cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Stadler1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>. Processing of prM by cellular furin results in mature infectious virus in which E homodimers are poised to mediate fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Stadler1">[33]</xref>. Important recent studies describe the structure of pr peptide in complex with E, and indicate that processed pr remains associated with the virus at low pH and can inhibit virus-membrane interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu2">[36]</xref>. Thus, pr on the virus could protect E protein from low pH in the secretory pathway.</p>
<p>The flavivirus prM/pr protein plays multiple roles in the virus life cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-SanchezSanMartin1">[26]</xref>). prM acts as a chaperone for E protein folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lorenz1">[37]</xref> and associates with the tip of E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>. prM also appears to respond to low pH to permit E rearrangement on the virus surface and allow furin access for prM processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lin1">[38]</xref>. Following cleavage, the pr peptide may prevent premature virus fusion through bridging interactions that stabilize the E homodimer and thereby prevent dissociation to E monomers, a key fusion intermediate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu2">[36]</xref>. To better understand these multiple roles of prM/pr, separation of its chaperone and pH-protection functions and characterization of the pr-E interaction are needed.</p>
<p>Here we developed a system to produce DENV pr peptide and reconstitute the pr-E interaction in vitro. At low pH pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion and trimerization. Addition of exogenous pr to mature DENV particles inhibited virus fusion and infection. Mutation of a key histidine residue in the pr-E interface, E H244, reduced pr's binding and inhibitory activity, and reduced DENV secondary infection and particle production. The defect in particle production could be partially rescued by neutralization of exocytic low pH, indicating the important role of pr in protecting DENV from premature fusion during transport to the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Expression and characterization of pr peptide</title>
<p>A number of truncated E proteins have been successfully produced by co-expression with prM (e.g., references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Ivy1">[39]</xref>), while the pr-E structural studies were based on a secreted hybrid protein containing truncated prM linked to truncated E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>. Previous studies indicated that full-length TBEV prM could fold correctly when expressed in the absence of E protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lorenz1">[37]</xref>, suggesting that production of pr peptide alone might be possible. We generated a construct based on residues 1–86 of DENV2 prM, truncating pr just before the start of the furin cleavage recognition site at residue 87 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). This sequence was linked to a mammalian signal peptide at the N-terminus and to an affinity tag at the C-terminus, and expressed in 293T cells. The protein was isolated in a highly purified form by affinity chromatography and gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), and was recognized by mAb prM-6.1 against prM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Junjhon1">[40]</xref> (data not shown). The pr peptide migrated at a position of ∼17 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE, in keeping with its predicted size of 13 kDa plus the presence of carbohydrate due to the glycosylation site at position 69. This carbohydrate was removed by Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to give a peptide of the predicted size. The protein was largely resistant to Endoglyosidase H (Endo H) digestion, indicating maturation of the carbohydrate chain as the protein transited through the Golgi complex. A mobility shift was observed upon reduction of pr, in keeping with the presence of 3 disulfide bonds in the structure of pr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also produced and purified a dimeric ectodomain form of DENV2 E protein containing all three domains (E′), a monomeric form containing E domains I and II (DI/II), and E domain III (DIII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g001">Fig. 1A and 1C</xref>), all as previously described in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao2">[41]</xref>.</p>

<title>pH-dependent binding of pr and E proteins</title>
<p>As a first test of in vitro pr-E binding, we coupled pr to sepharose beads and tested its ability to pull-down truncated E protein containing only domains I and II. This form of E protein is monomeric and the tip of DII is thus accessible even at neutral pH. Previous studies showed that this and other DENV DI/II proteins are active in membrane insertion and trimerization at both neutral and low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>. We observed efficient pull-down of DI/II protein by pr-sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), but in spite of the accessibility of the pr binding site on DI/II at neutral pH, pull-down was low pH-dependent. The pull-down of DI/II protein by pr was specific, as it was blocked by inclusion of mAb 4G2 against the E fusion loop at the DII tip, and did not occur with BSA-sepharose beads. These data suggested that the recombinant pr peptide could bind to the tip of DI/II in a low pH-dependent reaction.</p>

<title>Pr peptide binds DENV E proteins in a pH-dependent manner.</title>
<p>A) Pull-down of DI/II protein by pr. DI/II was incubated with sepharose beads conjugated with pr peptide or BSA at the indicated pH for 1 h at room temperature. As indicated, reactions contained a 2∶1 molar excess of mAb 4G2 to the E fusion loop or mAb to the ST tag (con.). Input lanes show an aliquot representing 20% of the reaction prior to pull-down. (Panels B–D) SPR analysis of pr-E binding. Pr peptide was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and DENV2 E′ (B), DI/II (C) or SFV DI/II proteins (D) were flowed over the chip at concentrations of 1.2 µM in buffers of the indicated pH for 300 s, followed by injection of protein-free buffer at the same pH. Data are a representative example of two independent experiments.</p>

<p>For more detailed studies of pr-E binding, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays using our various forms of recombinant E protein with immobilized pr peptide. Compared to the pull-down assay, SPR can detect low levels of protein-protein interactions as binding is detected in real time and does not require removal of unbound E. The E′ protein is a dimer at neutral pH and dissociates to monomers at low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>. When SPR was performed with E′ protein buffered at pH 8.0 there was very low binding (low signal response) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). As the buffer pH was decreased, the signal gradually increased, with maximal response observed at ∼pH 6.25 and no further increase at pH 6.0. A rapid decrease in signal was observed when the samples were shifted to protein-free buffer, indicating rapid dissociation of the pr-E interaction. Similar results were obtained using monomeric DI/II, with the lowest binding at pH 8.0, highest binding at pH 6.25, and a slight decrease at pH 6.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, the dimeric E′ and monomeric E DI/II proteins bound pr peptide with similar pH-dependence. Binding to pr was specific, as little interaction was observed using the structurally similar E1 DI/II protein of SFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). In addition, binding of DENV E DI/II protein to pr was inhibited by preincubation with mAb 4G2 against the fusion loop (molar ratio 1∶1) (data not shown). Determination of the affinity of pr-E binding was not performed as the data did not fit to a simple Langmuir model of 1∶1 binding, presumably because of E protein aggregation at low pH.</p>

<title>Effect of exogenous pr peptide on E protein-membrane interaction</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that retention of endogenous pr peptide on the furin-processed DENV particle inhibits virus interaction with liposomes at low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>. Structural considerations suggested that this inhibition occurs primarily by blocking low pH-triggered dissociation of the E dimer, a required first step in the fusion reaction. To test this mechanism, we evaluated the effect of pr on the membrane interactions of dimeric and monomeric forms of E protein. The E′ dimer was preincubated with pr peptide or an unrelated protein with the same affinity tag for 5 min at pH 8.0, and then treated at pH 5.75 in the presence of target liposomes. Membrane-associated proteins were separated by liposome floatation on sucrose gradients. There was no liposome co-floatation when E′ protein was incubated with liposomes at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). About 70% of the total E′ floated with liposomes in the top part of the sucrose gradient after treatment at pH 5.75 in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, top panel) or absence (data not shown) of a control protein. In contrast, when E′ was preincubated with pr peptide (pr∶E′ molar ratio 12∶1) and treated with low pH, only ∼2% of E′-ST floated with the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, middle panel). Inhibition by pr was not observed when it was added after E′ was treated at low pH in the presence of liposomes for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, bottom panel), and thus pr needed to be present during the membrane insertion step. Inhibition was concentration-dependent, with 22% E′ co-floatation at a pr∶E′ molar ratio of 3∶1, 8% at 6∶1, and 0.4% for 24∶1 (data not shown; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>A) E′-liposome co-floatation assay. E′ protein was mixed with pr peptide or an ST-tagged control protein (Seap) at a final concentration of 50 µg E′ protein and 200 µg pr/Seap protein/ml (molar ratio 12 pr/1E). Liposomes were added at a final concentration of 1 mM, and the samples were incubated at the indicated pH for a total of 60 min at 28°C. Where indicated, E′ protein plus liposomes were incubated for 30 min, pr peptide added to a final concentration of 200 µg/ml, and the incubation continued for an additional 30 min. The liposome-bound proteins were then separated by floatation on sucrose gradients at the indicated pH. Aliquots of the top, middle and bottom of the gradients were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting for E protein. B) DI/II-liposome co-floatation assay. 40 µg/ml DI/II plus DIII or BSA (200 µg protein/ ml) were incubated with liposomes plus 200 µg pr peptide/ml as indicated and assayed for liposome co-floatation as in panel 3A. C) SFV DI/II-liposome co-floatation assay. SFV DI/II protein (40 µg/ml) was mixed with BSA or pr peptide (160 µg/ml). Liposomes were added at a final concentration of 1 mM, and the samples were incubated at the indicated pH for a total of 30 min at 28°C. Liposome co-flotation was assayed as in panel 3A. D–E) Loss of pr inhibition of E protein in the pH range of the late endocytic pathway. D) pH dependence of pr inhibition. E′ protein was mixed with liposomes in the presence or absence of pr peptide (molar ratio ∼12 pr/1E), treated at the indicated pH as in Fig. 3A, and E′- membrane association determined by floatation assay as in Fig. 3A. E) Concentration-dependence of pr inhibition. E′ protein was mixed with liposomes and treated at pH 5.75 or pH 5.0 in the presence of the indicated molar ratios of pr peptide to E protein. E′-membrane association was determined by floatation assay as in Fig. 3A. For each pH, the E′ floatation efficiency was normalized to the amount of floatation in the top fraction in the absence of added pr protein. Data in panels A–E are each a representative example of two independent experiments.</p>

<p>We then tested the effect of pr on the DENV E DI/II protein. This protein is monomeric and its stable membrane interaction requires DIII to “clamp” the core trimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, ∼25% of DI/II co-floated with liposomes at low pH in the present of DIII, while no co-floatation was detected when BSA was substituted for DIII protein. The addition of pr peptide blocked membrane interaction of DI/II when added prior to liposome incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> panel), but not after liposome incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, bottom panel).</p>
<p>The structurally related alphavirus protein SFV E1 DI/II is monomeric and efficiently interacts with membranes at low pH (80% cofloatation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, middle panel). No inhibition occurred when pr peptide was added prior to liposome addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, bottom panel), in keeping with the lack of pr-SFV DI/II binding in the SPR experiments discussed above. Thus, pr peptide specifically inhibits target membrane interaction of both monomeric and dimeric forms of the DENV E protein.</p>
<p>E′ protein efficiently inserted into membranes over a wide range of pH values from 6.25-4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3D–E</xref>). However, pr's inhibition of E membrane insertion was less efficient in the pH range (pH 5.0) present in the late endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3D–E</xref>). This loss of pr inhibition at more acidic pH may be relevant to recent studies of infection by immature DENV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Dejnirattisai1">[42]</xref>, as mentioned in the discussion section below.</p>

<title>Effect of exogenous pr peptide on dengue virus fusion and infection</title>
<p>All of the results above were obtained with soluble forms of the E protein. In order to test the ability of exogenous pr peptide to interact with and inhibit intact DENV, we took advantage of a previously described assay that monitors low pH-triggered fusion of DENV with cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao2">[41]</xref>. In this fusion-infection assay, virus is pre-bound to target cells on ice, and then treated at 37°C for 1 min at low pH to trigger virus fusion with the plasma membrane. This fusion reaction is then quantitated by detecting the infected cells by immunofluorescence. We tested the effect of pr peptide during this 1 min low pH treatment using DENV1 WP and DENV2 NGC. The sequence of E DI/II is 68% identical between these two serotypes. Both serotypes showed efficient fusion and infection after treatment at pH 6.0, with about a 10-fold increase compared to samples treated at pH 7.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The addition of pr peptide during the 1 min low pH treatment strongly inhibited DENV fusion and infection. Inhibition was dose-dependent, with 45–49% inhibition at 6 µM pr and 81–85-% inhibition at 30 µM pr. In contrast, pr did not inhibit low pH-triggered fusion by the alphavirus SIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, exogenous DENV2 pr peptide can specifically interact with mature DENV1 and DENV2 to block virus fusion and infection. We did not observe inhibition when DENV was preincubated with 30 µM pr at pH 7.0 and then added to target cells in a standard infection assay, suggesting that under these conditions an inhibitory concentration of pr was not present during low pH-triggered fusion reaction in the endosome. This result also indicates that the presence of pr did not affect virus-cell binding.</p>

<title>Role of E H244 in pr-E binding</title>
<p>Although the interaction of pr with DENV can clearly prevent virus-membrane interaction and fusion (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>), the importance of pr in protecting DENV during exocytic transport has not been defined.

Sequence analysis shows that these 11 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, numbered residues) are highly conserved among the 4 DENV serotypes, and that D63 and D65 of pr, and the complementary H244 on E protein are conserved among all reported flavivirus sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>. Optimal pr-E binding in vitro occurred at ∼pH 6.25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that protonation of H244 could be involved in this pH-dependence. To test this we substituted alanine for H244 in the DI/II protein. DI/II H244A was produced in highly purified form with electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the wild type (WT) protein in reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>We first tested the effect of the H244A mutation on pr-E binding. In agreement with our earlier results, WT DI/II protein was efficiently pulled-down by pr-sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Pull-down was low pH-dependent and blocked by mAb 4G2 against the E fusion loop at the DII tip. In contrast, almost no H244A DI/II protein was pulled-down by pr-sepharose at either low pH or neural pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). SPR analysis of WT DI/II protein showed most efficient binding at pH 6.0, and binding was blocked by pre-incubating the DI/II protein with mAb 4G2 (molar ratio 1∶1) before dilution into SPR buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, upper panel). Equivalent concentrations of H244A DI/II protein showed greatly reduced binding to pr compared to that of WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lower panel). Although H244A binding was decreased, the residual binding was still blocked by mAb 4G2 and had an acidic pH optimum. This suggests that binding also involves other residues in the pr-E interface, such as the complementary residues identified in the structural studies and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>.</p>
<p>We then asked if the H244A DI/II protein was still active in binding to target liposomes. WT or mutant DI/II proteins were mixed with liposomes at low pH in the presence of DIII protein to stabilize the core trimer. Both proteins efficiently bound liposomes in a DIII-dependent reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that the mutant protein retains its ability to insert into target membranes and form a core trimer. In agreement with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, floatation of the WT protein was blocked by inclusion of pr during the membrane insertion step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, the efficiency of floatation of the H244A mutant protein was 43% in the absence of pr and 47% in the presence of pr. Thus, the H244A mutation did not inhibit E-membrane interaction but made that interaction insensitive to the presence of pr.</p>

<title>H244A mutation inhibits DENV secondary infection</title>
<p>Since the E H244A mutation disrupts E protein's interaction with pr, we used this mutation to address the importance of pr in protecting DENV during transport through the exocytic pathway. We introduced the E H244A mutation into the infectious clone of DENV1 WP. WT and mutant viral RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription and were electroporated into BHK cells.

<title>Role of E H244 during virus assembly and secretion</title>
<p>The absence of secondary infection by the H244A DENV1 mutant could be due to decreased virus particle production and/or production of particles that are non-infectious. Efficient DENV particle production is dependent on E protein folding, particle budding into the ER, and subsequent particle egress through the secretory pathway. To investigate these issues, we took advantage of the ability of the flavivirus prM and E proteins to assemble into virus-like particles (VLP) in the absence of other viral components or virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Allison1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lorenz2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Hsieh1">[46]</xref>. The VLP system avoids complications arising from selection of revertants of deleterious virus mutations such as H244A. Flavivirus VLP bud into the ER in the immature prM form, undergo furin maturation during transport through the secretory pathway, and display similar low pH-dependent fusion activity as infectious virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Allison1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Corver1">[47]</xref>.

<p>We established stable HEK 293 cells that inducibly express the DENV1 WT or H244A prM-E proteins. After 36 h induction with tetracycline, both WT and H244A cells show abundant intracellular expression of the DENV1 E protein as detected by immunofluorescence, while the parent cell line is negative for E expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). To evaluate whether WT and H244A E proteins were correctly folded, cells were induced for 36 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to E DIII, and with two conformation-specific mAbs. mAb 4E11 recognizes a discontinuous epitope on DENV E DIII and requires proper DIII disulfide bond formation for recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lisova1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Thullier1">[50]</xref>. mAb 4G2 recognizes the fusion loop at the tip of flavivirus E DII and its epitope is sensitive to reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Crill1">[51]</xref>. Expression studies have shown that the 4G2 epitope is not formed if the E protein is expressed in the absence of prM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Konishi1">[52]</xref>, indicating that this epitope is particularly useful for diagnostic tests of prM's chaperone interaction with E (see also reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lorenz1">[37]</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>, lysates from cells induced to express prM plus WT or H244A E proteins showed strong reactivity with all three antibodies. Quantitation of multiple experiments confirmed that WT and H244A E proteins were comparably recognized by the 4E11 and 4G2 mAbs. Thus, by these criteria H244A E protein interacts with prM protein and is correctly folded. This result also agrees with our finding that truncated H244A E protein expressed with prM in the S2 cell system was fully active in low pH-dependent membrane binding and trimerization, suggesting correct folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

E proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by Sango, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to DIII, and by the mouse mAbs 4G2 and 4E11, as indicated at the top of the panel.

<p>We then used the inducible cells to examine VLP production. Expression was induced for 36 h. The cells were then lysed and the E proteins immunoprecipitated, and the VLP in the culture media were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Analysis by western blotting showed strong E protein expression in both WT and H244A cells, and no expression in the parent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). The WT cells released E protein in VLP, but VLP release from cells expressing the H244A mutant E protein was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>, - media samples). This result is in keeping with the hypothesis that the H244A cells assemble VLP in the neutral pH environment of the ER but that VLP release is inhibited by the lack of pr protection from the low pH of the secretory pathway. To test this idea, we induced WT and H244A prM-E expression and cultured the cells in the presence of 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to neutralize the acidic pH in the Golgi and TGN compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>, +NH<sub>4</sub>Cl lanes). The cellular expression level of either E protein was not significantly affected by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment, and WT VLP production was similar in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-treated cells and untreated cells. However, production of VLP containing the H244A mutant E protein was increased 4–7 fold in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-treated cells. While H244A VLP production was still significantly decreased compared to that of WT, it was selectively rescued by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During translation of the flavivirus polyprotein, prM is the first protein translocated into the ER lumen, where it acts as a chaperone during the folding of the subsequently translocated E protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lindenbach1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Lorenz1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Allison1">[44]</xref>. In addition to this important role of prM during E protein synthesis, a variety of data suggest that the interaction of pr peptide with the viral E protein protects flaviviruses from low pH during their transport through the exocytic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu2">[36]</xref>. Here we showed that a recombinant pr peptide was efficiently folded, glycosylated, and secreted from 293T cells in the absence of its normal prM context and furin processing. Recombinant pr bound to soluble E proteins at low pH, inhibited E-membrane insertion, and interacted with mature dengue virus to block fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of the conserved E H244 within the pr-E interface disrupted pr-E binding in vitro and blocked secondary virus infection. VLP production was inhibited by the H244A mutation and partially rescued by pH neutralization with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Together our data demonstrate the critical role of pr in protecting DENV from exocytic low pH.</p>

In situ measurements indicate that the pH of the TGN is ∼6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Demaurex1">[53]</xref>, while the pH optimum of DENV2 NGC fusion is ∼6.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao2">[41]</xref>. The low pH of the TGN is critical for the rearrangement of immature DENV to allow furin cleavage, but once the virus is processed it becomes fusion-active in this same pH range. Thus the pH dependence of the pr-E interaction appears optimized to protect DENV during its continued transit through the secretory pathway. Pr's inhibition of E membrane insertion was less efficient at a pH value (pH 5.0) similar to that in the late endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g003">Fig. 3D–E</xref>). This loss of pr inhibition at more acidic pH could help to explain the recent finding that infection by immature DENV is enhanced by antibodies to prM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Dejnirattisai1">[42]</xref>. The antibody-bound immature virus is likely to be endocytosed and processed by cellular furin in the endocytic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Zhang2">[54]</xref>. The lower pH conditions of the late endocytic pathway could then cause the loss of pr inhibition and allow virus fusion.</p>
<p>The structure of furin-cleaved DENV at pH 6.0 shows that pr is bound to the virion through interactions with the DII tip of one E protein and DI on the neighboring E monomer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu2">[36]</xref>. This suggested that pr might primarily block virus-membrane interaction by preventing dissociation of E dimers, a required first step in the fusion pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Stiasny1">[55]</xref>. Our results show efficient binding of pr to the dimeric form of the DENV E protein, but also to the monomeric DI/II form. We do not know if the E′ protein dimer is stabilized by pr interaction or if the dimer dissociates prior to interaction with pr, and experiments to address these points were inconclusive (data not shown). The similar pH dependence of pr binding to monomeric and dimeric E proteins suggests that pr may bind the same site in both cases. mAb 4G2 against the fusion loop inhibited pr interaction with E DI/II, confirming that pr was binding to the DII tip rather than to other sites on expressed E proteins. In keeping with its binding site in the vicinity of the fusion loop, pr peptide blocked the membrane insertion and liposome co-floatation of E′ and DI/II proteins. Prior studies showed that a monomeric DI/II protein with a single <italic>Strep</italic> affinity tag stably inserts into liposomes at either neutral or low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>, and pr blocked this insertion even at pH 8.0 where its interaction with DI/II was suboptimal (data not shown). Thus, while the pr-E interaction is strongly low pH-dependent, its functional inhibition of membrane insertion can still be observed at neutral pH in the presence of excess pr.</p>

<title>Effects of E protein H244 mutations</title>
<p>Several other studies have addressed the role of E H244 in the flavivirus lifecycle. Experiments in TBEV evaluated particle production and membrane fusion activity using a VLP system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Fritz1">[56]</xref>. Mutation of H248 (TBE numbering) to A or I blocks VLP secretion, in agreement with our results. However, an H248N mutant efficiently produces VLP, and these particles show WT levels of fusion activity. WNV E H246A or Q mutations inhibit release of infectious reporter virus particles from cells, as do a number of other substitutions at this position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Nelson1">[57]</xref>. Replacement of H246 with aromatic residues such as phenylalanine allows both particle release and infectivity. An H244A mutation in DENV2 NGC inhibits infectious virus production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Kroschewski1">[43]</xref>. E H244 and its interacting partners D63 and D65 on pr are conserved within the flaviviruses, and thus these data from several flaviviruses plus our DENV results support an important role for the E 244 position. However, a histidine residue at this position does not seem to be strictly required for particle production, suggesting that substitutions such as 244F and 244N can support the interaction of E with pr.</p>
<p>In contrast to the block in production of H244A VLP, the H244A DI/II protein was efficiently secreted from cells. Mutant protein secretion was somewhat reduced, with the final yield of DI/II H244A about half that of the WT protein in two separate preparations (data not shown), suggesting some effects of non-optimal pr interaction. However, unlike the E protein in virus or VLP, the truncated DI/II protein lacks the TM region and does not mediate membrane fusion, and thus may be relatively independent of the pH-protection function of pr. The purified WT and mutant DI/II proteins were able to bind liposomes and form core trimers that were stabilized by DIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, the mutant protein is correctly folded and active in membrane insertion. Studies with conformation-specific mAbs also provided evidence for the correct folding of H244A E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001157-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the H244A E protein is still able to access the chaperone functions of prM, while its decreased pr binding indicates that it can no longer utilize the pH protection functions of pr.</p>
<p>These data are consistent with the idea that, similar to WT E, the mutant protein is assembled with prM into VLP in the ER. The membrane insertion and trimerization activity of H244A suggest that the full-length mutant protein would be fusion-active on such VLP once they are transported from the neutral pH of the ER to the low pH of the Golgi and TGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Paroutis1">[31]</xref>. Thus, the decreased release of H244A VLP and its partial rescue by neutralization of the exocytic pathway support a critical role for pr in protecting DENV from exocytic low pH, and suggest that virus/VLP fuses in the TGN in the absence of pr-E interaction. Rescue of H244A VLP production by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was clearly incomplete. This may be due to complex aspects of both virus and cell, such as direct effects of the H244A mutation on particle assembly in the ER, or difficulties in blocking fusion of a virus with the relatively high pH threshold of DENV.</p>

<title>Implications of the in vitro pr-E interaction</title>
<p>Several strategies have been used to block flavivirus and alphavirus fusion reactions and thus inhibit virus infection. SFV and DENV fusion are specifically blocked by exogenous DIII, which binds to the core trimer and prevents the foldback of endogenous DIII and hairpin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao2">[41]</xref>. A later stage in DENV fusion is targeted by a stem-derived peptide, which binds to the ectodomain trimer in which DIII has folded back but stem packing has not yet occurred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Schmidt1">[58]</xref>. These virus protein-protein interactions can be reconstituted in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-SanchezSanMartin2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Liao1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Schmidt1">[58]</xref>, opening the possibility of using them as screens for small molecule inhibitors of virus fusion and infection.</p>
<p>The in vitro reconstitution of the pr-E interaction using soluble components could also act as a screen for small molecule inhibitors of this important flavivirus protein-protein interaction. Such inhibitors could act at multiple points in the virus lifecycle. During virus protein biosynthesis, an inhibitor could block the chaperone interaction of prM with E, leading to misfolding of E and its elimination by the ER quality control pathway. An inhibitor of pr interaction could make E protein susceptible to premature fusion in the TGN and could thus block virus production similar to the H244A mutation. It is also possible that small molecule inhibitors of pr-E binding could interact directly with the DII tip on mature virus particles, perhaps stabilizing the dimer and/or blocking membrane insertion of the fusion loop, thereby blocking virus fusion. Thus the in vitro system we describe here has the potential to identify molecules that could aid in the study of the flavivirus lifecycle and that could act to inhibit specific steps.</p>

<title>Effects of pr on virus fusion</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that after cleavage endogenous pr is retained on the virus particle if the virus is maintained at acidic pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>. Under these conditions, the virus-pr complex does not bind target membranes, while virus from which pr is first released at neutral pH efficiently binds membranes upon shift to acid pH. Thus, the bound endogenous pr inhibits virus-membrane interaction and presumably blocks virus fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Yu1">[35]</xref>. Our results demonstrated that even after maturation to fully infectious DENV particles, exogenous pr could add back to the virus and inhibit low pH-triggered virus fusion and infection. The flavivirus membrane fusion reaction is very rapid, occurring within seconds of low pH treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Corver1">[47]</xref>. Recombinant DENV2 pr peptide inhibited fusion by both DENV1 and DENV2, suggestive of a fairly broad spectrum inhibition in agreement with the strong sequence conservation at the pr-E interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Li1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>The structure of the flavivirus E protein in its pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations defines the dramatic conformational changes between these two states. Many questions about the intermediates that connect the pre- and post-fusion conformations remain. In particular, it will be important to define the membrane protein rearrangements in the context of the highly organized flavivirus particle. For example, a neutralizing E mAb that blocks virus fusion was used to trap a West Nile virus fusion intermediate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001157-Kaufmann1">[59]</xref>. It will be interesting to evaluate if exogenous pr peptide could also be used as a novel probe to capture intermediates in the flavivirus fusion pathway.</p>
