<p>When colonising host-niches or non-animated medical devices, individual cells of the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> expand into significant biomasses. Here we show that within such biomasses, fungal metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> acts as a communication molecule promoting the switch from yeast to filamentous growth essential for <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathology. We find that CO<sub>2</sub>-mediated intra-colony signalling involves the adenylyl cyclase protein (Cyr1p), a multi-sensor recently found to coordinate fungal responses to serum and bacterial peptidoglycan. We further identify Lys 1373 as essential for CO<sub>2</sub>/bicarbonate regulation of Cyr1p. Disruption of the CO<sub>2</sub>/bicarbonate receptor-site interferes selectively with <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation within fungal biomasses. Comparisons between the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> infection model and the mouse model of disseminated candidiasis, suggest that metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> sensing may be important for initial colonisation and epithelial invasion. Our results reveal the existence of a gaseous <italic>Candida</italic> signalling pathway and its molecular mechanism and provide insights into an evolutionary conserved CO<sub>2</sub>-signalling system.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Pathogenic microorganisms can produce a variety of secondary metabolites and signalling molecules which can affect the host, or provide them with a selective advantage against competing commensal organisms. We demonstrate that gaseous, metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> can serve as a signalling molecule to enhance the organism's virulence during infection establishment by using the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> as a model. Furthermore, we identified a CO<sub>2</sub> receptor site within the catalytic domain of the soluble adenylyl cyclase, Cyr1p, which is critical for CO<sub>2</sub> sensing and hence virulence of the organism. CO<sub>2</sub> sensing is conserved in a variety of pathogenic species, and increased levels have been shown to suppress the host's immune system. Thus, CO<sub>2</sub> sensing may represent a mechanism to enhance <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence when the host's immune system is suppressed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the predominant fungal pathogen of humans. In healthy individuals <italic>C. albicans</italic> resides as a commensal of the gastrointestinal, oral and vaginal tracts. <italic>C. albicans</italic> can cause superficial infections which, although not life threatening, provide discomfort to the individual and require treatment with antifungals which is a constant drain on hospitals resources. However, <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections are life threatening when the individual's immune system becomes compromised as a result of age, cancer, chemotherapy hospitalisation and AIDS. Under these circumstances superficial infections may readily develop into systemic disease where mortality rates are reported to be up to 40%, which is higher than those for most bacterial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Almirante1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klevay1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Leroy1">[3]</xref>. For example, oropharyngeal candidiasis is common in patients with haematological malignancies (up to 60%) and those undergoing radiotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Bodey1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Odds1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Scully1">[6]</xref>. Here, a few fungal cells develop into biomasses measuring several millimetres in diameter that penetrate and invade the underlying tissue, eventually leading to dissemination of <italic>Candida</italic> into the blood stream and subsequently systemic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Farah1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Development from superficial infection to invasive disease is mediated by many well characterised virulence factors including morphological transition. <italic>C. albicans</italic> can exist in yeast, pseudohyphal and true hyphal growth forms, all of which are important for the virulence of the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Lo1">[8]</xref>. Yeast cells are thought to be essential for growth and dissemination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Saville1">[9]</xref>, while the hyphal forms are essential for invading mucosal membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Saville1">[9]</xref>. This morphological transition is mediated by host environmental cues including temperature, pH, serum, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>, which the pathogen encounters during disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Odds1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Buffo1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The virulence-associated morphological transitions of <italic>C. albicans</italic> are largely controlled through the secondary messenger cAMP. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, cAMP is synthesised by the fungal adenylyl cyclase (AC), Cyr1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Rocha1">[12]</xref>, a member of the Class III nucleotidyl cyclase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Kamenetsky1">[13]</xref>. Activity of Cyr1p governs most processes essential to <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence including tissue adhesion followed by the invasion of the underlying host-barriers, and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Verstrepen1">[14]</xref>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> AC activity is subject to both positive and negative regulation, with an increasing number of molecules directly interacting with specific domains of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Fang1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Xu1">[16]</xref>. For example, bacterial peptidoglycan stimulates Cyr1p via the enzyme's leucine-rich-region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Xu1">[16]</xref>, and CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> directly activates the Cyr1p C-terminal catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>. These forms of regulation enable <italic>C. albicans</italic> to recognise and respond (via filamentation) to specific host environmental conditions during disease progression.</p>
<p>In addition to host environmental cues, the morphological transition of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is also regulated by soluble chemical mediators, termed quorum sensing molecules (QSMs). QSMs are secreted into the environment by a variety of microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Hogan1">[for recent reviews see 17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Shank1">[18]</xref>, and upon reaching threshold concentrations, impact on microbial behaviour by influencing expression of virulence determinants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Hughes1">[19]</xref>. QSMs including the self-generated sesquiterpene farnesol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Hornby1">[20]</xref> and 3-oxo-C12 homoserine lactone (HSL) secreted by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Hogan2">[21]</xref> inhibit <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation though cAMP dependent signalling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-DavisHanna1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Further to soluble chemical mediators, volatile compounds can also act as signalling molecules. For example, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, nutrient limited yeast cells release volatile ammonia, which when sensed by another colony inhibits its growth in the direction of the signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Palkova1">[23]</xref>. CO<sub>2</sub> is a volatile gas that has recently been described as a predominant regulator of <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence factors and has been shown to effect the virulence of other microbial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Bahn1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-GewissMogensen1">[25]</xref>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> functions in two processes key to pathogenicity, one metabolic and the other cell signalling to promote filamentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>. In biological systems CO<sub>2</sub> is maintained in equilibrium with its hydrated form, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, via the actions of carbonic anhydrase. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> is required for metabolism, but when at high concentrations HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> directly activates adenylyl cyclase increasing cytosolic cAMP and promoting filamentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>. To date, only the effects of high (5%) exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been investigated in microbial species. However, microbes continuously secrete metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> into their immediate microenvironment at levels perceived to be lower than 5%. Here, we investigate the effects of self generated CO<sub>2</sub> on pathogenicity associated traits of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Previously we identified the carbonic anhydrase, Nce103p, as being essential for growth under CO<sub>2</sub> limiting conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>. Now we explore a new application of the mutant strain Δ<italic>nce103</italic> as a CO<sub>2</sub> biosensor to report on CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within fungal biomasses. Using our CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent bio-sensing strain, we demonstrate that build-up of self-generated, metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> occurs in a fungal population. Furthermore, we show that CO<sub>2</sub> mediates its effects as a hierarchy, with low concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> functioning to fill metabolic demand, then once CO<sub>2</sub> exceeds a critical threshold, it promotes filamentation and subsequent surface invasion of the pathogen. We show that microbial CO<sub>2</sub>, like environmental CO<sub>2</sub>, is sensed by the AC catalytic domain and identify a bicarbonate receptor site in Cyr1p.</p>

<title><italic>C. albicans</italic>-generated CO<sub>2</sub> accumulates under diffusion-limiting conditions</title>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is generated during metabolism and acts as an important cellular signalling molecule in many organisms. CO<sub>2</sub> influences microbial virulence and organisms behaviours such as mating, feeding or ventilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Sharabi1">[26]</xref>. We confirmed that, when grown under diffusion-limiting conditions (i.e., closed systems), <italic>C. albicans</italic> accumulated self-generated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g001">Figure 1 A, B</xref>). Next we asked whether self-generated CO<sub>2</sub> could be utilized by <italic>C. albicans</italic> to meet the organism's growth requirements. In normal atmospheres, (0.03% CO<sub>2</sub>) the <italic>C. albicans</italic> carbonic anhydrase (CA), Nce103p, is essential for catalyzing the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate to meet metabolic demands. Therefore, in ‘open’ systems (i.e., under the 0.03% CO<sub>2</sub> in air), deletion of <italic>NCE103</italic> results in a depletion of bicarbonate levels which inhibits growth. However, at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (such as 5% CO<sub>2</sub> experienced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> when inside an infected mammalian host) there is sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> spontaneously hydrated to bicarbonate to meet the metabolic requirements restoring growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, the carbonic anhydrase mutant (TK1; <italic>Δnce103</italic>) can only grow in environments with elevated concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>, and as a result, functions as a CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator. The <italic>Δnce103</italic> bio-indicator strain failed to grow when co-incubated with wild type (SC5314; WT) cells in an open system, but grew in the presence of WT <italic>C. albicans</italic> in a closed system without exogenously supplied CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, incubation of surplus (10,000 CFUs/plate) <italic>Δnce103</italic>, on its own, in closed but not open systems also restored the growth of <italic>Δnce103</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001193.s001">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that in closed systems the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels are sufficient to complement the growth of <italic>Δnce103</italic>.</p>

<p>To confirm that it was volatile CO<sub>2</sub> generated by the WT strain which restored growth to the <italic>Δnce103</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator strain, we included hydroxide into the closed system, which specifically traps CO<sub>2</sub> in the form of carbonate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Christensen1">[27]</xref>. Solid sodium hydroxide interfered with the growth of the <italic>Δnce103</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator strain, but not WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The diminished growth in the presence of sodium hydroxide is most likely caused by CO<sub>2</sub> trapping and not oxygen depletion, as oxygen levels are not influenced by the CO<sub>2</sub> trap. Taken together, these results reveal that metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> can provide sufficient HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> to meet the metabolic demands of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and that this CO<sub>2</sub> can be provided in the form of a volatile signal from neighbouring colonies.</p>
<p>Consistent with the idea that the CO<sub>2</sub> generated by WT <italic>C. albicans</italic> is supplying CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> to meet the metabolic demand of the <italic>Δnce103</italic> bio-indicator strain, rescue was independent from the cAMP signalling system, as the <italic>Δcyr1-Δnce103</italic> strain (RH12) was also complemented when incubated at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that there is sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> generated during normal metabolism of WT <italic>C. albicans</italic> to support the growth of the <italic>Δnce103</italic> bio-indicator strain, as long as diffusion of the generated CO<sub>2</sub> is limited.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>CO<sub>2</sub> accumulates inside a fungal biomass</title>
<p>We next asked whether CO<sub>2</sub> levels sufficient for signalling would build-up within a fungal biomass. To address this question, we grew the <italic>Δnce103</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator strain on its own, or mixed with equal numbers of DAY286, a <italic>Δhis1</italic> strain which is wild type for carbonic anhydrase and adenylyl cyclase, in an open system to specifically test whether CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation could occur between cells growing in the same biomass. Using the different auxotrophic tags (HIS<sup>+</sup> and HIS<sup>−</sup>) to distinguish the two strains after incubation within mixed biomasses, we were able to directly test whether metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> from DAY286 could complement the growth of <italic>Δnce103</italic>, while <italic>Δnce103</italic> on its own would be restricted in growth. Co-incubation of <italic>Δnce103</italic> with DAY286 enhanced the recovery of <italic>Δnce103</italic> 600-fold (p = &gt;0.0001) when compared to incubation of the CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator strain on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To exclude that DAY286 was able to fill the metabolic demands of <italic>Δnce103</italic> by providing other metabolic intermediates other than CO<sub>2</sub>, the <italic>Δnce103</italic> strain was also co-incubated with a surplus (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells) of heat-killed DAY286 cells. However, co-incubation of <italic>Δnce103</italic> and heat-killed DAY286 did not enhance the recovery of <italic>Δnce103</italic> compared to incubation of the CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator strain alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g003">Figure 3</xref>, p = &gt;0.0001), suggesting that within a fungal biomass, even in an open system, there is an accumulation of metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> sufficient to promote the growth of <italic>Δnce103</italic>. These data also prove that the carbonic anhydrase is essential because it ‘captures’ metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> which is needed to meet metabolic requirements of cells deep within the colony.</p>

<title>The volatile messenger CO<sub>2</sub> affects <italic>C. albicans</italic> colony morphology</title>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is not only required for metabolism, but it also acts as a signal for cAMP-dependent filamentation of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Therefore, we sought to determine whether metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> could act within a biomass to modulate morphology. To test whether <italic>C. albicans</italic> produces sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> to affect filamentation, we incubated wild type cells under open and closed conditions. In open systems, no colonies filamented, while under closed conditions, we observed changes in colony morphology after 48 hours. Plating 500 CFUs produced extensive filamentous colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Microscopic analysis of resuspended colonies confirmed that the majority of the cells filamented in the closed system (forming a highly interwoven mass of cells resistant to mechanical stress; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphal induction is critically dependent on cAMP signalling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Rocha1">[12]</xref>, we tested a strain deficient for adenylyl cyclase CR276-CTRL (RH20; <italic>Δcyr1</italic>) in our open and closed systems.

<title>Fungal CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> sensing is mediated by lysine 1373 of the Cyr1p catalytic domain</title>

However, it remains to be shown whether the mechanism of activation and potential binding site generally apply to sAC-like enzymes, in particular from eukaryotes, and whether they are responsible for the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on AC activity.</p>
<p>Using sequence alignments of Class III ACs, we generated a homology model of Cyr1p and identified the Cyr1p site corresponding to the proposed bacterial CO<sub>2</sub> receptor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Kamenetsky1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Cann1">[29]</xref>. A lysine residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Cann1">[29]</xref>, Lys1373 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> Cyr1p, would be a key interaction partner for bicarbonate in this receptor site. Class III ACs are dimers with shared active sites – i.e. residues from both monomers contribute to each active site – so that only the dimer can display activity. In contrast to ‘heterodimeric’ Class III ACs, which have one active site and a second, related-but-degenerated, ‘regulatory’ site in their dimer interface, homodimeric Class III ACs, like Cyr1p, have two identical catalytic sites in their dimer interface. In these ACs, it is believed that both sites can act as active or as regulatory sites. The putative bicarbonate-interacting lysine residue is strictly conserved in both “active’ and ‘regulatory’ sites (for example, in mammalian sAC, Lys334, would be the corresponding residue in the active site). In active sites, the conserved lysine at this position is essential for substrate binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Kamenetsky1">[13]</xref>. Because Lys1373 of Cyr1p should be essential for substrate binding in at least one of the two sites formed at the homodimer interface, we predicted <italic>CYR1<sup>1373</sup></italic> would be inactive on its own. We integrated full-length Cyr1p with Lys1373 point mutated to alanine, under the control of the <italic>TEF2</italic> promoter, into an adenylyl cyclase null, generating strain CR276-CYR1<sup>1373</sup> (RH22; <italic>cyr1/cyr1:pTEF2</italic> CYR1<sup>1373</sup>).

<p>To specifically test the role of this lysine in the bicarbonate activation of Cyr1p and to generate an AC with a selective defect in its bicarbonate responsiveness, we generated strains containing mutant/WT heterodimers. Due to the dimeric architecture of Class III ACs, one wild type Cyr1p monomer could interact with one Cyr1p<sup>1373</sup> monomer, allowing basal AC activity, but preventing bicarbonate stimulation due to disruption of the bicarbonate interacting site in the second ‘regulatory’ centre (as described above). The point mutated Cyr1p was integrated into a strain expressing wild type adenylyl cyclase, generating strain CAI4-CYR1<sup>1373</sup> (RH25; <italic>CYR/CYR1/pTEF2 CYR1<sup>1373</sup></italic>). Consistent with the expected heterodimer formation and with specific interruption of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced cAMP formation, CAI4-CYR1<sup>1373</sup>, but not the control strain CAI4-CYR1 (RH24; <italic>CYR1/CYR1/pTEF2 CYR1</italic>), displayed a signal-specific defect to the filamentation inducing cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g005">Figure 5B, C</xref>), despite the two strains expressing comparable levels of <italic>CYR1</italic>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001193.s003">Figure S3</xref>). CAI4-CYR1<sup>1373</sup> filamented in response to serum, but much less in response to CO<sub>2</sub>, while the control strain expressing wild type AC, CAI4-CYR1, filamented equally in response to both serum and CO<sub>2</sub>. The incomplete suppression of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced filamentation in CAI4-CYR1<sup>1373</sup> is consistent with the statistical formation of homodimers and heterodimers between the co-expressed wild type and variant protein, which will also yield fully CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive wild type homodimers.</p>
<p>To confirm that the observed phenotype is specific to the destruction of the bicarbonate binding site in the <italic>CYR1<sup>1373</sup></italic> heterodimers, rather than a general influence on AC activity, two additional point mutations, that inactivate Cyr1p stimulus-independent, were constructed. Asp1334 and Asp1377 (involved in active site Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding) were mutated to Ala and also expressed under the control of the <italic>TEF2</italic> promoter. Integration of these constructs into the adenylyl cyclase mutant (CR272-CYR1<sup>1334</sup>; RH26, and CR276-CYR1<sup>1377</sup>; RH27) confirmed that the proteins were catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001193.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, expression of these inactive proteins in CAI4 (containing two genomic copies of CYR1; CAI4-CYR1<sup>1334</sup>; RH28, and CAI4-CYR1<sup>1377</sup>; RH29) did not perturb hyphal induction in response to 5% serum or elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, as Lys1373 did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g005">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Thus, CAI4-CYR1<sup>1373</sup> shows a specific disruption of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced filamentation and therefore, the identified lysine, which likely acts as bicarbonate binding site, serves as physiological CO<sub>2</sub> “switch” in Cyr1p and perhaps in all related sAC-type enzymes.</p>

<p>As the fly model identified that CYR1<sup>1373</sup> was delayed in its ability to cause infection, we also sampled mice at days 1, 2 and 3 days post-infection to determine whether the delayed ability of CYR1<sup>1373</sup> to cause infection was also present in the mouse model.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is a biologically important molecule and has major implications for disease progression. As well as host derived CO<sub>2</sub>, microorganisms themselves generate and secrete metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> into their microenvironment which has the potential to impact on the organism's virulence. We observed that fungal derived, metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> accumulated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> biomasses to sufficient levels to first provide HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> as a metabolic intermediate to promote growth and then subsequently to induce the morphological transition crucial for <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathogenicity through activation of Cyr1p via lysine residue 1373.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is produced by multiple metabolic processes and the data presented here suggest that nutrient availability affects production rates. For instance, we found that fungal biomasses grown on nutrient rich media (YPD) were able to support the growth of over ten times the amount of our bio-indicator strain (<italic>Δnce103</italic>) compared to those grown on nutrient limiting media (YNB; data not shown). This result may reflect the increased flux through metabolic pathways as the organism utilises the available nutrients. In accordance with this Ghosh <italic>et al.</italic> recently proposed that the catalysis of arginine to urea and urea's subsequent breakdown to CO<sub>2</sub> produces sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> to induce <italic>C. albicans</italic> germ tube formation when engulfed by macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Ghosh1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, arginine biosynthesis maybe a key contributor to CO<sub>2</sub> production in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>Accumulation of metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> in race tubes has been shown to impact on asexual spore development in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Belden1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Park1">[33]</xref>. Here, simple displacement of the accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> (by inverting the tubes) restores conidial banding. These results suggest that the heavier density of CO<sub>2</sub> compared to O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> allow it to accumulate in a system more freely rather than diffusing away. In accordance with this, we found that growth of the <italic>Δnce103</italic> strain was enhanced at the bottom of the colony (17-fold, P = 0.001) where agar invasion was observed to stem from the centre of the colony, suggesting that the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is highest at the lower extremities of the biomass (data not shown).</p>
<p>The ability to accumulate in a system is essential for communication molecules, with many molecules only having an impact once a threshold concentration is reached. However, unlike conventional QSMs, CO<sub>2</sub> may not be specifically generated for the purpose of communication. This is mainly due to the lack of evidence for a single pathway controlling CO<sub>2</sub> output, although the work of Ghosh <italic>et al</italic> suggest that arginine biosynthesis may play a significant role in the production of CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Ghosh1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, it is more likely that the organisms have evolved to sense and respond to CO<sub>2</sub> gradients as a form of diffusion sensing rather than CO<sub>2</sub> being a true quorum sensing molecule.</p>
<p>However, the interplay between CO<sub>2</sub> production and other microbial species maybe relevant. When colonising mucosal membranes and epithelia <italic>C. albicans</italic> will be in contact with other microbes residing in the same niche. For example we found that under diffusion limiting conditions significantly fewer colony forming units (10-fold less) of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> were required to restore growth of the CO<sub>2</sub> bio-indicator strain, <italic>Δnce103</italic>, compared to wild type <italic>C. albicans</italic> (data not shown). Given that <italic>C. albicans</italic> is found in mixed microbial biofilms on medical devices it is interesting to speculate about the role the metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> in biofilm establishment and maintenance.</p>
<p>Signalling molecules normally interact with membrane associated receptors to initiate intracellular signalling cascades terminating in a transcriptional response which subsequently induces the desired effect. Unlike most signalling molecules, CO<sub>2</sub> enters the cell by simple diffusion and is maintained in the cell through hydration to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> via the actions of carbonic anhydrase. Although HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> is a metabolic intermediate and will feed into various metabolic processes, a conserved HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> binding site was identified in the adenylyl cyclase, Cyr1p, involving lysine residue 1373, which enables CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> to bind and directly stimulate Cyr1p and hence activate cAMP dependent signalling cascades. Mutation of the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> binding site resulted in a subpopulation of cells that were CO<sub>2</sub> non responsive.</p>
<p>Introduction of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensing deficient strain (CAI4-CYR1<sup>1373</sup>) into the Toll-deficient <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> infection model highlighted its reduced ability to kill the host. In the mouse model for disseminated candidiasis this attenuated virulence was not observed. However, this was hypothesised as the mutated strain remained fully responsive to other host environmental cues, including the elevated temperature and presence of serum in mammals, which are absent in the fly infection model. Taking this into consideration we hypothesise that the ability to sense and respond to metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> gradients is important during colonisation and initial invasion of mucosal membranes lining the oral and vaginal tracts during superficial infections where environmental CO<sub>2</sub> conditions are low and not as important during systemic infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001193-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Here, in an expanding fungal biomass self produced metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> gradually accumulates and once reaching threshold concentrations directly activates the soluble adenylyl cyclase, Cyr1p via the catalytic, bicarbonate receptor site. The resulting increase in cytosolic cAMP, in conjunction with other epithelial adhesion mechanisms, functions to induce the morphological switch in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Hyphal formation results in the penetration and invasion of the underlying epithelial cells, which subsequently enhances the dissemination of the fungal pathogen. Our data supports this as we routinely found enhanced levels of <italic>Δnce103</italic> cells in the biomass sections that were invading into the agar, similar to what is observed in oropharyngeal candidiasis, suggesting that cells towards the bottom of the biomass are exposed to higher concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> than cells on the surface, which would support hyphal development. Therefore, we hypothesise that during superficial infections that occur in niches where environmental CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are low (for example, on the skin and mucosal membranes lining the oral cavity) <italic>C. albicans</italic> can use self generated, metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> to enhance adhesion and promote filamentation of the underlining cells increasing the opportunity for dissemination into the bloodstream.</p>

<title>Model for metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> signalling in fungal pathogenicity.</title>
<p>As the cells proliferate on the epithelial surface, increasing fungal growth generates pockets of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> located at the bottom of the biomass. Cells exposed to the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> undergo morphological switching, promoting hyphal development and hence increasing the adherence of the organism. At the same time, the protruding hyphae would expose the pathogen to host environmental signals like serum, pH and further increases in CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which would further enhance hyphal development, increasing the opportunity for tissue invasion.</p>

<p>In line with CO<sub>2</sub> playing an enhancing role in microbial virulence, hypercapnia (elevated CO<sub>2</sub>) has recently been shown to inhibit the production of anti-microbial peptides in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Helenius1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels suppress the mammalian inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-DeSmet1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Halbertsma1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-OCroinin1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, pathogen associated, metabolically generated CO<sub>2</sub> may play multiple roles in the infection process. One would operate at a local level, suppressing the host's immune system in the underlining epithelia and rendering the host susceptible to infection. Secondly, high CO<sub>2</sub> would enhance the microbe's pathogenicity, providing more opportunity for host cell invasion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Cyr1p is a multifunctional sensor that is essential to fungal pathology. It contains multiple domains that mediate signal-specific enzyme activation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> in response to diverse filamentation-inducing molecules. We have now identified the mechanism by which this AC is stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by CO<sub>2</sub>, supplied by the environment or the fungal biomass itself. Our results give novel molecular insights into this pathogenicity mechanism, as well as an evolutionary conserved CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreception system. Interfering with fungal CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing may reveal novel approaches for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>All animal experimentation was done in accordance with United Kingdom Home Office regulations and was approved by both the Home Office and the University of Aberdeen ethical review committee. All mice were checked and weighed at least once daily, and if they showed any signs of severe disease and/or had lost 20% of their original body weight mice were humanely terminated immediately. Mice sampled at defined time points were also humanely terminated prior to aseptic removal of kidneys for burden determination.</p>

<p><italic>C. albicans</italic> strains and transforming plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001193.s007">Table S3</xref>. Columbia blood agar plates (CBA), a quality-controlled growth medium routinely used in diagnostic microbiology laboratories, supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood were either purchased premade, or were made from Columbia blood agar base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Ellner1">[38]</xref> from Oxoid (2.3% peptone, 0.1% starch, 0.5% NaCl, 1% agar, pH 7.3). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) without bicarbonate and pyruvate was obtained from GIBCO and used at pH7, (1.34% DMEM, 3.57% HEPES supplemented to a final concentration of 2% glucose). YNB and YPD were made as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Klengel1">[10]</xref>. Where supplementation with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> was required, plates were incubated in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (Infors HT Minitron) enriched with 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>. Solidified or serum supplemented media contained 2% agar and 5% horse serum.</p>
<p>Toll transheterozygotes flies were generated by crossing flies carrying a loss of function allele of Toll (<italic>Tl<sup>1-RXA</sup></italic>; obtained from the Tübingen Drosophila Stock Collection) and flies carrying a thermo-sensitive allele of Toll, with a strong phenotype at 29°C (<italic>Tl<sup>3</sup></italic>; obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center). All stocks were maintained on standard fly medium at 25°C, except during infection experiments where flies were incubated at 30°C.</p>

<title>Open and closed systems</title>
<p>For diffusion-permitting (open) systems, plates were incubated in the standard way with no additional sealing mechanism. To generate a diffusion-limiting (closed) environment, standard 10 cm petri dishes containing CBA (20 ml) were sealed with two layers of laboratory sealing film (Parafilm) followed by three layers of standard cling-film (low density polyvinyl chloride). To minimise diffusion the sealing process was repeated twice. When plates were to be incubated in parallel, standard petri dishes were placed into, zip-locked polyvinyl chloride bags (15.5×23 cm). To ensure that the bags were air tight they were sealed mechanically with an additional polyethylene bar making the bags both air and water tight.</p>

<title>Measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation in diffusion-limiting conditions</title>
<p>Sodium hydroxide was used as a CO<sub>2</sub>-trap as described by the equation below. Plates were incubated in air tight plastic bags containing a separate vial of 4M NaOH, or 0.5g of solid NaOH crystals for 48 hrs. To measure CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation the BacT/ALERT system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001193-Thorpe1">[39]</xref> was used with some modifications. The prefilled bottles were emptied in a sterile environment, media replaced with 20 ml of solidified DMEM pH7 and the agar surface seeded with 10,000 SC5314 cells. Bottles for incubation in closed systems were sealed as described for agar plates. CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation was directly measured using a BacT/ALERT 3D automated microbial detection system (bioMerieux) where microbial CO<sub>2</sub> production is assessed by a colorimetric sensor and detection system (red L.E.D and red-light-absorbing photodiode). Emitted light is recorded as a voltage signal that is directly proportional to the reflective light and hence the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the bottle.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001193.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<p>Heterogeneous cell suspensions containing equal proportions (500 cells/µl) of DAY286 and <italic>Δnce103</italic> were spotted (1 µl total) onto individual YPD or YNB plates and incubated at 37°C for 48 hrs. Initially 1 ml of sterile water was used to wash the single colony from the plate with light agitation of the agar to remove adhered cells. From the recovered 800 µl, 200 µl was plated onto YNB, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to promote growth of the strictly CO<sub>2</sub>-requiring strain <italic>Δnce103</italic> strain only (DAY286 will not grow under these conditions as it is <italic>Δhis1/Δhis1</italic>). Stability of the different phenotypic markers was verified upon replica-plating of colonies. The number of colonies was counted, and after taking into account the dilution factor, related back to the initial number of colonies in the cell suspension. Initial cell suspensions were always replica plated onto YNB and YPD to obtain the average starting cell concentration for each strain.</p>
