<p>Plasmodesma (PD) is a channel structure that spans the cell wall and provides symplastic connection between adjacent cells. Various macromolecules are known to be transported through PD in a highly regulated manner, and plant viruses utilize their movement proteins (MPs) to gate the PD to spread cell-to-cell. The mechanism by which MP modifies PD to enable intercelluar traffic remains obscure, due to the lack of knowledge about the host factors that mediate the process. Here, we describe the functional interaction between <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV) MP and a plant factor, an ankyrin repeat containing protein (ANK), during the viral cell-to-cell movement. We utilized a reverse genetics approach to gain insight into the possible involvement of ANK in viral movement. To this end, ANK overexpressor and suppressor lines were generated, and the movement of MP was tested. MP movement was facilitated in the ANK-overexpressing plants, and reduced in the ANK-suppressing plants, demonstrating that ANK is a host factor that facilitates MP cell-to-cell movement. Also, the TMV local infection was largely delayed in the ANK-suppressing lines, while enhanced in the ANK-overexpressing lines, showing that ANK is crucially involved in the infection process. Importantly, MP interacted with ANK at PD. Finally, simultaneous expression of MP and ANK markedly decreased the PD levels of callose, β-1,3-glucan, which is known to act as a molecular sphincter for PD. Thus, the MP-ANK interaction results in the downregulation of callose and increased cell-to-cell movement of the viral protein. These findings suggest that ANK represents a host cellular receptor exploited by MP to aid viral movement by gating PD through relaxation of their callose sphincters.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During infection, plant viruses utilize their cell-to-cell movement proteins (MPs) to gate plant intercellular connections, the plasmodesmata (PD), and spread between the host cells. The mechanism by which MPs facilitate their cell-to-cell translocation remains elusive. We have identified a tobacco ankyrin repeat-containing protein, ANK, that interacts with MP of <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV) both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. When coexpressd with MP, ANK promoted intercellular transport of MP and, by implication, gated PD for its movement and facilitated the viral spread. Conversely, RNAi-based knock-down of the ANK gene expression resulted in reduced MP movement and attenuated viral infection. Coexpression of ANK with MP resulted in reduction of callose deposits at PD, which are known to function as PD channel sphincters. Interestingly, expressing ANK alone did not affect callose deposits. Thus, ANK most likely represents a cellular factor that recognizes MP and acts synergistically with it to gate PD and mediate MP transport through these channels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plasmodesma (PD) is a cell-wall spanning channel that interconnects plant cells and is unique for plants. This structure is characterized by a neck-like constriction at its each end, is lined by the plasma membrane, and is traversed by a strand of appressed endoplasmic reticulum, providing endomembrane and cytoplasmic connections to adjacent cells. PD mediate direct macromolecular exchange between the connected cells, and this transport is highly regulated (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Oparka1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Maule1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Epel1">[3]</xref>).</p>
<p>PD are also utilized by plant viruses for infection. After initial inoculation and replication in the infected cell, plant viruses spread to the neighboring cells and throughout the entire plant. For this transport, viruses utilize their cell-to-cell movement proteins, MPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Epel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Rhee1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Waigmann1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Lazarowitz1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Lucas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beachy1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Boevink1">[9]</xref>. The traffic of viral MPs represents a paradigm and a model system for macromolecular transport through PD. For example, <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV) MP, the archetype of many viral MPs, presumably associates with the viral genomic RNA to form a movement ribonucleocomplex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Citovsky1">[10]</xref>, targets this complex to PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Heinlein1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Tomenius1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ding1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Meshi1">[14]</xref>, and increases the PD size exclusion limit to translocate the movement complex through the PD channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Wolf1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Waigmann2">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, two cellular factors, actin filaments and callose have been implicated in control of transport through PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ding2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Northcote1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Botha1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bucher1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Iglesias1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa2">[24]</xref>. A recent study suggested that the <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> and TMV MP may sever the actin filaments to aid their cell-to-cell transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Su1">[25]</xref>, and callose, which accumulates at the neck region of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Northcote1">[18]</xref>, represents a molecular sphincter that restricts cell-to-cell transport of macromolecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Northcote1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Botha1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bucher1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Iglesias1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa2">[24]</xref>. The level of callose in the cell wall is primarily determined by a balance between the enzymatic activities of callose synthases and β-1,3-glucanases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Kauss1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Kauss2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Levy1">[28]</xref>. Callose deposits presumably affect transport through PD, because their elevated accumulation delays local and systemic movement of different viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Iglesias1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa2">[24]</xref>. Thus, it would make a biological sense if plant viruses had evolved a mechanism to regulate, via viral MPs and as yet unknown host factor(s), callose deposits to allow their own movement through PD. So far, however, the existence of such a mechanism has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p>To date, several and very diverse host proteins have been shown to bind viral MPs. For example, cytoskeletal elements, calreticulin, pectin methylesterases, and DnaJ chaperones have all been shown to interact with TMV MP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Heinlein1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-McLean1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Shimizu1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-vonBargen1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Chen1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Chen2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Dorokhov1">[34]</xref>. Yet, none of these factors had any effects on callose deposits at PD. The role of one class of host proteins, ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (ANKs) — also known as TIP1-3, and initially reported to bind MP of the <italic>Potato virus X</italic> (PVX) <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Fridborg1">[35]</xref> — in viral movement has received no attention since their discovery. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of ANK in regulation of mobility of TMV MP through PD. Our data indicate that ANK interacts with MP and promotes reduction in PD callose deposits and subsequent MP cell-to-cell transport.</p>

<p>To evaluate TMV spread within infected plant tissues, it is useful to employ a plant host that does not develop necrosis upon infection with this virus. Thus, we chose the cultivar of tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum cv</italic>. Turk), which lacks the <italic>N</italic>-gene and, therefore, does not produce a hypersensitive cell death response to TMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ghoshroy1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Citovsky2">[37]</xref>. Because the ANK homolog of this cultivar has not been isolated, we cloned its cDNA and compared the predicted amino acid sequence with several known ANK homologs from tobacco and Arabidopsis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that the ANK sequence is well conserved in these plants, with the highest degree of identity found in the C-terminal ankyrin repeats (underlined in blue), which represent the protein domains typically involved in protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Mosavi1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bjrklund1">[39]</xref>.

<p>We then utilized reverse genetics to gain the first insight into the possible involvement of ANK in viral movement. We generated transgenic tobacco plants with RNAi-based suppression of the <italic>ANK</italic> gene. For specific suppression, we targeted the sequences of <italic>ANK</italic> that encode the N-terminal part of the protein, rather than its more conserved C-terminal ankyrin motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Based on quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis of several independently-transformed lines, we identified severe and moderate suppressors, in which the <italic>ANK</italic> gene expression levels were reduced to 5% and 15–40%, respectively, of the wild-type expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s003">Figure S2A</xref>). The severe suppressors also produced a markedly chlorotic phenotype (line RNAi ANK3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s003">Figure S2B</xref>), consistent with the known involvement of ANK homologs in chloroplast biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bae1">[45]</xref>. The moderate suppressors, however, appeared healthy and did not develop any detectible morphological or developmental phenotypes (line RNAi ANK1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s003">Figure S2B</xref>). Two such transgenic lines, RNAi ANK1 and RNAi ANK2, were selected for further analyses.</p>
<p>First, to confirm the specificity of the RNAi-based ANK suppression, we examined the expression levels of two genes, <italic>ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE</italic> (<italic>AATF</italic>) and <italic>MAGNESIUM PROTOPORPHYRIN IX (MgPP)</italic>, which are unrelated to ANK, but contain a short, 17-bp nucleotide sequence that is also found in the <italic>ANK</italic> sequence used for the RNAi suppression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s002">Figure S1</xref>). No differences were detected in the expression levels of <italic>AATF</italic> and <italic>MgPP</italic> in both RNAi ANK lines and in the wild type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s001">Table S1</xref>), indicating that the <italic>ANK</italic> suppression in our RNAi ANK lines was specific.</p>
<p>We then used RNAi ANK1 and RNAi ANK2 to examine the effect of the reduction in the endogenous <italic>ANK</italic> expression on MP cell-to-cell movement. To this end, MP was tagged with YFP and the encoding constructs introduced into the wild-type and RNAi transgenic lines by microbombardment. The MP-YFP movement was determined by confocal microscopy two days after bombardment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that, in the wild-type plants, approximately 60% of the signal was distributed between 2 to 3 cells. These observations were consistent with the known rate of the MP movement in plant tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Lewis1">[47]</xref>, and typical for this tobacco cultivar. In contrast, 70–75% of the signal remained confined to a single cell in RNAi ANK1 and RNAi ANK2 lines, indicating substantial decrease in the MP movement. Statistical evaluation of these data by the unpaired two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test confirmed that the MP movement capacities in the RNAi ANK1 and RNAi ANK2 plants were similar to each other, but different from those in the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). MP was found associated with PD in a punctate pattern characteristic for PD localization in both RNAi ANK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g002">Figure 2B, D–F</xref>) and in RNAi ANK2 plants (not shown), as in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Boyko1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Oparka2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Crawford1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Kotlizky1">[51]</xref>. Importantly, the MP colocalized with a PD marker, the PD callose binding protein (PDCB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Simpson1">[52]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g002">Figure 2D–F</xref>), further confirming the targeting of the viral protein to PD in RNAi ANK background. MP localization to PD was also confirmed in both wild-type and RNAi ANK backgrounds at different time periods after bombardment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s004">Figure S3A, B, D, E</xref>); furthermore, the expression levels of MP-YFP in these plants were essentially the same, indicating that the alteration of the ANK amount in the cell does not affect the accumulation of MP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s004">Figure S3G</xref>). Thus, the ANK suppression most likely affected MP translocation through PD, rather than its PD targeting or level of expression.</p>

<p>That the lack of ANK negatively affects MP movement is suggestive of ANK's involvement in this transport process. To support this notion further, however, it is useful also to demonstrate that overproduction of ANK enhances movement. To this end, we generated another series of transgenic lines, this time, expressing <italic>ANK</italic> under the control of a constitutive promoter. We then selected two of these lines, ANK1 and ANK2, which exhibited moderate levels of the <italic>ANK</italic> transcript overexpression (1.5–2 fold, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We could not measure directly the levels of the ANK protein in these lines due to the lack of a specific anti-ANK antibody. Instead, we produced transgenic lines overexpressing ANK tagged with a short (1 kDa) StrepII epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Voss1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Witte1">[60]</xref> and demonstrated close correlation between the levels of the <italic>ANK-StrepII mRNA</italic> and the ANK protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s005">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that the increased levels of <italic>ANK</italic> transcription lead to the increased accumulation of ANK protein.</p>

<p>When the ANK1 and ANK2 plants were examined for their ability to support cell-to-cell movement of MP-YFP, the movement was enhanced in both lines. Specifically, whereas 58% of the signal moved in the wild-type plants, the extent of movement in the ANK transgenic plants reached a total of 84–86% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, the extent of the movement was also slightly, but consistently enhanced, with 7% of the signal found in three cell-clusters in the wild-type tissues, and in 11–17% in the ANK1 and ANK2 plants. The unpaired two-tailed Student's <italic>t-</italic>test confirmed the statistical significance of the differences in cell-to-cell movement of MP between the wild-type and the ANK transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s004">Figure S3</xref>, the PD localization pattern or the accumulation level of MP were not affected in these plants. Collectively, these data indicate that the ANK may represent a plant factor that facilitates the MP cell-to-cell movement.</p>

<title>ANK is required for TMV infection</title>
<p>Biologically, suppression of MP mobility should lead to delayed infection, while increase of the MP trafficking through PD is expected to enhance the viral spread. To examine this possibility, we inoculated the ANK overexpressor and suppressor lines as well as the wild type plants with a recombinant virus that carries an autofluorescent tag DsRed (TMV-DsRed) in the place of its coat protein. The local movement of this virus was detected by the appearance and spread of the DsRed signal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows that whereas the viral transport became visible in all plants approximately at the same time after inoculation (panels A, B), the subsequent viral spread occurred faster in the ANK1 and ANK2 lines than in the wild type plants (panels A, C, E). In contrast, in RNAi ANK1 and RNAi ANK2 lines, the virus moved significantly slower than in wild type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g004">Figure 4A, C, D</xref>). Importantly, the viral movement in the ANK suppressor lines was delayed, but not arrested, and it reached the wild-type levels late in the infection process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g004">Figure 4F, G</xref>). It is important to assertain whether the positive effect of ANK overexpression and negative effect of ANK suppression on the viral movement are not due to increased or decreased replication of the virus in the ANK overexpressor or suppressor lines, respectively. To this end, we produced protoplasts from ANK1, ANK2, RNAi ANK, RNAi ANK2, and wild type plants and infected them with TMV-DsRed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g004">Figure 4H</xref> shows that no significant differences were detected in the replication levels of the virus between any of the tested plant lines, suporting the idea that the effect of ANK on the spread of the virus was due to its <italic>bona fide</italic> effect on the cell-to-cell movement capacity of the viral MP.</p>

<title>MP and ANK directly interact at PD</title>
<p>To gain insight into molecular mechanism of the ANK function in MP movement, we first examined the subcellular localizations of both proteins. When MP tagged with YFP and ANK tagged with CFP were transiently coexpressed in tobacco leaves following agroinfiltration, MP displayed the typical punctate pattern of PD localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5A, B</xref>), whereas ANK was largely cytoplasmic with characteristic transvacuolar strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5C, D</xref>), consistent with the known cytoplasmic localization of its homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Kuhlmann1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bae1">[45]</xref>. Thus, the majority of the ANK population does not colocalize with MP. Furthermore, the presence of ANK did not detectibly alter the MP localization. Indeed, the MP localization pattern in the coexpressing cells (indicated with single asterisks) was essentially identical to that in the neighboring cells (indicated with double asterisks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Taken together with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g002">Figure 2</xref> (panels B–F) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s004">Figure S3</xref> (panels A–F), these observations indicate that ANK does not affect PD targeting of MP.</p>

<p>Although the expression pattern of ANK is different from that of MP, MP is known to possesses cytoplasmic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Brill1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Fujiki1">[58]</xref>, providing physical basis for potential interaction between a proportion of the ANK population and MP. Thus, we tested whether ANK can directly recognize and bind MP <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we utilized the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Citovsky3">[61]</xref>. To date, BiFC represents one of the best assays for protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization of the interacting proteins within living cells. In this approach, proteins are tagged with N-terminal (nYFP) and C-terminal (cYFP) halves of YFP, neither of which fluoresces on its own. Interaction of the tagged proteins results in reconstruction of the YFP signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Hu1">[62]</xref>. In addition, to avoid potentially non-specific effects on protein overexpression on the interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Zamyatnin1">[63]</xref>, MP-cYFP was expressed from a relatively weak nopaline synthase promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-An1">[64]</xref>. Under these conditions, coexpression of MP-cYFP and nYFP-ANK in tobacco leaf epidermal cells resulted in appearance of strong YFP signal, indicating protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5E–G</xref>). Importantly, this YFP signal faithfully colocalized with the PDCB-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5F–H</xref>), clearly demonstrating that the MP-ANK interaction occurs at PD.</p>
<p>The specificity of the MP-ANK interaction was verified in negative control experiments, for which we chose two unrelated cytoplasmic proteins similar in size to ANK (37 kDa), the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cytoplasmic NADH kinase (NADK3, 36 kDa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Chai1">[65]</xref>, and a fragment of the bacterial ß-glucuronidase (GUS, 37 kDa). Neither NADK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5I</xref>) nor the GUS fragment (not shown) promoted reconstruction of the YFP signal when they were tagged with nYFP and coexpressed with MP-cYFP. Thus, the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between MP and ANK at PD was specific.</p>
<p>This BiFC data were confirmed by an independent approach, using a renatured gel blot overlay assay for protein interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Chen2">[33]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5J</xref> shows that ANK tagged with StrepII specifically interacted with the membrane-immobilized recombinant MP tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (lane 1), whereas no such binding was observed to the immobilized unfused GST (lane 2). Binding of MP to ANK was specific because it did not occurred between MP and NADK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g005">Figure 5J</xref>, lanes 3, 4) or between MP and CNX or ACA2 (not shown). Thus, MP can specifically recognize and bind ANK both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>ANK, in concert with MP, down-regulate callose deposits at PD</title>
<p>Arabidopsis ANK2 is involved in ROS scavenging through its interaction with ascorbate peroxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Yan1">[40]</xref>, and ROS may, in turn, affect PD transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-BenitezAlfonso1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Stonebloom1">[67]</xref>.

Also, the ROS levels in transgenic plants, both ANK overexpressor and suppressor lines, were not significantly different from wild-type lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001201.s006">Figure S5</xref>). Most likely, therefore, ANK facilitates MP movement through the mechanism independent from ROS.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that ANK is involved in regulation of callose sphincters of PD. Callose deposits are known to affect viral movement through PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bucher1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Iglesias1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Beffa2">[24]</xref>, presumably functioning as a sphincter which physically restricts PD mediated macromolecular trafficking. Thus, ANK may facilitate MP movement by reducing the PD callose deposits. To test this idea, we transiently expressed ANK and MP separately or together with each other in tobacco leaves. The amounts of callose in the expressing tissues were assayed by immunostaining using anti-callose antibody with previously demonstrated specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Sivaguru1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ueki3">[69]</xref>, followed by quantitative confocal microscopy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows that this technique readily visualizes callose deposits in a typical distribution pattern specific for PD with virtually no background signal (panels B and C), and no signal at all in the absence of the primary, anti-callose antibody (panel D). Quantification of the callose-specific signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) revealed that expression of ANK alone or MP alone resulted in virtually no reduction in callose levels as compared to control tissues. However, when both ANK and MP were coexpressed in the same tissues, the callose-specific signal decreased substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g006">Figure 6C, E</xref>), to as low as 37% of the control. These results were statistically significant as demonstrated by the unpaired two tailed Student's <italic>t-</italic>test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001201-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, ANK most likely potentiates MP movement through PD by reducing PD callose deposits, and this down-regulation of the callose content requires the presence of both ANK and MP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The molecular mechanism by which MP gates PD for viral trafficking remains obscure even two decades after the discovery of this activity of MP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Wolf1">[15]</xref>. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the host factor(s) with which MP interacts during the PD gating process. Once such factor, actin, is suggested by a recent study showing that several viral MPs may sever actin filaments to relax PD during their cell-to-cell movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Su1">[25]</xref>. Here, we characterized another cellular factor, a tobacco cytoplasmic protein ANK, which likely facilitates MP transport through PD. Our data demonstrate direct interaction between ANK and MP <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and indicate that this interaction results in reduction of callose deposits at PD and enhanced cell-to-cell movement of MP. Conversely, ANK deficit results in reduced movement of MP and slower spread of viral infection. Mechanistically, ANK promotes increase in PD transport by reducing callose deposits at PD and, by implication, relaxing the callose sphincter around the PD channel.</p>
<p>There are two interesting aspects to this activity of ANK. First, it binds and affects PD transport of MP, which is known to target specifically to PD and gate and traverse them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ding1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Wolf1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Waigmann2">[16]</xref>. On the other hand, it does not bind to or affect PD transport of proteins, such as CNX, ACA2 and free YFP, that do not specifically localize to PD and move through them presumably by simple diffusion which does not involve PD gating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-GuenouneGelbart1">[53]</xref>. Thus, ANK most likely is involved in active PD gating, but not in mere endomembrane-mediated diffusion through PD. Second, ANK cannot elicit its effects on PD transport alone, but does so in concert with MP. Thus, MP does not simply use the existing PD transport pathway, but actively interacts with the host components and participates in the gating activity. MP, thought to associate with endomembranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Heinlein2">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Reichel1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Mas1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Reichel2">[70]</xref>, interacts with ANK most likely through its cytoplasmic domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Brill1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Fujiki1">[58]</xref>. Because MP specifically targets to PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Ding1">[13]</xref>, it may help direct ANK, a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, to PD.</p>
<p>ANK is a multifunctional protein, the roles of which in different plant species are just beginning to emerge. In Arabidopsis, there are two highly conserved ANK proteins, both of which are involved in chloroplast biogenesis by binding to its outer envelope membrane proteins and delivering them to their destination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bae1">[45]</xref>. The Arabidopsis AKR2 also participates in ROS scavenging via interaction with ascorbate peroxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Yan1">[40]</xref>. Also, both Arabidopsis and tobacco ANKs are involved in disease resistance against <italic>Pseudomonas syringe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Yan1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Kuhlmann1">[41]</xref>, and ANK/HBP1/TIP1 from the <italic>N</italic>-gene containing <italic>N. tabacum</italic> cv. Xanthi in hypersensitive cell death response to TMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Kuhlmann1">[41]</xref>. ANK/HBP1/TIP1 and two ANKs from <italic>N. tabacum</italic> cv. Samsun, i.e., TIP2 and TIP3, may bind MP of PVX; these interactions, however, were shown only in the yeast two-hybrid system, and potential involvement of these ANKs in potexviral movement has not been explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Fridborg1">[35]</xref>. Finally, also in the yeast two-hybrid system, ANK/HBP1/TIP1, TIP2 and TIP3 interact with vacuolar β-1,3-glucanases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Fridborg1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Wirdnam1">[71]</xref>; because these ANKs and β-1,3-glucanases reside in different subcellular compartments, this interaction, presumably, is not biological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Levy2">[72]</xref>. Furthermore, all known β-1,3-glucanases that might degrade callose are predicted to be either vacuolar or secreted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Levy1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Suen1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Delp1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Bol1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Nishikawa1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Hu2">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Castresana1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Rinne1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Rinne2">[80]</xref> and are not known to possess cytoplasmic domains. The predicted subcellular localization suggests that it is physically impossible for these enzymes to interact with cytoplasmic ANK. One possibility is that ANK may be crucially involved during the targeting of β-1,3-glucanases containing ER-derived vesicles by MP to PD, as proposed recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Epel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-GuenouneGelbart1">[53]</xref>, by directly binding to MP. Another possible target for the ANK activity is cellular callose synthases. Callose is presumed to have a rapid turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Meier1">[81]</xref>, and active callose synthases are likely critical to maintain the PD callose deposits. These enzymes usually contain several subunits, many of which have not been sufficiently characterized; however, at least some of them have been predicted to represent transmembrane proteins with cytoplasmic domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Richmond1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Dhugga1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001201-Verma1">[84]</xref>. This topology of callose synthases would allow interactions with ANK and/or ANK- MP complexes. Regardless of its potential downstream targets in the molecular pathway of PD gating, ANK most likely represents a cellular factor that recognizes MP and acts synergistically with it to gate PD and mediate MP transport through these channels.</p>

<p>ANK cDNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence encoding the ankyrin repeat-containing domain (positions 670–1032) is shadowed, and the sequence used for the pRNAi-ANK construct is underlined. The segment used for pRNAi-ANK is unique to ANK, except for the 17-bp region highlighted in black (positions 19–45), which is found in two <italic>N. tabacum</italic> genes, aspartate aminotransferase (AB126259.1) and magnesium protoporphyrin IX (AF014052.1). The sequences for primers used for qRT-PCR are also indicated. As these primers are designed to detect the sequence specifically conserved in the ANK family, but not found in other ankyrin repeat-containing proteins, qRT-PCR using this primer set allows specific quantification of all close homologs of ANK.</p>
