Silencing tHRF by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly impaired tick feeding and decreased <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burden in mice. Interfering with tHRF by actively immunizing mice with recombinant tHRF, or passively transferring tHRF antiserum, also markedly reduced the efficiency of tick feeding and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burden in mice. Recombinant tHRF was able to bind to host basophils and stimulate histamine release. Therefore, we speculate that tHRF might function <italic>in vivo</italic> to modulate vascular permeability and increase blood flow to the tick bite-site, facilitating tick engorgement.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ticks are distributed worldwide and affect human and animal health by transmitting diverse infectious agents. Ticks are considered to be second to mosquitoes as major vectors of human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-delaFuente1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Anderson1">[2]</xref>. For example, Ixodes spp., transmit <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (the Lyme disease agent), <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> (the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis), <italic>Babesia microti</italic>, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), among other pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-delaFuente1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Feder1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Effective vaccines against most tick-borne pathogens are not currently available and there is an urgent need for the control of ticks and their associated pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Clark1">[4]</xref>. Typical vaccines target microbes directly, using extracts of the organism, or recombinant antigens as the immunogen. For example, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> outer surface protein A has been extensively studied and resulted in an Federal Drug Administration-approved vaccine that was commercially available from 1998 until 2002 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Nardelli1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Steere1">[6]</xref>. Currently one vaccine is approved and available for protection against a tick-borne pathogen – TBEV, which is transmitted by <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in Northern Europe and Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Clark1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The transmission of tick-borne pathogens can also theoretically be prevented by interfering with the ability of ticks to feed on a mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-delaFuente2">[7]</xref>. A pilot study by Allen and Humphreys several decades ago, suggested that vaccines based on tick gut antigens successfully reduced <italic>Boophilus</italic> engorgement on cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Allen1">[8]</xref>. Recently, immunization of guinea pigs with a tick salivary antigen, sialostatin L2, diminished the capacity of <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> nymphs to feed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Kotsyfakis1">[9]</xref>. While reducing the ability of tick feeding, tick-based vaccines may have another equally important impact – to decrease the chance of transmission of tick-borne pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Labuda1">[10]</xref>. Immunization of cattle with Bm86 vaccines resulted in lower infestations as well as decreased incidence of babesiosis and <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic> infection in some regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-delaFuente1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-delaFuente2">[7]</xref>. Repeated exposure of guinea pigs to ticks causes acquired resistance of the animals to subsequent tick bites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Brown1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Wikel1">[12]</xref>, and this development of “tick-immunity” can decrease tick-transmitted <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Narasimhan1">[13]</xref>. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> need to replicate within the ticks during blood feeding and are transmitted to the host after 36–48 h of tick attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Anderson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-DeSilva1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Brossard1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Piesman1">[16]</xref>. Thus, impairing <italic>I. scapularis</italic> feeding could be another useful strategy to reduce <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission.</p>
<p>Tick saliva contains molecules that are important for formation and maintenance of the feeding cavity in the host dermis, as well as the transmission of tick-borne pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Francischetti1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Hovius1">[18]</xref>. These activities include anti-hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Francischetti1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Ribeiro1">[19]</xref>. Histamine binding proteins are well characterized and suggested to be important to neutralize the inflammatory effect of histamine, which is secreted by host immune cells at the tick feeding site and critical for Ixodes ticks to successfully attach to the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Kemp1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Paesen1">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> ticks also express a protein in their saliva, which shares high homology with mammalian histamine release factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Mulenga1">[22]</xref>. Given the deleterious effects of histamine on tick physiology, it is very surprising that ticks encode a histamine release protein that would presumably stimulate histamine secretion. The role of the tick histamine release factor <italic>in vivo</italic> during tick feeding is not understood and warrants detailed examination.</p>
<p>Tick feeding can be divided into a series of 9 stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Anderson1">[2]</xref> beginning with host seeking, and culminating in engorgement on the host followed by detachment and dropping off the host. A feeding lesion is established about 24 h post attachment, and during this early phase of feeding there is minimal blood intake. Blood meal ingestion begins slowly around 48 h post tick attachment followed by rapid feeding to repletion around 72 h–96 h post tick attachment (late stage). While it is recognized that the <italic>I. scapularis</italic> salivary gland proteome changes during these early and late phases of feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Narasimhan1">[13]</xref>, a molecular understanding of these events remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In this study, we have characterized a putative histamine release factor from <italic>I. scapularis</italic>, the predominant vector of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, the agent of Lyme disease in North America. We invoke a pivotal role for <italic>I. scapularis</italic> HRF during the rapid phase of tick feeding, and address the vaccine potential of this antigen in the context of tick engorgement and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission.</p>

<title>An <italic>I. scapularis</italic> histamine release factor (tHRF) is up-regulated in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected ticks</title>
<p>To identify tick proteins that may be utilized by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> to facilitate transmission, 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was performed using extracts from <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected, and uninfected, <italic>I. scapularis</italic> salivary glands. Seventeen differentially expressed proteins (5-fold or more expression levels in <italic>Borrelia</italic>-infected salivary glands) were selected for mass spectrometric analysis, and 4 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> proteins were unambiguously identified with significant MASCOT scores (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) of 79 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001205.s002">Table S1</xref>). In this study, we characterize one of the most highly induced proteins, named tHRF because it shares high homology with a murine histamine release factor (57.1% similarity and 40.1% identity at amino acid level). <italic>tHRF</italic> mRNA levels were induced during <italic>I. scapularis</italic> engorgement, and significantly higher in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected, than in uninfected, ticks (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Immunoblots using tHRF antiserum further demonstrated a ∼2.5 fold up-regulation of tHRF in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g001">Figure 1, A, C–D</xref>). tHRF was present in tick saliva, as well as in the salivary glands and midgut, indicating that it is a secreted protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Silencing <italic>tHRF</italic> impairs tick feeding and <italic>Borrelia</italic> transmission</title>
<p>To analyze the potential role of tHRF in tick feeding, and also during <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission, <italic>tHRF</italic>-deficient <italic>I. scapularis</italic> nymphs were generated by RNA interference (RNAi). Buffer-injected (MOCK), <italic>SSRB</italic> (another tick gene- Single Sequence Receptor Beta- found in our 2DIGE list, used as a control) or <italic>tHRF</italic> double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-injected <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected nymphs were allowed to engorge on mice. The silencing of <italic>tHRF</italic> and <italic>SSRB</italic> were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). After 3 days, the weighs of <italic>tHRF</italic>-deficient ticks were significantly lower than control ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Q-PCR revealed a decrease in spirochete levels in <italic>tHRF</italic>-deficient ticks, as well as in the skin of mice that were fed upon by <italic>tHRF</italic>-deficient ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2, C and D</xref>). At 3 weeks, when spirochetes have disseminated to diverse organs, the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burden in the heart and joints was also lower in mice infected by <italic>tHRF</italic>-deficient ticks, compared to that in mice infected with control ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2, E and F</xref>).</p>

<p>To further show that <italic>tHRF</italic> directly influences tick feeding, an RNAi study was performed with nymphs that were not infected with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Consistent with the results using <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected ticks, the tick weight was significantly decreased in <italic>tHRF</italic>-dsRNA-treated uninfected <italic>I. scapularis</italic> after feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).

<title>tHRF antiserum prevents efficient tick feeding and <italic>Borrelia</italic> transmission</title>
<p>To further examine the importance of tHRF during tick feeding, and its influence on <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission, a passive immunization study was performed in naive mice. Groups of 5 mice were administered 200 µl of tHRF antiserum, or control sera (normal rabbit serum or Salp25D antiserum; Salp25D is a tick salivary protein that does not influence tick feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Narasimhan2">[23]</xref>). One day later, 6 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected ticks were placed on each mouse and tick weights were assessed after 3 days of feeding. Ticks engorging on tHRF antiserum-treated mice weighed significantly less than ticks that fed on control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The spirochete burden in ticks was also substantially lower in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> that fed on tHRF antiserum-immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burden was also markedly reduced in tHRF antiserum-immunized mice. The spirochete load in murine skin at day 7 post-infection and in joints and hearts at 3 weeks post-infection was markedly lower in tHRF antiserum-immunized group compared to control serum immunized group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g003">Figure 3, C–E</xref>). About 20–27% of the tHRF antiserum-immunized mice (N = 15) were fully protected (based on the absence of a detectable <italic>flaB</italic> signal in Q-PCR), while 100% of the control animals were infected (N = 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g003">Figure 3, C–E</xref>).</p>

<p>Uninfected <italic>I. scapularis</italic> nymphs also fed less efficiently on tHRF antiserum-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) as seen by decreased engorgement weights compared to ticks fed on control antiserum-treated mice.</p>
<p>We then assessed the ability of the ticks to feed on mice actively immunized with tHRF. Group of 5 mice were immunized with recombinant tHRF, or adjuvant (control). Immunoblots confirmed that mice generated antibodies against tHRF following active immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The tick weights were significantly decreased when <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected, or uninfected, nymphs fed on tHRF immunized mice compared to ticks that fed on control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">Figure 4, B and C</xref>). The spirochete load was also markedly reduced in ticks fed on tHRF-immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) and in murine skin (at day 7 post-infection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) and in joints and hearts (at 3 weeks post-infection) in the tHRF-immunized group compared to that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">Figure 4, F–G</xref>). 20–33% of tHRF immunized mice (N = 15) were PCR negative, while 100% of the mice in the control groups (N = 15) were PCR positive for <italic>B. burgdorferi flaB</italic> amplicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">Figure 4, E–G</xref>).</p>

<p>Our above experiments focused on 72 h post tick attachment- a specific time point at which 30–40% of the ticks from the control groups successfully complete engorgement and drop off the mice, and the remaining ticks nearing engorgement. To address the role of tHRF on 72–96h post tick attachment, all the ticks were allowed to feed to repletion on tHRF antiserum immunized mice or control mice. While, ticks in the control group fed to repletion and detached around 72–84 h of attachment, ticks fed on tHRF-immunized animals fed to repletion around 96 h after attachment. Further, 10–20% of ticks from the tHRF group remained attached to the mouse even after 96 h, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001205.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

<title>tHRF is required for tick rapid feeding</title>
<p>Ticks are sensitive to histamine during the early stage of blood feeding, and express histamine binding proteins to counteract this effect.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The incidence of tick-borne diseases has steadily increased over the past few years, and effective vaccines against most tick-borne pathogens are not currently available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Clark1">[4]</xref>. <italic>I. scapularis</italic> is the major vector of Lyme disease in the USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Anderson1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Brossard1">[15]</xref>. Further, <italic>I scapularis</italic> can serve as efficient vectors of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>B. microti</italic>, and Powassan virus (a tick-borne encephalitis causing virus). The last decade has seen an increased functional understanding of tick salivary proteins and their critical interactions with the host and pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Francischetti1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Hovius1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Nuttall1">[25]</xref>. This information has also offered a new approach to develop effective vaccines against ticks and the pathogens they transmit by simultaneously targeting the pathogen and the tick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Dai1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The identification of tick proteins potentially involved in pathogen transmission is an important step in the development of effective tick vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-delaFuente1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Hovius1">[18]</xref>. The presence of <italic>B. burgdorfer</italic>i within ticks may alter the expression level of selected genes that encode antigens in saliva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Ribeiro1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Ramamoorthi1">[27]</xref>. One of best characterized genes is <italic>salp15</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Ramamoorthi1">[27]</xref>; our recent study suggests that immunization with Salp15 could reduce the transmission of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> from infected ticks to mice, although Salp15 antibodies did not influence the ability of ticks to feed. The action is mainly due to the interaction between Salp15 antibody, Salp15 and <italic>Borrelia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Dai1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>We performed a 2DIGE analysis to identify additional tick salivary proteins modulated by spirochetes. We found that tHRF was up-regulated in <italic>Borrelia</italic>-infected tick salivary glands. HRF is an evolutionally conserved multiple-function protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Bommer1">[28]</xref>, also a novel cytokine that provokes the release of histamine by both IgE-dependent and IgE-independent mechanisms from mammalian basophils and mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-MacDonald1">[29]</xref>. In addition to mammalian HRF, HRF homologs have also been identified in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-MacDonald2">[30]</xref>, <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Mulenga1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Mulenga2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Mulenga3">[32]</xref> and <italic>Dermanyssus gallinae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Bartley1">[33]</xref>. The latter study further indicated that antibodies against HRF increased the mortality of the mites after engorgement, suggesting its potential as a vaccine antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Bartley1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Histamine, secreted by basophils in blood and mast cells in tissues, plays a deleterious role during tick feeding. Histamine is a mediator of the itch response and promotes the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells to the tick bite site – and these immune response prevent tick attachment to the skin of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Kemp1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Paine1">[34]</xref>. However, the Ixodes tick encodes several histamine binding proteins (HBPs) to counteract the effect of histamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Paesen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Mans1">[35]</xref>. The elaboration of a histamine release factor in tick salivary glands therefore seemed counterintuitive, since such an activity would be detrimental to tick feeding. Mulenga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Mulenga1">[22]</xref> suggested that ticks might need either HBPs or HRF, depending on its feeding phase. Tick feeding involves a complex series of 9 sequential stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Anderson1">[2]</xref>. Host seeking and engagement with the host precede actual tick attachment and establishment of the feeding lesion. The early phase of tick feeding that lasts about 24 h post attachment is sensitive to histamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Kemp1">[20]</xref>. We observed increased expression of Histamine Binding Proteins (<italic>HBP</italic>) in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> nymphal salivary glands during this early phase of tick feeding and might be critical to counter the effect of histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Ticks imbibe very little blood during this early phase of feeding. About 60–72h post tick attachment, which includes the rapid feeding phase, tick sensitivity to histamine significantly declines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Kemp1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-Paine1">[34]</xref>, and ticks fully engorge. During this phase the expressions of HBPs appear to be significantly decreased, and the expression of tHRF increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We speculate that this reciprocal expression of HBPs and tHRF might help increase the local concentration of histamine at the tick-feeding site during the rapid feeding phase. Increased histamine concentration might modulate the vascular permeability to enhance blood flow into the tick feeding site and facilitate tick engorgement.</p>
<p><italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> replicate after the tick begins to take a blood meal, and transmission to the host begins about 36–48 h post tick attachment, a time coincident with active spirochete replication and migration to the salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-DeSilva1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001205-DunhamEms1">[36]</xref>. Temperature and host blood are critical signals for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> replication and dissemination from the midgut. Since the feeding ability of the tHRF-deficient ticks was significantly impaired, the replication and dissemination of <italic>Borrelia</italic> inside the ticks was also significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Consequently, the spirochete transmission from tick to mouse was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and 20–30% of the mice immunized with tHRF were fully protected from <italic>Borrelia</italic> infection based on the absence of a detectable <italic>flaB</italic> signal in Q-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001205-g004">4</xref>). It is also conceivable that the vasodilatory effect of histamine, might additionally contribute to the efficient dissemination of <italic>Borrelia</italic> from the original tick-feeding site, where they are deposited, to distal sites.</p>
<p>In summary, for the first time, we demonstrate that the <italic>I. scapularis</italic> salivary protein tHRF is critical for the tick engorgement, and consequently also facilitates <italic>Borrelia</italic> transmission to the murine host. We show that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> upregulates the expression of tHRF and immunization with tHRF significantly impairs tick feeding, and decreases <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burden in mice. Importantly, these observations underscore the dynamic nature of the temporal interactions between the vector, the host and the pathogen. While vaccine targeting of tHRF alone might not be sufficient to thwart tick feeding and spirochete transmission, blocking tHRF might offer a viable strategy to complement ongoing efforts to develop vaccines to block tick feeding and transmission of tick-borne pathogens.</p>
