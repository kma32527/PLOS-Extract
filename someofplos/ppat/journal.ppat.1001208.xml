<p>Protection against malaria often decays in the absence of infection, suggesting that protective immunological memory depends on stimulation. Here we have used CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from a transgenic mouse carrying a T cell receptor specific for a malaria protein, Merozoite Surface Protein-1, to investigate memory in a <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> infection. CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup>) developed during the chronic infection, and were readily distinguishable from effector (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>) cells in acute infection. On the basis of cell surface phenotype, we classified memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into three subsets: central memory, and early and late effector memory cells, and found that early effector memory cells (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>) dominated the chronic infection. We demonstrate a linear pathway of differentiation from central memory to early and then late effector memory cells. In adoptive transfer, CD44<sup>hi</sup> memory cells from chronically infected mice were more effective at delaying and reducing parasitemia and pathology than memory cells from drug-treated mice without chronic infection, and contained a greater proportion of effector cells producing IFN-γ and TNFα, which may have contributed to the enhanced protection. These findings may explain the observation that in humans with chronic malaria, activated effector memory cells are best maintained in conditions of repeated exposure.</p>

<p>Protective immunity against malaria develops only after several infections and can be lost on leaving an area in which malaria is transmitted. This suggests that the chronic infection may maintain the protective immune response. In this paper we have used a mouse model of a blood-stage malaria infection to examine the memory response of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic infection. These T cells are required for protective immunity, and also play a part in the inflammatory response that gives rise to malaria disease. Understanding what constitutes a protective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell may help us design more protective vaccines. We show that these memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells persist in an activated state, produce the inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IFN-γ, and are more protective than “resting” memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained from mice in which the infection has been eliminated. This may explain why people are better protected against malaria disease when they are infected frequently.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protective immunity to malaria develops only after repeated infections; although protection from homologous infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Collins1">[1]</xref> and lethal malaria occurs after one to two infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Gupta1">[2]</xref>. Immunity to infection can persist for years; however, clinical immunity can be lost on emigration away from endemic areas, and high levels of exposure lead to lower disease prevalence than lower exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Snow1">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, human vaccine trials and mouse models have shown that immunity decays both with time after vaccination and that treatment of infection reduces protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Guinovart1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-FreitasdoRosario1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Achtman1">[6]</xref>. These observations suggest that continuous exposure to the parasite may be required for the maintenance of immunological protection from malaria, as has also been suggested in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and other chronic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Uzonna1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Hansen1">[8]</xref>. Recent work with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> demonstrated that the decay of protection is replicated in mouse models and that this may be determined by a decay in memory T cell (Tmem) function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-FreitasdoRosario1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Adaptive immunity to infection develops by accrual of antigen-experienced memory cells. In the absence of chronic infection, resting, antigen-independent memory T cells reside in secondary lymphoid organs; however, in chronic infection, memory cells and effector cells may be continually generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Snyder1">[9]</xref>, and may even expand the memory cell pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Vezys1">[10]</xref>. Central memory T cells (Tcm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Lanzavecchia1">[11]</xref>), defined by high levels of expression of CD62L, have been shown to be protective in various infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Zaph1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Bustamante1">[13]</xref>. However, infection with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver-stages and other chronic infections have been shown to primarily produce effector memory and effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Martin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Berenzon1">[15]</xref>, which are also protective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Zaph1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Huster1">[16]</xref>. In humans, CD8+ effector memory (Tem) cells have been subdivided with activation markers into early and late subsets, with different subsets predominating in different infections, however, it has not yet been determined how they are derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Romero1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Appay1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Harari1">[19]</xref>. In some chronic infections where high pathogen loads persist, such as HIV and LCMV, chronic stimulation leads to functional impairment or exhaustion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and production of IL-10, which slows clearance of the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Blackburn1">[20]</xref>, while in other infections, such as HCV, virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells actually accumulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Snyder1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Vezys2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>While there have been relatively few studies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory in malaria, it is known that immunity to the blood stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is dependent on both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Meding1">[22]</xref>, and the presence of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific CD4+ T cells, in some cases, has been shown to correlate with clinical immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Reece1">[23]</xref>. However, it has been shown that <italic>P. yoelii</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> infections can lead to deletion of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells generated by vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Hirunpetcharat1">[24]</xref>, and a recent study showed that protective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory decays after 6.5 months in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-FreitasdoRosario1">[5]</xref>, suggesting some impairment of long-lived immunological memory in blood-stage malaria infections. Therefore it is critical to understand more about the generation and maintenance of memory T cells in malaria to improve our capacity to generate long-lived protection by vaccination.</p>
<p>Here we have investigated the development of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells using a transgenic mouse with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for a peptide within Merozoite Surface Protein-1 (MSP1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Stephens1">[25]</xref>), the B5 T cell receptor Transgenic (B5 TCR Tg). MSP1 is expressed on the surface of merozoites and is a candidate antigen for inclusion in a blood-stage malaria vaccine. We establish that a heterogeneous memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population develops after a primary infection, and is composed predominantly of early effector memory T cells (TemE). We demonstrate a pathway of differentiation from central memory to early and then late effector memory CD4 T cells by adoptively transferring these three subsets into <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-infected RAG° mice. We also show that upon adoptive transfer, memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from chronically infected mice delay the onset of parasitemia and protect better against pathology than rested memory cells, suggesting that continuous stimulation enhances the effector function and protective capacity of memory T cells in malaria, correlating with their enhanced Th1 cytokine production. While we have previously shown the importance of B cells and antibodies in clearance of primary infection, the current studies suggest a role for cytokine production by memory T cells in long-term protection. This may be one of the reasons why people are better protected against malaria when they are re-infected frequently.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to identify malaria-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T memory cells during malaria, we have followed the response of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-specific transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which carry a TCR recognising a peptide of Merozoite Surface Protein-1 (B5 Tg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Stephens1">[25]</xref>), throughout a blood-stage infection of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> in mice. This infection is characterised by an acute phase with a peak parasitemia 8–10 days post-infection of approximately 25% infected erythrocytes. After the acute phase, parasitemia is reduced but not eliminated and can persist as a low-grade chronic infection for up to 3 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Achtman1">[6]</xref>. Purified naïve (CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup>), MSP1-specific B5 TCR Tg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Thy1.2<sup>+</sup>) were labelled with CFSE and injected into BALB/c Thy1.1 mice (2×10<sup>6</sup> per mouse). The recipient mice were infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> the following day, and the transferred B5 Tg T cells were followed by flow cytometry for 60 days after infection.</p>
<p>The acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection lasting about 20 days, and the subsequent low-level chronic infection may result in the continuous generation of effector cells, as has been reported in other persistent infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Snyder1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Vezys2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Wherry1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we utilized multiparameter flow cytometry and the activation and memory markers, CD44, CD43, CD27, IL-7Rα and CD62L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Huster1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Swain1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Hikono1">[28]</xref> to distinguish between CD4<sup>+</sup> effector and memory subsets. At day 9 of infection, the majority of Tg cells had divided (CFSE<sup>neg</sup>, FACS gating showing level of CD44 expression correlating with cell division is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), and were defined as effector cells (Teff) CD62L<sup>lo</sup>, IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>, CD43<sup>+</sup>, and CD27<sup>−</sup>, and CD44<sup>int</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Flow cytometry data gated on CD4<sup>+</sup>Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> CFSE<sup>neg</sup> divided B5 Tg cells were collected at several time-points during the infection, and subjected to boolean gating analysis, which distributed them into the 32 possible subsets generated by testing every possible combination of the 5 activation markers. This is shown in the histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, where the percentage of the divided B5 Tg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells falling into each subset is illustrated. Strikingly, this unbiased analysis identified effector cells as CD62L<sup>lo</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup> during the acute parasitemia at day 9, while memory cells were easily distinguished by their upregulation of IL-7Rα, as seen in the majority of divided, CFSE<sup>neg</sup> B5 Tg cells by day 60, which fell into both the effector (Tem) and central (Tcm) memory categories as indicated by their expression of CD62L. Various subsets could be seen within these major populations, and the other three markers, CD44, CD43, CD27, were used to determine the overall activation status of the cells. By grouping subsets based on the number of activation markers they express, we constructed pie charts to demonstrate graphically how activated the MSP1-specific cells were throughout the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). More than 80% of the Tg T cells expressed markers of activation at day 9, and interestingly, many malaria-specific cells remained activated even at day 21, when the parasite was cleared to below 0.01% of erythrocytes infected. At day 45, the activation status of the cells appeared to have stabilized, so that even at day 60, 25% of the cells maintained three or more markers of activation. This suggests that a large proportion of the MSP1-specific Tg T cells that persisted late into the chronic phase of infection remained considerably activated and did not become resting or central memory cells in this time.</p>

<p>Sorted Naïve (CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup>), CFSE-labelled B5 T cells (2×10<sup>6</sup>) were seeded into congenic Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> mice. Mice were infected with 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> iRBC, sacrificed and splenocytes stained with anti-CD4, Thy1.2 and activation markers CD44, CD43, CD27, IL7Rα and CD62L at different times post infection. <bold>A</bold>) Divided B5 T cells (CFSE<sup>neg</sup> Thy1.2<sup>+</sup>, left plot and histogram) were analyzed for expression of the activation markers on day 9 post-infection by multiparameter flow cytometry. Histograms show gating for the activation markers. CFSE<sup>neg</sup> B5 Tg effector T cells (Teff) are CD44<sup>int-hi</sup>, IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>, CD62L<sup>lo</sup>, and can be CD43<sup>+/−</sup>, and CD27<sup>+/−</sup>. <bold>B</bold>) CFSE<sup>neg</sup> (divided) B5 Tg T cells were boolean gated into 32 possible subsets based on their expression all five markers. The percentage of cells expressing each combination of markers for all of the subsets at day 9 (white bars) and day 60 (black bars) are shown in the histograms. Boxes below indicate the marker listed to the left. The blue box on the right indicates the group with none of the markers of activation. <bold>C</bold>) CFSE<sup>neg</sup> Tg cells were pooled into groups according to the number of activation markers expressed (color coded for 0–5 markers of activation as shown in the panel on the left, with colors ranging from blue: no activation markers; to purple, 5 activation markers), and the percentage of cells in each group is shown in a pie chart to indicate the relative activation state on a given day post-infection. A representative experiment of 3 performed is shown. The values shown are for 2–5 mice at each time point, cytometry data were concatenated. Experiment was repeated twice with similar results.</p>

<p>In these studies, when 2×10<sup>6</sup> B5 Tg CD4+ T cells were transferred into the recipient mice, more than 70% of the specific cells divided, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>. We focused on divided cells (CFSE<sup>neg</sup>) as they represent the specific response, however, it is possible that transfer of this number of cells may have led to non-physiological responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Whitmire1">[29]</xref>. We therefore transferred fewer T cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>) and were able to detect them by enriching Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> cells before analysis and utilizing the enhanced signal to noise ratio of double staining to detect the small numbers of cells. We could see expansion of 30,000 or 5,000 naïve purified T cells at the peak of infection (day 6) in the spleen, with some cells still remaining undivided (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>), as in the transfer of 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells. By day 60 more cells divided when fewer cells were transferred, as previously reported, and there was a similar distribution of memory T cell subsets as with more cells. When less than 10<sup>6</sup> cells were transferred, less than 50 B5 cells were collected at day 60 necessitating concatenation of the FACS data for visualization. Transferring more cells allowed us to analyze the data from each mouse separately, concatenating only for display. Therefore it was not possible to carry out further experiments with lower numbers of cells and attain statistically meaningful data. When few cells are transferred no transferred cells are detectable in uninfected mice after two months, consistent with the data of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Whitmire1">[29]</xref>, and suggesting that the transgenic cells are not expanding in a malaria-antigen-independent manner. The approach of transferring 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells was further validated by the consistency of data from 5 individual mice in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>. Importantly, transfer of 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells resulted in a physiological response, in that the small fraction that survives (0.01%) was the same proportion as MSP-1 responsive T cells in wild-type mice, as assessed previously by limiting dilution analysis (0.011% (1/8800) of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from BALB/c mice respond to B5-containing fragment of MSP-1 after ten weeks of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Quin1">[30]</xref>).</p>

<p>Effector and memory cells amongst the transferred Tg CD4 T cells were further analyzed using the expression profile, IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup>, described above for effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) and CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>, left contour plot) for memory T cells. As shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>, at day 9 of infection, these effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells accounted for approximately 75–80% of the MSP1-specific Tg T cell population, were still a substantial proportion of the total B5 T cell population at day 21, and despite low parasitemias, some even persist to day 60. CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> CD4 memory cells were present by day 21 when parasitemia is very low, but memory cells did not become the dominant population until day 45. This is important as it suggests that the memory phase where memory T cells dominate over effector cells may be delayed by chronic low-level infection.</p>

<p>Human CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells observed in various virus infections have been subdivided further into “early”, “intermediate” and “late” based on differential expression of CD28 and CD27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Appay1">[18]</xref>. We wanted to determine whether the CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> Tg CD4+ memory cells in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection also contained subpopulations suggesting differential stimulation, or stages of differentiation. CD28 could not be used in our experiments as a marker for further subdivision of Tem subsets, as expression of this molecule is not up-regulated on mouse T cells with activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Romero1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Appay1">[18]</xref>. We therefore defined subsets within the IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> memory Tg cells using CD27 and CD62L. CFSE<sup>neg</sup> (divided) B5 T cells were gated on CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> memory cells and expression of CD27, and CD62L analyzed on these cells to show the distribution of central and effector memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>, left contour plot). There were two effector memory subsets, which correlated with early and late effector memory (TemE, TemL). This analysis on day 60 post-infection showed that TemE B5 Tg cells (CD27<sup>+</sup>, CD62L<sup>−</sup>) dominated the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>, graph). Both the proportion of CD44<sup>hi</sup> IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> memory T cells and the subsets defined by CD27 and CD62L remained similar on days 45 and 60 (data not shown). We also observed the development and trafficking of memory T cells in the lymph nodes and saw both central and effector memory cells, while liver contained only effector memory cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Memory cells were also observed in the bone marrow in small numbers (data not shown).</p>
<p>In many, but not all, persisting infections, T cells have been shown to express inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 (CD279) and KLRG1. These correlate with dysfunction of the T cells called exhaustion, and can regulate pathogenic responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Day1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Barber1">[32]</xref>. However, although <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection in mice has a prolonged acute parasitemia and a long chronic phase, few PD-1<sup>+</sup> effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>) Tg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (all CD62L<sup>lo</sup>, maximum of 5.7% at day 21) were transiently present, and no KLRG-1+ cells were observed (data not shown). This suggests that terminal differentiation of effector cells is taking place normally, and that exhaustion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is not a problem in this malaria infection, but the data show the memory cells remain in an activated state. Therefore, we investigated the pathway of differentiation that leads to this state.</p>

<title>Differentiation of malaria-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory subsets</title>
<p>As early (CD27<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>−</sup>) and late (CD27<sup>−</sup> CD62L<sup>−</sup>) effector memory cell subsets (TemE and TemL) have not previously been studied in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, we investigated the cytokine profiles and differentiation potential of each of the three subsets in this <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. Using TAPI-2, an inhibitor of the metalloproteases that cleave CD62L and TNFα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Jabbari1">[33]</xref>, we were able to perform intracellular cytokine staining on memory T cells at day 60 post-infection whilst maintaining expression of CD62L.

Interestingly, while Tcm and TemL subsets contained small populations of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells and few IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells; 52% (+/−4.1 SEM) of TemE cells made either IL-10 or IFN-γ, and 14% (+/−2.9 SEM) made both cytokines.

<p>In order to determine how the three memory T cell subsets relate to each other and to effector cells, and how they differentiate and survive in the face of constant exposure to infection, transfer experiments with the CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> memory cell subsets were undertaken. We could not magnetically sort Thy1.2+ Tg cells from the spleen at day 60 due to hemozoin, an insoluble iron-containing catabolite of hemoglobin that makes phagocytes magnetic. Therefore, to analyze memory T cell differentiation and protection <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated memory cells to test by infecting the B5 transgenic mouse. Interestingly, although 80% of the cells in this mouse are malaria-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Stephens1">[25]</xref>, a normal percentage of effector cells and memory cells was generated (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>). Therefore, purified Tcm (CD62L<sup>hi</sup>), TemE (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>), or TemL (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD27<sup>−</sup>) from B5 TCR Tg mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold> shows the FACS profiles of the sorted cells), were transferred into RAG° mice, that were then infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>. These experiments have not yet been done in the absence of infection to ascertain the effect of homeostatic proliferation in the RAG° recipients on the differentiation of memory T cells, however, as antigen-induced proliferation is faster, it is likely that it is the dominant pathway in chronic infection. The results showed that not many Tcm cells were present on day 38. Although some did survive and maintain their phenotype, they had largely differentiated into effector memory and effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>, Tcm); suggesting that Tcm have the intrinsic capacity to become TemE, TemL and Teff when stimulated to divide. By contrast, TemE had the capacity to expand and generate TemL and Teff cells but not Tcm; while TemL only generated more TemL and Teff cells. These data indicate that there is a linear differentiation pathway from central to early effector to late effector memory, in high-level chronic <italic>P.chabaudi</italic> infection (represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>), and that all subsets can generate Teff.</p>

<title>Removal of the chronic <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection by chloroquine treatment reduces protective capacity of memory T cells</title>
<p>We have shown previously that chronically infected C57Bl/6 mice are more resistant to a second infection with the homologous strain of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> than mice whose chronic infection had been eliminated with the anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Achtman1">[6]</xref>. This was also the case for <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infections in BALB/c mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s007">Figure S7A</xref></bold>). This suggests that memory B and T cells are affected by chronic infection in such a way that they are more effective when continually exposed to antigen.</p>
<p>To determine whether chronically stimulated memory T cells contribute to this enhanced protection, we assessed the ability of MSP1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to confer protection in adoptive transfer experiments into RAG° mice. As we found that the individual memory T cell subsets in chronically infected mice did not show differential protection, unfractionated Tg memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) from chronically infected or from previously infected and chloroquine-treated B5 transgenic mice, were transferred into RAG° mice together with immune B cells, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Stephens1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Langhorne1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>We first verified that chloroquine treatment had resulted in loss of the B5 antigen from the system, as well as eliminating the chronic infection as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Achtman1">[6]</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s007">Figure S7B</xref></bold>). CFSE-labelled MSP-1-specific Tg CD4 T cells were injected into chronically infected or infected and drug-cured mice at day 45 and 60 post-infection, and recovered and analyzed after 3 days. Cell division of the Tg cells, measured by CFSE levels, indicated whether the MSP1 peptide was still being presented. Indeed, in the chronically infected B5 mice, the B5 MSP1 peptide was still presented on antigen-presenting cells at 45 and 60 days of infection as detected by proliferation of CFSE-labelled MSP1-specific B5 Tg T cells. By contrast, much less proliferation was observed in the Tg T cells recovered from drug-cured mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001208.s007">Figure S7B</xref></bold>), suggesting that after removal of parasites there was insufficient residual MSP1 antigen to stimulate Tg T cells and that we could consider these memory cells as “resting”.</p>
<p>After adoptive transfer of chronically simulated or rested CD4 T cells into recipient mice, there were two clear major measurable effects of these cell transfers on parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>); a delay in appearance of early parasitemia, and a reduction in peak parasitemia. Mice receiving chronically stimulated memory T cells (−CQ) showed a delayed onset of parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>, left graph), showing that these cells were more effective in controlling early parasite growth. Consistent with this, chronically stimulated memory T cells also reduced peak parasitemia (p = 0.02) compared with resting cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>, right graph) or naïve cells (data not shown). Consistent with reduced parasitemia, mice receiving chronically stimulated cells exhibited less pathology than mice receiving rested memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>) and naïve cells (not shown). Thus chronically stimulated malaria-specific memory T cells show an enhanced early protective effect with reduced parasitemias and reduced pathology compared with rested memory T cells. Furthermore, chronically stimulated B5 memory T cells provided more effective help for a <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-specific antibody response than resting memory B5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). RAG° mice receiving chronically stimulated T cells also had higher levels of TNFα, IFN-γ and IL-10, in plasma at day 7 of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001208-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>), than those receiving rested T cells. These inflammatory cytokines may enhance parasite killing, while IL-10, may regulate their pathogenic effects, as has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Li1">[35]</xref>.</p>

<p>As we have shown that the more protective chronically stimulated memory T cells resulted in larger amounts of circulating cytokines upon adoptive transfer into RAG° mice than rested memory T cells, we investigated whether this was also the case in the chronic infection itself, which might explain the greater protective efficacy of the chronically stimulated T cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a real need to understand protective immune mechanisms in malaria in order to improve vaccination. Development of immunological memory to malaria infection develops over several exposures, and protection is short-lived in the absence of exposure to the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Langhorne2">[37]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and specifically CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory, which are of central importance in immunity to blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections, have been comparatively little investigated in infections <italic>in vivo</italic>, compared with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to the liver stages of malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Cockburn1">[38]</xref>, despite the fact that it is the blood stages and CD4<sup>+</sup> cells which cause disease.</p>
<p>Here, we have used a mouse model of malaria, <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>, to investigate whether <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory develops in a blood-stage infection. We show that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with phenotypic characteristics of memory cells are indeed generated within two months of an infection. They develop slowly, and the predominant memory cells are early effector memory cells, the majority of which are able to produce cytokines on short-term re-stimulation and to become effector cells on re-infection. Importantly, we showed that chronically stimulated memory T cells protect immunocompromised mice from infection better than rested memory cells.</p>
<p>There was a striking predominance of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> effector memory cells remaining after the acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection, which remained in a relatively activated state. Such cells have also been shown to predominate in the liver stages of malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Berenzon1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Krzych1">[39]</xref> and are present in humans protected against malaria by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoite challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Roestenberg1">[40]</xref> as well as in other chronic infections such as LCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Wherry1">[26]</xref>, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Bustamante1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Martin1">[14]</xref> <italic>T. muris</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Zaph2">[41]</xref>, gamma herpes virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Obar1">[42]</xref>, and human Hepatitis B and C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Urbani1">[43]</xref>, and in some cases are critically important in effector sites such as the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Roberts1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-JunqueiraKipnis1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Brown1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>The type of memory cells maintained may depend on persistence of specific or non-specific stimulation. Studies of CD8+ T cell memory in human viral infections have correlated memory phenotypes with the level of chronic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Harari1">[19]</xref>, and suggested that memory T cell differentiation progresses through a maturation process dependant on the level and duration of antigenic stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Romero1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Appay1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Fritsch1">[47]</xref>. Thus a linear pathway of differentiation (Tcm&gt;TemE&gt;TemL) has been proposed based on surface markers and the length of the telomeres in each subset; where low level chronic infections would lead to maintenance of early effector memory cells, but high levels would enhance late effector memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Appay1">[18]</xref>. Here we show conclusively that in chronic infection central memory CD4+ T cells can produce these other two subsets that are indeed related in a linear manner to one another as suggested by the human studies as well as effector T cells. It is likely that selection for high affinity clones and regulation of cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Foulds1">[48]</xref> occurs during this differentiation process.</p>
<p>Both Teff and Tem CD4 T cells can protect in various infectious disease models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Zaph1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Huster1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Hikono1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Zaph2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Cush1">[49]</xref>, and for CD8 T cells, in some cases, they are more potent than resting memory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Zaph2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Kapina1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Jabbari2">[51]</xref>. Although effector memory cells are likely to be more short-lived than central memory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Kaech1">[52]</xref>, there are other reports of long-term persistence of effector-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Ahmadzadeh1">[53]</xref>. From our studies it appears that CD4<sup>+</sup> Tem survive the acute infection, especially CD27<sup>+</sup> cells. This molecule, a member of TNFR family, has been shown to prolong the life of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Hendriks1">[54]</xref>. Extrapolating these findings to human <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections, it is possible that TemE may survive and protect for extended periods after an infection.</p>
<p>We compared memory CD4 T cells generated and maintained in chronic infection, with those that survived after drug-clearance of infection. We identified an increase in CD44<sup>hi</sup>IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> memory CD4 T cells after drug treatment. Although IL-7 can be utilized by memory T cells for survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Seddon1">[55]</xref>, the observation that in chronically infected mice there were more IL-7Rα<sup>−</sup> effector cells two months after infection suggests that a sub-population in infected mice may depend instead on antigen or infection for maintenance.</p>
<p>In an adoptive transfer and infection system, chronically stimulated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were more protective; they slowed parasite growth, reduced peak parasitemia and were associated with less pathology compared with resting memory cells obtained from infected and drug-cured mice. Despite the eventual higher antibody titers in mice receiving chronically stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, it is unlikely that antibody was the mechanism of parasite control, as at this early stage of infection anti-malaria antibodies were not detectable. However, the chronically stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contained more effector cells and a greater proportion of TNFα<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>−</sup> double-producing cells than resting memory cells. Furthermore, mice receiving the chronically stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had significantly greater plasma levels of IFN-γ, and TNFα, cytokines known to play a role in early parasite control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Stevenson1">[56]</xref>. Together, our data suggest that Th1 memory cells can control the acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> parasitemia. It will be important to determine which of the activated memory cell subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Romero1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Hikono1">[28]</xref> within the chronically activated T cell population containing the IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>TNFα<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>−</sup> cells are responsible for these anti-parasite effects. The lesser pathology observed in mice receiving chronically stimulated memory T cells compared with rested memory cells, may be the result of the lower parasitemia brought about through the effects of TNFα and IFN-γ, and to the increased levels of IL-10, a cytokine known to down-regulate pathology associated with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Li1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we have seen that the changes in a memory population on withdrawal of infectious stimuli for a month after infection, have subtle effects on the proportions of individual memory T cell subsets in the spleen in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> malaria, but nevertheless reduce the potential for Th1 cytokine production, and protection. Our data suggest that chronically stimulated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the most protective for controlling early parasitemia and pathology, as seen in <italic>Leishmania</italic> infections, another low-level chronic infection. However Tem may be short-lived, as they are not thought to be the main component of long-lived memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Scott1">[57]</xref>. This might explain why protective memory is lost in mice over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-FreitasdoRosario1">[5]</xref> and in humans who move away from endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Snow1">[3]</xref>, as previously activated cells revert to a resting state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Lanzavecchia1">[11]</xref>. A contribution of continually stimulated effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to parasite control and regulation of pathology are very much in line with observations that the best protection of humans in areas of endemic malaria is a certain level of continuous exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Gupta1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Langhorne2">[37]</xref>, and with the association of effector memory cells producing multiple cytokines observed in humans experimentally infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001208-Roestenberg1">[40]</xref>. This suggests that vaccination methods that enhance production, and survival of cells which maintain effector functions, may be the most successful in protection against severe malaria, although this must be balanced with the well-tuned production of regulatory cytokines.</p>
