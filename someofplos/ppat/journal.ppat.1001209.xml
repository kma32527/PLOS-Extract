<p>The fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a major cause of illness in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients. The ability of the fungus to acquire nutrients during proliferation in host tissue and the ability to elaborate a polysaccharide capsule are critical determinants of disease outcome. We previously showed that the GATA factor, Cir1, is a major regulator both of the iron uptake functions needed for growth in host tissue and the key virulence factors such as capsule, melanin and growth at 37°C. We are interested in further defining the mechanisms of iron acquisition from inorganic and host-derived iron sources with the goal of understanding the nutritional adaptation of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to the host environment. In this study, we investigated the roles of the <italic>HAP3</italic> and <italic>HAPX</italic> genes in iron utilization and virulence. As in other fungi, the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Hap proteins negatively influence the expression of genes encoding respiratory and TCA cycle functions under low-iron conditions. However, we also found that HapX plays both positive and negative roles in the regulation of gene expression, including a positive regulatory role in siderophore transporter expression. In addition, HapX also positively regulated the expression of the <italic>CIR1</italic> transcript. This situation is in contrast to the negative regulation by HapX of genes encoding GATA iron regulatory factors in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Although both <italic>hapX</italic> and <italic>hap3</italic> mutants were defective in heme utilization in culture, only HapX made a contribution to virulence, and loss of HapX in a strain lacking the high-affinity iron uptake system did not cause further attenuation of disease. Therefore, HapX appears to have a minimal role during infection of mammalian hosts and instead may be an important regulator of environmental iron uptake functions. Overall, these results indicated that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> employs multiple strategies for iron acquisition during infection.</p>

<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> causes life-threatening central nervous system infections in immunocompromised people such as AIDS patients. The competition for iron between pathogens such as <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and mammalian hosts is a key aspect of disease outcome. We previously identified and characterized the major iron regulatory protein Cir1 in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, as well as proteins for the transport of iron-binding molecules (siderophores) and for high-affinity iron uptake. In this study, we examined the roles of additional regulatory proteins (Hap proteins) in the response to low-iron conditions and the use of host iron sources such as heme and transferrin. We discovered that the HapX protein has a conserved regulatory function to repress iron-dependent functions during iron deprivation, as well as a positive regulatory role for the expression of putative siderophore transporters. A <italic>hapX</italic> mutant was defective in the use of heme as an iron source in culture but was only modestly attenuated for virulence in mice. This result suggests that additional mechanisms for iron uptake must be available to support <italic>C. neoformans</italic> proliferation in the host, and that HapX may play an important role in environmental iron acquisition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> causes life-threatening illness in immunocompromised individuals. For example, there are an estimated one million cases of cryptococcal meningitis globally per year in AIDS patients, leading to approximately 625,000 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Park1">[1]</xref>. A related species, <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic>, has emerged as a primary pathogen of immunocompetent people, as demonstrated by the ongoing occurrence of infections in otherwise healthy people and animals on the West Coast of North America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Bartlett1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Galanis1">[4]</xref>. These fungi share a set of virulence determinants that include the production of a polysaccharide capsule, the formation of melanin in the cell wall and the ability to grow at 37°C. The capsule makes a major contribution to virulence, and its size is influenced by iron and CO<sub>2</sub> levels, growth in serum, and host tissue location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Vartivarian1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Janbon1">[8]</xref>. The increase in capsule size in response to iron deprivation is likely to be important in the mammalian environment where iron withholding contributes to host defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Weinberg1">[9]</xref>. Melanin synthesis is also regulated by iron and additional factors such as glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Polacheck1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jacobson1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The influence of iron on capsule size in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has prompted efforts to define the mechanisms of iron sensing and uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Lian1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>. These mechanisms are likely to be important determinants of disease outcome because of the well-documented competition for iron between microbes and mammalian hosts during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Schaible1">[19]</xref>. Initially, the transcriptional response of the fungus to iron deprivation was characterized using serial analysis of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Lian1">[13]</xref>. This transcriptome study identified a set of iron-regulated genes, including the <italic>CAP60</italic> gene that is required for capsule formation, and revealed that defects in an iron-regulated iron permease and an abundant mannoprotein, Cig1, caused growth defects in low-iron medium. A mutation in <italic>CIG1</italic> also altered the regulation of capsule size in response to iron availability. Subsequent work on a siderophore transporter, Sit1, revealed a role in the use of siderophore-bound iron and growth in a low-iron environment, but not in virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Tangen1">[14]</xref>. In contrast, loss of the high-affinity iron uptake system comprised of the iron permease Cft1 and the ferroxidase Cfo1 resulted in mutants that were attenuated for virulence but still eventually caused disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>. This result suggests that other iron uptake mechanisms are in play during infection, even though Cft1 and Cfo1 are required for growth under low-iron conditions and for utilization of both inorganic iron and iron from transferrin in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>. The interconnections between iron and virulence in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> have recently been reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung2">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanisms governing the fungal response to iron deprivation have been best characterized in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Kaplan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Kosman1">[21]</xref>. In this fungus, iron starvation activates the transcriptional activators Aft1 and Aft2 to induce expression of iron regulon genes including those encoding uptake functions. Induced functions also include the RNA binding proteins Cth1 and Cth2 that mediate the degradation of mRNAs for some iron-dependent proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Puig1">[22]</xref>. In <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, GATA repressors (SreA and Fep1, respectively) and the regulatory subunits of the CCAAT-binding complex (HapX and Php4, respectively) control the expression of iron-dependent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>. For example, the Fep1 repressor in <italic>S. pombe</italic> prevents the expression of iron acquisition functions under iron-replete conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier3">[26]</xref>. In this situation, Fep1 represses the transcription of the <italic>php4+</italic> gene and prevents Php4 from negatively regulating the Php2/3/5 protein complex. This complex activates the transcription of genes for iron storage, the TCA cycle and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis when iron is available. These genes are normally repressed by the Php2/3/4/5 complex when insufficient iron is available to support enzyme function; in this condition, Fep1 does not block the transcription of <italic>php4</italic>+. This regulatory scheme has a similar functional outcome as the iron-responsive regulation of mRNA stability by Cth2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Puig1">[22]</xref>. Specifically, the transcription of genes encoding iron-requiring proteins is repressed upon iron deprivation thus allowing the cells to spare iron for essential functions. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, SreA plays a parallel role to that of Fep1 and HapX functions in a similar manner to Php4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, the GATA factor Cir1 is a major regulator of both the transcriptional response to iron and the expression of virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>. Cir1 shows sequence similarity to the regulators Fep1 and SreA but lacks one of the two zinc finger motifs found in these factors. Mutants defective in <italic>CIR1</italic> are transcriptionally unresponsive to iron deprivation and exhibit iron-related phenotypes. Transcriptional profiling of wild type and <italic>cir1Δ</italic> cells revealed that Cir1 plays both positive and negative regulatory roles for the majority of genes encoding iron uptake functions as well as genes for a large number of other functions (signal transduction, transcription, sterol biosynthesis, DNA replication and cell wall biosynthesis). For example, Cir1 positively regulates the expression of the genes <italic>CFT1</italic> and <italic>CFO1</italic> that encode the high affinity iron uptake system, and negatively regulates genes encoding candidates for intracellular iron transport (<italic>CFT2</italic>, <italic>CFO2</italic>) and the <italic>LAC1</italic> gene encoding laccase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, loss of Cir1 also altered the expression of all of the major virulence factors including loss of capsule formation, enhanced melanin deposition and poor growth at 37°C. Given these changes, it was not surprising a <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutant was completely avirulent in a mouse model of cryptococcosis. These findings demonstrate that the iron regulatory network is a critical aspect of pathogenesis in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to Cir1, transcription factors with demonstrated or potential roles in iron regulation include the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> ortholog of the pH–responsive factor <italic>RIM101</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Liu1">[28]</xref>, a <italic>HAPX</italic> ortholog identified by Hortschansky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref> and the <italic>HAP3</italic> and <italic>HAP5</italic> components of the CCAAT-binding complex that interacts with HapX in other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Olesen1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Johnson1">[30]</xref>. A number of other transcription regulators have been found to regulate subsets of genes encoding iron uptake functions in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> including Tup1, Nrg1 and Sre1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Lee1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Chun1">[34]</xref>. In this study, we examined the roles of the <italic>HAP</italic> genes in iron-related phenotypes, in the transcriptional response to different iron sources, and in virulence. We also examined the regulatory connections between Cir1, HapX and Rim101 at the transcriptional level. We found that HapX shares conserved regulatory functions with other fungi with regard to repression of iron-dependent functions during iron deprivation. However, we also discovered that HapX has a positive regulatory role for <italic>CIR1</italic> and for a subset of genes that encode putative siderophore transporters. A mutant defective in HapX did not show virulence-related phenotypes in culture, but was modestly attenuated for virulence in mice. In contrast, Hap3, as a representative of the CCAAT-binding complex, showed virulence-related phenotypes in culture, but did not contribute to virulence. Surprisingly, deletion of <italic>HAP3</italic> or <italic>HAPX</italic> in the background of a <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutant did not cause further attenuation of virulence relative to the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutant alone. This result suggests that additional mechanisms for iron acquisition must be available to support <italic>C. neoformans</italic> proliferation in the host environment.</p>

<title>Defects in the <italic>HAP3</italic>, <italic>HAP5</italic> and <italic>HAPX</italic> genes attenuate growth on hemin</title>
<p>The <italic>HAP</italic> genes were initially examined with mutants in the deletion collection constructed by Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Liu1">[28]</xref> to investigate their roles in the regulation of iron acquisition. The deletion collection contained mutants for two genes related to <italic>HAP3</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (designated <italic>HAP3-1</italic> and <italic>HAP3-2</italic>), mutants for <italic>HAP5</italic> and <italic>HAPX</italic>, as well as a strain with a defect in a putative <italic>HAP1</italic> gene. The growth of these strains on solid media containing different iron sources initially revealed that three mutants (<italic>hap3-1Δ</italic>, <italic>hap5Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic>) had poor growth on hemin (the ferric iron version of heme) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We subsequently reconstructed the mutants for the <italic>HAP3</italic>, <italic>HAP5</italic> and <italic>HAPX</italic> genes singly and in combination with the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> (ferroxidase) mutation in the background of the serotype A strain H99. This strain has been used to characterize iron uptake because of its high virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Tangen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the wild type (WT) and the reconstructed mutant strains all had weak growth on low-iron medium, with especially poor growth observed for the <italic>hapXΔ</italic>, <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> and double mutants. Growth was restored for all of the strains upon addition of the siderophore feroxamine; however, ferric chloride allowed growth of all of the single mutants but not the double mutants lacking the <italic>HAP</italic> genes and <italic>CFO1</italic>. The <italic>hap3Δ</italic>, <italic>hap5Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants each showed weaker growth on medium with hemin as the sole iron source, and complementation with the corresponding genes restored growth to the WT level. Similarly, the double mutants all failed to grow on hemin. The poor growth of the mutants with hemin was further confirmed with assays in liquid media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The sequence alignments, deletion constructs and confirmation of the mutant genotypes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s004">S4</xref>. Taken together, these results indicated that Hap3, Hap5 and HapX all contribute to iron utilization from hemin (e.g., by regulating uptake and/or processing functions); this finding prompted a further examination of the impact of <italic>hap</italic> mutations on iron-related transcription and virulence.</p>

<title>HapX plays a greater role than Cir1 and Hap3 in the transcriptional response to inorganic and mammalian iron sources</title>
<p>The influence of the <italic>hapXΔ</italic>, <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutations on transcription was examined by microarray analysis of RNA from cells incubated in low-iron media alone or in the presence of ferric chloride, hemin or transferrin. As described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, three biological replicates of iron-starved cells were prepared for each strain and the cells were grown for 6 h in each iron condition prior to RNA extraction. The time point of 6 h is just before the initiation of growth in each of the iron sources, although the mutants failed to grow in low-iron medium and medium with transferrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s002">Figure S2</xref>). For the microarray experiments, cDNA synthesized from the total RNA was hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays initially designed for genes in the serotype D strain JEC21 and updated to include genes for the strain H99 employed in our experiments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In total, the hybridization signals for 6165 oligonucleotides that matched H99 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s006">Table S1</xref>) were evaluated.</p>
<p>Initially, we examined the global changes in transcription for each mutant in comparison with the WT strain in each iron source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This analysis revealed that the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutation had the greatest influence, with 1131 genes down-regulated and 910 up-regulated upon comparison with WT under low-iron conditions. By contrast, Hap3 made a much smaller contribution with 83 genes down-regulated and 230 up-regulated under the same conditions. The <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutant had an intermediate influence with 419 and 402 genes down- and up-regulated, respectively. The latter numbers are consistent with our previous analysis of the influence of Cir1 on transcription in a serotype D strain of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>. Overall, the same global pattern of influence was observed with the cells grown with the three iron sources, although the numbers of genes influenced by the mutations were lower by 30 to 50% compared with the differential expression seen under low-iron conditions. Also, these results indicated that HapX plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression under low-iron conditions. Venn diagrams displaying the overlapping numbers of genes for each mutation and each iron condition are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s005">Figure S5</xref>.

<title>HapX negatively regulates functions for electron transport and positively regulates genes encoding siderophore transporters in response to low-iron conditions</title>
<p>We next examined the Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the microarray data to identify the enriched functions among the differentially expressed genes in each mutant and comparison. As described in our previous analysis of Cir1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>, we employed the data mining tool ermineJ to identify the GO terms listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Pavlidis1">[35]</xref>. Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s011">Tables S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s012">S7</xref> list the GO terms and the genes in each GO term, along with their <italic>p</italic> values, respectively. The top GO terms for the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant versus WT under low-iron conditions were ATP synthesis-coupled electron transport (two categories, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t001">Table 1</xref>) followed by siderophore transport, karyogamy during conjugation with cellular fusion (mainly tubulin genes), and mitochondrial electron transport. Further analysis of the GO terms for mutant versus WT indicated that HapX does not show differentially expressed genes in inorganic iron- or hemin-replete conditions (except in specific categories other than direct iron uptake functions, such as karyogamy, serine family amino acid catabolism, retrograde transport and RNA polymerase III transcription). Thus, it appeared that HapX primarily influences differential gene expression under low-iron conditions and to a lesser extent with transferrin. The lower response to transferrin as an iron source may reflect the timing of the analysis in that the cells may take longer to respond to this iron source compared to ferric chloride or hemin. The influence of HapX under low-iron conditions served to focus attention on a specific subset of iron regulon genes related to siderophore transport (and iron ion transport to a lesser extent) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t002">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, genes in the category “high-affinity iron ion transport” were not influenced by loss of HapX. This result suggests that, in contrast to the more global influence of Cir1 (see below), the influence of HapX on the expression of iron uptake functions may be restricted to the subset of genes needed for siderophore uptake. The differential transcript levels for a subset of the genes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t002">2</xref> were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown).</p>

<title>Enriched GO terms for differentially-regulated genes in the mutants and WT strain in response to different iron sources.</title>
<p>The figure shows the GO terms identified by Gene Score Re-sampling with the microarray data mining tool ermineJ for differentially expressed genes in the mutants versus WT in response to different iron sources. The terms are also shown for WT in iron-replete versus iron-limited conditions. For each comparison, GO terms with statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) are indicated by colored boxes. The numbers within the colored boxes represent the GO term rankings within each comparison. Two GO terms (indicated by asterisk) from the ermineJ annotation file are updated on the GO website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link>): GO:0042775 is described as mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport and GO:0006118 has been made obsolete and replaced by GO:0055114 oxidation reduction.</p>

<title>Hap3 negatively regulates genes for electron transport but has a minimal influence on the expression of iron uptake functions</title>
<p>The top ranked GO terms for the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> mutant versus WT under low-iron conditions were ATP synthesis-coupled electron transport (two categories) followed by electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial electron transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Several of these GO terms overlapped those observed with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutation under low-iron conditions, and this suggests that these factors may function together in the regulation of specific categories of genes. For example, both Hap3 and HapX negatively influenced the expression of electron transport functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is therefore possible that HapX works with Hap3 and the other CCAAT-binding complex proteins to repress iron-dependent functions under low-iron conditions, as seen in other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s007">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s008">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s009">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s010">S5</xref> provide the lists of the specific genes that are differentially regulated in each of the iron conditions. The overlap in GO terms for the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> and <italic>hap3Δ</italic> mutants was not seen for iron-replete conditions with inorganic iron or hemin, but the pattern was observed with transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As mentioned above, this result may reflect experimental conditions in that this iron source may not be used as readily or at the same rate as other iron sources. Alternatively, there may be a separate regulatory program for transferrin utilization. Loss of Hap3 had a minimal influence on the transcription of the genes for iron transport (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t002">Table 2</xref>), thus highlighting a regulatory difference compared to HapX. As mentioned above, the GO terms for iron transport influenced by HapX but not Hap3 represent positive regulatory influences of HapX primarily on siderophore transporters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t002">Table 2</xref>). It is also interesting to note that loss of Hap3 resulted in only 28 differentially expressed genes upon comparison with WT grown on hemin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, no enriched GO terms were found for the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> mutant in this comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, it appears that Hap3 plays a less prominent role than HapX in the transcriptional response of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to different iron sources, and that the majority of the Hap3 influence is on electron transport functions, as is found in other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>.</p>

<title>Cir1 and HapX regulate overlapping subsets of genes encoding iron transport functions</title>
<p>The top GO terms for the <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutant versus WT under low-iron conditions were siderophore transport, high-affinity iron ion transport, iron ion transport, processing of 20S pre-RNA, and rRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The inclusion of the <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutant in the analysis allowed a comparison of overlapping regulatory activities for the Hap transcription factors and Cir1. We were particularly keen to determine whether Cir1 and HapX co-regulated specific genes for iron acquisition functions. As described above, HapX has the negative regulatory function to control iron-dependent functions (e.g., electron transport) during iron deprivation. However, it also has a positive activity for the expression of iron regulon genes for siderophore transport. The examination of the GO terms for differentially expressed genes of HapX and Cir1 revealed that the only shared categories were iron ion transport and siderophore transport under low-iron conditions. No other shared categories were identified under any of the iron-replete conditions. In addition, there was no overlap in the GO terms regulated by Cir1 and Hap3. Thus, it appears that HapX and Cir1 may partner in the regulation of genes for iron acquisition related to siderophore transport (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001209-t002">Table 2</xref>). For example, both HapX and Cir1 positively regulated the transcript level of the <italic>SIT1</italic> gene that was previously shown to function in siderophore transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Tangen1">[14]</xref>. In addition, Cir1 regulates genes of relevance for virulence that are not regulated by HapX or Hap3 and a clear example is the <italic>LAC1</italic> gene encoding the laccase for melanin formation.</p>

<title>HapX positively regulates <italic>CIR1</italic> and <italic>RIM101</italic> transcript levels</title>
<p>To further explore the relationship between <italic>HAPX</italic> and <italic>CIR1</italic>, the microarray data were examined for the expression patterns of these genes in each mutant background. In addition, we included <italic>RIM101</italic>, a gene encoding a pH-responsive transcription factor, because O'Meara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref> recently reported an influence of Rim101 on the expression of iron uptake genes. Several of these genes were included in the GO terms that we observed to be regulated by Cir1 (high-affinity iron ion transport, iron ion transport and siderophore transport) and HapX (iron ion transport and siderophore transport). For example, Rim101 positively regulated the transcript levels of several siderophore transporter genes including <italic>SIT1</italic>, as well as the <italic>CFT1</italic> gene encoding the iron permease that is required for full virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Tangen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>. We initially focused on the low-iron condition for this analysis and found that Cir1 had a minor influence on the transcript level for <italic>HAPX</italic> in this situation. This observation agreed with previous microarray analysis of the <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutant in a serotype D strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, Cir1 had a positive influence on the <italic>RIM101</italic> transcript with a 6.4-fold higher level in the WT strain compared with the <italic>cir1Δ</italic> mutant. We also found that HapX positively influenced levels of both the <italic>CIR1</italic> transcript (3.5-fold) and the <italic>RIM101</italic> transcript (2.0-fold) under low-iron conditions. Under iron-replete conditions, Cir1 positively regulated <italic>RIM101</italic> (4.0-fold) but did not significantly influence the expression of <italic>HAPX</italic>. Under this condition, HapX showed no regulation of <italic>RIM101</italic> and only a small positive influence on <italic>CIR1</italic> transcript levels (1.3-fold), that was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Overall, the microarray data therefore indicated interconnected levels of regulation for the three transcription factors. To confirm the relationships between the transcription factors, we employed quantitative RT-PCR with RNA prepared from the <italic>cir1Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants grown under low-iron and iron-replete conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the quantitative RT-PCR analysis supports the conclusion that HapX has a positive regulatory influence on the transcript levels of both <italic>CIR1</italic> and <italic>RIM101</italic>. We also noticed that a larger influence of HapX on the <italic>CIR1</italic> transcript was found under the iron-replete condition by quantitative RT-PCR. This may reflect the greater sensitivity of this method relative to microarray analysis. We should also note that O'Meara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref> performed a microarray comparison of the <italic>rim101</italic> mutant with the WT parental strain and found that Rim101 positively influences the expression of <italic>HAPX</italic> (4.8-fold).</p>

<title>Hap3 and Hap5 influence capsule size, growth at host temperature and utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources</title>
<p>We next examined the <italic>hap3Δ</italic>, <italic>hap5Δ</italic>, and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants, and the double mutants lacking the <italic>HAP</italic> genes and <italic>CFO1</italic>, for expression of the three major virulence factors: capsule, melanin, and growth at 37°C.

<p>With regard to growth at host temperature, we made the surprising observation that the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants (with or without the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutation) showed more robust growth at 37°C than the WT or the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, addition of hemin enhanced the growth of the other strains suggesting an unexpected interplay between this iron source and temperature. We previously observed enhanced growth in response to hemin for the <italic>C. neoformans cfo1Δ</italic> mutant (defective in the ferroxidase for high-affinity iron uptake) upon exposure to the antifungal drug fluconazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>. Presumably, this phenomenon is due to the requirement of enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway for heme and connections between iron availability and heme biosynthesis. As part of our microarray analysis, we found that Hap3 and HapX did regulate the expression of the genes encoding ergosterol and heme biosynthetic functions under low-iron conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s013">Tables S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s014">S9</xref>).</p>

<p>We also examined the carbon source requirements for the <italic>hap</italic> mutants because it is known that the <italic>HAP</italic> genes in other fungi regulate growth on non-fermentable carbon sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Olesen1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Johnson1">[30]</xref>. The <italic>C. neoformans</italic> mutants were tested for growth on glucose, sucrose, acetate and ethanol, and it was found that the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants showed weaker growth on the latter three carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Unexpectedly, the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant did not show these growth phenotypes even though the transcriptional profiling suggested that HapX and Hap3 both participate in the regulation of genes needed for respiratory growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It is possible that the growth differences between the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants reflect differential influences on the expression of respiratory functions under the iron-replete conditions in the media. The addition of hemin did not rescue the growth defects of the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants suggesting that lack of this iron source is not responsible for the observed phenotypes on acetate and ethanol (data not shown). Overall, these analyses provided several examples of distinct phenotypes for the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant relative to the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants. In a further example, we noted that the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants were more sensitive to growth in the presence of 0.01% SDS, compared with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant and the WT strain (data not shown). As described below, the distinct behavior of the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant extends to virulence.</p>

<title>Loss of HapX results in a modest virulence defect</title>
<p>The small capsule phenotype of the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> mutant, and the growth defects of the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants on hemin as the sole iron source (particularly when combined with the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutation), prompted an investigation of the virulence of these mutants in a mouse inhalation model of cryptococcosis. We therefore inoculated mice with the WT strain, the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutant and the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> or <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants. We also included the complemented mutants and the <italic>hap3Δ cfo1Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ cfo1Δ</italic> double mutants. The rationale for including <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> in the analysis came from previous observations that loss of the Cfo1 ferroxidase or the iron permease Cft1 resulted in attenuated virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>.

We reasoned that loss of Cfo1 and the Hap proteins might interfere with the utilization of both transferrin and hemin, and further attenuate virulence beyond that observed for the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutant alone. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, deletion of <italic>HAP3</italic> did not result in a virulence defect despite the growth defect on hemin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and the small capsule size observed in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Also, the double mutant, <italic>hap3Δ cfo1Δ</italic>, showed a delayed virulence phenotype similar to that of the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> single mutant thus indicating no additive influence.</p>

<p>In contrast to the situation with the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> mutant, the infection of mice with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant revealed a modest attenuation of virulence manifested by a prolonged survival period of 3–5 days compared with infection with the WT strain (<italic>p</italic> = 0.033; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In this case, reintroduction of the <italic>HAPX</italic> gene resulted in a WT level of virulence compared with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). As with the <italic>hap3Δ cfo1Δ</italic> double mutant, the <italic>hapXΔ cfo1Δ</italic> double mutant also showed attenuated virulence in comparison with the WT strain but not when compared with the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> single mutant. The results for the double mutants indicated that the inability to use hemin as a sole iron source <italic>in vitro</italic> did not translate into a defect in iron acquisition in mice that would attenuate virulence. This result suggests that one or more additional iron acquisition systems, beyond Cfo1 and those influenced by Hap3 and HapX, must function during infection.</p>

<title>Evidence for an additional iron uptake system under acidic conditions</title>
<p>Possibilities for additional iron uptake mechanisms include low-affinity or ferrous iron-specific systems that may respond to iron mobilized by reduced pH during infection. A reduction in pH increases iron availability and acidic metabolites such as acetate are known to accumulate during cryptococcal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Wright1">[36]</xref>. In addition, a low-affinity uptake system for inorganic iron was previously identified in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> by physiological experiments, and intracellular residence of fungal cells in the acidic phagolysosomal compartment may also influence iron availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jacobson2">[37]</xref>. We tested the possibility of an additional uptake function by reexamining the growth of the <italic>hap</italic> mutants alone or in combination with the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutation on medium at reduced pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001209-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The plate assays revealed that a reduction in pH to 5.0 rescued the growth of the double mutants on both ferric chloride and hemin in support of the idea that iron availability is enhanced under acidic conditions to allow uptake via an alternative mechanism(s). The results also suggest that the cells require Hap functions to utilize both iron sources in the situation where the loss of Cfo1 activity causes a defect in the high-affinity, reductive iron uptake pathway.</p>

<title>The roles of Hap3, 5 and X in hemin utilization and virulence</title>
<p>Our goal is to understand the mechanisms of iron sensing and acquisition employed by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in the environment and in iron-deprived niches of mammalian hosts. This information may enable new therapeutic approaches to reduce the substantial global burden of cryptococcosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Park1">[1]</xref>. Previously, we demonstrated that the GATA factor Cir1 is a major regulator of both iron acquisition and virulence in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>. In this study, we examined the roles of additional regulatory proteins of the CCAAT-binding complex (Hap3 and Hap5) and HapX to further investigate the response to iron deprivation. These proteins are important in the response to low-iron in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, and we hypothesized that they would play a similar role and contribute to virulence in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>. Indeed, we found that the <italic>hap3Δ</italic>, <italic>hap5Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants had defects in hemin utilization and, when combined with a mutation in the ferroxidase gene <italic>CFO1</italic>, were defective for the use of ferric chloride and hemin in culture at neutral pH.</p>
<p>The poor growth of the <italic>hap</italic> mutants on hemin as the sole iron source may be due to expression defects in specific hemin uptake and/or processing functions, or in interacting metabolic processes. In the latter case, we noted both the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants had reduced transcript levels for ergosterol biosynthesis enzymes when grown in low-iron medium. A complex interaction between heme and ergosterol biosythesis/uptake has been described in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Gachotte1">[38]</xref>. Specifically, heme is a co-factor for some ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes and mutations in genes for heme biosynthesis (i.e., <italic>HEM3</italic> and <italic>HEM4</italic>) contribute to suppression of the sterol auxotrophy seen in <italic>erg25</italic> mutants. The <italic>hem3</italic> and <italic>hem4</italic> mutations allow yeast to take up exogenous sterols under aerobic conditions. We speculate that a similar interplay between heme and ergosterol biosynthesis may occur in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, although additional explanations are possible given that Hap3 and HapX regulate other heme-dependent functions including electron transport. Interestingly, the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants were more tolerant of fluconazole on iron-rich medium, but not on low-iron medium, compared with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant (data not shown). This result is consistent with an interaction between iron metabolism and fluconazole inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. We previously found that a defect in iron uptake due to a <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutation caused an increased sensitivity to fluconazole that could be remediated by exogenous heme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung4">[18]</xref>. However, in the case of the <italic>hap</italic> mutants, the results presented here suggest more complex interactions between growth temperature, heme, and ergosterol biosynthesis that require further investigation.</p>
<p>The <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants (but not the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant) displayed a smaller polysaccharide capsule that is a major virulence factor, as well as an interesting phenotype of better growth at 37°C, when compared with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant or the WT strain. The growth phenotype may reflect a derepression of functions to deal with stressful conditions such as elevated temperature. In support of this idea, it has been shown that the CCAAT-binding complex coordinates the response to oxidative stress in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Thn1">[39]</xref>. We also found that hemin improved the growth of all strains at 37°C. This observation is intriguing, and may indicate that hemin acts both as an iron source and as a signal to influence the response to elevated temperature and other stresses. Overall, this analysis of <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hap5Δ</italic> mutants revealed a new aspect of the response to heme in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and additional work is clearly needed to examine the role of heme in the context of adaptation to host temperature.</p>
<p>Despite a reduced capsule size, the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> mutant did not show a virulence defect when compared with the WT strain. In contrast, the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant showed a modest virulence defect with a delay in mortality of 3–5 days relative to WT. Previously, we observed that the <italic>cft1Δ</italic> and <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> mutants, with defects in the high-affinity, reductive iron uptake system, were still able to cause disease in mice, although at an attenuated level. We hypothesized that these mutants were likely to be defective for transferrin use <italic>in vivo</italic> (based on their phenotypes in culture), but their ability to grow and eventually cause disease in mice might result from heme utilization. In this context, we anticipated that examining the virulence of <italic>hap3Δ cfo1Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ cfo1Δ</italic> double mutants would provide further insights because these mutants were unable to utilize ferric chloride or hemin as the sole iron sources <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although the mutants were attenuated for virulence relative to the WT strain, they showed equivalent virulence to the <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> single mutant and an additive contribution of the mutations was not observed. It is possible that heme utilization is not required for virulence in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, that the mutants are only partially debilitated for hemin use or that there are mechanisms other than heme utilization that explain the disease seen in mice infected with the <italic>cft1Δ</italic> or <italic>cfo1Δ</italic> single mutants. We favor the explanation that there are redundant iron acquisition and heme utilization mechanisms, and that some of these may be uniquely expressed when the fungus is in the host environment. In addition, the defect in growth on hemin as a sole iron source might arise from interactions between heme and ergosterol biosynthesis, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Candidate alternate pathways for iron acquisition could include the low-affinity iron uptake system identified by Jacobson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jacobson2">[37]</xref> as well as novel heme acquisitions systems involving extracellular hemophores such as those identified in bacterial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Cescau1">[40]</xref>. It is also likely that there are differences between growth on solid and liquid medium, and host tissue, that influence iron acquisition. One <italic>in vivo</italic> condition that is particularly relevant is the pH arising from pathogen metabolism at sites of infection or in localized host niches such as the phagolysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Wright1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Friedman1">[41]</xref>. Under the acidic condition, the ferrous form of iron would be predominant, which may bypass reductive iron uptake systems and may be transported by some other uptake pathway, or even non-specifically. Indeed, we found that acidification of the growth medium rescued the growth of the <italic>hap3Δ cfo1Δ</italic>, <italic>hap5Δ cfo1Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ cfo1Δ</italic> double mutants on ferric chloride and hemin.</p>

<title>The influence of Hap3 and HapX on transcription in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and other fungi</title>
<p>Our microarray experiments further characterized the roles of the Hap3 and HapX proteins in the response to low-iron conditions and different iron sources. This work revealed that HapX influenced the transcript levels of 2041 genes in response to iron deprivation, and that Hap3 had a much more limited role (313 genes). The differentially expressed genes in the <italic>hap3Δ</italic> and <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutants mainly overlapped in functions related to ATP synthesis-coupled electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial electron transport. The regulation of iron-dependent functions such as TCA cycle and respiration components during iron limitation appears to be a conserved function of HapX and related orthologs in other fungi. For example, microarray analysis in <italic>S. pombe</italic> revealed that the HapX ortholog Php4 regulated the expression of 86 genes in response to iron starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>. Specifically, Php4 was found to negatively regulate the transcription of iron-dependent functions under low-iron conditions. One of these genes encoded the iron repressor Fep1 and others encoded iron-requiring functions for the TCA cycle, the electron transport chain, amino acid biosynthesis and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. In addition, Php4 mediated down-regulation of genes for the response to oxidative stress. These results indicate a primarily negative regulatory role for Php4, although it is possible that examination of Php4 function under other conditions may reveal positive regulatory contributions. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, HapX and the CCAAT-binding complex also repress the expression of genes encoding proteins in iron-dependent pathways and in heme biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>. However, the proteome analysis of Hortschansky et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref> additionally revealed that loss of HapX results in lower levels of proteins with a variety of other functions, including metabolic and proteolytic enzymes. From our microarray data, it appears that the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> HapX protein has a similar negative regulatory influence on iron-dependent pathways (e.g., cytochromes) as Php4 and HapX in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. However, we also found that the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> protein has a positive influence on gene expression including siderophore transport functions. Overall, further comparative studies are needed to investigate the sets of genes that are positively regulated by the HapX proteins in the different fungi.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>HapX and Cir1 have shared and distinct influences on iron uptake functions</title>
<p>The microarray data revealed that HapX and Cir1 shared GO terms for iron ion transport and siderophore transport under low-iron conditions, and that HapX makes little contribution to the regulation of genes for high-affinity iron uptake (i.e., <italic>CFT1</italic> and <italic>CFO1</italic>). No other shared GO categories for HapX and Cir1 were identified under any of the iron-replete conditions. Thus, HapX and Cir1 may partner in the regulation of genes for iron acquisition related to siderophore transport. It is thought that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> does not make its own siderophores and instead employs transporters to steal siderophores from other microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Tangen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jacobson2">[37]</xref>. Dissecting the roles of the siderophore transporters in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> will be challenging given that there are at least seven candidate genes and the corresponding proteins may have overlapping transport specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Kosman1">[21]</xref>. Further studies of the siderophore utilization by the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant may shed light on uptake and provide support for or against the emerging view that HapX regulation of iron uptake functions may primarily be important during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> growth in the environment rather than in mammalian hosts. This idea is consistent with the modest attenuation of virulence seen with the <italic>hapXΔ</italic> mutant; the partial contribution to disease may result from positive and/or negative regulatory influences of HapX on other genes, coupled with possible redundancy with Cir1 and other regulators. Certainly, it is likely that Cir1 and other regulators participate in adapting iron-related metabolism to the host environment.</p>
<p>The absence of a role for siderophore transport in the virulence of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> would be consistent with observations in the fungal pathogen <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Tangen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Schrettl1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hissen1">[43]</xref>. This fungus relies on siderophore production and uptake to acquire iron and cause disease in a mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Schrettl1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hissen1">[43]</xref>. Reductive iron uptake is not required for virulence, in contrast to the situation in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung3">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Schrettl1">[42]</xref>. The iron-regulatory GATA transcription factor SreA, which has sequence similarity to Cir1, regulates the expression of genes for siderophore biosynthesis but, interestingly, loss of SreA does not attenuate virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Schrettl2">[44]</xref>. This result suggest that other regulatory mechanisms, perhaps including a response to iron deprivation mediated by a HapX ortholog, may contribute to siderophore biosynthesis during infection.</p>

<title>An emerging iron regulatory network for host and environmental iron acquisition</title>
<p>Previous work on the major iron regulator Cir1 revealed that the protein influences the expression of a large number of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref>. In addition, several groups have identified other transcriptional regulators (e.g., Nrg1, Sre1, Tup1, and Rim101) that influence the expression of iron uptake genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Lee1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Chun1">[34]</xref>. Interactions between Cir1 and other factors likely comprise a regulatory network to control iron acquisition during cryptococcal growth in the environment and in the host. In addition, Cir1 and these transcriptional regulators may regulate one another to fine tune the expression of key iron uptake functions. Our microarray data and follow up quantitative RT-PCR studies support this view because HapX positively regulates <italic>CIR1</italic> transcript levels under low-iron conditions. Given the possibility that HapX plays a role in environmental iron acquisition via siderophore transport, we propose that the different transcription factors function in an interconnected iron regulatory network to regulate specific iron uptake functions. Thus, we hypothesize that HapX would regulate functions for environmental iron uptake and Cir1 would control these functions in partnership with HapX; Cir1 would additionally regulate functions for iron acquisition in the host environment. Rim101 is a likely additional partner because O'Meara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref> found that this factor regulates the expression of numerous iron uptake functions in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> including those expected to play roles in the environment (siderophore transporters) and those that function in the host (e.g., high-affinity iron uptake). Rim101 may also participate in the pH response and therefore have a more general role in iron acquisition, along with Cir1. Interestingly, O'Meara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref> and Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Liu1">[28]</xref> did not find a virulence defect for the <italic>rim101</italic> mutant and the protein may therefore primarily influence environmental iron acquisition. As additional regulatory connections are evaluated, it may be possible to include other regulators that influence iron uptake functions in the model. In particular, the sterol regulatory factor, Sre1, that mediates the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> response to hypoxia, may make a contribution during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Chang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Chun1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>HapX in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has a novel positive influence on iron regulation</title>
<p>We found that HapX positively regulates the transcript level of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> GATA factor Cir1 under low and high iron conditions, and that Cir1 has little influence on the transcript levels of <italic>HAPX</italic>. These results are strikingly different from the negative regulatory feedback relationships found for the corresponding HapX-related proteins and GATA-type iron regulatory proteins in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>. For example, HapX represses the expression of <italic>sreA</italic> under the low-iron condition and binds with the CCAAT-binding complex proteins to the <italic>sreA</italic> promoter in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>. Similarly, SreA binds to a GATA element in the promoter of the <italic>hapX</italic> gene and deletion of <italic>sreA</italic> results in elevated <italic>hapX</italic> transcripts under iron-replete conditions. The coupled relationship is further reinforced by the observation that an <italic>sreA hapX</italic> double mutant is synthetically lethal. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Php4 (the HapX ortholog) negatively regulates the transcript level of the GATA iron-responsive repressor <italic>fep1+</italic> under low-iron conditions and, as in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, the reciprocal repression of <italic>php4+</italic> transcription by Fep1 under iron-replete conditions is also seen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier3">[26]</xref>. Finally, in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Lan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Lan1">[45]</xref> found that the transcript for the <italic>HAPX</italic> ortholog, <italic>HAP43</italic>, is elevated upon iron starvation, and it is repressed by the GATA factor Sfu1 under iron-replete conditions. Overall, our results highlight a major difference between the role of HapX in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> compared with its role in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>. That is, HapX in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has a positive regulatory influence on Cir1, compared with the negative influence of the corresponding proteins on the GATA factor genes <italic>sreA</italic> and <italic>fep1+</italic> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, respectively. In addition, we note that HapX in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has both positive and negative regulatory roles. So far, there is evidence from proteome studies that HapX in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> may also have positive and negative regulatory influences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Hortschansky1">[24]</xref>. For <italic>S. pombe</italic>, transcriptional profiling of the <italic>php4Δ</italic> mutant under low iron conditions indicates a primarily negative regulatory role for the expression of genes encoding iron-requiring proteins, although this does rule out potential positive role in the expression of other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Mercier2">[25]</xref>. A recent analysis of HapX in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> also revealed both positive and negative regulatory influences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Schrettl3">[46]</xref>. Interestingly, this study also identified a role for HapX in virulence, a finding consistent with the positive role of HapX in siderophore production.

The insights reported here into the role of HapX in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, when combined with our analysis of Cir1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Jung1">[15]</xref> and the recent work on Rim101 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-OMeara1">[27]</xref>, emphasize the complexities of iron regulation and uptake mechanisms in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and reveal differences in regulatory strategies between fungi.</p>

<p>Because the gene lists of microarray probes were originally designed for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>neoformans</italic> JEC21, they were modified for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> H99 as described below. First, a list of 70-mer probes designed from JEC21 cDNA sequences were matched against the H99 transcriptome (using blastN algorithm in stand alone mode). Only the highest scoring hit was considered for each query sequence. Blast results were then further filtered to include only those hits that matched 67 or more nucleotides of the 70-mer probe (95.6% oligonucleotides matching). This is a conservative application of stringency criteria given the 85–90% genome sequence similarity between serotype D strain JEC21 and serotype A strain H99. An intermediate level of match stringency was selected to allow for detection of transcripts using probes from a heterologous serotype. Using the 67/70 cut-off, we obtain 4523 (4348 unique) matching H99 genes. A list of 70-mer probes designed from H99 cDNA sequences was then blasted (blastN algorithm) against the H99 transcriptome to identify matching transcripts. Again, only the highest scoring hit was considered for each query sequence. Blast results were further filtered to include only those hits with 100% matching oligonucleotides (70/70). This yielded 2485 (2447 unique) H99 genes. A comparison of the lists of H99 hits obtained from the blasts of the heterologous (JEC21) and homologous probe sequences indicated 630 genes in common. This method identified a total of 6165 matching H99 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001209.s006">Table S1</xref>). Inclusion of mitochondrial transcripts in the H99 transcriptome database only identified one additional gene - CNAG_9009 (cytochrome c-oxidase) in the BLAST (69/70 match, e-value = 2e-31).</p>

<title>Microarray hybridization, statistical analysis and data mining</title>
<p>The following experimental design was adopted for the study: within each strain, each treatment pair (low-iron control (C) versus ferric chloride (F), transferrin (T) or hemin (H); six pairs) were hybridized to an array; and within each treatment, each strain comparison (WT versus <italic>hap3Δ</italic> (H3), <italic>hapXΔ</italic> (HX) or <italic>cir1Δ</italic> (C1), 6 pairs) was hybridized to an array for a total of 48 microarrays. Each strain/treatment combination was labeled an equal number of times with Cy3 and Cy5 to ensure dye balance. After hybridization, each array was scanned using the Perkin Elmer Scan Array Express. Each channel was background corrected by subtracting the lowest 10% of foreground signal intensities within each subgrid of the array. The two channels of each array were normalized to each other by Huber's variance stabilization algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Huber1">[52]</xref>. A linear mixed effects model was applied to the normalized data in each channel. A fixed effect was included for each array, for the dye by gene interaction and for each treatment/strain combination. Random effects were included for within-array variability (each gene appeared twice on each array), technical variability (replicate culture was hybridized twice) and biological variability (48 replicate cultures were employed). The pairwise changes between treatments within strain and the pairwise changes between strains within treatment were estimated with standard errors and <italic>p</italic>-values based Student <italic>t</italic> statistics; <italic>q</italic>-values were computed to adjust for the false discovery rate.</p>
<p>For clustering, the genes that were more than 2-fold differentially expressed with a significant <italic>q</italic>-value (<italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) in at least one comparison were selected and the log fold change were clustered using DIANA (a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Kaufman1">[53]</xref> and visualized by heatmaps and dendrograms. All analyses were performed using the R language and environment for statistical computing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Pinheiro1">[54]</xref>. The microarray data mining tool ermineJ was used to analyze the microarray dataset based on GO terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001209-Pavlidis1">[35]</xref>. The <italic>p</italic>-values from the microarray data were used as input scores and gene score resampling analysis (GSA) was applied. The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" xlink:type="simple">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) under the accession number GSE22988.</p>

<title>Virulence assays</title>
<p>The virulence of each cryptococcal strain was examined using female BALB/c mice (4 to 6 weeks old) from Charles River Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). Fungal cells were cultured in 5 ml of YPD at 30°C overnight, washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen), and resuspended in PBS. The BALB/c mice, in groups of 10, were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (80 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (5.5 mg/kg) in PBS and suspended on a silk thread by the superior incisors. A suspension of 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells in 50 µl was slowly dripped into the nares of the anesthetized mice, and the mice were suspended for 10 minutes on the thread. The health status of the mice was monitored daily post-inoculation. Mice reaching the humane endpoint were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> anoxia. Statistical analyses of survival differences were performed by log rank tests using GraphPad Prism 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p>

<title>Capsule formation</title>
<p>Low-iron medium was used to examine capsule formation. A single colony from a YPD plate for each strain was cultured overnight at 30°C in liquid YPD medium. Cells were harvested and diluted in low-iron water, and 10<sup>4</sup> cells were added into 3 ml of LIM for further incubation at 30°C for 48 h. After incubation, the capsule was stained with India ink and examined by differential interference microscopy.</p>

<title>Carbon source utilization</title>
<p>YNB agar was supplemented with one of the following carbon sources: 2% glucose, 2% sucrose, 2% sodium acetate, or 2% ethanol. Exponentially growing cultures were washed, re-suspended in water and adjusted to a concentration of 2×10<sup>4</sup> cells per µl. The cell suspensions were diluted 10-fold serially and 5 µl of each dilution was spotted onto the plates. Plates were incubated for 2–3 days at 30°C and photographed.</p>
