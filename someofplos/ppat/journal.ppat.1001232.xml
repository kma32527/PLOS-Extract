<p>Parasitic protozoa such as the apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> progress through their life cycle in response to stimuli in the environment or host organism. Very little is known about how proliferating tachyzoites reprogram their expressed genome in response to stresses that prompt development into latent bradyzoite cysts. We have previously linked histone acetylation with the expression of stage-specific genes, but the factors involved remain to be determined. We sought to determine if GCN5, which operates as a transcriptional co-activator by virtue of its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, contributed to stress-induced changes in gene expression in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. In contrast to other lower eukaryotes, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> has duplicated its GCN5 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT). Disruption of the gene encoding for TgGCN5-A in type I RH strain did not produce a severe phenotype under normal culture conditions, but here we show that the TgGCN5-A null mutant is deficient in responding to alkaline pH, a common stress used to induce bradyzoite differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. We performed a genome-wide analysis of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> transcriptional response to alkaline pH stress, finding that parasites deleted for TgGCN5-A fail to up-regulate 74% of the stress response genes that are induced 2-fold or more in wild-type. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we verify an enrichment of TgGCN5-A at the upstream regions of genes activated by alkaline pH exposure. The TgGCN5-A knockout is also incapable of up-regulating key marker genes expressed during development of the latent cyst form, and is impaired in its ability to recover from alkaline stress. Complementation of the TgGCN5-A knockout restores the expression of these stress-induced genes and reverses the stress recovery defect. These results establish TgGCN5-A as a major contributor to the alkaline stress response in RH strain <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p>

<p>Protozoan parasites cause significant disease in humans and livestock, and many of our current therapies have serious side effects or are being rendered useless due to the development of drug resistance. These parasites typically have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts and some, like <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, have the ability to remain in the host for life as a latent tissue cyst. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is one of the most successful parasites on Earth because the ability to develop into a tissue cyst greatly facilitates transmission through carnivores. Cyst formation also is responsible for recrudescent infection in immunocompromised patients. The conversion of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> from its replicating cell to the cyst is triggered by stress, but we have little understanding of how the parasite stress response functions. In this study, we identify the genes involved in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>'s response to alkaline stress, which is a known trigger of cyst development. We also establish that a lysine acetyltransferase enzyme called TgGCN5-A is required for type I RH strain <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> to respond normally to alkaline stress. Parasites lacking TgGCN5-A are no longer capable of activating genes induced during cyst formation triggered by alkaline pH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress responses are critical to cell survival, allowing cells to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In certain pathogenic eukaryotes, such as the protozoan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (phylum Apicomplexa), the stress response takes on added significance as it triggers a developmental change into a latent cyst form. Parasitic protozoa often rely on stimuli in the environment or host organism in order to progress through the parasite life cycle. The study of stress-induced developmental changes in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is significant as this process underlies pathogenesis. This obligate intracellular protist develops from a rapidly growing form (tachyzoite) into a latent cyst form (bradyzoite) in response to stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Weiss1">[1]</xref>. In human hosts, the cyst forms can re-emerge as destructive tachyzoites if immunity wanes, causing recurring bouts of toxoplasmosis that may endanger immunocompromised individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Wong1">[2]</xref>. A major gap in our knowledge that impedes the development of novel therapeutics against <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection is our poor understanding of how tachyzoites reprogram their expressed genome in response to stresses that prompt cyst development. The identification of proteins that contribute to stress response and bradyzoite formation would be a significant step towards the design of new therapies to treat toxoplasmosis.</p>
<p>How the parasite coordinates the changes in gene expression that accompany stress-induced bradyzoite development is not clear, but epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications, have been implicated as contributing to this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Saksouk1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Sullivan1">[4]</xref>. Formerly referred to as histone acetyltransferases (HATs), lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) of the general control nonderepressible-5 (GCN5/KAT2) family are well-conserved among eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Berger1">[5]</xref>. While invertebrates generally possess a single GCN5, vertebrate species harbor two: GCN5 and the highly similar homologue called PCAF (p300/CBP-Associating Factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Yang1">[6]</xref>. The GCN5 KAT family has been implicated in cell-cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Zhang1">[7]</xref>, chromatin remodeling at specific promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Gregory1">[8]</xref>, transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Johnsson1">[9]</xref>, cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Yamauchi1">[10]</xref>, and the cellular stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Huisinga1">[11]</xref>. Microarray analyses of knockouts made in yeast suggest that GCN5 is a gene-specific coactivator, regulating 1.1% of genes in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and up to 4% in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Lee1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Helmlinger1">[13]</xref>. The GCN5 deletion mutant in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is viable, but grows poorly on minimal media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Marcus1">[14]</xref>. Similarly, GCN5 is not essential for growth under normal conditions in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, but is required for mounting an appropriate response to KCl and CaCl<sub>2</sub>-mediated stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Johnsson2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-XueFranzen1">[16]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, GCN5 controls ∼5% of genes and is important for normal growth and development, as well as the response to cold stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Vlachonasios1">[17]</xref>. GCN5 was shown to be instrumental in the control of specific morphogenetic cascades during developmental transitions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Carre1">[18]</xref>. GCN5-null mouse embryos fail to form dorsal mesoderm lineages due to a high incidence of apoptosis and die 10.5 days post conception, suggesting a critical role for GCN5 in mammalian development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Yamauchi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Xu1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Bu1">[20]</xref>. In contrast, PCAF appears to be dispensable in mice as its loss confers no distinct phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Yamauchi1">[10]</xref>. Collectively, these studies support the idea that GCN5 KATs modulate gene expression during stress, or exposure to other environmental stimuli, to elicit the appropriate response or developmental change.</p>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is unique among fellow apicomplexan parasites and other invertebrates in possessing two GCN5 HATs, designated TgGCN5-A and –B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Bhatti1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Sullivan2">[22]</xref>. We sought to delineate the function of TgGCN5-A by creating a genetic knockout using homologous recombination in haploid RH strain tachyzoites. As in other lower eukaryotes, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lacking TgGCN5-A (ΔGCN5-A) showed no discernible phenotype under normal culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Bhatti1">[21]</xref>, but its response to stress was not addressed. Here, we analyzed wild-type and ΔGCN5-A parasites under normal and alkaline pH growth conditions using <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genome microarrays. The results illuminate the parasite's response to alkaline pH and demonstrate that TgGCN5-A is required for most of these changes in gene expression. We also show that ΔGCN5-A parasites exhibit greater sensitivity to alkaline pH stress - a novel role for GCN5 KATs. Moreover, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lacking TgGCN5-A cannot activate bradyzoite-specific genes that are normally up-regulated during alkaline pH-induced cyst development. These studies establish a novel function for GCN5 KATs in the eukaryotic response to alkaline stress and support the idea that TgGCN5-A is a key contributor to gene expression pertinent to the development of the latent cyst form of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p>

<title>Differential gene expression in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> during alkaline pH stress</title>
<p>We have previously created a null mutation of the TgGCN5-A gene by replacing the majority of the genomic locus with a hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) minigene in type I RH strain parasites lacking HXGPRT, designated ΔGCN5-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Bhatti1">[21]</xref>. The loss of TgGCN5-A had no overt effect on tachyzoites grown in standard culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Bhatti1">[21]</xref>, mirroring phenotypes reported for other lower eukaryotes such as yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Marcus1">[14]</xref>. In other species, GCN5 has been shown to be important for stress responses and developmental changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Koutelou1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, stress can lead to expression of bradyzoite-specific genes and the eventual formation of tissue cysts. We predicted that if TgGCN5-A played a role in stress-induced bradyzoite gene expression, then it may be up-regulated in response to a stress agent. After 3 days in alkaline culture conditions (pH 8.2), message levels for TgGCN5-A increase &gt;5-fold in wild-type RH <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Actin was monitored as a control to show that alkaline pH stress does not globally increase gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To further assess if TgGCN5-A played a role in the stress response in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites, we performed whole genome expression profiling to compare ΔGCN5-A and wild-type parasites grown for 3 days either in alkaline pH (8.2) medium or control medium. Gene profiling of certain <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains under stress has been reported previously, but the effects of alkaline pH stress on RH strain has not been examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Behnke1">[24]</xref>. Affymetrix ToxoGeneChip microarrays, which contain probe sets for ∼8000 predicted <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes, were used for this study. The differentially regulated genes were grouped into functional categories based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genome database at ToxoDB.org. The entire dataset of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes affected by alkaline pH stress is available as supplemental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s002">Dataset S1</xref>). TgGCN5-A was present in wild-type and absent in ΔGCN5-A, validating the identity of the samples and supporting the fidelity of the microarray analysis. The fidelity of select microarray results was further confirmed through independent qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Results show that ∼14% (1,114) of genes are differentially regulated (p value&lt;0.001) in intracellular wild-type parasites after 3 days of alkaline pH exposure. Similar to findings in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Viladevall1">[25]</xref>, a broad range of genes have altered expression in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> during alkaline pH exposure, including genes involved in invasion, metabolism, protein processing, signaling and gene expression, and membrane transport. Of the 1,114 genes affected, 592 genes were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and 522 genes were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Among the genes with largest changes in response to alkaline stress (an arbitrary cut-off of 2-fold or more), 177 were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s004">Table S2</xref>) and 84 were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s005">Table S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Common Environmental Response/Environmental Stress Response genes</title>
<p>Many of the genes altered during pH stress in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> have been previously described as being part of the Common Environmental Response (CER) or Environmental Stress Response (ESR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Gasch1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Causton1">[27]</xref> while others appear specific to the alkaline stress response.</p>
<p>CER/ESR is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in a wide array of cellular processes including metabolism, detoxification, protein folding and degradation, metabolite transport, vacuolar and mitochondrial function, and intracellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Gasch1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Causton1">[27]</xref>. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that intracellular tachyzoites exposed to alkaline pH have increased levels of messages encoding enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis, such as 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme, glycan synthase, and other gluconeogenic enzymes that facilitate glycogen synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s006">Table S4</xref>). Moreover, the 2.3-fold increase in trehalose-6-phosphate synthase transcript suggests trehalose synthesis increases during alkaline stress in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s006">Table S4</xref>). Glycogen and trehalose act as stores of energy reserves, stabilize proteins, and provide osmolyte balance during stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Hounsa1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Singer1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another classical feature of CER/ESR is the up-regulation of protein folding enzymes and protein degrading enzymes. Our microarray study showed that pH-stressed tachyzoites generally have increased levels of chaperones and protein folding enzymes such as TCP-1/cpn chaperones and DnaJ domain containing proteins. Sixteen genes involved in protein folding increased while 7 showed reduced expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s006">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s002">Dataset S1</xref>). Similarly, the pH-stressed parasites up-regulate factors involved with proteosomal degradation, suggesting that they are preparing to remove malfolded proteins. During pH stress in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, ribosomal genes tend to be slightly depressed or unchanged, consistent with the cell shifting to an energy saving mode.</p>
<p>Another feature of CER/ESR is the induction of genes that provide protection from oxidizing agents, including transporters that maintain ion homeostasis and an intracellular reducing environment. In alkaline pH-stressed tachyzoites, thioredoxins, glutraredoxins, and glutathione reductase genes are up-regulated, as well as genes encoding a cation transporter, solute transporter, and sodium/hydrogen exchangers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s006">Table S4</xref>). We conclude that tachyzoites exposed to alkaline stress exhibit many parallels to the CER/ESR reported in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Gasch1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Causton1">[27]</xref>, supporting the idea that this type of core stress response arose very early in eukaryotic cell evolution.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>pH-specific changes in gene expression</title>
<p>Very few studies have examined the alkaline stress response of eukaryotic cells in detail. Studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have demonstrated up-regulation of several phosphate transport and metabolism genes in response to alkaline pH, including PHO84, PHO11/PHO12, and PHO89, as well as ion transport and homeostasis genes such as CTR3, FRE1, and ARN4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Causton1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Lamb1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Serrano1">[31]</xref>. We found a potential homologue of PHO84 in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (46.m01634) that is increased nearly 2-fold in wild-type parasites exposed to alkaline stress. Our data also shows that a ctr copper transporter domain-containing protein increases 2-fold (55.m05007), two calcium-transporting ATPase increase ∼2-fold (44.m02594 and 583.m00010), and a cation-transporting ATPase (80.m00077) increases 2.8-fold.</p>
<p>A number of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors are known to be up-regulated during alkaline pH exposure in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, such as Rim101 and NRG2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Lamb1">[30]</xref>. Only one predicted C2H2 zinc finger protein was slightly up-regulated in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, 55.m04837 (1.3-fold), and it is not clear if it is orthologous to Rim101 or NRG2. TIS11 is a CCCH type zinc finger protein up-regulated during alkaline stress in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Lamb1">[30]</xref>; two zinc fingers of this class were up-regulated &gt;2-fold in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> exposed to alkaline stress. Genes encoding several other zinc finger proteins were also increased during alkaline stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001232-t001">Table 1</xref>). A number of transcription factors in Apicomplexa containing plant-like Apetela-2 domains (AP2) also increased during alkaline pH stress; those increasing 2-fold or more include 20.m03817, 80.m02236, 37.m00767, and 641.m01483 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1001232-t002">Table 2</xref>). No AP2 domain proteins were down-regulated 2-fold or more. The data suggest that the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and yeast alkaline stress response share some common features, but there are clearly parasite-specific changes taking place, as evidenced by the up-regulation of 75 hypothetical genes of unknown function at least 2-fold in alkaline pH-stressed <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s007">Table S5</xref>).</p>

<p>TgGCN5-A itself was not observed to increase during alkaline stress by microarray analysis, appearing to contradict the highly reproducible findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

<title>Deficient gene regulation in ΔGCN5-A parasites during alkaline stress</title>
<p>A scatter plot of the microarray data reveals that there are virtually no differences (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) in gene expression patterns between wild-type and ΔGCN5-A parasites grown under normal culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), which is consistent with the indiscernible phenotype of ΔGCN5-A cultured in normal conditions. However, relative to wild-type, the ΔGCN5-A parasites differ dramatically in their ability to regulate gene expression when grown in alkaline medium (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). While 1,114 genes are altered in wild-type parasites exposed to alkaline stress, only 502 genes were changed in alkaline-stressed parasites lacking TgGCN5-A (p&lt;0.001). Since TgGCN5-A is an activator of gene expression we focused on the genes up-regulated during alkaline stress. Further examination of up-regulated genes reveals that ΔGCN5-A parasites fail to up-regulate 439 of the 592 genes up-regulated by wild-type parasites grown in alkaline pH. In other words, TgGCN5-A is required for increased expression of 74% of the genes activated in response to alkaline pH. TgGCN5-A-dependent genes have diverse roles in signaling and gene expression (18%), protein processing and translation (17%), metabolism (13%), membrane transport (8%), and adhesion (7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). TgGCN5-A also controls a substantive number of hypothetical proteins with no known function (37%). Hypothetical genes with a change of 2-fold or more are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s007">Table S5</xref>.</p>

<title>ΔGCN5-A parasites fail to activate bradyzoite genes in response to alkaline stress</title>
<p>The impaired response to alkaline pH stress suggests that ΔGCN5-A parasites may also be defective in bradyzoite development. The knockout was made in the hypervirulent type I RH strain, which does not fully develop into bradyzoites at high frequency. RH strain will generally not form cyst walls, but will express detectable levels of bradyzoite-specific marker genes in response to stresses that induce cyst formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Soete1">[34]</xref>. In our hands, we can detect BAG1 and LDH2 mRNAs by day 4 of alkaline pH treatment. To test if TgGCN5-A plays a role in stress-induced bradyzoite gene expression, we grew wild-type or ΔGCN5-A parasites in pH 7.0 (control) or pH 8.2 (stress) media. At day 4, intracellular parasites were harvested for quantitative real-time PCR to monitor mRNA levels for bradyzoite-specific genes BAG1 and LDH2. While wild-type parasites up-regulate both bradyzoite marker genes in response to pH 8.2, the ΔGCN5-A parasites fail to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g006">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref>). Actin was monitored as a control gene that does not significantly change during bradyzoite induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). To ensure the defect was not an indirect effect, we complemented ΔGCN5-A parasites by stably expressing a recombinant copy of TgGCN5-A. Expression of BAG1 and LDH2 was restored in the complemented ΔGCN5-A parasites exposed to alkaline stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g006">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref>). The mRNA levels of BAG1 and LDH2 following stress in complemented ΔGCN5-A parasites are higher than wild-type, presumably because the recombinant TgGCN5-A is being expressed above wild-type levels. Interestingly, this higher level of TgGCN5-A expression in the complemented clone does not affect levels of BAG1 or LDH2 under non-stressed conditions, implying that TgGCN5-A does not activate these bradyzoite genes until a stress signal is perceived by the parasite. We used ChIP analysis to further demonstrate the involvement of TgGCN5-A in regulating developmentally expressed genes. ChIP demonstrates that TgGCN5-A is recruited to BAG1 and LDH2 promoter regions during alkaline stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). We conclude that parasites lacking TgGCN5-A are defective in up-regulating bradyzoite-specific genes in response to alkaline stress.</p>

<title>TgGCN5-A knockout parasites are deficient in recovery from alkaline stress</title>
<p>Based on our results, it would be predicted that parasites exposed to alkaline stress would have difficulty recovering from the insult. To test this hypothesis, intracellular parasites were exposed to pH 8.2 for 3 or 5 days, harvested, and then inoculated into fresh host cells and cultured under normal (pH 7.0) conditions. Parasite proliferation was monitored using the PCR-based B1 assay. Data show that intracellular parasites lacking GCN5-A exposed to pH 8.2 for 3 days do not recover as efficiently as wild-type or the GCN5-A complemented clone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The recovery defect is even more pronounced when the intracellular ΔGCN5-A parasites are subjected to pH 8.2 for 5 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001232.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The preceding studies were performed on tachyzoite-infected host cells. We also examined if direct exposure to alkaline stress produced a phenotype in the parasites. In order to test if alkaline pH impacts ΔGCN5-A parasites directly, we monitored the ability of purified, extracellular ΔGCN5-A tachyzoites to recover from a short term exposure to alkaline pH. Equal numbers of extracellular ΔGCN5-A or wild-type tachyzoites were placed in media of pH 7.0 (control) or 8.2 for 30 min, and then allowed to infect confluent host cell monolayers under normal culture conditions. At day five, plaques in the infected monolayers were counted. The ΔGCN5-A mutant displayed increased sensitivity to alkaline pH as evidenced by its impaired ability to produce plaques following this insult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Recombinant TgGCN5-A was able to restore the ability of ΔGCN5-A parasites to recover from alkaline stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). We verified the results with a second, independent type of growth assay that monitors parasite proliferation through quantitative PCR of the parasite-specific B1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Collectively, these studies establish that TgGCN5-A is a key factor that manages the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> response to alkaline pH stress in RH strain tachyzoites. It is curious that the complemented clone, which appears to be over-expressing TgGCN5-A, does not offer greater protection from alkaline stress despite being able to up-regulate BAG1 and LDH2 greater than wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001232-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). GCN5 HATs function in large multi-subunit complexes, the components of which vary in different cells or under different conditions. A possible explanation could be that a “minimal” GCN5 complex can up-regulate certain stress response genes, but it is not capable of providing greater protection to the cell because other components are required that are not over produced.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> possesses two GCN5 KATs, which is unusual as lower eukaryotes tend to have a single GCN5. We have sought to delineate the roles of these two GCN5s by making genetic knockouts. The ΔGCN5-A mutant is viable and does not show growth defects under normal culture conditions; however, attempts to generate a knockout of TgGCN5-B have not been successful. These results support a model that TgGCN5-B is essential for housekeeping functions while TgGCN5-A is required to overcome certain stress situations. Such a role for TgGCN5-A is established by the studies described herein. It remains possible that there is some functional overlap between the two TgGCN5s, but whatever contribution is made by TgGCN5-B is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of TgGCN5-A in terms of responding normally to alkaline pH stress, including the up-regulation of bradyzoite marker genes BAG1 and LDH2.</p>
<p>A key finding in this study is that TgGCN5-A is required to activate developmental genes in response to pH stress. These studies were performed in type I RH strain, which is not well suited for a more thorough characterization of bradyzoite development <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Such studies would require the generation of an analogous TgGCN5-A knockout in type II strain <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Our initial attempts to disrupt the TgGCN5-A knockout in type II strains have not yet succeeded, probably due to technical challenges inherent in working with the slow growing type II strain, but it is possible that TgGCN5-A is essential in type II strain.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> possesses a duplicate GCN5 HAT that appears to be exquisitely tailored to respond to alkaline, and to a lesser extent, KCl stress. Adaptation to fluctuations in pH is likely to be relevant to proliferating tachyzoites, as pH stress almost certainly is encountered by <italic>Toxoplasma in vivo</italic> as it moves in and out of host cells throughout diverse regions of the body. Additionally, while not addressed for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, it has been reported that other infections elevate intracellular pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Patton1">[35]</xref>. It is difficult to distinguish whether the observed changes in intracellular parasites are due to direct effects of high pH on <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites themselves or indirect effects produced by the response of host cells. What is clear is that RH strain parasites lacking TgGCN5-A are defective in regulating changes in the transcriptome that accompany the response to alkaline pH. The data are significant as alkaline pH is considered a “gold standard” method for triggering bradyzoite development <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Weiss1">[1]</xref>. In summary, our studies establish that TgGCN5-A plays a major role in the normal response to alkaline pH stress, including the activation of developmentally regulated genes, in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> RH strain. The conclusion is based on multiple lines of data from independent studies, including up-regulation of TgGCN5-A mRNA during pH stress, microarray analysis, TgGCN5-A enrichment at genes up-regulated during alkaline stress, and phenotypic analysis showing that the TgGCN5-A knockout has impaired alkaline stress recovery. Our microarray analysis also provides novel insight into the molecular basis of the alkaline stress response in intracellular <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p>

<title>Parasite culture and reagents</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites (wild-type (WT) RH, ΔGCN5-A, and TgGCN5-A complemented lines) were cultured in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1.0% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). Parasites were grown in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub> (5%) incubator at 37°C. Cultures were confirmed to be free of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> contamination by MycoAlert Assay (Cambrex Bio Science). Parasites were harvested immediately following lysis of host cell monolayers and purified by filtration through a 3.0 micron filter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Roos1">[36]</xref>. Bradyzoite growth conditions were identical except the infection medium was replaced with alkaline medium (DMEM with 20 mM HEPBS, 2 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/L and 1.0% FBS, adjusted to pH 8.2 using NaOH) and changed daily.</p>

<p>Tachyzoites were released from HFF monolayers using a 25 gauge syringe needle, and filtered to remove the host cell debris was spun out at 500×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Extracellular parasites were resuspended at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> parasites/ml in DMEM, alkaline medium (pH 8.2, adjusted with NaOH as described above), or medium containing 0.6 M KCl, 5 µM arsenite, 1 µM ionophore.

<title>RNA preparation and hybridization to microarrays</title>
<p>Confluent HFF monolayers grown in T25-cm<sup>2</sup> flasks were infected with 10<sup>6</sup> parasites using normal parasite culture media (above). After 2 hr, infection medium was replaced with normal medium (pH 7.0) or alkaline medium (see above). Flasks were maintained in humidified 37°C incubator in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Medium for both normal and alkaline cultures was replaced each day for 3 days, at which point the infected monolayers were scraped with a rubber policeman. Samples were centrifuged (1500 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in sterile PBS. Intracellular parasites were released from host cells by syringe passage using a 25 gauge needle and washed in PBS. Total RNA was isolated from the purified parasites using an RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). To minimize genomic DNA contamination, additional treatment with DNase was performed. The cDNA and cRNA were synthesized according to the protocols recommended by Affymetrix in their GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using T7 promoter-dT24 oligonucleotide as primer with the Invitrogen Life Technologies SuperScript Choice system. Biotinylated cRNA was made using the Affymetrix <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT) labeling kit. Fifteen µg of biotinylated cRNA was added to a total hybridization cocktail of 300 µl, and 200 µl was hybridized to an Affymetrix custom <italic>T. gondii</italic> ToxoGeneChip (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://roos-compbio2.bio.upenn.edu/~abahl/Array-Tutorial.html" xlink:type="simple">http://roos-compbio2.bio.upenn.edu/~abahl/Array-Tutorial.html</ext-link>) after adding control oligonucleotides. Hybridization was performed at 45°C for 17 h with constant rotation. The hybridization mixture was then removed and the GeneChips were washed, stained with phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin, washed, incubated with biotinylated anti-streptavidin, and re-stained with phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin to amplify the signals; these steps were carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station. To reduce non-random error, balanced groups of samples were handled in parallel. Arrays were then scanned using the dedicated scanner, controlled by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS). The Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5 (MAS5) algorithm was used to analyze the hybridization intensity data from GeneChip expression probe arrays and to calculate the set of metrics that describe probe set performance. The average intensity on each array was normalized by global scaling to a target intensity of 1000. For each of the two conditions (normal and alkaline), four independent preparations of WT and ΔGCN5-A RNA were prepared; each of the 16 preparations was hybridized to its own microarray to ensure a strong statistical basis for analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis and data deposition</title>
<p>We analyzed only those probe sets (genes) that were called “present” by the MAS5 detection call in at least half of the arrays for at least one of the four conditions to eliminate probe sets that are not reliably detected (those at or near background or that may reflect cross-hybridization) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-McClintick1">[38]</xref>. We used a Welch's t-test on log<sub>2</sub> transformed MAS5 signals to reveal significant differences between WT and ΔGCN5-A. The resultant p-values were used to calculate false discovery rates (FDR) using the Benjamini and Hochberg method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001232-Benjamini1">[39]</xref>. Fold-changes were calculated by taking the ratio of the mean of the WT and ΔGCN5-A signal values, using the larger mean as the numerator; by convention we show the result as negative if the mean of the ΔGCN5-A samples was smaller.
