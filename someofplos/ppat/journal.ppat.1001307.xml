<p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is a correlation between phylogenetic relationship and inflammatory response amongst a panel of clinical isolates representative of the global diversity of the human <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> Complex (MTBC). Measurement of cytokines from infected human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages revealed a wide variation in the response to different strains. The same pattern of high or low response to individual strains was observed for different pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and was conserved across multiple human donors. Although each major phylogenetic lineage of MTBC included strains inducing a range of cytokine responses, we found that overall inflammatory phenotypes differed significantly across lineages. In particular, comparison of evolutionarily modern lineages demonstrated a significant skewing towards lower early inflammatory response. The differential response to ancient and modern lineages observed using GM-CSF derived macrophages was also observed in autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, but not in human unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We hypothesize that the reduced immune responses to modern lineages contribute to more rapid disease progression and transmission, which might be a selective advantage in the context of expanding human populations. In addition to the lineage effects, the large strain-to-strain variation in innate immune responses elicited by MTBC will need to be considered in tuberculosis vaccine development.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is a long-standing human pathogen spread by aerosol transmission between individuals interacting in close social groups. It can be anticipated that the evolution of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> will parallel the evolution of human societies, and the phylogeny as determined by whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates is indeed consistent with emergence of the pathogen with modern humans in Africa and its subsequent dissemination along routes of human migration and trade. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the genetic diversity of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates would be reflected in a corresponding diversity in their biological properties. In particular, we explored the interaction of different isolates with the innate immune system, which plays important contrasting roles in initial resistance to infection and in disease transmission. We observed a difference in the innate immune response when we compared isolates belonging to “modern” lineages that have evolved amongst high-density populations in regions of recent massive demographic expansion, with isolates belonging to “ancient” lineages selected in older low-density human populations. Our results provide insights into host-pathogen co-evolution and into fundamental mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-throughput sequence analysis has allowed reconstruction of the evolution of human <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> Complex (MTBC), differentiating the bacteria into six main phylogenetic lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hershberg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Comas1">[2]</xref>. Three lineages, including two whose members are known as <italic>M. africanum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-deJong1">[3]</xref>, which branched off from a common ancestor at an early stage of evolution, are referred to as evolutionarily “ancient” lineages; three separate evolutionarily “modern” lineages diverged at a later time point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hershberg1">[1]</xref>. It is proposed that the branches reflect the history of human migration out of Africa, with the current geographic distribution of the different lineages being determined by the expansion and migration of their corresponding host populations.</p>
<p>This phylogeny provides a rational framework to assess whether the genotypic diversity of MTBC is associated with diversity in biological phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Gagneux1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Nicol1">[5]</xref>. Several studies suggest that this may be the case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Nicol1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Coscolla1">[6]</xref>. A comparison of pulmonary TB with TB meningitis in Vietnam demonstrated that strains belonging to the modern Euro-American lineage were significantly less likely to cause extra-pulmonary disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Caws1">[7]</xref>. In contrast, the modern Beijing/W lineage was found significantly associated with extra-thoracic TB in comparison with non-Beijing/W lineages, though no difference was found when looking at other read-outs of virulence such as the amount of cavitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Kong1">[8]</xref>. A recent study in Madagascar found that infection with an ancient lineage induced a significantly higher immune response, measured as interferon-γ production by peripheral blood T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Rakotosamimanana1">[9]</xref>. Finally, a series of studies, including the report from Madagascar, have described a reduced immune response to members of the “Beijing family” (part of the modern East Asian Lineage 2), and its association with rapid progression to severe disease in humans and experimental animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Rakotosamimanana1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Manca1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Reed1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Tanveer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Lopez1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hanekom1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two studies that analyzed individual isolates involved in TB outbreaks concluded that a low inflammatory response was linked to increased virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Manca1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Newton1">[15]</xref>. The rationale is that a reduction in innate immune recognition will result in a delay in engagement of the adaptive response, providing the pathogen with a significant advantage during the early stage of infection. The low inflammatory phenotype of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> HN878, a member of the Beijing family implicated in an outbreak in Texas, was reversed by disruption of the gene encoding an enzyme required for biosynthesis of a phenolic glycolipid molecule (PGL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Reed1">[11]</xref>. However, it was shown later that the production of PGL was variable across strains from the Beijing/W lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Sinsimer1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, the role of this particular glycolipid in the virulence of HN878 could not be reproduced by restoring its production in the genetic background of another modern strain belonging to Lineage 4, highlighting a rather confusing inter- and intra-lineage diversity in the molecular mechanisms of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenicity. In contrast, the low inflammatory phenotype of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CAS, responsible for an outbreak in Leicester, was linked to a chromosomal deletion and could be reversed by restoration of the functional gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Newton1">[15]</xref>. Several other studies have described differences in the inflammatory response induced by different isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Tanveer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Lopez1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-MarquinaCastillo1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-HoalvanHelden1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Theus1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we used a collection of strains covering the global genetic diversity of MTBC to test the hypothesis that inflammatory phenotype would be linked to genotype.</p>

<p>First, there were clear differences in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by a single donor in response to different strains; ranging from a few hundred picograms to several nanograms. Second, although the absolute amount of cytokine varies between individual donors (results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g002">Figure 2</xref> are plotted against two separate y-axes), the relative hierarchy of low and high responses is the same in the two donors. This is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g003">Figure 3</xref>, summarizing results from eight donors, with strains ranked according to their ability to induce a cytokine response after median normalization of the dataset. In addition to robust consistency across different human donors, a similar hierarchy was observed when the same strains were used to stimulate bone-marrow-derived macrophages from Balb/c mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001307.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A third observation is that the different pro-inflammatory cytokines – IL-6, IL-12p40/p70 and TNFα – all showed a similar pattern. Again, this is particularly clear when analyzed across the panel of eight donors, showing a highly significant correlation between production of IL-6 and IL-12p40/p70 for example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; Spearman rank correlation coefficient  =  0.988, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

<title>Innate immune responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> complex strains correlate with the phylogeny and genetic diversity data</title>
<p>We next compared the pro-inflammatory responses across the main MTBC lineages. Combining results from the eight individual donors after median normalization revealed higher heterogeneity in IL-6 production in response to Lineage 5, 6 and 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, there was overall a statistically significant effect of lineage on the cytokine levels observed (Kruskal-Wallis rank test, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). To look for higher order grouping of the lineages we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) using the genetic variation among the strains. PCA distinguished three major groups: strains belonging to Lineages 5+6 (<italic>M. africanum</italic>), strains belonging to Lineage 1, and strains belonging to the Lineages 2+3+4 (these three lineages have been referred to as evolutionarily “modern” based on previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hershberg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Brosch1">[22]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These three major groupings were consistent with the most recent genome-based MTBC phylogeny published earlier this year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Comas1">[2]</xref> and shows that the “modern” lineages are more genetically homogenous than “ancient” lineages.</p>

<title>IL-6 production varies with genetic clustering of MTBC lineages.</title>
<p>A) Median normalized levels of cytokine production by human monocyte-derived macrophages from eight independent donors were averaged for scatter plot representation and clustered according to strain lineage. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant effect of lineage variable in cytokine production (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). B) PCA plot (PC1 versus PC3) of the strains used in this study based on the polymorphisms found between them in Hershberg et al. 2008 highlights three main groups clearly separating the three modern lineages from Lineage 1, and from the two <italic>M. africanum</italic> lineages (5 and 6). C) IL-6 response from T1-MDMs from eight donors infected by the panel of MTBC strains indicates that Lineages 5+6 and Lineage 1 induce more IL-6 than the modern lineages. (Mann-Whitney U test, * <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, ** <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001307.g004" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Comparing the level of cytokine induction across these three groups showed that the modern group of strains consistently induced a lower IL-6 response when compared to Lineage 5+6 or Lineage 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), though Lineage 1 had an intermediate phenotype reflecting again the higher heterogeneity of the ancient group when compared to the modern strains. Even so, combining the lineages according to the ancient/modern grouping revealed an overall difference in inflammatory phenotype, with strains from the modern lineages always eliciting significantly lower levels of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and other cytokines and chemokines such as IL-12p40/p70, TNFα, IL-15, MIP-1α, CCL5 and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore for the rest of the study we decided to keep the "ancient"/"modern" dichotomy to highlight the different behavior of the later group when compared with the other lineages. However, relevant figures splitting the data in three groups ("<italic>M. africanum</italic>", Lineage 1 and "Modern") are made available as supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001307.s002">Figure S2 A-E</xref>).</p>

<p>Supernatants of infected macrophages 24 h post-infection from 3 independent donors were pooled and analyzed using multiplex technology and results were plotted for each individual cytokine/chemokine.

<p>As a further test of the reproducibility of the differential inflammatory response, experiments were repeated using a second batch of the same strains of MTBC separately cultured and quantified. While a few individual isolates showed evidence of batch variation in inflammatory phenotype, the overall pattern of a lower response to the modern lineage was maintained as shown by a statistically significant correlation test (Spearman correlation test, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001307.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>There was a differential increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as the infection progressed, and the difference between ancient and modern lineages observed at the 24-hour time point had markedly diminished by 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g006">Figure 6</xref>; Mann-Whitney U test, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Thus, the reduced response to the modern strains is due to a delay in the kinetics, rather than a complete inhibition of the immune response.</p>

<p>Scatter plot representation of macrophage cytokine responses to ancient versus modern strains at 24 h and 72 h post-infection from a single donor. Supernatants from infected macrophages were collected at 24 h and 72 h and analyzed by ELISA for IL-6 and IL-12p40/p70 content. While the trend towards higher cytokine production from macrophages infected by strains belonging to the ancient lineage is maintained, convergence of cytokine levels at the later time point (particularly in the case of IL-6) suggests that lower responses to the modern lineage may reflect a delay rather than complete inhibition of the inflammatory response (Mann-Whitney U test, * <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, NS non significant).</p>

<title>The inflammatory response to ancient and modern lineages differs when infecting autologous PBMCs or anti-inflammatory Type 2 macrophages.</title>
<p>A) Scatter plot representation of macrophage (circles) versus autologous PBMCs (squares) cytokine responses to ancient (open) versus modern (filled) groups of strains shows that the pro-inflammatory phenotype was reversed when infecting PBMCs instead of GM-CSF derived macrophages from the same donor and looking at IL-6 production but not TNFα. B) Macrophages from three independent donors were derived from monocytes either in the presence of recombinant human GM-CSF or M-CSF to generate Type 1 macrophages (T1-MDMs) and Type 2 macrophages (T2-MDMs) respectively.

<p>Replacement of GM-CSF by M-CSF during monocyte differentiation generated a “Type 2” macrophage population characterized by a lower level of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with increased expression of IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Verreck1">[21]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g007">Figure 7B</xref> illustrates the differences between Type 1 (T1-MDMs) and Type 2 (T2-MDMs) polarization in response to LPS stimulation. Comparative flow cytometry analysis is shown as supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001307.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Infection of T2-MDMs with the different strains of MTBC resulted in lower production of IL-6 and IL-12p40/p70 as compared to T1-MDMs, with a significant difference between lineages only for IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g007">Figure 7C, D</xref>). In contrast to T1-MDMs, a consistent IL-10 response was induced during infection of the T2-MDMs. The IL-10 response was also variable between isolates, but no significant difference was observed when comparing ancient and modern lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>
<p>IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to act as an auto-regulatory inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-deWaalMalefyt1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Saraiva1">[24]</xref>. Notably, IL-10 production has been associated with the anti-inflammatory phenotype of a recent outbreak strain belonging to the modern lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Newton1">[15]</xref>. IL-10 is produced and effective at very low concentrations. To test whether the differential inflammatory response observed in T1-MDMs might be influenced by variations in production and consumption of IL-10 that were not detected by ELISA, we repeated infection experiments in the presence of anti-IL-10 blocking antibodies. Consistent with the idea that IL-10 is produced and acting at very low levels, IL-10 blockage resulted in a systematic increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6, but not in IL-12p40/p70. However, it did not affect the differential between ancient and modern lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001307-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a panel of strains representative of human MTBC genetic variability, we have found that genetically diverse strains of MTBC vary widely in their induction of an early inflammatory response during infection of human macrophages, and that these differences are linked to MTBC lineages. Overall there was a significantly lower response to evolutionarily modern lineages as compared to ancient lineages.</p>
<p>Previous reports have described differences amongst <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates in their inflammatory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Manca1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Tanveer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Lopez1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Newton1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-HoalvanHelden1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Theus1">[19]</xref> but the present study is the first to link this to MTBC phylogeny. Consistent with previous reports, we observed a higher inflammatory phenotype for the laboratory strain H37Rv in comparison to the Beijing strain, HN878 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Reed1">[11]</xref>. We found that these differences were robust and reproducible using different batches of bacteria to infect monocyte-derived macrophages and autologous dendritic cells across different human donors. We were concerned that an experimental bias could result from inaccuracies in quantifying bacterial preparations. Our quantitation is based on measurement of colony forming units and, while we made every effort to use comparable actively growing cultures, to minimize clumping artifacts and to repeat multiple measurements, errors could arise if there is a variation between strains in the rate of accumulation of dead cells during culture. While it is difficult to rigorously exclude this possibility, we consider it an unlikely explanation for our results since (a) differences in accumulation of dead cells would need to span several orders of magnitude, and (b) in some experimental systems – infection of PBMCs or T2-MDMs – the same preparations showed opposite or no differences in cytokine response. Convergence in responses of T1-MDMs to different strains at later time points is also consistent with equivalence between preparations.</p>
<p>Although we did observe a link between inflammatory phenotype and the various bacterial genotype clusters, each of the phylogenetic lineages included strains that induced high and low levels of inflammatory cytokines. For example, strain N0024 belonging to Lineage 3 consistently elicited a stronger inflammatory response as compared to the other strains from the same lineage. Future comprehensive genetic and biochemical analysis of these strains will be performed with the aim of deciphering the origin of this difference. The variation observed within lineages suggests that differences in inflammatory phenotype cannot be explained simply by the presence or absence of a single molecular determinant, and one model to account for the dispersal of high and low inflammatory strains across the phylogenetic tree is that a diverse range of mutations might influence innate immune recognition and arise independently in different lineages. This model is consistent with the known complexity and diversity of mycobacterial products that have been shown to stimulate or inhibit inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Reed1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Ishikawa1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Stewart1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Nigou1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Rao1">[28]</xref>. Considering the multiple families of cell-surface and intracellular receptors involved in mycobacterial recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Jo1">[29]</xref>, one might expect that the consequences of molecular changes that affect different ligands would depend on the exact receptor repertoire expressed by different donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Gagneux2">[20]</xref>. However, the consistent hierarchy in inflammatory response that was observed across independent donors suggests that there is limited human variability in the initial immune response to genetically different mycobacteria. Our demonstration of a robust hierarchy in inflammatory phenotype within the different lineages of MTBC poses a challenge to our understanding at a molecular level of the microbiology and pathogenesis of tuberculosis as multiple mechanisms might converge towards similar phenotypic effects in distinct MTBC lineages. This observation may hold important lessons for development of new vaccines.</p>
<p>In spite of the heterogeneity within MTBC lineages, we observed a statistically significant distribution towards more pro-inflammatory strains amongst members of the ancient lineages, and lower inflammatory responses to strains from the modern lineages. The low inflammatory phenotype of modern strains is in agreement with previous studies of individual Beijing strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Manca1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Tanveer1">[12]</xref> and other strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Newton1">[15]</xref> belonging to the modern lineages. Our results are also consistent with the previous suggestion that a low inflammatory response may lead to a reduction in the adaptive response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Rakotosamimanana1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>A possible model to rationalize this finding is that the respective high and low inflammatory responses could reflect different virulence strategies that emerged during the evolution of the ancient and modern lineages. The characteristic latency in TB has been suggested to represent an evolutionary adaptation to low host densities, with reactivation after several decades allowing the pathogen to access new susceptible birth cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hershberg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Blaser1">[30]</xref>. By contrast, the low inflammatory response induced by evolutionary modern outbreak strains has been associated with an enhanced ability to cause early progressive disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Manca1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Newton1">[15]</xref>. Such a strategy may be an advantage in the context of high human population densities, where the number of susceptible hosts is large, and rapid lethality does not threaten to exhaust the pool of new uninfected hosts.</p>
<p>We previously presented an evolutionary scenario for human TB based on population genetic analyses of multilocus sequence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hershberg1">[1]</xref> referred to recently as “the most well defined phylogeny of the MTB complex” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Smith1">[31]</xref>. According to this scenario, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> originated in Africa and accompanied early modern humans on their Out-of-Africa migrations. In those times, human populations were small, and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> might have benefited from the latency strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Blaser1">[30]</xref>. During the last few hundred years, the three modern lineages of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> experienced strong population expansions as a consequence of the recent human population increases in Europe, India and China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-Hershberg1">[1]</xref>. The overall lower inflammatory responses observed in the modern lineages of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> might be a consequence of their access to rapidly increasing numbers of susceptible hosts resulting in selection for faster progression to active disease. In support of this hypothesis, a study in the Gambia showed that members of the modern strain lineages were three times more likely than members of the ancient lineages to cause active TB in recently exposed contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1001307-deJong2">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that the immune response to a particular infectious agent has been measured in a systematic manner by selecting representative strains belonging to the major human MTBC lineages and grasping the global <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genetic diversity, including notably <italic>M. africanum</italic>. As we show here, the combination of genotypic, phenotypic and epidemiological studies offers the potential for novel insights into the biology of this pathogen.</p>
