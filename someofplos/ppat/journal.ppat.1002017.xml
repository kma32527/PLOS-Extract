        <p>Malaria eradication will require vector-control strategies that are both
                    self-sustaining and not affected by migration of infected humans and mosquitoes.
                    Replacement of wild malaria-susceptible mosquito populations with transgenic
                    strains refractory to parasite development could interrupt the cycle of disease
                    transmission and support eradication efforts. Production of <italic>P.
                        falciparum</italic>-resistant mosquitoes is a necessary first step towards
                    investigating the population replacement strategy. Here we show that <italic>An.
                        stephensi</italic> engineered to produce <italic>P.
                    falciparum</italic>-targeting effector molecules are resistant to this important
                    human malaria parasite. Two of the three effector molecules represent a novel
                    combination of components derived from the immune systems of mosquitoes and
                    mice. An important feature of these molecules is that they are unlikely to
                    significantly harm the mosquito, as the mosquito component is an
                        <italic>Anopheles</italic> antimicrobial peptide with activity against
                        <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, while the other component is based on a murine
                    antibody selected for its ability to bind specifically to a parasite protein.
                    Transgenes with this design coupled with a gene-drive system could be used
                    alongside vaccines and drugs to provide sustainable local elimination of malaria
                    as part of a long-term strategy for eradication.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a causative agent of human malaria, is a
                vector-borne parasite that is responsible for more than 500 million clinical disease
                cases each year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Snow1">[1]</xref>.
                The selection of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and drug-resistant parasites
                necessitates an ongoing search for new disease-control methods. A proposed strategy
                for interrupting transmission is to replace wild, malaria-susceptible mosquito
                populations with transgenic, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-resistant mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-James1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Terenius1">[4]</xref>. Key
                components of this approach are effector molecules that inhibit parasite development
                when expressed from a transgene. The mechanisms by which effector molecules function
                can vary greatly, as the development of the malaria parasites within mosquitoes
                involves several transitions of environment, physiology and morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Nirmala1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When mosquitoes feed on infected humans, they ingest parasites in the form of
                gametocytes. These produce gametes that fuse to form diploid zygotes that develop
                into the motile ookinetes. The ookinetes invade and traverse the mosquito midgut
                epithelium and then rest beneath the basal lamina of the midgut, forming oocysts.
                Thousands of sporozoites develop within the oocysts before budding out into the
                circulatory fluid, the hemolymph, and invading the salivary glands. Several effector
                molecules have been tested for their ability to target the parasite during either
                early sporogony in the midgut, or late sporogony in the hemolymph or salivary glands
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Nirmala1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Meredith1">[8]</xref>. An effector mechanism based on the mosquito signaling
                protein Akt is the only one to date shown to inhibit completely <italic>P.
                    falciparum</italic> development in a transgenic <italic>Anopheles</italic>
                mosquito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-CorbyHarris1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One effector molecule strategy exploits the finding that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
                that recognize surface-bound or secreted parasite molecules can inhibit pathogen
                development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Barr1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Yoshida1">[14]</xref>. Two mAbs, 4B7 and 1C3, target parasites early in their
                development within mosquitoes. 4B7 binds <italic>P. falciparum</italic> surface
                protein Pfs25, a molecule expressed on the surface of ookinetes, and inhibits
                parasite development completely when fed to <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in
                a gametocytemic bloodmeal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Barr1">[9]</xref>. In contrast, 1C3 binds a parasite-secreted enzyme,
                    <italic>P. falciparum</italic> chitinase 1, and inhibits oocyst formation of
                    <italic>P. falciparum</italic> when incorporated into infectious bloodmeals
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Li1">[10]</xref>. A third mAb,
                2A10, binds <italic>P. falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite protein (CSP), and when
                pre-incubated with sporozoites, greatly decreases their ability to infect cultured
                hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Hollingdale1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Burkot1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the size and complexity of mAbs exclude them from consideration as potential
                effector molecules, single-chain antibodies (scFvs), which retain the binding
                specificity of a mAb, are much smaller and can be produced from a single
                transcription unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Raag1">[15]</xref>. An scFv targeting the <italic>P. gallinaceum</italic>

                    transcription products in non-blood-fed and blood-fed mosquitoes in all of the
                    established transgenic lines. No significant correlation was seen between
                    transgene copy number and amount of transcription product detected (data not
                    shown). Therefore, the lines m1C3 P4.1, m4B7 25.1 and m2A10 44.1, each of which
                    displayed the highest levels of transcript accumulation in their respective
                    group, were selected for use in all further analyses. Southern blot analyses of

                    transgenes.</p>
        <p>Transgene-specific transcript accumulation profiles detected by RT-PCR were
                    similar in mRNA samples prepared from the dissected midguts of m1C3 P4.1 and

                    3</xref>). Both lines showed constitutive accumulation in midguts from non-blood
                    fed mosquitoes. In addition, each line showed accumulation of their respective
                    mRNAs at 4 hours post-bloodmeal (hPBM), and signals were evident at 12 and 24
                    hPBM. m4B7 transcript also could be detected at low levels at 48 hPBM. No
                    amplification products were produced from mRNA prepared from female carcasses or
                    males of each line. As expected, control reactions using mRNA from midguts
                    dissected at 4 hPBM from wild-type, non-transgenic females were negative.
                    RT-qPCR analysis at multiple post-bloodmeal time points was used as an
                    independent measure of m1C3 P4.1 expression. The highest measured level of m1C3
                    mRNA, 10,000-fold above the control level, was observed in the 16 hPBM midgut
                    sample (paired T-test, one tailed p-value = 0.005), but
                    similar elevated levels also were seen at 24 and 48 hPBM. At this time, we
                    cannot account for the difference in the RT-PCR and RT-qPCR results at 48 hPBM,
                    although this could result from individual females that responded differentially
                    to the feeding regimen. This difference is not expected to have affected the
                    outcome of the challenge experiments because this scFv targets parasites within
                    the first 24 hPBM.</p>

                            m2A10 44.1 transgenic mosquitoes. RNA from wild-type control females was
                            included as both a positive control for <italic>AsVg1</italic>
                            expression and as a negative control for m2A10 44.1 amplification.

        <p>Immunoblot analyses of m1C3 and m4B7 transgenic mosquitoes were unproductive
                    despite repeated attempts. Although high levels of proteinase inhibitors were
                    used during sample preparation, it is possible that the transgene products were
                    degraded quickly in the strong digestive milieu of the post-feeding midgut
                    lumen.</p>
        <p>Transgene transcripts detected in whole transgenic m2A10 44.1 females showed sex-

                        3</xref>). No signals were seen in samples derived from mRNA prepared from
                    males and non-blood fed transgenic or control wild-type, non-transgenic females.
                    Specific transcript accumulation was evident in m2A10 44.1 females at 12 and 24

        <p>While expression of the m1C3 and m4B7 scFvs is necessary only during the first 24
                    hours post-bloodmeal, expression of m2A10 must be sustained over several days,
                    as oocysts can mature asynchronously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Ponnudurai1">[26]</xref>. Denaturing immunoblot
                    analyses were performed on m2A10 44.1 females sampled over the course of four

                    continuous presence of m2A10 was detected in females that were given bloodmeals
                    once every five days. Expression of m2A10 also was observed at 12 hPBM in
                    additional immunoblot analyses (data not shown). Immunoblots of hemolymph
                    samples indicated that m2A10 protein was present in the hemolymph of blood-fed
                    transgenic females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002017-g004">Figure

        <p>Parasite challenge experiments were performed to test the efficacy of the
                    anti-pathogen effector molecules. Transgenic and control mosquitoes ingested
                    blood containing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes through a
                    membrane-feeding apparatus. Control mosquitoes for most experiments were
                    non-transgenic (wild-type) mosquitoes. In addition, the oocyst prevalence and
                    mean intensities of infection of a group of m2A10 44.1 females were examined for
                    each challenge experiment to determine whether transgenesis alone had an impact

        <p>The effect of transgene expression on parasite development for both the m4B7 25.1
                    and m1C3 P4.1 transgenic lines was measured by comparing the number of oocysts
                    in transgenic and control mosquito midguts at nine days after the infectious

                    intensities of oocyst infection were reduced by 37–81% in three

                    intensities of infection were reduced by only 29–36% in two
                    experiments (4 and 5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002017-t001">Table
                        1</xref>) in which control mosquitoes had greater than 17 oocysts per

        <p>Parasite challenge assays of m2A10 44.1 involved dissecting 7–11 mosquitoes
                    of each group 10 days after the infectious bloodmeal to count midgut oocysts and
                    to confirm that both transgenic and control mosquitoes were infected
                    successfully (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002017-t002">Table 2</xref>). No

                    m2A10 44.1 and control mosquitoes was observed (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>
                    test, one-tailed P value, 0.24&lt;p&lt;0.48). The remaining mosquitoes
                    (n = 8–50) in each group were examined 17–19
                    days after infection for the presence of sporozoites in the salivary glands
                        (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002017-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002017-g005">Figure 5</xref>). All mosquitoes were
                    provided an uninfected bloodmeal every five days to maintain expression of
                    m2A10. Engorged and un-engorged females were not separated after the uninfected
                    bloodmeals in experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4, and a 52–84% reduction in
                    mean intensity of sporozoite infection was observed in transgenic mosquitoes
                    when compared to the controls. To obtain a more precise measurement of the

                    additional three experiments (5, 6 and 7) were performed in which un-engorged
                    females were discarded after each uninfected bloodmeal. A 96–97%
                    reduction of mean intensity of infection was observed in m2A10 44.1 mosquitoes
                    that fed every five days. Furthermore, m2A10 44.1 mosquitoes in experiment 7 had
                    a 14% prevalence of infection compared to 78% observed in the
                    corresponding control.</p>

      <p>Previous evaluations of mosquitoes engineered genetically to express
                    anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> effector genes featured analyses of transgene
                copy numbers, transgene transcription levels, detection of transgene effector
                proteins, binding of effector molecules to the target parasite stage and a phenotype
                of reduced parasite mean intensities of infection and prevalence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-CorbyHarris1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Meredith1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Jasinskiene1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Ito1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Moreira1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Kokoza1">[29]</xref>. Remarkably, no
                single study includes all of these data and the emphasis has been on the impact of
                transgene presence on parasite numbers. Expression of the two midgut-directed scFvs,
                m1C3 and m4B7, was detected by RT-PCR, but not by immunoblots. The rapid degradation
                of these scFvs in the midgut environment may have inhibited immunoblot detection.
                However, the observation that m4B7 25.1 and m1C3 P4.1 transgenic mosquitoes have
                reduced parasite loads supports the conclusion that these scFvs are expressed in the
                midgut. Both transgene transcription and translation products were detected in m2A10
                44.1 mosquitoes. The finding that the immunoblot analyses of non-denatured m2A10
                44.1 samples detected the presence of scFv multimers is consistent with the
                expectation that the short polypeptide linker joining the V<sub>H</sub> and
                    V<sub>L</sub> regions promotes intermolecular scFv interactions. The size of
                these multimers was similar to the predicted sizes of m2A10 multimers comprising
                four, seven, nine, and fifteen scFv molecules. Such scFv multimers are reported to
                have high affinity to target epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Hudson1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both m1C3 and m4B7 expressed in transgenic lines P4.1 and 25.1, respectively,
                inhibited parasite development during early sporogony, resulting in significantly
                reduced mean intensities of oocyst infection in eight of ten challenge experiments.
                The results of two of the m4B7 25.1 challenge experiments are consistent with the
                interpretation that there is a threshold level of initial parasite density above
                which this scFv, at the levels expressed in these transgenic lines, cannot
                efficiently inhibit ookinete development. The finding that m2A10 44.1 and wild-type
                control mosquitoes did not differ in midgut infection supports the conclusion that
                transgene integration alone does not necessarily impair parasite development.</p>
      <p>When expression of m2A10 in line 44.1 was induced repeatedly by blood feeding, a
                highly significant decrease in sporozoite load was observed in transgenic mosquito
                salivary glands. For this transgenic line, the greatest reduction in prevalence was
                found in an experiment in which the mean intensity of oocyst infection was low. It
                is likely that these scFvs would effectively impair <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
                transmission in field conditions, as infected wild-caught <italic>An.
                    gambiae</italic> carry few oocysts. Studies of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> by
                Billingsley <italic>et al.</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Billingsley1">[30]</xref> and
                Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Taylor1">[31]</xref> found
                mean numbers of oocysts per infected mosquito of 1.55 and 3.38, respectively.</p>
      <p>Incorporation of multiple transgenes is typical for
                <italic>piggyBac</italic>-mediated insertions into <italic>An. stephensi</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Ito1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Nirmala2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Chen1">[32]</xref>. Although it is
                reasonable to expect that higher transgene copy numbers should yield higher
                expression levels, no statistically-significant correlations have been reported. We
                hypothesize that many of the multiple copies have little or no expression as a
                result of position effects, and that the majority of transgene expression comes from
                single or small numbers of the transgenes. To mitigate copy-number issues, we have
                used <italic>piggy-Bac</italic>-mediated transposition to integrate target sites for
                    <italic>φC31</italic> site-specific recombination into multiple locations
                in the <italic>An. stephensi</italic> genome and are now testing individual lines
                for permissiveness for optimum transgene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Amenya1">[33]</xref>. These lines have the added
                benefit of having been evaluated for the impact on fitness of the introduced
                exogenous DNA at the specific insertion site, and therefore the effects of
                anti-pathogen transgene product expression can be measured directly. Furthermore, we
                are eager to evaluate the phenotype of dual transgenes, for example, those combining
                m4B7 and 2A10 or m1C3 and m2A10, on parasite mean intensities of infection and
                prevalence. Additional studies facilitated by this approach could include testing
                alternate gene regulatory sequences, such as those of the salivary gland-specific
                anopheline antiplatelet protein or the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> adult
                peritrophic matrix protein 1, to measure the effect of different transgene
                expression patterns upon parasite development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Yoshida3">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Abraham1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the scFvs in lines m1C3 P4.1, m4B725.1, and m2A10 44.1 inhibited parasite
                development significantly, no transgenic line displayed zero prevalence of
                infection. It has been demonstrated in an avian malaria model system comprising the
                vertebrate host, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, the mosquito host, <italic>Aedes
                    aegypti</italic>, and the parasite, <italic>P. gallinaceum</italic>, that
                mosquitoes containing as few as 20 sporozoites in their salivary glands infected
                chickens during a blood meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Jasinskiene1">[16]</xref>. This finding supports the conclusion that a target of
                zero prevalence is necessary for a transgenic mosquito to be incapable of disease
                transmission in this system. These results are in contrast to reports of experiments
                with transgenic mosquitoes and a rodent malaria parasite, <italic>P.
                    berghei</italic>, in which the effector molecules SM1, PLA2 and CEL-III show a
                significant inhibition of parasite development (81.6%, 87% and
                84.8%, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Ito1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Moreira1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Yoshida2">[28]</xref>. Reductions of mean intensities of <italic>P.
                    berghei</italic> sporozoite infection in salivary glands below ∼400 were
                sufficient to block transmission. In contrast, experimental infections of humans
                with <italic>P. vivax</italic> showed that 10 sporozoites were sufficient to cause
                malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Ungureanu1">[36]</xref>.
                We have opted to take the conservative approach and are attempting to achieve zero
                prevalence of human parasites in mosquito salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Jasinskiene1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Two anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> effector molecule strategies have yielded
                transgenic mosquitoes with zero prevalence: expression of the signaling molecule
                Akt, and expression of a combination of Cecropin A and Defensin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-CorbyHarris1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Kokoza1">[29]</xref>. The latter
                study was conducted with the <italic>P. gallinaceum</italic>/<italic>Ae.
                    aegypti</italic>/<italic>G. gallus</italic> model system. The study of Akt
                demonstrated the feasibility of producing an <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito
                that is completely resistant to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, however this
                effector molecule may not be an optimal component of a population replacement
                strategy as these mosquitoes have a significantly reduced lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-CorbyHarris1">[7]</xref>. A
                synthetic peptide designed to interact with <italic>P. yoelii</italic> reduced
                midgut infections of this parasite by 67–87% in <italic>An.

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Meredith1">[8]</xref>.
                Quantitative comparisons of the efficacy of alternative effector molecules are
                hindered currently by differences in expression that result from variations in
                transgene location and copy number. Site-specific recombination approaches will
                allow such evaluations in well-characterized ‘docking-site’ mosquito
                strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Meredith1">[8]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002017-Amenya1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The finding that m2A10 44.1 mosquitoes display up to 97% decreases in the mean
                intensity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection, as well as decreased
                prevalence of infection, supports the argument that this scFv may be an effective
                component of a malaria resistance transgene. The m1C3 and m4B7 scFv genes conferred
                significant reductions in mean intensities of infection, and if expressed in higher
                quantities, also may be used in the design of a transgenic, parasite-resistant
                mosquito. Furthermore, expressing the scFv transgenes in additional malaria vectors,
                in particular, <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, and challenging these with a variety of
                    <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates would help evaluate whether these
                effector molecules could be used in multiple transmission areas.</p>
      <p>The discovery and characterization of several effector molecules that completely
                inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> development will support the engineering of
                mosquitoes that express multiple effector molecules. Such mosquitoes may have a
                reduced likelihood of selecting for resistant parasites. Along with vaccines, drugs,
                and insecticide-treated nets, parasite-resistant transgenic mosquitoes would be a
                useful component in a malaria-control strategy, especially in regions where existing
                interventions have been unable to eliminate disease transmission.</p>
