        <p>Over the last decade a significant number of studies have highlighted the central role of host antimicrobial (or defence) peptides in modulating the response of innate immune cells to pathogen-associated ligands. In humans, the most widely studied antimicrobial peptide is LL-37, a 37-residue peptide containing an amphipathic helix that is released via proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein CAP18. Owing to its ability to protect against lethal endotoxaemia and clinically-relevant bacterial infections, LL-37 and its derivatives are seen as attractive candidates for anti-sepsis therapies. We have identified a novel family of molecules secreted by parasitic helminths (helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit similar biochemical and functional characteristics to human defence peptides, particularly CAP18. The HDM secreted by <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> (FhHDM-1) adopts a predominantly Î±-helical structure in solution. Processing of FhHDM-1 by <italic>F. hepatica</italic> cathepsin L1 releases a 34-residue C-terminal fragment containing a conserved amphipathic helix. This is analogous to the proteolytic processing of CAP18 to release LL-37, which modulates innate cell activation by classical toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show that full-length recombinant FhHDM-1 and a peptide analogue of the amphipathic C-terminus bind directly to LPS in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing its interaction with both LPS-binding protein (LBP) and the surface of macrophages. Furthermore, FhHDM-1 and the amphipathic C-terminal peptide protect mice against LPS-induced inflammation by significantly reducing the release of inflammatory mediators from macrophages. We propose that HDMs, by mimicking the function of host defence peptides, represent a novel family of innate cell modulators with therapeutic potential in anti-sepsis treatments and prevention of inflammation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The study of pharmacologically active peptides is central to the understanding of disease and the development of novel therapies. Of particular interest is the array of short cationic peptides, collectively known as antimicrobial (or host defence) peptides. In humans, the most widely studied host defence peptide is LL-37. This Î±-helical peptide is expressed by neutrophils, macrophages and mucosal epithelial cells and modulates the response of innate immune cells to pathogen-associated ligands (such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide). We have identified a novel family of molecules secreted by medically-important helminth pathogens (termed helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit striking structural, biochemical and functional similarities to host defence peptides, including LL-37. HDMs bind LPS preventing the activation of macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that can cause sepsis. We propose that HDMs modulate the immune response via molecular mimicry of host defence peptides, thus creating a unique opportunity for novel anti-infective therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The detection of microbial invasion by cells of the innate immune response (macrophages and dendritic cells; DCs) occurs via receptor recognition of specific microbial molecular patterns (pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PAMPS), such as the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin. Interaction between cell receptors and bacterial PAMPS drives the early immune response and leads to maturation of anti-microbial responses manifested in the production of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12 and TNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Medzhitov1">[1]</xref>. While the production of these cytokines, together with up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on DCs, macrophages, granulocytes and mast cells, is a critical step in the development of appropriate protective adaptive immune responses, an excessive inflammatory response can lead to sepsis, septic shock and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Castellheim1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Giuliani1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Human defence peptides are potent signalling molecules released by cells of the innate immune system in response to cellular stimulation by microbes and pro-inflammatory mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hirsch1">[4]</xref>. Multiple peptides are simultaneously secreted at the site of infection and/or inflammation and work cooperatively to perform broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Doss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Tecle1">[6]</xref>. While it is well recognized that defence peptides participate as direct antimicrobial effectors of innate immunity by disrupting bacterial membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Auvynet1">[7]</xref>, more recent studies suggest that they are also important in the regulation of innate immune responses and are critical in protecting against the detrimental effects of an excessive innate inflammatory response. Thus, defence peptides have been shown to suppress LPS-mediated responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Giuliani1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Murakami1">[8]</xref>, promote phagocytosis while inhibiting oxidant responses of neutrophils or monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Tecle2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Miles1">[10]</xref>, and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages in the presence of bacteria or other non-specific inflammatory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Tecle1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Miles1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated experimentally that intestinal injury and systemic endotoxemia are two factors leading to morbidity in helminth infection of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Herbert1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Leeto1">[12]</xref>. Disruption to the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium and consequently the translocation of luminal antigens (bacteria and their toxins) into the circulation is common to many helminth parasites. Thus, infection with enteric nematodes is characterised by enhanced leakiness of the intestinal epithelium, mediated by activated mast-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-McDermott1">[13]</xref>, which aids the expulsion of the parasite from the host but can lead to the movement of bacterial LPS into the portal circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Farid1">[14]</xref>. Even in non-enteric helminths, such as the schistosomes that reside in the mesenteric veins, damage caused by worm eggs traversing the intestinal epithelium can result in the systemic translocation of bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Herbert1">[11]</xref>; for example, <italic>E. coli</italic> are frequently detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Ferraz1">[15]</xref>. Biliary obstruction due to the growth of <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> worms in the bile ducts increases intraductal pressure leading to the disruption of hepatocellular tight junctions and subsequent translocation of <italic>E. coli</italic> and enterococcus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Ogunrinade1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Valero1">[17]</xref>. Despite such bacterial colonisation, potent host responses such as septicaemia are not common events during helminth infections. While the mechanism of resistance to septicaemia during helminth infection is poorly understood, it is known that innate immune cells rather than those of the adaptive immune system play an essential protective role. For example, mice deficient in the IL-4Î± receptor specifically on macrophages and neutrophils, but not T-cells, experienced high mortality (100%) associated with increased sepsis following infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Herbert1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Leeto1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we describe a novel family of proteins that is secreted by medically-important trematode pathogens. As these proteins display similar functional and biochemical characteristics to the human defence peptides, defensins and cathelicidins, we have termed them helminth defence molecules (HDMs). We have characterised the HDM secreted by <italic>F. hepatica</italic> (FhHDM-1), and show that proteolytic processing of this molecule by a co-secreted cathepsin L1 releases a 34-residue C-terminal fragment containing an amphipathic helix. This amphipathic peptide is conserved amongst the HDMs of the major trematode pathogens of humans and exhibits similar structural features to LL-37, an anti-microbial peptide proteolytically released from the human cathelicidin precursor, CAP18. Recombinant FhHDM-1 and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amphipathic C-terminal fragment bind directly to LPS in a concentration-dependent manner, block its interaction with LPS-binding protein (LPB), and prevent it binding to the surface of macrophages. Furthermore, both FhHDM-1 and the amphipathic C-terminal peptide protect mice against LPS-induced inflammation by significantly reducing the release of inflammatory mediators from macrophages. We propose that HDMs represent a novel family of helminth modulators of host innate immunity that are responsible for preventing the induction of sepsis during infection.</p>

        <p>Fractionation by gel filtration chromatography of proteins secreted by adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> yielded two major peaks, termed PI (&gt;200 kDa) and PII (20â60 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Because of different separation techniques employed in the present study the elution and protein profiles of PI and PII appear slightly different from those presented in our earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Donnelly1">[18]</xref>. We have shown previously that PI contains the anti-oxidant peroxiredoxin (Prx; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Donnelly1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Donnelly2">[19]</xref>). However, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that this fraction contains another major component with a molecular mass around 8 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Whilst it is not fully understood why this 8 kDa protein is the most abundant species in the &gt;200 kDa PI fraction, we suspect that it forms aggregates with other secretory proteins, including peroxiredoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Donnelly1">[18]</xref>. These aggregates are dispersed by RP-HPLC using acetonitrile in the mobile phase allowing the 8kDa protein to be isolated to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lane E). N-terminal sequencing of this band generated a single clean sequence (SEESREKLRE) that matched a putative peptide encoded by several <italic>F. hepatica</italic> ESTs (e.g. HAN3008-1e06.p1k) following tBLASTn analysis. This N-terminal sequence is identical to the first ten amino acids of a sequence reported by McGonigle <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-McGonigle1">[20]</xref> within a high molecular mass fraction of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> secretory proteins, although the identity of the protein remained elusive until the present study.</p>

Fractions collected following gel filtration and RP-HPLC were run on reducing 4â12% Bis-Tris gels (B) and showed that a prominent â¼ 6 kDa protein present in total adult secretory proteins (S) was enriched in PI and purified to homogeneity (&gt;95%) following RP-HPLC (E). (C) Western blot of adult fluke secretions probed with an anti-FhHDM-1 antibody. P, pre-immune sera; T, test bleed. (D) N-terminal sequencing and LC-MS/MS analysis of the native â¼ 6 kDa protein generated peptide sequence information that allowed cloning of the cDNA, termed FhHDM-1. The primary amino acid sequence of FhHDM-1 derived from conceptual translation of the cDNA is shown. The predicted N-terminal signal peptide is shown in italics and the actual N-terminal of the native protein is shown by an arrow. The SEESREKLRE sequence generated by N-terminal sequencing is boxed in grey and a peptide (<italic>m/z</italic> 642.93; ITEVITILLNR) matched by LC-MS/MS following tryptic digest of the native protein is underlined.

        <title>FhHDM-1 oligomerisation is enhanced at low pH</title>
        <p>Despite having a molecular mass of 8 kDa, native FhHDM-1 is found within a high molecular mass fraction (PI; &gt;200 kDa) following gel filtration of adult <italic>Fasciola</italic> secretory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Therefore, analytical ultracentrifugation was performed to investigate the quaternary structure of recombinant FhHDM-1 (<italic>M<sub>r</sub></italic>â=â9277.6) in aqueous solution. Sedimentation velocity studies were employed at an initial protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml at pH 4.5 and pH 7.3. The absorbance versus radial position profiles of FhHDM-1 at pH 4.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002042.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, bottom panel) and pH 7.3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002042.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, bottom panel) show a predominantly single sedimenting boundary suggesting the samples are primarily homogeneous. However, there is a small proportion of a slower sedimenting boundary in the sample buffered at pH 4.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002042.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, bottom panel). To confirm the presence of multiple species, the absorbance versus radial position data at different time points were fitted to a continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Perugini1">[29]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Schuck2">[31]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This yielded excellent fits for all samples as represented by the random distribution of residuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002042.s001">Figure S1A and B</xref>, top) and the excellent statistical parameters resulting (i.e. rmsd values &lt;0.0063 and Runs test Z values &lt;8.8). From the ordinate maximum of the distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, the standardized sedimentation coefficient (<italic>s</italic><sub>20,w</sub>) of FhHDM-1 at pH 7.3 is 2.5 S, whilst at pH 4.5, the <italic>s</italic><sub>20,w</sub> values of the two peaks observed in the <italic>c(s)</italic> distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002042.s003">Table S2</xref>) are 3.1 S (major species) and 2.0 S (minor species). The equivalent continuous mass [<italic>c(M)</italic>]-distribution analyses of the same data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) suggest that the 2.5 S species at pH 7.3 is a trimer, whereas the 2.0 S species and predominant 3.1 S species at pH 4.5 correspond to dimers and pentamers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, solid line; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002042.s003">Table S2</xref>). However, the broad <italic>c(s)</italic> and <italic>c(M)</italic> distributions at pH 4.5 is more likely to indicate that the sample exists as a mixture of dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers and potentially hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g005">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>, solid lines).

        <title>FhHDM-1 exhibits structural similarity to human defence molecules</title>
        <p>The unusual helical nature of FhHDM-1 provided the impetus to conduct a bioinformatic search for small molecules with a similar structure. Helical wheel analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kael.net/helical.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://kael.net/helical.htm</ext-link>) revealed the presence of an amphipathic helix within this C-terminal region for all the trematode HDMs; for FhHDM-1 this is comprised of residues 69-89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). This is supported by the CD spectroscopy studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This amphipathic helix is found in many small peptide antimicrobials and defensins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hancock1">[32]</xref>. Further probing discovered a striking structural similarity between the HDMs and the human defence molecule CAP18. CAP18 is larger than FhHDM-1 (170 as opposed to 90 residues) but regions of conservation exist between the two molecules throughout their lengths. Most importantly, the C-terminal regions of both molecules exhibit high conservation, with a signature motif EKI[X<sub>9</sub>]R[X<sub>2</sub>]D[X]L. It is known that CAP18 is secreted and undergoes cleavage in this C-terminal region by endogenous proteases to release the bioactive 37-residue peptide LL-37 containing an amphipathic helix. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g002">Figure 2</xref>, this helical structure is also found in FhHDM-1 and conserved in other trematode HDMs.</p>

Analysis of the reactions by SDS-PAGE showed that, at pH 4.5, the 9.2 kDa band corresponding to full-length recombinant FhHDM-1 had decreased in intensity concurrent with the appearance of a number of smaller protein fragments, notably, a prominent band with a molecular mass of â¼8.5 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The putative degradation products did not react with an anti-His antibody suggesting that the C-terminal region of the recombinant FhHDM-1 had been removed. Furthermore, an anti-FhHDM-1 antibody detected a number of the smaller protein fragments, suggesting that the full-length protein had been cleaved by FhCL1 at pH 4.5. In contrast, FhHDM-1 was not processed by FhCL1 under identical incubation conditions at pH 7.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The FhHDM-1 fragments produced by cathepsin L were analysed by MALDI TOF MS. Several minor peaks were found, but the major masses detected were matched to full-length recombinant FhHDM-1 Â± the C-terminal His-tag (m/z 9272.88 and 8450.53, respectively) and a 37-amino acid C-terminal fragment (m/z 4232.44) created by cleavage after Arg<sub>56</sub> (native peptide numbering; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Whilst the N-terminal fragment created by cleavage after Arg<sub>56</sub> also matched this mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), the presence of a C-terminal FhHDM-1 peptide in the â¼3.5 kDa band found in the Vivaspin filter flow-through supports its identification as the C-terminal fragment. Based on this putative cleavage site, a 34-residue synthetic peptide (FhHDM-1 p2) corresponding to this C-terminal region of the molecule was designed for subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). It is noteworthy that the cathepsin L cleavage site that produces the FhHDM-1 p2 peptide is, based on primary sequence alignments, only one amino acid N-terminal to the proteolytic cleavage of human CAP18 that releases the bio-active LL-37 peptide (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>A major function of human LL-37 is the neutralisation of bacterial LPS. Given the structural similarity between FhHDM-1 and CAP18/LL-37, the ability of FhHDM-1 and derived peptides to likewise bind LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> 0111:B4 was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g007">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Both full-length native and recombinant FhHDM-1 bound to LPS via specific interaction with its secondary structure. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by an un-related recombinant protein (expressed/purified in the same manner as FhHDM-1) that displayed less than 25% of the LPS binding shown by FhHDM-1 (data not shown). Furthermore, recombinant FhHDM-1 and the C-terminal peptide FhHDM-1 p2 (containing the complete amphipathic helix) bound to LPS in a concentration-dependent manner. However, peptide FhHDM-1 p1, in which the amphipathic helix is truncated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), did not bind to LPS. The specific interaction between FhHDM-1 and LPS was supported by experiments in which FhHDM-1 and FhHDM-1 p2 were mixed with increasing concentrations of LPS during the ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, both molecules bound to free LPS in solution and were therefore unable to bind LPS immobilised on the ELISA plate.</p>

            <p>(A) Alignment of full-length FhHDM-1 with peptide 1 (FhHDM-1 p1) and peptide 2 (FhHDM-1 p2). The conserved C-terminal amphipathic helix is shaded in grey. (B) The ability of native and recombinant FhHDM-1 to bind LPS was investigated by incubating the proteins (2 Âµg/well) in an LPS-coated (100 ng/well) microtitre plate. Bound proteins were detected by ELISA using rabbit anti-FhHDM-1 as a primary antibody. BSA was used as a baseline control. Whilst trypsinising the recombinant FhHDM-1 significantly reduced the LPS interaction, boiling had no effect. (C) The ability of recombinant FhHDM-1 (Î), FhHDM-1 p1 (â¢) or FhHDM-1 p2 (âª) to bind to LPS was investigated by incubating a range of concentrations of proteins (0.02â2 Âµg/well) in this assay. (D) FhHDM-1 or derived peptides (0.1 Âµg) were incubated in the presence of LPS (0.05-5 Âµg/well) and bound peptides measured as described above. Binding of peptides to the LPS-immobilised plates was expressed as a percentage of that measured for 2 Âµg (for panel C) or 0.1 Âµg (for panel D) of FhHDM-1. Data are the means Â± SD from three separate experiments. (E) FhHDM-1 and FhHDM-1 p2 but not FhHDM-1 p1 reduced the interaction between LPS and LBP as effectively as LL-37. LPS-coated microtitre plates were incubated with 5 Âµg/well of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> ES, LL-37, FhHDM-1 or derived peptides for 1 h prior to the addition of 10% human sera in PBS. Interaction of LBP with LPS was measured by ELISA using an anti-LBP primary antibody and expressed as a percentage of that detected for 10% sera in the absence of added peptides. Data are the mean Â± SD of three separate experiments. Statistical significance was calculated using the student t-test and represent a comparison to the binding of 10% sera to immobilised LPS. (F) Binding of FITC-conjugated LPS to RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by LL-37, FhHDM-1 and peptides. RAW264.7 cells (5Ã10<sup>5</sup>cells/ml) were incubated with 100 ng/ml of FITC-conjugated LPS in the presence of FhHDM-1, FhHDM-1 p1, FhHDM-1 p2 and LL-37 (5 Âµg/ml) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS for 20 min at 4Â°C. The binding of FITC-LPS was analysed by flow cytometry. Values represent percentage inhibition of FITC-LPS binding compared to cells in the absence of peptides.

        <p>The ability of FhHDM-1 and derived peptides to block the interaction of LPS with LPB was assessed by ELISA using an anti-LBP primary antibody. Since it is a well-characterised Î±-helical defence peptide, human LL-37 was used for comparison.

        <p>The effect of FhHDM-1 and derived peptides on the binding of FITC-LPS to CD14+ cells was determined by flow cytometry of the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. The assay was performed at 4Â°C to inhibit endocytosis, thus ensuring that only cell-surface interactions were observed. FITC-LPS bound to RAW264.7 cells strongly in the absence of parasite molecules or LL-37 and this binding was inhibited (70% inhibition) by LL-37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). FhHDM-1 p2 (58% inhibition) and full-length FhHDM-1 (29% inhibition) also considerably reduced FITC-LPS binding when used at 5 Âµg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). In contrast, incubation with FhHDM-1 p1 increased FITC-LPS binding to the cell surface by 29%.</p>

        <title>Recombinant FhHDM-1 and FhHDM-1 p2 prevent LPS-induced inflammatory response in mice</title>
        <p>By inhibiting the interaction between bacterial LPS and macrophages, FhHDM-1 and derived peptides are predicted to prevent the activation of an inflammatory immune response. To investigate this, BALB/c mice were injected intra-peritoneally with 1 Âµg of LPS alone or LPS combined with 1 Âµg of FhHDM-1, FhHDM-1 p3 or LL-37. Serum was collected 2 h later, and levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators TNF and IL-1Î² were measured by ELISA. As expected, a single dose of LPS increased the levels of both TNF and IL-1Î² in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). However, when mixed with FhHDM-1, FhHDM-1 p2 or LL-37, LPS failed to induce an equivalent immune response, with levels of serum TNF and IL-1Î² significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). Because macrophages are the main source of pro-inflammatory mediators in this murine model of inflammation, we examined whether the decrease in circulating cytokines could be attributed to a reduction in the activation of macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from treated mice (LPS Â± FhHDM-1, peptides or LL-37 as described above), and the quantity of TNF and IL-1Î² secreted into culture media over 16 h was measured by ELISA. Correlating with the sera data, macrophages isolated from mice injected with LPS alone showed elevated levels of both TNF and IL-1Î² compared to PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g008">Figure 8C and 8D</xref>) whereas production of TNF was decreased in the presence of FhHDM-1 or FhHDM-1 p2. Interestingly, LL-37 did not have a significant effect on LPS-induced secretion of TNF from macrophages in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). This contrasts with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Nagaoka1">[36]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Bowdish1">[38]</xref> but may be due to a number of experimental differences such as the doses of LPS and LL-37 given, the serotype of LPS, and the time of cellular isolation. In addition, the full-length recombinant FhHDM-1 or LL-37 (but not FhHDM-1 p2) also reduced the release of IL-1Î² from peritoneal macrophages in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002042-g008">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using proteomics and database mining we have identified a novel family of secretory proteins from trematode pathogens (termed helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit similar biochemical and functional characteristics to human defence peptides.</p>
      <p>Host defence (also termed antimicrobial) peptides represent an evolutionarily conserved component of innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Boman1">[39]</xref>. Their potent antimicrobial activity has led to suggestions that they are involved not only in suppressing inflammation in the presence of pathogenic challenge, but also in maintaining homeostasis by limiting inflammatory responses that could otherwise be triggered by the presence of commensals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Mookherjee1">[40]</xref>. They are widely distributed in nature, from insects and plants to highly evolved animal species with more complex immune systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Schauber1">[41]</xref>. Although the peptides identified to date show considerable diversity in their lengths, structures and activities, they are all generally amphipathic, possessing both cationic (positively charged) and hydrophobic faces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Gennaro1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Risso1">[43]</xref>. These features bestow the peptides with antimicrobial activity by facilitating interactions with negatively charged microbial cell membrane components (e.g., phospholipids), thereby increasing membrane permeability and resulting in microbial death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hancock2">[44]</xref>. Owing to the lack of primary sequence similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hancock1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Mookherjee2">[45]</xref>, peptides are broadly classified based on secondary structure as cathelicidins (linear Î±-helical peptides), defensins (Î²-strand peptides connected by disulfide bonds), and bactenecins (loop peptides) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hazlett1">[46]</xref>. Using this classification, the 8 kDa protein (FhHDM-1) secreted by <italic>F. hepatica</italic> could be termed a cathelicidin as CD spectroscopy studies indicate that both native and recombinant FhHDM-1 have a high propensity to adopt Î±-helical structure in the presence or absence of helix-stabilising agents in both neutral and acidic pH conditions.</p>
      <p>In humans, the most widely studied cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed by neutrophils, macrophages and mucosal epithelial cells in response to stimulation by microbes and proinflammatory mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Mookherjee2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Durr1">[47]</xref>. LL-37 is secreted as an inactive precursor protein known as CAP18 that undergoes cleavage by endogenous proteases to release the bioactive 37-residue peptide LL-37 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Agerberth1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Gudmundsson1">[49]</xref>. Similarly, the secreted FhHDM-1 can be processed by the major cysteine protease (cathepsin L1; FhCL1) from <italic>F. hepatica</italic> to release a C-terminal peptide fragment. Despite having activity over a broad pH range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Lowther1">[50]</xref> FhCL1 could only process FhHDM-1 at pH 4.5, which is similar to the pH of the <italic>Fasciola</italic> gut lumen. Similarly, FhCL1 can only digest host haemoglobin at pHâ¤4.5 as relaxation of the haemoglobin structure at acidic pH makes it susceptible to proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Lowther1">[50]</xref>. It is unlikely that local relaxation of the FhHDM-1 structure accounts for its proteolysis at low pH since it adopts almost identical solution structures at both pH 4.5 and pH 7.3. Moreover, full-length FhHDM-1 and its C-terminal fragment were both found in native fluke secretions, suggesting that not all FhHDM-1 molecules are cleaved in the parasite gut. The greater propensity of FhHDM-1 to oligomerise at low pH (predominantly existing as pentamers) may render individual FhHDM-1 molecules inaccessible to the active site of FhCL1 thus offering some degree of protection against proteolysis. Whilst FhCL1 is the most abundant protease secreted by adult flukes, is it possible that other cathepsin cysteine proteases (e.g. FhCL2, FhCL5 and cathepsin B) could also process FhHDM-1 <italic>in vivo.</italic> It is also possible that FhHDM-1 may be cleaved by host proteases at neutral pH. This would be an ideal mechanism for regulating the activity of the secreted parasite molecule until it reaches its site of action on/within host cells.</p>
      <p>Residues 13â34 of LL-37 form an amphipathic helix that anchors the peptide to phospholipid membranes via interaction with its hydrophobic face <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Agerberth1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Porcelli1">[51]</xref> and is important for its antimicrobial ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Giuliani1">[3]</xref>. In addition to these potent bactericidal activities, LL-37 can also bind to LPS and neutralize its biological activities. Among the host defence peptides, only the cathelicidin CAP18-derived peptides (human and rabbit) and CAP11 display an ability to bind to LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Nagaoka1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Kirikae1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Larrick1">[53]</xref>. In contrast, defensins exhibit little, if any, LPS-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Nagaoka1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hancock3">[54]</xref>. It has been suggested that it is the amphipathic helical structure of the cathelicidin peptides that is critical for interacting with LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hoess1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Porro1">[56]</xref>. Indeed, LL-37-derived peptides covering residues 13â34 are as effective as full-length LL-37 with respect to LPS binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Nell1">[57]</xref>. The 34-residue C-terminal peptide of FhHDM-1 released by cleavage with FhCL1 contains a 21-residue amphipathic helix which confers a striking structural parallel with the bioactive LL-37 peptide. In addition, a peptide (FhHDM-1 p2) derived from the C-terminal of FhHDM-1 containing the complete amphipathic helix binds <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS in a concentration-dependent manner. In stark contrast, a second peptide, FhHDM-1 p1, in which the amphipathic helix is truncated, did not bind LPS. Although recognising FhHDM-1, sera isolated from sheep at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-infection with <italic>F. hepatica</italic> did not block binding of FhHDM-1 to LPS (data not shown). This is likely as a result of the sera binding the non-amphipathic region of the molecule, and the amphipathic helix remaining free to interact with LPS. Thus, the amphipathic helix of FhHDM-1, like LL-37, is a key functional determinant necessary for its biological properties.</p>
      <p>Bacterial LPS is recognized as a key molecule in the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock associated with gram-negative bacterial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Castellheim1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Morrison1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Lehmann1">[59]</xref>. By binding to LPS, LL-37 successfully neutralises its biological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Kirikae1">[52]</xref>. Similarly, FhHDM-1 targets key stages in LPS-mediated cell signalling. The first event in the recognition of microbial infection is the transfer of LPS to cellular CD14 by serum LPS-binding protein (LBP). This LPS-CD14 complex then initiates downstream signalling via interaction with cellular TLRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Beutler1">[60]</xref>, which results in the secretion of inflammatory mediators. By binding directly to LPS, FhHDM-1 and FhHDM-1 p2 blocked the interaction of LPS with LBP, thus effectively reducing the number of LPS molecules that are targeted to the TLR signalling complex on the macrophage cell surface. This in turn prevents LPS-induced activation of macrophages. Therefore, FhHDM-1, and its conserved C-terminal region, just like human LL-37, impair LPS signalling and protect against harmful immune responses by reducing the release of inflammatory mediators from macrophages. In contrast, FhHDM-1 p1 increased FITC-LPS binding to the surface of RAW264.7 macrophages by 29%. Enhanced LPS binding to immune cells has previously been observed for other proteins such as bactericidal/permeability increasing protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Schultz1">[61]</xref> and surfactant protein A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Stamme1">[62]</xref> but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon for any of these immunomodulatory peptides/proteins has yet to be determined. One possible explanation is that some molecules induce mobilization (and surface expression) of LPS-binding proteins from intracellular vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Weersink1">[63]</xref>.</p>
      <p>By preventing the activation of innate immune responses by LPS, the helminth parasite enhances the survival of the host and thus its own longevity. As mentioned in the introduction, the translocation of intestinal bacteria into circulation is common during many helminth infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Herbert1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-McDermott1">[13]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Ferraz1">[15]</xref>. Despite this movement of enteric microbes, fatal septicaemia during infection with trematodes including <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is not a common occurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Onguru1">[64]</xref>. Indeed, there are, as yet, no reports of such in intestinal nematodes. In addition, in areas endemic for helminth parasites, co-infection with gram-negative bacteria, most commonly <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp., is common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Melhem1">[65]</xref>. This results in a protracted clinical course of bacterial disease and yet patients show atypical symptoms of typhoid fever displaying only intermittent fever and chills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Tai1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Gendrel1">[67]</xref>. The reason why the helminth-infected host does not respond to such increases in potentially harmful microbes is not fully understood. One explanation given is that the conversion of macrophages to an alternatively activated phenotype during helminth infection renders them unresponsive to subsequent Th1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Kreider1">[68]</xref>. However, other reports suggest that macrophages are not terminally differentiated but display some degree of plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Gordon1">[69]</xref>. Moreover, despite long-term exposure to Th2 cytokines in vivo during a helminth infection, macrophages are nevertheless responsive to LPS, developing a classically activated phenotype characterised by the expression of iNOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Mylonas1">[70]</xref>. Other studies demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 can prime macrophages for secondary microbial challenge leading to enhanced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Varin1">[71]</xref>. Therefore, during a helminth infection it is likely that a wide spectrum of macrophage phenotypes exists, displaying varying degrees of responsiveness to bacterial ligands. We propose that the active secretion of FhHDM-1 by the parasite throughout its time in the mammalian host ensures that potentially lethal LPS, either from intestinal flora or from microbial co-infections, is neutralised and that LPS-mediated activation of macrophages is controlled. Consequently, excessive inflammatory responses are avoided and the survival of the host, and therefore the parasite, are prolonged.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that the HDMs show homology with the C-terminal region of the Sm16 protein from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and its <italic>S. japonicum</italic> homologues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Brnnstrm1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hu1">[73]</xref>. Like FhHDM-1, Sm16 forms oligomers, modulates LPS-mediated TLR signalling in human monocytes (albeit via a different mechanism to the HDMs) and its biological activity is mediated by its C-terminal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Brnnstrm1">[72]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the HDMs and the Sm16-like molecules evolved from a common ancestral protein and represent sub-clades of a larger family of helminth innate cell modulators. Our discovery of a family of HDMs that is conserved amongst medically-important trematode pathogens that modulate the immune response via molecular mimicry of host defence peptides provides a common mechanism for the anti-inflammatory properties of helminth infection.</p>
      <p>While many cationic amphiphilic compounds are being developed as therapeutics based on their potent antimicrobial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hadley1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Jenssen1">[75]</xref>, only derivatives of LL-37 have been proposed as attractive candidates for anti-sepsis therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002042-Hancock1">[32]</xref>. Our discovery of a novel family of HDMs derived from worm parasites provides a new pool of bio-active peptides that may have unique pharmacological properties with prospects for the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics.</p>
