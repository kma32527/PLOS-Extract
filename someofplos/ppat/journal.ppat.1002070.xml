        <p>Rhinovirus (RV) is the most frequent cause of acute respiratory tract infection in humans. RV has emerged as the most frequent pathogen associated with exacerbations of asthma. However, the mechanisms by which RV causes asthma flare-ups are not precisely known. We studied the requirements of two receptors which bind viral double-stranded RNA, melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)-5 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, for RV-induced airway responses using specific knockout mice. We found that MDA5 and TLR3 deficiencies had modest effects on viral titer. However, MDA5 and TLR3 knockout mice showed significantly reduced airway inflammation and responsiveness in response to RV infection. Mice with allergic airways disease also showed reduced airway responses. These results suggest that, in the context of RV infection, TLR3 and MDA5 initiate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways which lead to airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rhinovirus (RV) is the most frequent cause of acute respiratory tract infection in humans. RV infection is typically responsible for upper respiratory symptoms including rhinorrhea, sore throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, and headache. More importantly, RV has emerged as the most frequent pathogen associated with exacerbations of asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Nicholson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Johnston1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>RV is a positive sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus from the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. After endocytosis, RV RNA is inserted into the cytosol, where viral replication occurs. During replication, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediate is formed which represents an important stimulus of the host innate immune response. The mechanisms by which RV causes asthma exacerbations are not fully established, but current evidence indicates that the immune response is critical in this process. The first line of defense against RV infection is the innate immune system. Innate pathogen sensors detect viral products and respond by initiating a signaling cascade that leads to a rapid antiviral response involving secretion of interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. RV induces the expression of both type I (<italic>e.g.</italic>, IFN-α, IFN-β) and type III IFNs (in mice, IFN-λ2/IL-28A, IFN-λ3/IL-28B). Though they signal through the engagement of different receptor complexes, the intracellular signaling program activated by type I and type III IFNs is very similar, as evidenced by the cellular gene expression profiles induced after stimulation with IFN-λ versus IFN-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Doyle1">[3]</xref>. However, whereas the type I receptor complex is expressed ubiquitously, the type III receptor is only expressed in few cell types, notably epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Sommereyns1">[4]</xref>. The preferential expression of IFN-λ receptors on epithelial surfaces may allow the host to rapidly control and perhaps eliminate viruses at the major portals of entry into the body before infection is established, and without activating other arms of the immune system.</p>
      <p>Several pattern recognition receptors have been shown to be responsible for binding viral dsRNA and initiating the IFN response. Retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)-5 are homologous proteins located within the cytoplasm, whereas Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 is located mainly on the endosomal membrane and plasma membrane. RIG-I has been shown to preferentially recognize 5′ phosphorylated short dsRNA, whereas MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Hornung1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Pichlmair1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Kato1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Saito1">[8]</xref>. Thus, RIG-I has been shown to detect negative-strand viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and paramyxovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Liu1">[9]</xref>, as well as some positive-strand flaviviruses. In comparison, MDA5 has been shown to selectively detect positive-strand viruses including picornaviruses (encephalomyocarditis virus, Mengo virus and Theiler's virus). Previously, we demonstrated in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells that MDA5 and TIR-domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF), the adaptor protein for TLR3, are each required for maximal RV1B-induced IFN responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Knockdown of RIG-I had no effect on IFN responses. TRIF, but not MDA5, was required for maximal pro-inflammatory cytokine expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Wang1">[10]</xref>. TLR3 is partially required for HRV39-induced IL-8 expression in 16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Sajjan1">[11]</xref>, as well as HRV1A-induced MUC5AC expression in NCI-H292 mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Zhu1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies may not truly represent the complicated situation <italic>in vivo</italic>, where multiple cell types are involved. Further, the overall airway response to viral infection likely represents a coordinated response integrating both antiviral and pro-inflammatory pathways. For example, it has been proposed that asthmatics are susceptible to RV infection due to deficient IFN production. RV-infected airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects show impaired production of IFN-β and -λ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Wark1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Contoli1">[14]</xref> and asthmatics experimentally infected with RV16 showed a reduced IFN-γ/IL-5 mRNA ratio in their sputum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Gern1">[15]</xref>. According to the theory, reduced IFN responses, in turn, lead to increased viral-mediated inflammation. However, it is also conceivable that reduced RV-induced IFN responses are coupled with attenuated airways inflammation and responsiveness. For example, pneumovirus-infected IFNα/β receptor null mice show fewer BAL leukocytes and prolonged survival despite increased virus titers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Garvey1">[16]</xref>. To address these questions, we examined the airway responses of TLR3- and MDA5-deficient mice to infection with RV1B, a minor group virus which replicates in mouse lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Newcomb1">[17]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Effects of MDA5 and TLR3 deficiencies on RV1B-induced type I and type III IFNresponses</title>
        <p>Our previous studies in cultured airway epithelial cells demonstrated that MDA5 and TRIF, the adaptor protein for TLR3, are required for maximal RV-induced IFN expression. However, while the airway epithelium is a major target of RV infection, other cell types such as monocytes and macrophages may also be infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Nagarkar1">[18]</xref>. To determine whether MDA5 and TLR3 are required for RV1B-induced airway IFN responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, we studied MDA5−/− mice, TLR3−/− mice, and their strain-matched controls. Mice were inoculated intranasally with sham HeLa cell lysate, replication-deficient UV-irradiated RV1B or intact RV1B. Lungs were harvested at 4–96 h after infection. RV1B infection caused a significant induction of the expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) in control mice compared to sham or UV-RV1B inoculated mice. However, MDA5−/− mice showed minimal type I IFN responses 4 and 24 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g001">Figures 1a, 1b</xref>). The IFN-β protein response 24 h after infection was also significantly decreased in MDA5−/− mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g001">Figure 1e</xref>). Interestingly, by 48 h post infection, when the type I IFN expression in RV1B-infected control mice was essentially over, MDA5−/− mice showed robust but delayed type I IFN response. In contrast, the expression of type III IFNs (IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3) in RV1B-infected MDA5−/− mice was significantly lower than that of control mice throughout the time course studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g001">Figures 1c, 1d</xref>). These data suggest that the regulation of type I and type III IFN differ in the context of RV infection.</p>

        <p>In contrast to MDA5 null mice, there was no difference in type I IFNs or type III IFNs expression between TLR3−/− mice and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002070.s001">Figures S1a–e</xref>). IFNs-α, -β, -λ2 and -λ3 each showed brisk responses following RV1B infection of TLR3−/− mice. Taken together, these data suggest that both type I and type III IFNs are partially dependent on MDA5, but not TLR3, for their induction.</p>

        <title>MDA5 regulates viral titer</title>
        <p>To determine whether MDA5 plays a role in viral clearance, we determined lung viral titer and copy number by plaque assay and qPCR, respectively. As we have observed previously, control mice showed a modest increase in lung viral titer and copy number 24 h after infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Newcomb1">[17]</xref>, indicating a small amount of viral replication.

Viral titer and copy number were not significantly different between the two groups at 48 h.

Since RV1B-infected MDA5−/− and TLR3−/− mice each showed significant reductions in lung neutrophils and the CXCR2 ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2, we hypothesized that RV1B-infected knockout mice would show reduced airway responses to methacholine compared to control mice. As noted previously, RV1B-infected control mice displayed significantly higher airways responses to methacholine compared to sham-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g006">Figures 6c, 6d</xref>). However, compared to sham-inoculated mice, RV1B-induced airway responses were not elevated in MDA5−/− and TLR3−/− mice. Together, these results demonstrate that MDA5 and TLR3 signaling initiates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Thus, MDA5- and TLR3-driven innate immune responses to RV are responsible for airway dysfunction in this model.</p>

        <title>MDA5 is required for maximal RV1B-induced type I and III IFN responses in mice with allergic airways disease</title>
        <p>Since RV is the most frequent pathogen associated with asthma exacerbations, we sought to examine the effect of MDA5 deficiency, which affected both RV-induced inflammatory and IFN responses, on mice that were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), a commonly-used model of allergic airways disease. Wild-type and MDA5−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS or a solution of alum and OVA, and then challenged intranasally with PBS or OVA. Mice were infected with RV1B immediately following the last OVA or PBS treatment. Lung inflammatory and IFN responses were measured as previously described in non-allergic, naïve mice. Twenty-four h after infection, RV1B-infected OVA-treated wild-type mice displayed significantly increased levels of IFN-β, IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 expression compared to sham-inoculated OVA-treated mice. IFN responses were severely diminished in RV1B-infected OVA-treated MDA5−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g007">Figures 7a–c</xref>). Consistent with our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Nagarkar1">[18]</xref>, after ovalbumin sensitization and challenge, both control and MDA5−/− mice showed significantly lower viral titers compared to non-allergic mice, indicating either enhanced viral clearance or perhaps a failure of the virus to establish infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g007">Figure 7d</xref>). However, there was no difference observed between OVA-treated control or MDA5−/− mice with respect to viral titers. Thus, in the context of allergic inflammation, MDA5-deficient mice showed reduced viral titers, similar to wild-type mice, despite an abnormal IFN response.</p>

Thus, as expected, sham-infected OVA treated wild-type mice showed more lung inflammation than sham-infected or RV1B-infected naïve wild-type mice. Baseline levels of cytokines (CXCL2/MIP-2, CXCL1/KC, IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1, IFN-γ and CCL11/eotaxin-1) were increased in the lungs of sham-infected OVA-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g008">Figure 8</xref>) compared to the naïve, non-allergic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g004">Figures 4a, 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002070.s003">S3</xref>). Twenty-four h after RV1B infection, CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2, IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1 and IFN-γ expression in wild-type mice increased 3–5 fold. MDA5 deficiency significantly reduced the induction of CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2, IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1 and IFN-γ. The expression of CCL11/eotaxin-1 mRNA was not significantly elevated 24 h after infection and was not different between control and MDA5−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002070-g008">Figure 8f</xref>).

The ultimate host response is likely to be an integration of both IFN and pro-inflammatory responses. Because viral infections, in particular RV, are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations, we examined the roles of the pattern recognition receptors TLR3 and MDA5 in the response to RV infection. We found that both TLR3 and MDA5 were required for RV1B-induced maximal inflammatory responses and airways cholinergic hyperresponsiveness <italic>in vivo</italic>. MDA5 mice also showed a delayed type I IFN and attenuated type III IFN response to RV1B infection, leading to a transient increase in viral titer. Further, MDA5 null mice with allergic airways disease showed reduced viral titers compared to non-allergic mice despite deficient IFN responses, and allergic MDA5 and TLR3 null mice each showed decreased RV-induced airway inflammatory and contractile responses. Together, these results suggest that TLR3 and MDA5 individually initiate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to airways inflammation and cholinergic hyperresponsiveness.</p>
      <p>Mice lacking TLRs have been shown to display diverse viral infectious phenotypes depending on the host gene-pathogen combination.

In response to coxsackievirus B4 infection, TLR3−/− mice produce less pro-inflammatory mediators and are unable to control viral replication at the early stages of infection, resulting in severe cardiac damage and reduced survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Richer1">[26]</xref>. Compared to wild-type mice, TLR3−/− mice show increased airway mucus, airways responsiveness and IL-13 expression with RSV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Rudd1">[27]</xref>, suggesting that TLR3 signaling may be protective against airway pathology with this virus. On the other hand, other studies have suggested that TLR3 plays a detrimental role upon viral infection. Despite an increased viral load, influenza A virus-infected TLR3−/− animals display significantly reduced pro-inflammatory mediators, suggesting that TLR3 critically contributes to a detrimental host inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-LeGoffic1">[28]</xref>. In addition, TLR3 signaling has also been reported to have a detrimental effect in phlebovirus and vaccinia infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Gowen1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Hutchens1">[30]</xref>. TRIF−/− mice challenged with dsRNA display decreased airway responsiveness and pulmonary inflammation compared to control mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Torres1">[31]</xref>. The precise role of TLR3 in West Nile virus infections is uncertain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Wang2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Daffis1">[33]</xref>. Our study demonstrated that, as with influenza infection, TLR3−/− mice display decreased airway neutrophilic inflammation upon RV1B infection, resulting in a significantly lower airways cholinergic responsiveness, suggesting for the first time that TLR3 signaling is responsible for airway dysfunction following RV infection.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the effect of TLR3 deficiency on airways inflammation, TLR3 null mice showed normal IFN production. However, MDA5−/− mice displayed a reduction in type I IFN expression after RV1B infection, leading to a transient increase in viral load and copy number 24 h after infection. MDA5−/− mice displayed increased IFN-α/β expression 48 h after RV1B infection, suggesting a delayed onset of IFN signaling. We speculate that this was due to either the compensatory activation of another host pattern recognition receptor, or the dysregulation of normal innate immune system activation in the absence of MDA5-mediated signaling. On the other hand, MDA5 null mice showed a persistent defect in the expression of type III IFNs. These data suggest that type III IFN responses are a less critical host defense against RV1B infection and are regulated independently of type I IFN responses. In support of this concept, IFN-λ is not required for immunity to influenza in wild-type mice, though it protects influenza-infected IFN-α/β knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Mordstein1">[34]</xref>, suggesting that type III IFNs play a secondary and redundant antiviral role in innate immunity. Together, these data suggest that MDA5 rather than TLR3 is the primary receptor responsible for the initial IFN response to RV infection, and that type I IFNs play a role in the containment of RV infection.</p>
      <p>In addition to decreased IFN responses, MDA5−/− mice also displayed reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2 and IL-6. The coupling of IFN and pro-inflammatory responses in MDA5-deficient mice has been observed in other studies. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from MDA5−/− mice display significantly lower expression of IFN-α, CCL2/MCP-1 and IL-6 against murine norovirus infection compared those from control mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-McCartney1">[23]</xref>. On the other hand, reduced viral clearance has ultimately led to enhanced inflammatory responses in some models. MDA5−/− mice show significantly decreased IFN mRNA expression profiles five days after Sendai virus infection but compensatory IL-6 mRNA expression, resulting in increased mortality and severe histopathological changes in the lower airways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Gitlin1">[35]</xref>. Thus, host inflammatory responses in the absence of IFN expression are pathogen-specific: When challenged by pathogenic lethal viruses such as Sendai virus, the host initiates inflammatory responses to defend against viral invasion. However, when confronted with non-pathogenic viruses such as RV, it may be advantageous for the host to terminate the inflammatory response, in order to avoid adverse effects.</p>
      <p>It has been proposed that asthmatics are susceptible to RV infection due to deficient IFN production. RV-infected airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects show impaired production of IFN-β and -λ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Wark1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Contoli1">[14]</xref> and asthmatics experimentally infected with RV16 showed a reduced IFN-γ/IL-5 mRNA ratio in their sputum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Gern1">[15]</xref>. To examine whether an allergic background alters the response of wild-type and MDA5 knockout mice to viral infection, we combined RV infection with a commonly-used model of allergic airways disease, OVA-sensitization and challenge. First, we found that, following OVA treatment, both wild-type and MDA5−/− mice demonstrated reduced viral titers following infection with RV. MDA5 null mice showed reduced viral titers despite attenuated IFN responses. This finding is consistent with our previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Nagarkar1">[18]</xref>, as well as data from guinea pigs that were sensitized to OVA and subsequently infected with parainfluenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Adamko1">[36]</xref>. The precise mechanism for decreased viral titers in mice with allergic airways disease is unclear. Prior to RV infection, these mice showed increased baseline levels of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, IFN-γ, IL-6 and CCL11/eotaxin-1, each of which could have contributed to an antiviral response. Eosinophils are known to contain granule proteins such as eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin,which possess strong ribonuclease activity that can neutralize viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Slifman1">[37]</xref>. Eosinophils have been shown to neutralize RSV in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect could be completely reversed by a ribonuclease inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Domachowske1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Domachowske2">[39]</xref>. Another possible mediator is nitric oxide, an antiviral which is produced by epithelial cells in response to RV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Sanders1">[40]</xref>. Whatever the mechanism, our finding of reduced viral titers in MDA5−/− mice with attenuated IFN responses demonstrates that other factors besides IFNs may play a role in the containment and clearance of RV infection.</p>
      <p>Second, we found that RV1B-infected OVA-treated MDA5−/− mice showed significantly reduced IFN and cytokine levels compared to wild-type mice. Reduced cytokine expression, in turn, led to persistent attenuations in airway inflammation and responsiveness. Thus, pro-inflammatory and IFN responses were strictly linked: Reduced IFN responses in MDA5−/− mice were associated with less robust, not increased, inflammatory responses. These data are consistent with our recent findings in airway epithelial cells isolated from patients with COPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Schneider1">[41]</xref>. These cells showed increases in both pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs.</p>
      <p>In general, TLR3-deficient mice with allergic airways disease showed similarly attenuated inflammatory responses to RV1B infection, leading to reduced airways responsiveness. However, there were some differences between MDA5 and TLR3 null mice. As with non-allergic mice, TLR3 knockout mice showed normal IFN responses to RV infection. In addition, TLR3 mice showed higher levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines four days after infection, consistent with compensatory activation of another host pattern recognition receptors. On the other hand, a recent study showed that administration of synthetic dsRNA attenuates allergic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Aumeunier1">[42]</xref>, suggesting that TLR3 signaling may also have anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, disparities between MDA5 and TLR3 null mice be attributed to differences in genetic background.</p>
      <p>Finally, we would like to add a few comments about our mouse model of human RV1B infection. We <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Newcomb1">[17]</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002070-Bartlett1">[43]</xref> have found that a much higher viral titer is required to infect mice compared to humans. This is to be expected, as differences in the homology of viral receptors and intracellular signaling mechanisms are likely to restrict viral infection and replication in mice. This restriction in viral replication could have limited the effects of pattern recognition receptor knockout in our model. For example, had viral replication been more robust, it is conceivable that TLR3 and MDA5 knockout could have led to more severe airways disease, rather than the attenuated responses we observed. On the other hand, we suspect our results are physiologic, for the following reasons: First, viral replication in the lungs of humans is likely to be small. Despite the fact that RV is a well-established cause of asthma and COPD exacerbations in humans, it has rarely been cultured from the lower airways of non-immunosuppressed patients. Second, RV causes minimal cytotoxicity in infected epithelial cells. Whatever the level of viral replication, our results demonstrate that engagement of TLR3 and MDA5 by RV dsRNA initiates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to airways inflammation and cholinergic hyperresponsiveness. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the contribution of TLR3 and MDA5 to RV responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Our data raise the possibility that TLR3- and MDA5-driven innate immune responses to RV, a relatively non-pathogenic virus, are maladaptive, at least at the onset of infection. If this were true in humans, then antagonists against TLR3 and MDA5 could provide potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Future studies focusing on the interactions and coordination between the two receptors would be useful in understanding the precise mechanism of RV-induced, pattern recognition receptor-mediated innate immune responses.</p>
