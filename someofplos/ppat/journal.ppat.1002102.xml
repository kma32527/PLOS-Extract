        <p><italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne pathogen that cycles between a mammalian host and tick vector. This complex life cycle requires that the spirochete modulate its gene expression program to facilitate growth and maintenance in these diverse milieus. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> contains an operon that is predicted to encode proteins that would mediate the uptake and conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Previous studies indicated that expression of the operon is elevated at 23°C and is repressed in the presence of the alternative sigma factor RpoS, suggesting that glycerol utilization may play an important role during the tick phase. This possibility was further explored in the current study by expression analysis and mutagenesis of <italic>glpD</italic>, a gene predicted to encode glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Transcript levels for <italic>glpD</italic> were significantly lower in mouse joints relative to their levels in ticks. Expression of GlpD protein was repressed in an RpoS-dependent manner during growth of spirochetes within dialysis membrane chambers implanted in rat peritoneal cavities. In medium supplemented with glycerol as the principal carbohydrate, wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> grew to a significantly higher cell density than <italic>glpD</italic> mutant spirochetes during growth in vitro at 25°C. <italic>glpD</italic> mutant spirochetes were fully infectious in mice by either needle or tick inoculation. In contrast, <italic>glpD</italic> mutants grew to significantly lower densities than wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in nymphal ticks and displayed a replication defect in feeding nymphs. The findings suggest that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> undergoes a switch in carbohydrate utilization during the mammal to tick transition. Further, the results demonstrate that the ability to utilize glycerol as a carbohydrate source for glycolysis during the tick phase of the infectious cycle is critical for maximal <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> fitness.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> is the vector-borne pathogen that causes Lyme disease. It has a complex life cycle that involves growth in a tick vector and a mammalian host — two diverse environments that present <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> with alternative carbohydrate sources for support of growth. Previous studies suggested that glycerol may be an important nutrient in the tick vector. Here we show that genes predicted to be involved in glycerol metabolism have significantly elevated expression during all tick stages. Repression of expression in the mammalian host is dependent on the alternative sigma factor, RpoS. A mutant that cannot convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate to support glycolysis was able to infect mice. In contrast, the mutant was present at significantly lower levels in nymphal ticks, its replication was delayed during nymphal feeding and longer feeding times were required for transmission from nymph to mouse. The results demonstrate that the ability to utilize glycerol as a carbohydrate source for glycolysis during the tick phase of the infectious cycle is critical for maximal <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> fitness.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> is the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Bacon1">[1]</xref>. In the Northeastern United States, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is transmitted between mammalian hosts by the bite of the black legged deer tick, <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, with the white-footed mouse (<italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>) serving as the primary reservoir host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Levine1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Tsao1">[3]</xref>. The transmission cycle is as intricate as the life of the tick itself. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> are acquired by uninfected larvae feeding on an infected small mammal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Mannelli1">[4]</xref>. This is essential for the continued maintenance of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in nature, since there is no transovarial transmission in <italic>Ixodes spp.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Steere1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Magnarelli1">[6]</xref>. The bacteria remain in the midgut of engorged larval ticks through the molt. The infected nymph will take a blood meal on a mammal, at which point <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> multiply and begin their migration from the tick midgut to the salivary glands from which they are transmitted to a mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-deSilva1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-DunhamEms1">[9]</xref>, thereby completing the enzootic cycle.</p>
      <p><italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> must adjust its gene expression program in response to the different physiological cues encountered during the natural enzootic cycle. In bacteria, regulation of gene expression in response to environmental cues is often mediated by two-component systems (TCS) and/or alternative sigma factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Kazmierczak1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Beier1">[11]</xref>. The <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> genome encodes only two alternative sigma factors and two TCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fraser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Casjens1">[13]</xref>. Thus, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> must orchestrate its complex expression programs with a limited repertoire of known transcriptional regulators. Studies by Norgard and co-workers demonstrated a link between one TCS, Hk2-Rrp2, and the alternative sigma factors RpoN and RpoS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Hubner1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Yang1">[15]</xref>. The expression of several virulence genes, including <italic>ospC</italic>, <italic>dbpA</italic> and <italic>bbk32</italic>, are dependent on RpoS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Hubner1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>. RpoS is also essential for repression of genes whose expression is required during the tick phase, but not in the mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano3">[18]</xref>. BB0647 (BosR, Fur) has also been shown to play a role in RpoN-dependent expression of <italic>rpoS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Ouyang1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Hyde2">[21]</xref>. Less is currently known regarding the second TCS, consisting of Hk1 and Rrp1, but recent studies have begun to elucidate the processes that are regulated by this TCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rogers1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano4">[24]</xref>. In particular, Rrp1 has been shown to be responsible for production of bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and mutagenesis of Rrp1 results in alteration of expression for a substantial number of genes, including those involved in uptake and dissimilation of glycerol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rogers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-He1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Ryjenkov1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Different carbohydrates are selectively available to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> during its enzootic cycle. Glucose is the primary carbohydrate constituent in mammalian blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Young1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Welton1">[27]</xref> and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> can use glucose to support growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-vonLackum1">[28]</xref>. Ticks rely on a high concentration of carbohydrates and other nutrients available in the blood meal for molting and successful oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Balashov1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-James1">[30]</xref>. During feeding, ticks create a peritrophic matrix above the epithelial cell layer, which serves both as a compartment to trap the blood meal and as a barrier to prevent invasion by microorganisms that accompany the blood meal. However, the peritrophic matrix is permeable to hexose sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Balashov1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Shao1">[31]</xref>. Once hexoses permeate across the matrix, they are sequestered by midgut epithelial cells during larval feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Balashov1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Shao1">[31]</xref>. Consequently, nutrients present in the blood meal are rapidly depleted during larval feeding and are likely non-existent in an unfed nymphal midgut. Therefore, spirochetes resident in the midgut must identify and utilize alternative carbohydrates until the unfed nymph takes its next blood meal.</p>
      <p>Glycerol, a diffusible carbohydrate, is a readily available nutrient in the tick. Glycerol is produced by <italic>Ixodes spp.</italic> and serves as a colligative antifreeze for tick survival during the winter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Lee1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Vandyk1">[34]</xref>. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> encodes a putative glycerol utilization operon consisting of three genes. <italic>glpF</italic> (<italic>bb0240</italic>) encodes a putative transmembrane facilitator protein that mediates the entry of free glycerol into the cell. <italic>glpK</italic> (<italic>bb0241</italic>) encodes a putative kinase that would produce glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) which would be the substrate for glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), an enzyme putatively encoded by the third gene in the operon, <italic>bb0243</italic>. The resulting product, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, can enter glycolysis through the action of triose phosphate isomerase and ultimately result in the net production of one ATP molecule per original glycerol molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fraser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-vonLackum1">[28]</xref>. Alternatively, G3P may be converted to phosphatidic acid through the action of two enzymes, BB0327 (G3P acyltransferase) and BB0037 (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase); this pathway is required for phospholipid biosynthesis and production of new cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fraser1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Three lines of evidence suggest that glycerol utilization may be important during the vector phase of the enzootic cycle. Ojaimi et al. reported that all genes of the glycerol utilization operon are more highly expressed during in vitro growth in BSK-II medium at 23°C as compared to growth at 35°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Ojaimi1">[35]</xref>. Caimano et al. demonstrated that repression of <italic>glp</italic> operon expression is dependent on RpoS within the mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>. Moreover, constitutive expression of the <italic>glp</italic> operon partially restores the ability of Rrp1-deficient <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> to survive within feeding ticks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-He1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to elucidate the role of glycerol uptake and utilization by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> during its natural life cycle and the regulatory events that govern <italic>glp</italic> operon expression, the gene predicted to encode G3PDH (<italic>bb0243</italic>) was disrupted and the effects of mutagenesis were evaluated in vitro and during infection of ticks or mice. The results demonstrate that the ability to utilize glycerol as a carbohydrate for use in the glycolytic pathway during the tick phase of the infectious cycle is critical for maximal <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> fitness.</p>

In contrast to growth in BSK-II with GlcNAc only or medium supplemented with glucose (data not shown), there was a significant difference in growth between wild type and <italic>glpD</italic> mutants when glycerol was supplied as the principal carbohydrate source.

        <p>Spirochete numbers in wild type-infected ticks increased slightly after larval molting to nymphs but decreased in nymphs infected with any of the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant strains. This resulted in a significant five-fold decrease in CP176 density in unfed nymphs compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t002">Table 2</xref>). Further, in independent experiments, CP177 and CP257 had an identical phenotype to that observed for CP176, i.e. spirochete densities were significantly lower after molting as compared to spirochete loads in B31-A3-infected ticks (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Infected nymphs were fed on naïve mice and spirochete loads were measured in the resulting fed nymphs. As expected, spirochete numbers increased substantially during nymphal feeding in both wild type- and CP176-infected nymphs, although the spirochete burdens in the <italic>glpD</italic>-infected engorged nymphs were significantly lower than in nymphs infected with the parental strain (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.02) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t002">Table 2</xref>). These results suggest a role for glycerol utilization by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> as an important factor for spirochete maintenance during transtadial transition.</p>

        <title>Absence of GlpD results in impaired <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> replication in feeding nymphs</title>
        <p>As previously described, wild type- and <italic>glpD</italic> mutant-infected nymphs are equally capable of transmitting <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> to, and causing infection in, mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, those studies were conducted by allowing nymphs to feed to repletion. A feeding nymph will attach and feed on a host for 72 hours or longer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Piesman2">[47]</xref>. During this time, replicating <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> surround midgut epithelial cells, penetrate the midgut basement membrane, and enter the hemocoel and salivary glands from which they are ultimately transmitted to the mammal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Piesman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-DunhamEms1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, replication is a critical step in spirochete transmission from the vector to the mammalian host. Since the density of <italic>glpD</italic> mutant spirochetes decreases as a result of molting and was five-fold lower than in wild type-infected unfed nymphs, we reasoned that nymphs harboring <italic>glpD</italic> mutant spirochetes would require a longer feeding period before transmission to the host due to its delayed exit from the tick midgut.</p>
        <p>To explore this possibility, B31-A3- and CP176-infected nymphs were placed on naïve mice, allowed to begin feeding, but forcibly removed at different time points post-attachment. Mice were then monitored for evidence of infection. In a pilot experiment, nymphs were fed on naïve mice for 65 hours; 2/2 mice fed on by B31-A3-infected nymphs became infected, whereas 0/3 mice fed on by CP176-infected nymphs acquired infection. Based on this pilot study, B31-A3- or CP176-infected unfed nymphs were placed on the outer ear of naïve C3H/HeJ mice and allowed to feed for either 24, 48, 55, 62 or 72 hours or collected at drop off (&gt;72 hours). Ticks were removed at each time point and spirochete load was determined by qPCR. Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g011">Figure 11</xref> demonstrate that CP176 experienced a lag in replication and achieved significantly lower spirochete loads at times beyond 48 hours of feeding (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). At these points, spirochete loads per tick were 3.5–5 fold lower in CP176-infected ticks than in those infected with B31-A3 (e.g., at 55 hours of feeding spirochete loads were 42,633 and 8,581 for B31-A3 and CP176-infected nymphs, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Mice were also monitored for infection. Results demonstrate that mice fed on by wild type-infected nymphs were infected by 62 hours of feeding. In contrast, CP176-infected nymphs produced infection in mice only after at least 72 hours of feeding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t003">Table 3</xref>). These data suggest that wild type-infected nymphs are more readily able to infect naïve mice due to a more rapid increase in spirochete density induced on commencement of tick feeding. Further, disruption of glycerol utilization results in reduced fitness of the spirochete during the tick phase and spirochetes that are unable to utilize glycerol are at a disadvantage for transmission to a mammalian host.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>On acquisition by feeding larvae from an infected mammal, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> must initially adapt to the new host (i.e. tick) environment. The spirochete must then survive the tick molting process and endure a substantial period in a nutrient-poor milieu (unfed nymph). This is not a period of metabolic dormancy since several studies, including our own, demonstrate that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> gene expression is modulated in different tick developmental stages and that expression of some genes is higher in unfed nymphs than in fed nymphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Gilmore1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Bykowski1">[51]</xref>. During the subsequent nymphal blood meal, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> enter a rapid replication phase, experiencing a significant increase in density within a 48 hr period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Piesman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-DunhamEms1">[9]</xref> and must prepare for transmission back to a mammal. How does <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> generate the energy required to withstand this harsh environment?</p>
      <p>Glycerol and its metabolites play important roles in cellular biochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Brisson1">[52]</xref> and glycerol is a readily available carbohydrate in <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Lee1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Vandyk1">[34]</xref>. Most bacteria have the ability to acquire glycerol from the surrounding milieu or to re-utilize it from its own metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Brisson1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Lin1">[53]</xref>. G3P is a crucial intermediate for energy metabolism (via its conversion to dihydoxyacetone phosphate and entry into the glycolytic pathway) and for phospholipid biosynthesis (via its conversion to phosphatidic acid [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g001">Figure 1</xref>]). The <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> genome putatively encodes all the enzymes required for both processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fraser1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Schwan1">[54]</xref>. The possibility that glycerol uptake and utilization may play an important role during the tick phase of the enzootic cycle was suggested by previous studies showing that genes comprising the <italic>glp</italic> operon had elevated expression during growth in vitro at 23°C and were subject to RpoS-dependent repression within the mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Ojaimi1">[35]</xref>. A number of findings from the current study confirm that this is the case. First, in medium supplemented with glycerol as the principal carbohydrate source, wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> grew to a significantly higher cell density compared to a <italic>glpD</italic> mutant during growth at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). This difference was not observed during growth at 37°C or when glucose was employed as the principal carbohydrate source. Second, transcript levels for <italic>glpF</italic> and <italic>glpD</italic> were significantly lower in mouse joints relative to their levels in ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Third, GlpD protein was not produced during growth in DMCs and its repression was dependent on the presence of RpoS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant was fully infectious in mice when introduced by either needle or tick inoculation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t001">Table 1</xref>), but had a replication defect in ticks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g011">Figure 11</xref>).</p>
      <p>Absence of GlpD results in reduced spirochete fitness in the tick. This defect is manifested at two distinct points during this phase of the enzootic cycle. Spirochete loads are reduced five-fold after the larval molt in the mutant relative to the wild type. Spirochete loads were measured in larvae that had fed to repletion and in unfed nymphs two weeks after the molt. Therefore, it is not clear whether the reduction in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> density occurred during the molt or during the initial period in the unfed nymph. We favor the latter possibility. At the onset of nymphal feeding, the <italic>glpD</italic> mutants display a lag prior to beginning replication; as a result, they replicate more slowly than wild-type spirochetes and fail to achieve the same final spirochete densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g011">Figure 11</xref>). As a consequence, there is delayed transmission of <italic>glpD</italic> mutant spirochetes to mice during feeding. Whereas ticks infected with wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> caused infection by 62 hours of feeding, those infected with mutant spirochetes required at least 72 hours of feeding before productive transmission occurred. Dunham-Ems et al. have demonstrated that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> migration from the midgut to the salivary glands for transmission to a mammal proceeds in two phases. In the initial step, replicating spirochetes form non-motile networks that advance toward the basolateral surface of the gut epithelium. The non-motile spirochetes then transition to motile organisms that penetrate the basement membrane into the hemocoel and migrate to the salivary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-DunhamEms1">[9]</xref>. This model of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> dissemination provides an explanation for the delayed transmission phenotype of the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant. As dissemination of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in the tick during the first phase of feeding does not depend on motility, but instead is replication driven, the reduced replication rate of the mutant would result in delayed dissemination to the hemocoel. As a result, the mutant would require additional time for successful tick to mammal transmission.</p>
      <p>Spirochete loads of wild type and <italic>glpD</italic> mutant were identical in fed larvae whereas those of the mutant were reduced approximately five-fold after the larval molt; the reduced level of mutant persisted throughout the subsequent stages of the tick cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t002">Table 2</xref>). In a very recent study, He et al. showed that a <italic>glpF</italic> polar deletion mutant, which does not express any of the <italic>glp</italic> operon genes, had a phenotype both in vitro and in vivo very similar to that described here for a <italic>glpD</italic> mutant (i.e. the mutant failed to reach the same cell density as the wild type when cultured in medium with glycerol as the principal carbohydrate and had reduced spirochete loads in infected nymphs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-He1">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, the reduction in mutant spirochete levels in nymphs was much more severe (&gt;2 logs) in their study than was observed here for the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant. Presumably, this difference is due to the fact that the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant will only have an effect on glycerol utilization for glycolysis, whereas the <italic>glp</italic> operon mutant will also affect phospholipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, study of the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant is important in allowing evaluation of the contribution of glycerol utilization for energy metabolism without any confounding from effects on other metabolic pathways.</p>
      <p>Why isn't the <italic>glpD</italic> mutation lethal rather than being simply growth inhibitory? Clearly, there must be an alternative carbohydrate source that can be metabolized via glycolysis to produce the required ATP. We propose that this alternative energy source is chitobiose. Tilly et al. reported that <italic>chbC</italic> transcript is elevated at 23°C relative to 34°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Tilly1">[45]</xref> and we have found that <italic>chbC</italic> expression is significantly higher in ticks than in mouse joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that chitobiose utilization by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is important during the tick phase of the cycle. Chitobiose would be available to the spirochete during tick feeding, when it is shed from the forming peritrophic matrix, as well as during molting when the tick cuticle is being re-modeled for growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Shao1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rhodes2">[49]</xref>. It has been suggested that chitobiose utilization would be essential for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> during the tick phase of the enzootic cycle for spirochete glycolysis and cell wall synthesis. However, <italic>chb</italic>C mutants, which cannot take up exogenous chitobiose or utilize chitin to support growth, successfully complete the mouse-tick-mouse infectious cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Tilly2">[48]</xref>. It is possible that glycerol availability may be partially responsible for rescue of the <italic>chbC</italic> mutant. This would suggest that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> maintains spirochete fitness in the nutrient deplete environment of the tick midgut by utilizing either glycerol and/or chitobiose as glycolytic precursors. It would be of interest to determine whether a <italic>glpD-chbC</italic> double mutant would be capable of completing the natural infectious cycle.</p>
      <p>As described earlier, signals that lead to phosphorylation of Rrp2 result in activation of RpoN which, in turn, initiates transcription of <italic>rpoS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Hubner1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Yang1">[15]</xref>. RpoS is expressed only in feeding nymphs and mammals and therefore, is thought to be responsible for the regulon that is required for mammalian infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Mulay1">[55]</xref>. This is consistent with the fact that Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS mutants cannot establish infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fisher1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Boardman1">[57]</xref>. The RpoS regulon includes genes that are absolutely dependent on RpoS for their transcription (e.g. <italic>ospC</italic>), as well as genes subject to RpoS-dependent repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano3">[18]</xref>. The <italic>glp</italic> operon is in the latter category. Several recent studies have begun to reveal the role of the Hk1/Rrp1 TCS in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rogers1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano4">[24]</xref>. Lack of Hk1 and Rrp1 has no effect on infectivity in mice. However, Hk1 and Rrp1 mutants are killed within the tick midgut during feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-He1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano4">[24]</xref>. Hk1 and Rrp1 appear to be expressed during all stages of the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rogers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano4">[24]</xref>, but the important consideration is whether Rrp1 is phosphorylated leading to the production of c-di-GMP. Interestingly, Caimano et al. have recently shown that Hk1 mutants are killed during the larval and nymphal blood meals, indicating that c-di-GMP is required during both tick feeding stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano4">[24]</xref>. It is reasonable to conclude that the Rrp2/RpoN/RpoS pathway governs the expression of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> genes required in the mammalian host, whereas Hk1/Rrp1 controls a subset of borrelial gene products that is critical for survival in the tick vector. A number of genes that are induced by Rrp1 (i.e. c-di-GMP) are subject to RpoS-dependent repression; these include the <italic>glp</italic> operon genes and <italic>bba74</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rogers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-He1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The current study demonstrates that <italic>glp</italic> operon expression is modulated by nutrient availability. Several reports have established that this operon is regulated in a reciprocal manner by RpoS and Rrp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Caimano2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Rogers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-He1">[23]</xref>. The <italic>glp</italic> genes are the first borrelial gene products linked to spirochete metabolism whose expression is subject to regulation by both <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> TCSs. As such, these genes represent a valuable paradigm for elucidating the interplay between these two regulatory pathways. A model that integrates both carbohydrate availability and presence/absence of transcriptional regulators is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g012">Figure 12</xref>. It is presumed that early in larval feeding RpoS is still present, but must be degraded in order to allow for expression of tick phase genes; the precise timing of RpoS disappearance is not currently known. Glucose should be available at this stage in quantities sufficient to support <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> growth. Later in the blood meal hexose sugars and other serum constituents crossing the peritrophic matrix are sequestered by tick midgut epithelial cells. This creates a nutrient-poor environment in which <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> must rely on glycerol and rapidly depleting chitobiose to support glycolysis. The turnover of RpoS during larval feeding would result in the de-repression of glycerol pathway enzymes and presence of c-di-GMP will activate their expression, ensuring that spirochetes can rapidly switch from a glucose-based to a glycerol-based metabolism. Once spirochete infection is established in the midgut and the larva molts to an unfed nymph, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> remains a metabolically active spirochete that must rely on glycolysis for maintenance of cellular integrity. Glycerol is presumed to be the primary carbohydrate at this stage and absence of RpoS would allow expression of the <italic>glp</italic> operon. Early in nymphal feeding while blood constituents are scarce, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> must actively replicate and migrate through the epithelial midgut lumen to begin its migration to the salivary glands. At this point glycerol would be a primary energy source for support of cellular replication, as chitobiose will not be available until the eventual breakdown of the peritrophic matrix. Inability to utilize glycerol, as in the <italic>glpD</italic> mutant, would result in delayed and reduced spirochete replication that could impact transmission of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> to the mammalian host. Presence of c-di-GMP would result in sustained expression of <italic>glp</italic> operon genes. As RpoS levels increase during the nymphal blood meal, presence of c-di-GMP will counteract the repressive effects of RpoS on <italic>glp</italic> gene expression, ensuring that glycerol utilization can continue until the spirochetes are transmitted to a mammalian host.</p>

      <p>The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002102-g012">Figure 12</xref> accounts for carbohydrate source availability and presence of regulatory molecules throughout the tick-mouse enzootic cycle and highlights the interdependence of these two parameters. Concentrations of glucose and glycerol in mouse plasma are approximately 150 and 2.8 mg/100 mL, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Maeda1">[58]</xref>. Glycerol is abundantly present during all tick stages. On this basis, the model assumes that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> utilizes glucose as the preferred nutrient source when it is available in the mammal or at certain stages during the tick blood meal, but switches to utilizing glycerol, especially in the unfed nymph when glucose is not present. This may represent the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> version of carbon catabolite repression (CCR), which is defined as a regulatory mechanism by which the expression and enzymatic activities of enzymes involved in the use of secondary carbohydrates are reduced in the presence of sufficient levels of the preferred carbohydrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Gorke1">[59]</xref>. The mechanisms underlying CCR in most bacteria involve a glucose-specific phosphotranferase subunit (EIIA) that can be reversibly phosphorylated based on the phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate ratios. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> encodes a putative EIIA subunit (BB0559), but does not appear to contain other major components that modulate CCR in other bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fraser1">[12]</xref>. It is reasonable to assume that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> possesses sensing mechanisms that monitor the relative levels of glucose and glycerol in the environment. It is tempting to speculate that modulation of Hk1 kinase activity is one outcome of the fluctuating nutrient ratios. When the glycerol/glucose ratio increases Hk1 would phosphorylate Rrp1 leading to the production of c-di-GMP. The specific molecular signal that is recognized by Hk1 is not currently known. Likewise, the precise timing of the transcriptional activation/repression of RpoS and the possible reciprocal modulation of c-di-GMP levels is not known. Studies designed to elucidate the molecular events underlying the proposed model are warranted.</p>

Once infection was established as determined by culture of ear biopsy, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and 100–300 naïve, unfed larvae were placed in and around the ear canal. Mice were placed individually into cages with approximately 1 cm water at the bottom. A metal grid of the same length and width as the cage, and standing 1.5 cm high, was placed in the cage. Larvae were allowed to feed until repletion. Following drop off, larvae were collected, rinsed in water, pooled into groups of 30 in 5 ml tubes with a porous cover and maintained in a desiccator at 21°C, &gt;95% relative humidity with a 16 hour∶8 hour light: dark cycle. Larvae molted to unfed nymphs in approximately 5–6 weeks. At four weeks post molt, three unfed nymphs were placed on three-week old uninfected C3H/HeJ mice (Jackson) and allowed to feed until repletion. Fed nymphs were collected as described above.</p>
        <p>For interrupted feeding experiments, 3 unfed nymphs were allowed to feed on naïve C3H/HeJ mice for 24, 48, 55, 62, and 72 hours or to repletion.

        <p>For generation of standard curves, specific gene fragments for <italic>bb0240</italic>, <italic>bb0243</italic> and <italic>bbb04</italic> were amplified by PCR using primers pairs bb0240qRTPCRF/bb0240qRTPCRR, bb0243qRTPCRF/bb0243qRTPCRR, bbb04qRT-PCRF/bbb04qRT-PCRR, ospA-288F/ospA-369R and ospC-B31FTq/ospC-B31RTq, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t004">table 4</xref>). PCR reaction mixtures contained 100 ng of B31-A3 DNA, 0.25 µl Taq polymerase (Roche), 0.5 µl dNTPs (Roche), and 1× Taq polymerase buffer (Roche) in a total volume of 25 µl. Amplification conditions were 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 36 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds and a final incubation at 72°C for 10 minutes. Production of the expected product was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and the PCR products were ligated into the TOPO 2.1 cloning vector, the vector was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> Mach1 cells and recombinant clones were selected as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Clonal isolates were grown in 10 ml of LB broth supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and the plasmids were extracted as described above. PCR confirmed the presence of the desired gene fragments. Plasmid concentration was determined by spectrophotometric analysis at 260 nm, followed by mathematical computation of copy number (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uri.edu/research/gsc/resources/cndna.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uri.edu/research/gsc/resources/cndna.html</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>Transcript levels for <italic>bb0240 (glpF)</italic>, <italic>bb0243</italic> (<italic>glpD</italic>), <italic>bbb04</italic> (<italic>chbC</italic>), <italic>ospA</italic>, <italic>ospC</italic> and <italic>flaB</italic> were determined by performing qRT-PCR as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Ojaimi2">[65]</xref> using the primer pairs listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t004">table 4</xref> on an ABI Prism 7900HT thermocycler followed by analysis using the SDS2.1 software program (Applied Biosystems). For each experimental run, standard curves for these genes were generated using known quantities (10–10<sup>4</sup> in log increments) of gene specific plasmids for calculation of absolute copy number.</p>
        <p>One-way analysis of variance was performed on qRT-PCR results. To determine significance, a Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison Z-value test (Dunn's test) was performed, where significance was defined as <italic>P</italic>≤0.05.</p>

        <p><italic>bb0243</italic> was amplified using primers NdeI243F/XhoI243R (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002102-t004">Table 4</xref>), cloned into the TOPO 2.1 vector, transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> Top10 cells and recombinant clones were selected per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The <italic>bb0243</italic> insert was excised from the TOPO 2.1 plasmid by double digestion with NdeI and XhoI (Fermentas) and the insert was purified after separation by gel electrophoresis using the Wizard SV genomic gel purification kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). pET-15b (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) was digested with NdeI and XhoI and the gel-purified <italic>bb0243</italic> insert was ligated with the NdeI/XhoI-cut pET-15b at a 2∶1 ratio with 10 units of T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and clones were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Recombinant pET-15b carrying <italic>bb0243</italic> was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21-DE3 and grown on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. A clone containing <italic>bb0243</italic> was selected and subjected to DNA sequencing. This sequence contained two single nucleotide changes relative to the reported sequence in strain B31-MI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Fraser1">[12]</xref>. Nucleotide 107 had a T to C change that would result in a predicted amino acid change of I359T and nucleotide 591 had an A to T substitution that would result in an amino acid change of E197D.</p>
        <p>The selected clone was grown at 37°C in 250 ml Luria broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG with agitation for 4 hours. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 8000 RPM for 10 minutes and rGlpD was isolated from the cells using Ni-NTA His Bind Resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing rGlpD, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and loaded into an Amicon Ultra 50 kDa molecular weight cut off spin column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The protein sample was centrifuged at 7500× g for approximately 8 minutes to a volume of 800 µl. The protein solution was dialyzed against 2 liters of 1× PBS, 6 M urea (pH 7.4) with stirring overnight at 4°C. Identity of the protein as <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> rGlpD was confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory,New Haven, CT). The yield of purified rGlpD was 1.3 mg.</p>
        <p>100 µg of purified rGlpD in 1×PBS, 6 M urea (pH 7.4) was inoculated along with Freund's adjuvant into two Sprague-Dawley rats by Harlan Laboratories (Madison, WI). The rats received a boost at day 28 and day 56 post-inoculation and were sacrificed and bled on day 70 post inoculation. GlpD antiserum was tested by ELISA and confirmed to be specific for GlpD by immunoblot analysis.</p>

        <p><italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> cells grown in vitro or in DMCs were lysed with Bugbuster HT (Novagen) and 1 µg/ml of lysozyme (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions. 2 µg of whole cell lysate was subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and separated proteins were visualized by silver staining as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002102-Morrissey1">[71]</xref>. For immunoblotting, separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were exposed to protein-specific primary rat antiserum (GlpD, 1∶400 dilution; FlaB, 1∶2500 dilution) followed by alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-rat secondary antibody (1∶500) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). The membrane was washed three times for 10 minutes with 1× TBS/0.05% Tween 20 and developed with BCIP/NBT phosphatase substrate (KPL) until band development (approximately 2–4 minutes).</p>
        <p>To determine seroconversion in mouse infection studies, mouse serum was added to 1× TBS with 0.5% dry milk at 1∶200 dilution and incubated with whole <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> lysate Marblot strips (MarDX, Jamestown, NY) for 1 hour at room temperature. The remaining procedure is as described above, with anti-mouse secondary antibody (1∶5000 dilution).</p>
