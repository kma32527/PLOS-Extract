        <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging mosquito-borne pathogen that has recently caused devastating urban epidemics of severe and sometimes chronic arthralgia. As with most other mosquito-borne viral diseases, control relies on reducing mosquito populations and their contact with people, which has been ineffective in most locations. Therefore, vaccines remain the best strategy to prevent most vector-borne diseases. Ideally, vaccines for diseases of resource-limited countries should combine low cost and single dose efficacy, yet induce rapid and long-lived immunity with negligible risk of serious adverse reactions. To develop such a vaccine to protect against chikungunya fever, we employed a rational attenuation mechanism that also prevents the infection of mosquito vectors. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus replaced the subgenomic promoter in a cDNA CHIKV clone, thus altering the levels and host-specific mechanism of structural protein gene expression. Testing in both normal outbred and interferon response-defective mice indicated that the new vaccine candidate is highly attenuated, immunogenic and efficacious after a single dose. Furthermore, it is incapable of replicating in mosquito cells or infecting mosquitoes in vivo. This IRES-based attenuation platform technology may be useful for the predictable attenuation of any alphavirus.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that has reemerged since 2004 to cause millions of cases of severe and often persistent arthralgia. Because no licensed vaccine exists to prevent this disease, we utilized an attenuation approach to produce a live CHIKV vaccine candidate that elicits a robust, protective immune response yet causes no detectable disease in mice. It is also incapable of infecting mosquito vectors, an important safety feature for a live virus vaccine that may be used in nonendemic locations to immunize travelers or laboratory personnel. This vaccine approach, which exploits the attenuating effect of altering the expression of the alphavirus structural proteins with a picornavirus IRES, may be broadly applicable to other alphaviruses that cause important febrile diseases as well as encephalitis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chikungunya (CHIK) virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging arboviral pathogen that has recently caused explosive urban outbreaks involving millions of persons in Africa and Asia. The virus was first isolated from a human in Tanzania in 1953 during a major epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Karabatsos1">[1]</xref>, and derives its name from a Makonde word meaning “that which bends up,” which describes the posture observed in afflicted persons. CHIKV typically causes a febrile illness and severe joint pain, which is clinically similar to dengue fever. These 2 viruses also share similar endemic distributions in the Eastern Hemisphere, resulting in many CHIKV cases being misdiagnosed when laboratory testing is not available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Carey1">[2]</xref>. Large CHIK outbreaks were described during the 1950's and 60's in India and Southeast Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Rao1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Halstead1">[4]</xref>. However, it was not until 2005 that CHIKV gained widespread public attention due to massive outbreaks on islands of the Indian Ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Enserink1">[5]</xref> and later in India <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Arankalle1">[6]</xref> and Southeast Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Hapuarachchi1">[7]</xref>. In total, several million persons have been affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Charrel1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Pialoux1">[9]</xref>. On the Island of Reunion alone, ca. 300,000 persons or one-third of the population was affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Bessaud1">[10]</xref>. Another factor driving the resurgence of interest in CHIK is the detection of occasional fatal cases, which were not documented before. Previously, individuals who became severely ill typically presented with hemorrhagic manifestations and occasionally shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Nimmannitya1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Carey2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Sarkar1">[13]</xref>. However, the recent outbreaks have been linked to thousands of deaths in Reunion and India due to neurologic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Robin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Josseran1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Mavalankar1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CHIKV exists in two transmission cycles: an enzootic or sylvatic cycle and an endemic/epidemic urban cycle. The African sylvatic cycle likely involves several arboreal <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes as vectors and nonhuman primates as reservoir/amplifying hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Jupp1">[17]</xref>. African outbreaks occur from direct enzootic spillover or when CHIKV is introduced into an urban areas inhabited by the anthropophilic mosquito vector, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Jupp1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tesh1">[18]</xref>. More permanent endemic/epidemic transmission cycles were established when the virus was introduced into Asia ca. 1950, and into the Indian Ocean region, India and then Southeast Asia since 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Volk1">[19]</xref>. A mutation in the E1 envelope glycoprotein gene that results in an A226V amino acid substitution dramatically increased the infectivity of some epidemic strains for an alternative urban vector, <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Charrel1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tsetsarkin1">[20]</xref>. The nearly ubiquitous distribution of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and the expanding distribution of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> into tropical and temperate regions of both hemispheres has raised concern that CHIKV may spread outside of its previous endemic region into the Western Hemisphere and Europe. The latter scenario was realized in 2007 during a small epidemic in Italy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Rezza1">[21]</xref> and during autochthonous transmission in southern France during 2010 (ProMED archive 20100926.3495).</p>
      <p>CHIKV belongs to the family <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, whose members are enveloped virions that contain a positive sense, single stranded, RNA genome of ∼12 kb. The genome encodes 4 non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) and 3 major structural proteins (Capsid, E1, and E2 envelope glycoproteins)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002142-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). During replication, two distinct RNA's are produced: the genomic and subgenomic RNAs. A negative sense template RNA is also produced. The nonstructural polyprotein open reading frame (ORF) is translated via a cap-dependant mechanism from the genomic RNA, whereas the structural protein gene ORF is translated from the subgenomic RNA, also in a cap-dependent manner. The subgenomic RNA is transcribed late during infection from its promoter, which is found in the 3′ end of the nsP4 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Strauss1">[22]</xref>.</p>

      <p>There is no licensed vaccine or therapeutic CHIK, so outbreaks can only be controlled by preventing the exposure of people to infected mosquito vectors. Scientists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research produced an investigational vaccine called 181/clone 25 (hereafter called 181/25) during the 1980s. This live-attenuated strain was generated via serial plaque-to-plaque passages of a wild-type Thai CHIKV strain using MRC-5 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Levitt1">[23]</xref>. The virus is attenuated in both rodents and non-human primates and is highly immunogenic in humans. However, during phase II trials, strain 181/25 caused mild, transient arthralgia in 5 of 59 vaccinees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Edelman1">[24]</xref>. Also, strain 181/25 can be transmitted experimentally by the natural mosquito vector, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Turell1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To be effective in resource-limited nations that are endemic for CHIK as well as to combat an epidemic, an ideal CHIK vaccine would induce rapid and long-lived immunity after a single dose, have a low risk of reactogenicity and reversion to virulence, and be inexpensive. Vaccines against arboviral diseases should also have a low risk of transmission from vaccinated persons via mosquitoes in the event that viremia occurs, especially those used in non-endemic regions. Although replication-defective vaccine candidates have been described that emphasize safety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tiwari1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Muthumani1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Akahata1">[28]</xref>, none has been shown to induce rapid or long-lived immunity after a single dose, and some may be expensive to produce. In contrast, live-attenuated vaccines like the yellow fever 17D vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Pulendran1">[29]</xref> have been spectacularly successful in preventing disease in developing tropical regions.</p>
      <p>To generate a safer and more effective live-attenuated CHIK vaccine that meets the criteria outlined above, we previously produced and tested a series of chimeric alphaviruses containing either Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), eastern equine encephalitis or Sindbis virus non-structural protein genes along with the CHIKV structural protein genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Wang1">[30]</xref>. These vaccines produce robust neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses and provide complete protection against disease after CHIKV challenge. However, some residual ability to infect potential mosquito vectors remains, and attenuation is dependent on an intact murine interferon response (SCW, unpublished). To overcome these limitations, we developed a new attenuation strategy and conducted proof-of-principle studies with another alphavirus, VEEV vaccine strain TC-83. Both attenuation and elimination of mosquito infectability relied on the inactivation of the subgenomic promoter, and addition of a encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) to drive translation of the structural protein genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Volkova1">[31]</xref>. Chimeric alphaviruses incorporating the IRES element have also been generated as vaccine candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Kim1">[32]</xref>. The EMCV IRES also mediates inefficient translation in arthropod cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Finkelstein1">[33]</xref>, rendering these mutants unable to infect mosquitoes. However, starting with the attenuated TC-83 strain, the IRES-based attenuation resulted in inadequate immunogenicity and the lack of a neutralizing Ab response.</p>
      <p>Here, we implemented this IRES-based vaccine design for CHIKV using a cDNA clone generated from the wild-type La Reunion strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tsetsarkin2">[34]</xref>. Testing of this novel vaccine candidate in several murine models indicated that it is highly attenuated, even in the absence of an intact murine IFN response, is immunogenic and efficacious in preventing CHIK disease, and is unable to infect mosquitoes.</p>

        <p>Titers of CHIKV/IRES collected 30 h after electroporation were 6×10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU)/ml, in comparison to titers of 1.1x10<sup>7</sup> for wild-type (wt) CHIKV strain LR. To assess replication kinetics, viruses derived from the electroporation were compared after infection of Vero cells. The CHIKV/IRES replicated more slowly than 181-25 or wt-CHIKV, requiring 48 hours at 37°C to reach a peak titer of 2.5×10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml. Strain 181-25 replicated almost to peak titer within 24 hours and reached 7.9×10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml. The wt-CHIKV also replicated close to its peak titer by 24 hours and reached 4.2×10<sup>7</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002142-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Unlike wt-CHIKV, which produced visible plaques within 48 hours of Vero cell infection, the CHIKV/IRES plaques were not readily visible before 3 days of incubation at 37°C. CHIKV/IRES plaques were 0.5–2 mm in diameter, whereas vaccine strain 181/25 produced 2–4 mm and wt CHIKV produced ca. 6 mm plaques under 0.4% agarose at 3 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002142-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Stability following cell culture passages</title>
        <p>To assess phenotypic and genetic stability, CHIKV/IRES was passaged 10 times in Vero cells at 37°C using a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 PFU/cell. The plaque morphology remained heterogeneous but consistent after the 10 passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002142-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Sequencing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplicons covering the entire genome revealed no consensus mutations aside from the presence of adenine insertions within a poly-A track of the IRES element itself. Plaque purified clones were sequenced through the IRES to determine the frequency of these mutations; 8 of 10 plaque clones examined had 7 As like the original cDNA clone and the 10<sup>th</sup> passage consensus sequence. However, 3 biological clones had up to 17 As in this region. These differences in sequence showed no obvious correlation with plaque size (data not shown).</p>
        <p>CHIKV/IRES was also blind-passaged 5 times in C6/36 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> cells and the presence of virus was detected by the ability to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) on Vero cells and by RT-PCR amplification. Virus was detected only after the first passage, which presumably reflected residual virus that could not be washed from the cells after inoculation, and was not detected thereafter (data not shown). In contrast, the wt-CHIKV strain replicated in the mosquito cells throughout the passages, with titers ranging from 3–5×10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml.</p>

Because unprotected mice die before muscle or joint lesions develop (SCW, RS, unpublished), we examined the spleen, where earlier lesions occur. Cohorts of three 8–10-week-old A129 mice were vaccinated intradermally in the footpad with either 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of CHIKV/IRES or were sham-vaccinated with PBS. One mouse from each cohort was sacrificed 4 days post vaccination, and the remaining 2 mice were challenged with 100 PFU of wt-CHIKV at 26 days post-vaccination, then sacrificed 4 days post-challenge. The spleens of the sham-vaccinated mice challenged with CHIK-LR exhibited severe necrosis with markedly reduced numbers of small lymphocytes in the mantle and marginal zones. Only the central portion of the remnant lymphoid follicle remained.

        <p>To confirm that neutralizing antibodies mediated protection of A129 mice from CHIKV challenge, pooled serum collected 21 days after immunization of A129 mice was inoculated intraperitoneally into naïve 6–7-week-old A129 mice (N = 5) either undiluted or at dilutions of 1:2 or 1:4; undiluted normal mouse serum was used as a negative control. Following challenge with 100 PFU of wt CHIKV, mortality was monitored for 15 days. All mice that received immune serum exhibited increased survival compared with those that received normal mouse serum (Kaplan Meier, p&lt;0.001) and greater dilutions of the immune serum resulted in reduced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002142-g010">Fig. 10</xref>).

        <title>Mosquito infections in vivo</title>
        <p>To confirm that the CHIKV/IRES strain was incapable of replicating in mosquitoes, cohorts of 20 adult female <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, a highly susceptible urban vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tsetsarkin1">[20]</xref>, were inoculated intrathoracically with ca. 1.0 µl of a 10<sup>4</sup> PFU/ml suspension of either CHIKV/IRES or the wt LR strain. Intrathoracic infection was used rather than oral exposure because mosquitoes are uniformly susceptible to small CHIKV doses delivered via this route, whereas the oral portal of entry is less permissive even after large doses. After 7 days of incubation at 27°C, mosquitoes were triturated and serial 10-fold dilutions were tested for virus by inoculation of Vero cells followed by examination for cytopathic effects (CPE) through day 7. Mosquitoes inoculated with CHIKV/IRES as well as PBS-inoculated negative control mosquitoes produced no detectable CPE. In contrast, all 20 mosquitoes receiving wt CHIKV produced extensive CPE on the Vero cells. To ensure that temperature sensitive or host-restricted mutants were not generated following mosquito infection, RT-PCR targeting the 5′ end of the capsid gene was also used to detect viral RNA. No amplicons were detected from the CHIKV/IRES-infected mosquitoes by gel electrophoresis, whereas all mosquitoes injected with wt CHIKV produced strong bands of the expected size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002142.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Nearly 80 years after the introduction of the first vaccine against an arboviral disease, yellow fever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Theiler1">[39]</xref>, vaccination remains the most effective method to protect against arboviruses and many other infectious agents. In the case of CHIK, the 181/25 live-attenuated vaccine developed during the 1980s showed promise in preclinical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Levitt1">[23]</xref> but was mildly reactogenic in human trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Edelman1">[24]</xref>. More recent vaccine development has focused on inactivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tiwari1">[26]</xref>, DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Muthumani1">[27]</xref> or virus-like particle approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Akahata1">[28]</xref>. However, in our opinion, the requirements for multiple doses administered over several weeks and/or the higher cost of such vaccines, as well as the probability that boosters will be required to maintain immunity, will limit their usefulness in the developing nations of Africa and Asia where CHIKV is endemic. We have therefore focused on live-attenuated vaccines to prevent both endemic and epidemic CHIK.</p>
      <p>The maturity of reverse genetic technology has provided unprecedented opportunities for manipulation of the alphaviral genome to improve attenuation strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Davis1">[40]</xref>. Thus, unlike traditional attenuation approaches that rely on cell culture passages, which typically result in attenuation that depends only on small numbers of attenuating point mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Kinney1">[41]</xref>, alternative genetic strategies such as viral chimeras offer the promise of more stable attenuation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Wang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Paessler1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Wang2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Kenney1">[44]</xref>. In addition to the risk of reactogenicity, attenuation based on small numbers of mutations can also result in residual alphavirus infectivity for mosquito vectors. This risk, which was underscored by the isolation of the TC-83 VEEV vaccine strain from mosquitoes in Louisiana during an equine vaccination campaign designed to control the 1971 epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Pedersen1">[45]</xref>, is especially high when a vaccine that relies on a small number of point mutations is used in a nonendemic location that could support a local transmission cycle.</p>
      <p>To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we exploited the finding that the EMCV IRES sequence functions inefficiently for translation in insect cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Finkelstein1">[33]</xref>, yet can replace the alphavirus subgenomic promoter to mediate translation of the structural polyprotein open reading frame from the genomic RNA in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Volkova1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Kim1">[32]</xref>. The resultant CHIKV strain replicated efficiently in Vero cells, an acceptable vaccine substrate, and exhibited a stable plaque morphology and consensus genome sequence after 10 passages in this cell line. The CHIKV/IRES vaccine candidate was unable to replicate in mosquito cells or in the mosquito vector, <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, an important safety feature for an live arbovirus vaccine that may be administered to travelers or laboratory workers in nonendemic locations.</p>
      <p>Attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of the CHIKV/IRES vaccine candidate was assessed alongside that of the 181/25 CHIKV strain, which is highly immunogenic in humans and other animals yet inadequately attenuated. The goal was to equal the immunogenicity of the 181/25 vaccine strain but to achieve greater attenuation. Using infant and adult immunocompetent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Ziegler1">[35]</xref> and interferon type I receptor-deficient mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Couderc1">[36]</xref>, we demonstrated that CHIKV/IRES met both goals. As measured by survival and weight gain or maintenance, CHIKV/IRES was similarly or better attenuated than 181/25 in multiple mouse models, yet generated comparable neutralizing Ab titers and nearly complete protection against disease or mortality after CHIKV challenge. Immunity and protection were maintained for at least 3 months. Viremia after CHIKV/IRES vaccination was never detected in infant CD-1 mice, and was transiently present at a very low level in immunocompromised A129 mice, an important attenuation phenotype considering that viremia could potentially lead to mosquito infection. However, even in the unlikely event that vaccination of an immunocompromised human led to viremia, the mosquito-incompetent phenotype discussed above should prevent transmission. The only measure of efficacy for which strain 181/25 exhibited a slight superiority was in the prevention of footpad swelling post challenge; CHIKV/IRES-vaccinated A129 mice challenged with wt-CHIKV exhibited a greater mean of 0.15mm swelling versus only 0.09 mm for strain 181/25. However, both vaccines provided significant protection compared with sham-vaccination.</p>
      <p>Splenic histopathology was used as a second measure of protection. Mice challenged with wt-CHIKV after sham vaccination developed severe necrosis along with a monocytoid infitrate. in contrast, the CHIKV/IRES vaccine induced no splenic histopathology and protected against splenic lesions upon challenge.</p>
      <p>Previous attempts to use the EMCV IRES to generate an alphavirus vaccine used the VEEV live-attenuated vaccine strain TC-83 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Wang1">[30]</xref>. Although these studies succeeded in eliminating the ability of TC-83 to infect mosquito vectors, immunogenicity was reduced to the point where most vaccinated mice did not develop detectable neutralizing antibodies (although significant protection against challenge was still detected). In contrast, our CHIKV vaccine started with the genetic backbone of a virulent wt alphavirus (LR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002142-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), and robust immunogenicity was maintained despite strong attenuation. These results suggest that the IRES attenuation level may be optimal when applied to other wild-type alphavirus backbones. The application of this platform for attenuation is now being applied to Venezuelan, western, and eastern equine encephalitis viruses to test this hypothesis.</p>
      <p>In summary, a novel CHIK vaccine candidate, CHIKV/IRES, was generated by manipulation of the structural protein expression of a wt-CHIKV strain via the EMCV IRES. This vaccine candidate exhibits a high degree of murine attenuation that is not dependent on an intact interferon type I response, yet is highly immunogenic and protects against CHIKV challenge. This promising vaccine candidate is being tested in nonhuman primates to determine if it is suitable for evaluation in humans.</p>

        <p>The CHIKV cDNA clone containing the EMCV IRES with the subgenomic promoter ablated using 13 synonymous mutations (CHIKV/IRES) was produced using standard recombinant DNA techniques in which the infectious clone of La Reunion strain (LR) described previously was used as a template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Tsetsarkin2">[34]</xref>. This CHIKV clone, a gift from Stephen Higgs, contains an SP6 bacteriophage promoter for transcription of RNA that is identical to genomic viral RNA. The IRES sequence was PCR amplified from a cDNA clone described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002142-Volkova1">[31]</xref>. The inactivation of the subgenomic promoter was done using site-specific mutagenesis. An intermediate construct encoding the 3′ end of the nsP4 gene through the subgenomic promoter was produced using PCR with high fidelity Phusion DNA polymerase from Finnzymes (Espoo, Finland). The resultant amplicon was cloned into a shuttle vector, prS2, and was sequenced using the BigDye kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The 5′ end of capsid gene from the LR strain was amplified using PCR with an overhang complementary to the IRES sequence. The IRES-containing and capsid fragments were then joined using fusion PCR, and this fragment was cloned back into the shuttle vector and resequenced. The IRES/Capsid fragment and the mutated subgenomic fragment were finally ligated together through the SpeI site introduced into both fragments. The completed insert was then cloned into the LR backbone and this final construct was completely sequenced.</p>
