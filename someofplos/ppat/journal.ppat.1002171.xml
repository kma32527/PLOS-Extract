        <p>Despite effective chemotherapy to treat schistosome infections, re-infection rates are extremely high. Resistance to reinfection can develop, however it typically takes several years following numerous rounds of treatment and re-infection, and often develops in only a small cohort of individuals. Using a well-established and highly permissive mouse model, we investigated whether immunoregulatory mechanisms influence the development of resistance. Following Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infected mice we observed a significant and mixed anti-worm response, characterized by Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses. Despite the elevated anti-worm response in PBMC's, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, this did not confer any protection from a secondary challenge infection. Because a significant increase in IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>GITR<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes was observed, we hypothesised that IL-10 was obstructing the development of resistance. Blockade of IL-10 combined with PZQ treatment afforded a greater than 50% reduction in parasite establishment during reinfection, compared to PZQ treatment alone, indicating that IL-10 obstructs the development of acquired resistance. Markedly enhanced Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses, worm-specific IgG1, IgG2b and IgE and circulating eosinophils characterized the protection. This study demonstrates that blocking IL-10 signalling during PZQ treatment can facilitate the development of protective immunity and provide a highly effective strategy to protect against reinfection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Schistosomes are zoonotic parasitic helminths that infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Despite effective chemotherapy, schistosomiasis- the disease caused by these parasites, still plagues tropical regions of the world. This is due, in part, to poor resistance to reinfection resulting in high re-infection rates following treatment. This lack of resistance is intriguing, as effective treatment relies upon drug-induced parasite damage combined with host immune mediated killing. Furthermore, it has been widely reported that post-treatment, individuals develop and retain elevated levels of anti-parasite immune responses. We therefore asked why resistance to re-infection is so poor, despite the development of significant anti-worm responses post-treatment.</p>
        <p>It is essential that immune responses are controlled by various immunosuppressive mechanisms to prevent immune-mediated pathologies. However, a robust immunoregulatory response may obstruct the development of protective immunity. Thus, a balanced immune response providing a non-pathogenic yet effective immune response may be required for the development of effective resistance to reinfection. Understanding the immunological mechanisms of resistance to re-infection and the role of effector and regulatory responses may aid in the development of more effective vaccines and treatment strategies for schistosomaisis. This study suggests that combining chemotherapy with drugs that block IL-10 might provide an improved strategy to elicit acquired immunity to this parasite.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite inexpensive and effective chemotherapy, schistosomiasis continues to plague sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia, south America and areas of the Caribbean. This is due, in part, to rapid re-infection rates following curative chemotherapy. Recent estimates indicate that 200 million individuals are infected with a further 700 million people at risk of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Steinmann1">[1]</xref>. Although schistosomiasis research and control programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Bethony1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Colley1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hagan1">[4]</xref> are attempting to increase the availability and variety of anti-schistosomal drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Cioli1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-AbdulGhani1">[6]</xref> (particularly following the emergence of praziquantel (PZQ)-resistant parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Melman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Doenhoff1">[8]</xref>) and develop novel vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hotez1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Oliveira1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Pearce1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Wu1">[12]</xref>, additional approaches are required to complement classical chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>A central tenet of vaccine strategies for schistosomiasis is the induction of immunity to infection and re-infection. Despite significant work in this area over the last half century, the precise mechanisms of resistance to re-infection continue to be debated. Results from sufficiently powered longitudinal field studies suggest that resistance to re-infection can develop naturally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Silveira1">[13]</xref>, but only after multiple rounds of exposure, treatment, and re-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Gryseels1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Mutapi1">[15]</xref>. These observations have led to an age-dependent resistance model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Gryseels1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Etard1">[16]</xref>, which has dominated the schistosomiasis field for several decades. In this model, children &lt;15 years old are highly susceptible to re-infection post-treatment, with a gradual increase in resistance over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Etard1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Butterworth1">[17]</xref>. However, a recent study by Karanja and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Karanja1">[18]</xref> challenged this model and reported that occupationally exposed individuals in Kenya fall into one of three distinct groups; (1) immunologically resistant to re-infection independent of age; (2) immunologically susceptible irrespective of age; and (3) resistant to re-infection following multiple rounds of treatment. This important study suggested that resistance to re-infection could develop in response to curative chemotherapy and thus may not be strictly age-dependent, but rather exposure-dependent. It is worth noting however, that age and exposure are themselves proportional to one another and closely related.</p>
      <p>Many studies have reported correlations between immunological responsiveness to schistosome antigens and protection from re-infection, supporting an immunological mechanism of resistance to re-infection. Karanja and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Karanja1">[18]</xref> support this hypothesis and implicated CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in the development of resistance, loosely inferred from reduced resistance to schistosome infection observed in HIV<sup>+</sup> patients with low CD4 counts. To date, few reports have provided a detailed analysis of concurrent immunological effector and regulatory responses that are induced following PZQ treatment, either in humans or animal models. We wondered whether activation of inappropriate ‘regulatory’ responses might be disrupting the development of resistance to re-infection following curative chemotherapy. To address this question, we conducted a detailed analysis of the immunological response post-PZQ treatment, characterizing both effector and immunoregulatory responses in the highly permissive experimental mouse model of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> infection. In addition to enhanced Th2 responses as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Brown1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Joseph1">[20]</xref>, we observed increased in anti-worm Th1 and Th17 responses two-weeks after PZQ treatment. Despite the exaggerated anti-worm responses in PZQ-treated mice, no resistance to a subsequent challenge infection was observed. Using a bicistronic IL-10<sup>gfp</sup>-reporter mouse system, we identified increased populations of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>GITR<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>gfp+</sup> cells in the blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver of PZQ-treated and re-challenged mice. These observations suggested that an effector or regulatory population expressing IL-10 might be restricting the emergence of immunity following PZQ treatment. To investigate this, we used anti-IL-10R antibodies to block IL-10 signaling. Mice administered anti-IL-10R antibodies during PZQ-treatment displayed a greater than 50% reduction in worm burdens compared to control mice. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-10 signaling impedes the development of immunity to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and suggests that interfering with immunoregulatory mechanisms in combination with PZQ can accelerate resistance to re-infection in mice.</p>

          <p>Serum samples were diluted in TBS/Tween and wells washed between each incubation step with TBS/Tween. Flat-bottomed 96 well plates were coated with 10 µg/ml of SWAP diluted in carbonate buffer (0.1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.2). After washing, non-specific binding was blocked by incubating wells with 5% BSA (Fraction V, Gibco) in carbonate buffer, for 2 hours at 37°C. Doubling dilutions of serum from 1∶10 to 1∶1280, or as indicated, was then added and plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. For measurement of SWAP-specific-IgE, IgG was first depleted as SWAP-specific-IgG antibodies, which may be in more than 100-fold excess to IgE antibodies, interfere with the detection of SWAP-specific IgE. A 1∶4 dilution of serum in PBS was incubated overnight on a rotator at 4°C with protein-G bound sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech) (85 µl, packed beads). IgG-depleted serum was recovered by centrifugation, diluted in TBS/Tween and added to SWAP-coated plates. Plates were incubated with Biotinylated anti-mouse IgE (Clone R35 118, Pharmingen) for 2 hours before Extravidin–alkaline phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the plate at 4 µg/ml for 1 hour at 37°C.

Anti-worm Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5) responses were evident in SWAP-stimulated circulating leukocytes, m:LN and splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>) in addition to immunoregulatory IL-10. Similar to observations made here in murine schistosomiasis, schistosome-infected humans treated with PZQ experience a gain in weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Coutinho1">[29]</xref>, an increase in worm-specific cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Colley2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Grogan1">[31]</xref> and increase in anti-worm Th2 responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Grogan1">[31]</xref>. Anti-worm Th1 (IFNγ) was only detected in the spleen, while evidence of a Th17 response (IL-17A) was only detected in the local m:LN and in the PBMC's of PZQ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>). Thus, following PZQ-treatment, anti-worm Th2, Th1 and Th17 responses were all increased, with statistically significant increases of IL-5, IFNγ, IL-17A and IL-10 in various immunological compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>). Anti-worm IgG2a was also increased following PZQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g001"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>) with anti-worm IgG1 remaining unchanged and anti-worm IgE undetectable (data not shown). Collectively these data indicate that a mixed anti-worm cytokine, cellular and humoral immune responses were enhanced following PZQ treatment.</p>

        <title>IL-10R blockade during PZQ treatment increases resistance to re-infection</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that the lack of resistance to re-infection, in the face of significant anti-worm immune responses, was due to increased IL-10, which could be inhibiting protective anti-worm immunity. We tested this hypothesis by blocking IL-10 signaling with anti-IL-10 receptor blockade from week 6 (at the time of PZQ treatment) to week 8 (time of challenge infection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). Significantly fewer worms were recovered at week 15 in mice treated with anti-IL-10R Ab (35/PZQ/120 + anti-IL-10R), compared to challenge-only (–/–/120), challenge-only and anti-IL-10R Ab treatment (–/–/120 + anti-IL-10R) or PZQ-treated mice with control antibody (35/PZQ/120)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). Moreover, IL-10R blockade during PZQ treatment afforded similar protection as mice given an irradiated cercariae vaccination (Irr/–/120), the gold standard for vaccine-induced immunity. These data indicate that IL-10 impedes the development, or effector mechanisms, of resistance to re-infection after treatment. Correlating with increased resistance was a reduction in circulating neutrophils and an increase in eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). Anti-worm Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5), as well as Th1 (IFNγ) and Th17 (IL-17A) responses in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>) and m:LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>) were also elevated in resistant mice. Correlating with the broadly enhanced T helper responses in anti-IL-10R Ab treated mice, anti-worm IgG1, IgG2b and IgE isotypes were also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002171-g005"><bold>Figure 5F</bold></xref>). Anti-schistosomula responses in the spleen and m:LN were increased following PZQ treatment, however there was no significant change with the addition of anti-IL-10R blockade (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002171.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>).</p>

Taken together, these data indicate that blocking IL-10 signaling during PZQ treatment can accelerate resistance to re-infection. A wide range of immunological parameters were elevated in resistant mice, including anti-worm Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses as well as a mixed antibody response. Although a single immunological parameter did not stand out and correlate with resistance, a mixed response may indeed be the correlate of protection in this system.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we have demonstrated that following PZQ treatment, IL-10 inhibits the development of protective immunity to secondary schistosome infection. We observed an elevated anti-worm immune responses following PZQ treatment alone, however this failed to confer any protection to a secondary challenge infection, as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Gold1">[33]</xref>. This was largely due to the inhibitory effects of IL-10, as blockade of IL-10 combined with PZQ treatment raised protective immunity from 0% to more than 50% when compared with PZQ treatment alone.</p>
      <p>Although still debated, resistance to re-infection in humans appears to develop following repeated cycles of treatment and re-exposure. Exposure history can only be estimated, and therefore the notion that many rounds of re-infection are required before resistance develops has stood for many years. This has led to an age-dependent resistance model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Butterworth1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Sturrock1">[34]</xref>, with suggestions that in addition to several rounds of exposure, puberty and hormones may also influence resistance to re-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Fulford1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Kurtis1">[36]</xref>. Recent evidence however, suggests that resistance is not strictly tied to age, but rather resistance is a product of exposure and curative treatment cycles, combined with changes in the immunological status of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Karanja1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Black1">[37]</xref>. In a recent study, patients rapidly, gradually, or never developed resistance to re-infection throughout a 5-year prospective treatment- re-exposure study. These findings suggested to us that resistance might be primarily immunologically determined, rather than being strictly dependent on age and exposure history.</p>
      <p>Following PZQ treatment, <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-infected patients have been shown to exhibit elevated IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Brown1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Joseph1">[20]</xref> responses and increased numbers of circulating eosinophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Kimani1">[38]</xref>. Colley and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Colley2">[30]</xref> have also observed elevated anti-worm responses in schistosome infected Egyptians up to 2-years following PZQ treatment. We observed a similar increase in parasite-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and antibody production in infected mice following PZQ treatment. However, despite exhibiting significantly elevated anti-worm responses, the mice remained fully susceptible to a secondary challenge infection. Mitchell and colleagues also investigated this phenomenon and found that immunizing mice with adult worm antigens in combination with PZQ treatment was still incapable of conferring protection from re-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Mitchell1">[39]</xref>. A large proportion of drug treated patients also remain highly susceptible to reinfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Colley2">[30]</xref>. The mechanism behind the failure to generate a protective recall response following a cleared primary infection remains unclear. The current hypothesis from human studies suggests that several treatment and re-exposure cycles are needed, which triggers the release of worm antigens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Woolhouse1">[40]</xref> that repeatedly prime and boost the immune response, analogous to the immunity achieved following multiple vaccinations. Several rounds of treatment and re-infection likely mimic and accelerate the acquisition of acquired immunity, which would otherwise take years to develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Mutapi1">[15]</xref>. So, the question remains - why do infected and treated hosts develop increased anti-worm immune responses but remain susceptible to re-infection?</p>
      <p>We designed experiments to avoid the influence of egg-induced liver inflammation when non-specific resistance can develop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-McHugh1">[41]</xref>. The cost of such experimental design however, does pose a limitation on translating our findings to human infections, where diagnosis is often based upon egg detection. We hypothesized that opposing immunoregulatory responses were developing in parallel with the effector response and inhibiting the activation of effective anti-worm immunity. In support of this hypothesis, we observed a marked increase in IL-10 production and identified a population of putative regulatory T cells (CD4+CD44+CD25+GITR+IL-10gfp+) following PZQ treatment. Although we did not observe any change in Foxp3+ cells following PZQ treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility that the IL-10-producing T cells are a subset of Foxp3+ natural regulatory T cells or recently activated effector T cells. An increased IL-10 response has also been observed in PZQ-treated humans, which similarly paralleled an elevated anti-worm Th2 response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Joseph1">[20]</xref>. Longitudinal immunological studies conducted in schistosome endemic regions have also strongly implicated a negative regulatory role for IL-10 in the development of resistance to re-infection in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-vandenBiggelaar1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Leenstra1">[43]</xref>. Despite developing enhanced parasite-specific IL-5 responses following treatment, Van den Bigelaar and colleagues identified a concurrent increase in parasite-specific IL-10, and proposed that IL-10 was a major risk factor for re-infection. Similarly, Leenstra and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Leenstra1">[43]</xref> found that elevated IL-10 predicted a decrease in time to re-infection with several reports describing inverse correlations between IL-10 and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Caldas1">[44]</xref> or <italic>S. haematobium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Mutapi2">[45]</xref> infection intensity. These data support the concept that IL-10 functions as an important regulator of protective immunity and resistance to re-infection, which is consistent with its well established role as a suppressor of immunopathology during infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Sher1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-FloresVillanueva1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-FloresVillanueva2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Bosshardt1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Wynn1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Wynn2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hoffmann1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hesse1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Mangan1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Freeman1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Sadler1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Herbert1">[57]</xref>.

However, whether IL-10 obstructs the development of resistance to re-infection remained unclear.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that IL-10 was suppressing both anti-worm and anti-larval responses and was responsible for the failure to develop resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hoffmann2">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hogg1">[63]</xref>. We tested the impact of IL-10 in the development of resistance in a therapeutic model, combining anti-IL-10R Ab treatment with PZQ treatment. IL-10-blockade during PZQ treatment further increased anti-worm immune responses, and afforded significant protection from re-infection. Anti-larval responses were not directly measured in this study and although there may be cross-reactivity between adult and larval epitopes, increased resistance correlated with increased anti-adult immune parameters. The level of protection following combined PZQ treatment and IL-10 blockade equaled that achieved by the irradiated cercariae vaccination, which serves as the ‘gold standard’ for vaccine induced immunity. This observation is supported from other studies suggesting that immunoregulatory responses, in particular IL-10, can actively impede the development of immunity to infection either naturally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Anderson1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Belkaid1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Belkaid2">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Couper1">[67]</xref>, or following vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Bin1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Brooks1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Darrah1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Igietseme1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Roberts1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Silva1">[73]</xref>. Whether the Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR), which is expressed on these cells, functions as a proliferative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Liao1">[74]</xref>, cytokine enhancing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Motta1">[75]</xref>, or inhibitory receptor is currently unknown. Nevertheless, it is clear from our studies that IL-10 expressed in GITR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and potentially other cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hesse1">[53]</xref>, restricts the type and magnitude of the protective immune response following treatment with PZQ. Thus, combining IL-10R blockade with chemotherapy may accelerate the development of protective immunity in otherwise permissive hosts.</p>
      <p>It has previously been reported that resistance to re-infection in mice can be achieved through physiological means, as mentioned above. Wilson and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Wilson2">[76]</xref> demonstrated that the development of anastomoses precludes parasite maturation and migration, with reduced adult worm establishment. Although we cannot rule this out in our system, we believe there to be an immunological mechanism of resistance following IL-10R blockade. Many immunological correlates of resistance to re-infection in humans have been reported including IL-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Butterworth1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Roberts2">[77]</xref> and eosinophilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Butterworth2">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-GanleyLeal1">[79]</xref>, mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-GanleyLeal2">[80]</xref> and IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Roberts2">[77]</xref>. Antibody responses, in particular anti-IgE adult worm antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Butterworth1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Butterworth2">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hagan2">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Dunne1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Caldas2">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Dunne2">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Demeure1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Dunne3">[86]</xref> and CD23<sup>hi</sup> B cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Mwinzi1">[87]</xref> have also been described. In our studies, blockade of IL-10 in conjunction with PZQ treatment led to an increase in eosinophilia and adult worm-specific IL-4, IL-5, IFNγ and IL-17A. Anti-worm-specific IgG1, IgG2b and IgE were also elevated, providing evidence of an exaggerated but mixed cytokine profile, which was shown previously to improve vaccine-induced immunity to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> by boosting both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the parasite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hoffmann2">[62]</xref>. Whether larval stages (cercariae, early and late stage schistosomula) are the targets of protective immunity with anti-IL-10R mAb + PZQ treatment are currently unknown. Greater protection from schistosome infection has been observed in IL-10-deficient mice given an irradiated cercariae vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002171-Hoffmann2">[62]</xref>. In this scenario a mixed Th1/Th2 response was observed. Furthermore, whether a single immunodominant antigen is responsible for the protection is also not known. Conceivably, IL-10 blockade may allow a wider repertoire of antigens with greater magnitude and diversity. The impact of IL-10 on antigen repertoire and different classes of immune responses with respect to resistance to re-infection should be the subject of future studies if this regimen is to move successfully into patients.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that IL-10, derived predominantly from CD4+ lymphocytes, hampers the development of critical effector mechanisms that mediate resistance to schistosome infection following treatment. These observations suggest that immunomodulators delivered in combination with PZQ treatment may be required to generate the robust and mixed humoral and cell-mediated immune response that is required to prevent reinfection with schistosomes.</p>
