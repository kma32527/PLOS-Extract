        <p>The essential transactivator function of the HIV Tat protein is regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. Although individual modifications are well characterized, their crosstalk and dynamics of occurrence during the HIV transcription cycle remain unclear.</p>
        <p>We examine interactions between two critical modifications within the RNA-binding domain of Tat: monomethylation of lysine 51 (K51) mediated by Set7/9/KMT7, an early event in the Tat transactivation cycle that strengthens the interaction of Tat with TAR RNA, and acetylation of lysine 50 (K50) mediated by p300/KAT3B, a later process that dissociates the complex formed by Tat, TAR RNA and the cyclin T1 subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). We find K51 monomethylation inhibited in synthetic Tat peptides carrying an acetyl group at K50 while acetylation can occur in methylated peptides, albeit at a reduced rate. To examine whether Tat is subject to sequential monomethylation and acetylation in cells, we performed mass spectrometry on immunoprecipitated Tat proteins and generated new modification-specific Tat antibodies against monomethylated/acetylated Tat. No bimodified Tat protein was detected in cells pointing to a demethylation step during the Tat transactivation cycle. We identify lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1) as a Tat K51-specific demethylase, which is required for the activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells. LSD1/KDM1 and its cofactor CoREST associates with the HIV promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and activate Tat transcriptional activity in a K51-dependent manner. In addition, small hairpin RNAs directed against LSD1/KDM1 or inhibition of its activity with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine suppresses the activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells.</p>
        <p>Our data support the model that a LSD1/KDM1/CoREST complex, normally known as a transcriptional suppressor, acts as a novel activator of HIV transcription through demethylation of K51 in Tat. Small molecule inhibitors of LSD1/KDM1 show therapeutic promise by enforcing HIV latency in infected T cells.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>One of the remaining questions in HIV research is how the virus establishes a dormant (latent) stage and thereby escapes eradication by current antiretroviral therapy. Latently infected T cells do not produce significant amounts of viral genomes or viral proteins due to the silencing of a specific step in the viral life cycle called transcription. Viral transcription can be reactivated in latently infected cells, a process that rekindles HIV infection after antiretroviral therapy is discontinued. A key regulator of viral transcription is the viral Tat protein. Here we identify a novel cellular enzyme that regulates HIV transcription through the modification of the Tat protein. This enzyme, LSD1, is generally known as a transcriptional suppressor. In HIV infection, however, it acts as a transcriptional activator because downregulation of LSD1 expression or inhibition of its enzymatic activity suppresses reactivation of HIV from latency. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms of HIV latency and identify a potential new strategy that may help to keep HIV dormant in latently infected cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epigenetic processes are critical in the regulation of gene expression from the integrated HIV provirus and have become a focal point of research in therapeutics for HIV latency. Latently infected T cells persist in HIV-infected individuals despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and rekindle the infection when HAART is discontinued <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Han1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Noe1">[2]</xref>. In the majority of latently infected cells, HIV infection is blocked at the transcriptional level. Therapeutic efforts are aimed at permanently silencing HIV gene expression in latently infected cells or at “flushing out” the viral reservoirs by reverting the transcriptional silencing that lies at the core of HIV proviral latency.</p>
      <p>Known epigenetic processes involved in the regulation of HIV gene expression include DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Blazkova1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kauder1">[4]</xref>, chromatin remodeling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Treand1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Agbottah1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Mahmoudi1">[7]</xref>, posttranslational modifications of histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-VanLint1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Imai1">[9]</xref> and posttranslational modifications of the HIV Tat protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Ott1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kiernan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Bres1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Boulanger1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-VanDuyne1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans2">[16]</xref>. Tat is an essential viral gene product that potently activates HIV gene expression through its unique interactions with the TAR element located at the 5′ ends of nascent viral transcripts and the cellular positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Wei1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Liang1">[18]</xref>. Two Tat species naturally exist in HIV-infected cells: a full-length Tat protein of ∼101 aa length encoded by both <italic>tat</italic> exons and a shorter splice variant of 72 aa length encoded by the first <italic>tat</italic> exon. Both Tat forms are transcriptionally active and form a trimolecular complex with the cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb and TAR RNA to recruit the kinase activity of CDK9 to elongating HIV transcripts. The bulk of Tat is produced after successful integration of the provirus into the host genome where it activates its own production via a feed-forward mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Weinberger1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several posttranslational modifications of Tat have been identified that modulate the interactions of Tat with P-TEFb and TAR RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Hetzer1">[20]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002184.s006">Table S1</xref>). Two of these modifications, acetylation of K50 and monomethylation of K51, occur at adjacent residues within the arginine-rich motif (ARM) in Tat, a region involved in TAR RNA binding, nuclear localization and protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Hauber1">[21]</xref>. K50 is the preferred target for the acetyltransferase activity of p300/KAT3B in Tat while K51 is monomethylated by the lysine methyltransferase Set7/9/KMT7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Ott1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kiernan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Col1">[22]</xref>. K50 and K51 are also targets of the acetyltransferase activity of hGCN5/KAT2A and the di- or trimethyltransferase activity of SETDB1/KMT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-VanDuyne1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Col1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>K50 acetylation and K51 monomethylation have both important positive regulatory functions in Tat transactivation. Monomethylation of K51 strengthens the interactions of Tat with P-TEFb and TAR RNA while acetylation of K50 dissociates the Tat/TAR/P-TEFb complex and recruits the PCAF/KAT2B histone acetyltransferase to the elongating RNA polymerase II complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Dorr1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Mujtaba1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kaehlcke1">[25]</xref>. These findings form the basis for a dynamic view of the Tat transactivation cycle in which changes in the modification status of Tat occur sequentially and govern differential cofactor interactions of a single Tat molecule during HIV transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Bres2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Ott2">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We were intrigued by the close proximity of the two modifications in Tat (K50 acetylation and K51 methylation) and speculated that a bimodified protein may exist in cells. Similar studies were previously performed with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and supported the model that lysines in close proximity to each other are sequentially methylated and acetylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Ivanov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kurash1">[29]</xref>. However, we did not detect bimodified Tat in cells using mass spectrometry or newly generated antibodies specific for monomethylated/acetylated Tat. Instead, we identified LSD1/KDM1 as a Tat demethylase and an unexpected new transcriptional coactivator required for activation of HIV gene expression in latently infected T cells.</p>

        <title>Acetylation of K50 inhibits monomethylation of K51 in Tat <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>To examine how acetylation of K50 affects monomethylation of the neighboring K51 residue, we incubated short synthetic Tat peptides (aa 48–58) carrying an acetylated lysine at position 50 with recombinant Set7/9/KMT7 enzyme and radiolabeled S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Reactions were dissolved on a high percentage Tris-Tricine gel and examined by autoradiography. Acetylation at K50 completely suppressed methylation of the peptide by Set7/9/KMT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The same was observed when a K51-monomethylated peptide was tested in the reaction indicating that K50 is not a target of the Set7/9/KMT7 monomethyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We also performed the inverse experiment and incubated a Tat peptide carrying a monomethyl group at position 51 with the K50 acetyltransferase p300/KAT3B and observed that acetylation can proceed, albeit with a 40% decrease in efficiency as compared to an unmodified peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, a K50-acetylated peptide was further acetylated by p300/KAT3B confirming previous results that K51 also functions as a target of the p300/KAT3B acetyltransferase activity, especially when K50 is not available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Ott1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kiernan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Deng1">[30]</xref>. Similar results were observed when the reactions were performed with full-length synthetic Tat proteins (aa 1–72) carrying acetylated K50 or monomethylated K51 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002184.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These data demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> monomethylation cannot occur efficiently on an acetylated Tat substrate supporting previous data that point to a role of K51 monomethylation early in the Tat transactivation cycle before acetylation of K50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans2">[16]</xref>. Because we find that K50 acetylation can occur <italic>in vitro</italic> when Tat is monomethylated, we examined whether Tat is subject to sequential monomethylation/acetylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitated Tat</title>
        <p>To search for monomethylated/acetylated Tat in cells, we performed mass spectrometry of Tat immunoprecipitated from TNFα-activated J-Lat A2 cells. This Jurkat-derived cell line harbors an integrated bicistronic lentiviral vector, which expresses FLAG-tagged Tat and GFP from the integrated HIV LTR (LTR-Tat-IRES-GFP) upon stimulation with TNFα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Jordan1">[31]</xref>. Immunoprecipitated material was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with FLAMINGO fluorescence dye. The Tat band was cut from the gel and applied to in-gel digestion with chymotrypsin. Residual digested peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A representative MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of the digested peptides is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, and more than 100 peptide ion signals were detected. A peptide encompassing the Tat ARM region without modification was detected at 1084.681 <italic>m/z</italic>, which was identified as the peptide from glycine 48 to arginine 55 in the Tat-FLAG molecule by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We also detected a mass signal at 1197.724 <italic>m/z</italic>, which corresponded to the Tat peptide from lysine 50 to arginine 57 carrying a monomethyl group at lysine 51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Bimodified Tat (AcK50/Me1K51) was not detected in this experiment. In addition, we did not detect dimethylation at K51, but detected a peptide in which both K50 and K51 carried a mass addition of 42 Da, indicating that these residues could be either acetylated or trimethylated in cells (data not shown). Mass spectrometry cannot differentiate efficiently between these two modifications. We previously confirmed that acetylation of K50 exists in cells using acetylation-specific Tat antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kaehlcke1">[25]</xref> but could not detect trimethylation of K51 using trimethyl-Tat-specific antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans3">[32]</xref> supporting a model where both residues may be acetylated rather than trimethylated in cells.

Quantitative PCR analysis of the immunoprecipitated material with primers specific for the HIV LTR indicated that LSD1/KDM1 and CoREST, while only present at low concentrations at the promoter under nonstimulated conditions, were specifically recruited in response to TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, LSD1 and CoREST).

        <p>To test the function of LSD1/KDM1 in HIV transcription, A2 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing two different shRNAs directed against LSD1/KDM1 or control shRNAs directed against firefly luciferase or a scrambled shRNA. All vectors also expressed the mCherry marker to track infection efficiencies. More than 90% of cells expressed mCherry after lentiviral vector infection, and no difference in infection efficiencies was observed between the different lentiviral vectors (not shown). ShRNA-expressing cells were stimulated with TNFα, and expression of GFP was measured by flow cytometry. GFP expression was reduced by 40-60% in LSD1/KDM1 knockdown cells as compared to cell lines expressing luciferase or scrambled shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). No toxicity of LSD1 knockdown was observed in shRNA-treated cells as measured by dye exclusion in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). ShRNA#1 had a stronger suppressive effect on GFP expression than shRNA#2 mirroring the degree of LSD1/KDM1 knockdown in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The same result was obtained in 5A8 J-Lat cells harboring a full-length GFP-tagged latent HIV genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002184.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Here, reactivation from latency is achieved by stimulation with α-CD3/CD28 antibodies in ∼40% of cells.

        <p>The same experiment was performed in a primary T cell model of HIV latency. Quiescent CD4+ T cells were isolated from blood of two healthy donors and were spin-inoculated with an infectious clone of HIV expressing luciferase within the <italic>nef</italic> open reading frame following a similar protocol as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Swiggard1">[41]</xref>. Infected CD4+ cells were cultured with the integrase inhibitor saquinavir for 3 days to ensure that postintegration latency was measured and then treated with increasing amounts of phenelzine followed by stimulation with α-CD3 and α-CD28 antibodies to activate latent HIV transcription. Activation of luciferase expression was successfully suppressed by phenelzine treatment confirming the effectiveness of the drug in the context of a full-length infectious clone of HIV in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). A slight decrease in cell viability was observed in one donor at the highest concentration of phenelzine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). However, no effect of phenelzine on cell viability was observed in additional two donors, in whom reactivation from HIV latency were also successfully inhibited by the drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002184.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, in activated primary T cells, phenelzine was more efficient in suppressing HIV gene expression than DRB while in latently infected, but not activated, cells phenelzine, contrary to DRB, had no suppressive effect on luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002184.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Collectively, these results identify phenelzine as a potent new inhibitor of HIV reactivation from latency and support the model that LSD1/KDM1 is a novel activator of HIV transcription through Tat demethylation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We investigated whether Tat lysine methylation and acetylation events within the Tat ARM are linked via a demethylation step mediated by LSD1/KDM1. Similar to previous reports on the tumor suppressor p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Ivanov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kurash1">[29]</xref>, we find that methylation and acetylation of Tat can occur sequentially <italic>in vitro</italic> with methylation at K51 occurring first allowing subsequent acetylation of K50, albeit at diminished efficiency. Detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of the Tat ARM reveals that a bimodified Tat form does likely not exist in cells because it was not detected by mass spectrometry and by western blotting using newly generated bispecific Tat antibodies. Instead, we identify LSD1/KDM1 as a K51-specific Tat demethylase and a novel transcriptional activator of HIV transcription. These findings may be clinically relevant because we demonstrate that phenelzine, a MAO inhibitor with activity against LSD1/KDM1, successfully suppresses re-activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells.</p>
      <p>Until recently, it was unclear whether methylation of lysines is reversible. Today, there exist two types of lysine demethylases, LSD1/KDM1 and Jumoji C domain-containing demethylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Tian1">[42]</xref>. LSD1/KDM1 is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase, which can demethylate lysine 4 in histone H3 (an activatory mark) and lysine 9 in histone H3 (a silencing mark). LSD1/KDM1 can remove methyl groups from mono- or di-, but not tri-methylated lysines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Shi2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Metzger1">[44]</xref>. Since the FAD-dependent amine oxidase family of enzymes, which includes MAO-A, MAO-B and LSD1/KDM1, share a common mechanism for the oxidative cleavage of the unactivated nitrogen, known MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine used in this study or others have activity against LSD1/KDM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Lee1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Culhane1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Mimasu1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Binda1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It was recently reported that besides histones, LSD1/KDM1 can also demethylate non-histone proteins including the tumor suppressor p53, the DNA methylase Dnmt1, and transcription factor E2F1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Huang1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kontaki1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Wang1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Nicholson1">[48]</xref>. Demethylation of p53 by LSD1 alters the interaction of p53 with its coactivator 53BP1 and represses the proapoptotic function of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Huang1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, demethylation of Dnmt1 by LSD1 triggers a loss of protein stability and a loss of global DNA methylation while demethylation of E2F1 is required for E2F1 stabilization and apoptotic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kontaki1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Wang1">[47]</xref>. Our finding that Tat function is activated by LSD1/KDM1-mediated demethylation adds another nonhistone protein to the growing list of LSD1/KDM1 substrates. Like E2F1, Tat is activated by LSD1/KDM1 demethylation, a finding that supports the model that the coordinated occurrence of Tat modifications is essential for efficient Tat transcriptional activity.</p>
      <p>Our finding that LSD1/KDM1 and CoREST are both recruited to the activated HIV LTR <italic>in vivo</italic> points to Tat demethylation as a novel mechanism how HIV may corrupt the function of a known corepressor complex to enhance its own replication. The interaction with CoREST is known to direct the LSD1/KDM1 activity towards lysine 4 in nucleosomal histone H3 and is associated with transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Shi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Lee1">[34]</xref>. However, LSD1/KDM1 can also act as a transcriptional activator for instance through demethylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 in conjunction with androgen receptor-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Metzger1">[44]</xref>, through demethylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 in α-herpesvirus infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Liang2">[49]</xref> or through demethylation of the E2F1 transcription factor which activates its apoptotic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Kontaki1">[46]</xref>. Evidence that support a role of Tat demethylation in the LSD1/KDM1 coactivator function in HIV transcription comes from the Tat K51A mutant, which remains unaffected by siRNA-mediated downregulation of LSD1/KDM1 expression. However, other LSD1 substrates may exist at the HIV promoter that activate HIV transcription when Tat is absent. An attractive target is methylated lysine 9 in histone H3 at the HIV provirus, which was previously linked to HIV latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Imai1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Marban1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Zhou1">[51]</xref> and is the target of the activatory function of LSD1/KDM1 in the transcriptional control of herpes simplex virus- and varicella zoster virus latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Liang2">[49]</xref>. Notably, a recent study shows that the latter function also involves CoREST indicating that a functional LSD1/KDM1/CoREST complex can function as suppressor of cellular gene expression or as activator of viral transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Zhou2">[52]</xref>. Interestingly, HDAC1/2 are generally part of this complex, but we do not observe any interaction of Tat with HDAC1 in our study. This may point to HDAC2 or another HDAC associated with the LSD1/KDM1 subcomplex recruited to the HIV LTR or may indicate that Tat specifically dissociates HDACs from LSD1/KDM1 complexes involved in its demethylation. Notably, binding of CoREST, but not HDAC1, to LSD1/KDM1 restored the ability of recombinant LSD1 to demethylate nucleosomal substrates while HDACs are thought to act upstream of LSD1/KDM1 by providing hypoacetylated substrates for demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Shi1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We focused here on the interaction between Tat demethylation at K51 and K50 acetylation, but interplay may also exist between K51 demethylation and other known Tat modifications such as arginine methylation within the Tat ARM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002184.s006">Table S1</xref>). We have previously shown that both acetylation and deacetylation of K50 in Tat are required for full Tat transactivation. While acetylation of K50 by p300/KAT3B dissociates Tat from TAR RNA and P-TEFb, deacetylation by SIRT1 may be necessary to recycle nonacetylated Tat for reentry into the transactivation cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans1">[12]</xref>. Here, we show that the same “Yang/Yang” principle applies to methylation and demethylation of K51 in Tat. Both, methylation of K51 by Set7/9/KMT7 and demethylation of K51 by LSD1/KDM1 activate Tat transactivation because knockdown or inhibition of each enzyme leads to reduction of Tat transcriptional activity in a K51-dependent manner. We propose a model where demethylation of Tat occurs as a critical step during the Tat transactivation cycle possibly before acetylation of Tat by p300/KAT3B occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002184-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In support of this model, we have previously shown that monomethylation of Tat is an early event that strengthens the interaction of Tat with TAR RNA and P-TEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Pagans2">[16]</xref>. In addition, we show here that <italic>in vitro</italic> monomethylation at K51 decreases efficient acetylation of K50 by p300/KAT3B supporting the model that prior demethylation is required to allow full Tat acetylation at K50 and possibly at K51 in cells. We also found in preliminary experiments that LSD1/KDM1 coimmunoprecipitates with p300/KAT3B in cellular extracts pointing to a potential recruiting function of LSD1/KDM1 for p300/KAT3B to Tat (N. Sakane and M.Ott, unpublished data).</p>

          <title>Model of LSD1/KDM1 action in HIV transcription.</title>
          <p>Demethylation of Tat by the LSD1/KDM1/CoREST complex is a required new step during Tat transactivation of the HIV LTR. We propose that it may occur before acetylation of Tat by p300/KAT3B. Inhibition of LSD1/KDM1 by phenelzine blocks this demethylation step and inhibits Tat transactivation during reactivation from latency.</p>

      <p>Our data provide important first evidence that LSD1 inhibitors may function as therapeutics to suppress reactivation of HIV transcription in latently infected cells. They further support the model that targeting Tat posttranslational modifications may be a valid therapeutic strategy to control HIV transcription and latency; Tat becomes “locked” in one modified state when individual modifying enzymes are blocked and the normal flow of Tat modifications is disturbed. Interestingly, MAO inhibitors with inhibitory functions towards LSD1/KDM1 have suppressive activity in latent infections of α-herpesvirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002184-Liang2">[49]</xref>. Our results indicate that they may have a broader antiviral application that includes HIV-1. The development of more specific LSD1/KDM1 inhibitors will bring further validation to the model that LSD1/KDM1 is an important new drug target in the treatment of latent HIV infection.</p>

          <p><bold>Reactivation of HIV expression from latency is suppressed in full-length 5A8 J-Lat cells activated with α-CD3/CD28 antibodies.</bold> For the generation of J-Lat cells responsive to T cell activation, we employed a VSV-G pseudotyped HIV reporter virus containing the GFP open reading frame in place of the <italic>Nef</italic> gene (HIV-R7/Env-/GFP) as previously described (Jordan et al., 2003, EMBO J, 22:1868-77) to infect Jurkat cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 96 h. GFP-positive cells were sorted twice with a FACSDiva cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) and discarded. GFP-negative cells were propagated for 1 week and stimulated with plate-bound α-CD3 (10 µg/ml) and soluble α-CD28 (2 µg/ml) antibodies for 12 h. GFP-positive cells were collected and propagated without stimulation to allow silencing of LTR transcription. Single cells were seeded in 96-well plates to generate cell clones. Examination of six clones revealed that they all had the same integration site as shown by repetitive Alu-gag PCR (Liszewski et al., 2009, Methods, 47:254-60). One of these clones, 5A8, was used in these experiments. (A) Western blot analysis of LSD1 expression in 5A8 cells infected with indicated shRNAs. (B) 5A8 cells expressing indicated shRNAs were re-stimulated with α-CD3/CD28 antibodies overnight, and GFP was measured by flow cytometry. One representative experiment performed in duplicate is shown.</p>

The number of GFP+ cells was analyzed by flow cytometry and expressed as percent GFP+ cells as compared to luciferase-shRNA-infected A72 cells.
