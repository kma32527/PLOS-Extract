        <p>Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular parasites that invade host cells by an active process leading to the formation of a non-fusogenic parasitophorous vacuole (PV) where the parasite replicates within the host cell. The rhomboid family of proteases cleaves substrates within their transmembrane domains and has been implicated in the invasion process. Although its exact function is unknown, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ROM1 is hypothesized to play a role during invasion based on its microneme localization and its ability to cleave essential invasion adhesins. Using the rodent malaria model, <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic>, we carried out detailed quantitative analysis of <italic>pyrom1</italic> deficient parasites during the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lifecycle. <italic>Pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites are attenuated during erythrocytic and hepatic stages but progress normally through the mosquito vector with normal counts of oocyst and salivary gland sporozoites. <italic>Pyrom1</italic> steady state mRNA levels are upregulated 20-fold in salivary gland sporozoites compared to blood stages. We show that <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> sporozoites are capable of gliding motility and traversing host cells normally. Wildtype and <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> sporozoites do not differ in the rate of entry into Hepa1–6 hepatocytes. Within the first twelve hours of hepatic development, however, only 50% <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites have developed into exoerythrocytic forms. Immunofluorescence microscopy using the PVM marker UIS4 and transmission electron microscopy reveal that the PV of a significant fraction of <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites are morphologically aberrant shortly after invasion. We propose a novel function for PyROM1 as a protease that promotes proper PV modification to allow parasite development and replication in a suitable environment within the mammalian host.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are obligate intracellular organisms that invade cells by an active mechanism mediated by the secretion of contents from specialized secretory organelles, the micronemes and rhoptries. Invaded parasites reside and replicate within a membrane-bound compartment called the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). PV formation is exclusive to development within mammalian specific host cells, the erythrocytes and hepatocytes. Proper modification of the PV is important to protect the parasite from host defenses and to serve as a gateway for nutrient acquisition and communication with the environment. The rhomboid proteins, a class of intramembrane serine proteases, are implicated in the invasion process. We studied the microneme rhomboid protease, ROM1 in the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic>. We find that pyROM1 is not important for efficient invasion into host cells and instead is important for survival within the host cells. Analysis of parasites developing within hepatocytes reveals a defect in PV development. We propose that pyROM1 provides a fitness advantage to parasites developing within host cells by promoting the proper modification of the PV.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Malaria is a pervasive infectious disease that causes one million deaths each year and exacerbates the social and economic instability of endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Greenwood1">[1]</xref>. Malaria is caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, obligate intracellular protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic> have a complex life cycle with multiple differentiated forms that cycle between a sexual stage in the mosquito vector and an asexual stage in the vertebrate host. As obligate intracellular parasites, apicomplexans invade cells through the use of highly specialized secretory organelles, the micronemes and rhoptries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Baum1">[2]</xref>. Secretion from the micronemes is concurrent with apical reorientation and attachment of the parasite to the host cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Huynh1">[3]</xref>. Tight apposition between the parasite and host cell plasma membrane forms the moving junction through the cooperation of the microneme adhesin AMA1 and the Rhoptry Neck proteins (RON) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Lebrun1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Alexander2">[6]</xref>. As the parasite pushes itself forward into the host cell, the moving junction, a constrictive ring that translocates posteriorly and forms a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) forms through the invagination of host cell plasma membrane. PV formation is accompanied by the secretion of rhoptry contents in the form of secretory vesicles that become incorporated into the nascent parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-SussToby1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Lingelbach1">[9]</xref>. The PV is devoid of most host cell proteins and avoids fusion with host lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Mordue1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Mordue2">[11]</xref>. Proper establishment and modification of the nascent PV is critical for the survival of the parasite.</p>
      <p>Sporozoites and merozoites are the invasive stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites that form a PV as they enter their host cells, the hepatocytes and the red blood cells (RBC), respectively. Until recently, studies of parasite invasion and development in hepatocytes have been limited. Much of what we know about apicomplexan host cell invasion and PV formation comes from studies using the model apicomplexan, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, and from studies using <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocytic stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Baum1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Bannister1">[12]</xref>. It is likely, however, that sporozoites invade host cells in a manner similar to <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites as illustrated in a recent study showing the importance of host F-actin polymerization at the site of parasite entry for <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Gonzalez1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites have enabled a gene-based approach to studying this important stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Matuschewski1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Tarun1">[17]</xref>. Sporozoites developing within the hepatocyte undergo a radical transformation within the first few hours post invasion. The intracellular sporozoite within its PV settles near the nucleus of host cells and modifies its long and polarized shape to become spherical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Bano1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Jayabalasingham1">[19]</xref>. The liver stage parasite grows and replicates within the PV ultimately releasing membrane bound bundles of thousands of daughter merozoites (merosomes) that then enter the erythrocytic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Sturm1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Tarun2">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Pre-erythrocytic stages are considered targets for the development of vaccines and prophylactic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Ballou1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Mahmoudi1">[23]</xref>. Recently, genetically modified live attenuated sporozoites that confer sterile immunity in rodent models were generated. The deleted genes, UIS3, UIS4, and P52 are upregulated in salivary gland sporozoites and are crucial for development within hepatocytes. Their gene products localize to the micronemes/secretory organelles of salivary gland sporozoites and are necessary for early liver stage development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Mueller1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-vanDijk1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Host cell invasion by apicomplexans is associated with proteolysis of surface proteins, which include resident surface antigens and apically-secreted adhesion molecules, collectively called adhesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Coppi1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Harris1">[30]</xref>. Proteases implicated in shedding of adhesins are parasite-encoded and include the subtilase class of serine proteases and the rhomboid class of serine proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Carruthers1">[31]</xref>. Rhomboid proteins are polytopic membrane-associated serine proteases that form a catalytic pocket within the lipid bilayer and have the unique characteristic of cleaving substrates within the transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Dowse1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Urban2">[34]</xref>. Rhomboid proteases recognize small residues such as glycine and alanine within the transmembrane domains of substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Urban3">[35]</xref>. In the Apicomplexa, processing of key microneme adhesins, such as TgMIC2, TgMIC6, TgAMA1 and PfEBA175, has been shown to occur via intramembranous cleavage at sites predicted to be rhomboid-like substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Opitz1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Howell1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-ODonnell1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The specific rhomboid protease(s) involved in these processes have not been identified. Based on expression, localization, and substrate specificity, two <italic>Plasmodium</italic> rhomboids, ROM1 and ROM4, are predicted to play a role during invasion. PfROM1 is co-localizes with microneme markers has the ability to cleave certain microneme invasion adhesins such as PfAMA1, PfMAEBL, certain EBLs, and rhoptry proteins of the Rh family in a cell based assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-ODonnell1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Baker1">[39]</xref>. In addition, a separate study reported that PfROM1 is localized to a new apical organelle, the mononeme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Singh1">[40]</xref>. When expression of the PfROM1 ortholog in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, TgROM1, is down regulated in tachyzoite parasites, there is a slight growth phenotype and mild invasion defect compared to the wildtype control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Brossier1">[41]</xref>. Disruption of <italic>pbrom1</italic> in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> led to attenuation ascribed to an invasion defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Srinivasan1">[42]</xref>, however, invasion of parasites into host cells was not directly tested in this study.</p>
      <p>It is still unclear if ROM1 plays a role during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite invasion. Using the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic>, we investigated the specific role of ROM1 during the parasite lifecycle. We show that ROM1 is not required for entry into host cells but, instead, ROM1 is necessary shortly after the parasite has entered the host cell to promote fitness and parasite survival.</p>

        <title>PyROM1 is expressed in all invasive stages of the parasite lifecycle, with increased expression during sporozoite stages</title>
        <p><italic>Pyrom1</italic> was cloned from cDNA of <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> 17XNL mixed blood stages using 5′ and 3′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Smart RACE Clontech). The sequence obtained consists of 4 exons and 3 introns, encompassing two annotated genes on PlasmoDB, py00729 and py00728. Based on topology predictions (TMHMM and HMMTOP), PyROM1 has seven transmembrane domains with the canonical rhomboid catalytic serine motif (GASTS) found within transmembrane domain four and a conserved histidine found within transmembrane domain six (merops.sanger.ac.uk). It has an N-terminal tail of 52 amino acids that includes the conserved microneme targeting motif YPHY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Sheiner1">[43]</xref> and a very short carboxy terminal tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002197.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> DNA microarray data, expression of <italic>pfrom1</italic> is similar to genes involved during invasion with a significant upregulation in the sporozoite stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-LeRoch1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Bozdech1">[45]</xref>. We quantified <italic>pyrom1</italic> mRNA in several stages of the malaria life cycle using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Amplification of <italic>Pyrom1</italic> cDNA from synchronized erythrocytic stages shows modest expression, with greatest expression in schizont (S) stages. There is a 10-fold increased expression in midgut (MG) sporozoites and a 20-fold increased expression in salivary gland (SG) sporozoites relative to expression levels of schizont stages. To control for appropriate expression analysis, additional expression profiles of other known genes (PyAMA1, PyUIS3, PyADA, PyTUB1, and PyCSP) was carried out using the same cDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002197.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Real time PCR using cDNA prepared from synchronized blood stage parasites, mosquito derived parasites, and hepatic stage parasites of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XNL. Expression levels were normalized to 18s rRNA and calculated relative to the Schizont (S) transcripts, set as 1. Parasite stages are abbreviated as follows: MG, Midgut sporozoites (Day 10); SG, Salivary Gland sporozoites (Day 14); 6, sporozoite development at 6 hours post-invasion; 24, Liver trophozoite development at 24 hours; 42, Liver schizont development at 42 hours; R, Blood stage rings; T, blood stage trophozoite; S, blood stage schizont. (B) Schematic of knock-in strategy using pR1HA construct consisting of the <italic>pyrom1</italic> ORF fused to an N-terminal triple HA tag under the control of its 5′ and 3′ regulatory elements. (C) Restriction digest strategy described in (B) was used to test integration of the knock-in construct. Homologous recombination of knock-in construct pR1HA into the <italic>pyrom1</italic> locus creates an MscI (M) restriction site that is specific to the hDHFR coding sequence. Restriction sites BstZ171 (B) lie just outside the <italic>pyrom1</italic> sequence used in pR1HA knock in vector. Digestion of PyROM1-HA (R1HA) gDNA yields a two fragment restriction pattern (B,M – 5.758 bp; M,B – 9.190 bp) when a probe specific to the 3′ flanking region is used (dumbbell bar). Digestion of wildtype (Wt) gDNA with both enzymes yields a single fragment (B,B – 7241 bp) using the same probe. (D) Western blot analysis of synchronized blood stage parasites using lysates from pyROM1-HA recombinant clone probed with anti-HA antibody reveals a band of the expected size, ∼30 kDa (R: Ring, T: Trophozoite, T/S: late Trophozoite/Schizont, S: Schizont). Mixed blood stages of wildtype parasites were loaded as a negative control (Wt). Saponin-released parasite lysates were loaded at 40 ug per lane to normalize for protein amounts.

        <p>To further characterize pyROM1 expression at the protein level, we generated a transgenic line that expresses pyROM1 tagged at the N-terminus with a triple hemaglutinin tag (3xHA). Single cross-over homologous recombination using hDHFR selection cassette yields the expression of the HA-tagged <italic>pyrom1</italic> open reading frame driven by its own 5′ and 3′ regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Successful integration of the knock-in construct was verified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from mixed erythrocytic stage transgenic parasites R1HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis of erythrocytic and sporozoite stages of PyROM1-HA reveals a band that migrates at the expected size of ∼30 kDa on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). In synchronized erythrocytic stages, PyROM1-HA protein expression is lowest in ring stages (3 hours post invasion) and increases during the course of development with a peak in schizont stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In sporozoite stages, PyROM1-HA is readily expressed in salivary gland sporozoites with very minimal expression in midgut sporozoites. The expression pattern of PyROM1 at the mRNA and protein level implies a function at multiple stages of the parasite life cycle with a particular importance for the zoite stages that mediate host cell invasion.</p>

        <p>To investigate the importance of <italic>pyrom1</italic> in the parasite life cycle, we employed a reverse genetics approach to generate loss-of-function deletion mutants. Initially we used a single crossover homologous recombination step to disrupt the endogenous <italic>pyrom1</italic> locus. Successful disruption of the <italic>pyrom1</italic> gene was confirmed by Southern blot and RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002197.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Disrupted parasites (R1INT) were used to carry out initial phenotypic screens. Because single crossover disruptants can revert to wildtype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Ting1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Sultan1">[47]</xref> we also created a deletion mutant that would allow us to cycle the parasites between the mammalian host and mosquito vector without the risk of reversion. We used a gene replacement vector to exchange the endogenous <italic>pyrom1</italic> gene for a pbDHFR/TS-GFP cassette by double crossover homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Mota1">[48]</xref>. The targeting vector contains the pbDHFR-TS/GFP selection cassette, which confers pyrimethamine resistance, flanked by DNA fragments from the upstream (5′ARM) and downstream (3′ARM) regions of the predicted open reading frame of <italic>pyrom1</italic>. We successfully integrated the replacement cassette, deleting exons 1–3 of the <italic>pyrom1</italic> gene that include the region encoding the functional catalytic serine motif and the conserved histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Recombinant parasites were detected by diagnostic PCR of genomic DNA from wildtype and transfected parasites. Cloning of pyrimethamine-resistant parasites yielded two knock out clones (R1KO-1 and R1KO-2) and a wildtype clone (Wt Ctrl). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from mixed blood stages confirmed successful cloning of <italic>pyrom1</italic> deletion mutants (R1KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Strategy for enzyme restriction digestion with either ScaI (S) or a combination of ScaI and MscI (M) using a probe (dumbbell bar) specific for the 3′ homologous arm is depicted in (A). A ScaI fragment that corresponds to the wildtype (Wt) genomic locus migrates at ∼7000 bp in both blots.

        <p>Infection of BALB/c mice (n = 5) with salivary gland sporozoites by natural mosquito bite or by intravenous injection (inoculum of 20–2000) revealed that mutant parasites could establish a liver infection leading to blood stage infection with a pre-patent period of three days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002197.s005">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites are able to progress through the entire lifecycle. Due to the highly infectious nature of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> sporozoites <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is difficult to quantify liver development by relying solely on pre-patency period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Briones1">[49]</xref>.

        <p>A unique feature of salivary gland sporozoites is their ability to use the motility machinery to traverse cells without productively invading a host cell and forming a PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Vanderberg1">[58]</xref>. When sporozoites traverse cells they glide in and out of the cell puncturing the plasma membrane and causing host cell injury. Host cell traversal can be detected by quantifying host cells that take up non-permeable high molecular weight FITC-dextran, in the presence of migrating sporozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Mota2">[59]</xref>. Using this assay, there was no difference in cell traversal activity between wildtype or R1KO sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <p>Analysis and quantification of sporozoite development in Hepa 1–6 cells at 6, 12, and 24 hours post invasion was carried out using fluorescence microscopy. Differential red-green staining of pyCSP was carried out to distinguish intracellular versus extracellular parasites at 6 hours post invasion. By 6 hours, exoerythrocytic forms (EEF) have begun to round up and change morphology as a prelude to development in hepatocytes. The percent of R1KO developing sporozoites in Hepa 1–6 cells was decreased at 6 hours compared to wildtype sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) but this difference was not statistically significant (P-value 0.17).

            <p>Development of sporozoites within Hepa 1–6 cells was analyzed at 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post invasion. (A) A double staining assay was carried out to determine the number of intracellular parasites undergoing development inside Hepa1–6 cells at 6 hours post infection The % intracellular parasites was determined by counting at least 30 fields per well. Values shown are the mean % intracellular parasites from duplicate counts ± standard deviation. The values were not statistically significant (P-value 0.17) using unpaired t test analysis. Parasite development at 12 hours (B) and 24 hours (C) post infection was assayed by staining with α-pyCSP and developing parasites per field were counted (at least 30 fields were counted per well). The numbers represented are the mean values of developing parasites/15 fields ± standard deviation. At 12 hours development there is a 45% reduction in <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasite development (P-value 0.008 using one-way ANOVA analysis) and at 24 hours there is at least a 60% reduction in pyrom1(-) parasite development (P-value 0.001 using one-way ANOVA analysis) D) Images of developing liver stage parasites at 6 hours and 12 hours stained with CSP show that despite reduced numbers, R1KO parasites are capable of undergoing the initial differentiation, transformation, and sphericalization during early hepatic development. (E) Development of <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites that survive the initial 24 hours go on to develop normally. Immunofluorescence of exo-erythrocytic forms (EEF) at 40 hours post invasion of Hepa1–6 cells was performed using anti-pyCSP to visualize developing parasites. Pictures of at least 50 EEF/well (duplicate) were taken. Area of EEF was measured using Image J software. Area was determined as an arbitrary value from images taken with the same magnification (40×). Bar graphs represent the mean area ± SEM.</p>

        <p>Although the number of developing EEFs decreased with each time point, the R1KO EEFs that were observed still exhibited morphological characteristics of parasites that had progressed appropriately during development. For example, these EEFs exhibited rounding up of the elongate sporozoite, increase in cell size, and juxta-nuclear position within host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). To determine the fate of the fraction of parasites that survive past the initial 24 hours post infection, we allowed parasites to develop in Hepa1–6 for 40 hours. By this time, the EEF has grown in size and has undergone several rounds of multiplication, becoming a liver schizont (i.e. mature EEF). Liver schizonts were analyzed microscopically by staining with CSP to determine if pyROM1 plays a role during growth and later development stages of EEF maturation. Quantification of EEF area reveals that R1KO parasites that survived the initial stages of development are able to proceed with normal growth and cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Immunofluorescence assay was performed on methanol fixed and permeabilized parasites post hepatocyte invasion at 2 hrs and 6 hrs development. The parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) was detected by staining with α-pyUIS4. Parasites (both extracellular and intracellular) were stained with pyCSP. The percent UIS4-CSP double stained parasites was determined by counting parasites staining with both UIS4 (PVM staining; see B) and CSP and dividing this number by the number of parasites staining with CSP (total parasites including extracellular parasites). Numbers are the average of triplicates ± SEM (at least 300 parasites counted) and were statistically significant using the unpaired t test analysis. (B) Images from experiment in (A) of sporozoites at 2 hours post Hepa1–6 infection showing localization of PyUIS4 (red) within PVM and the associated tubulovesicular network (asterisk) characteristic of intracellular developing parasites versus the speckled UIS4 localization within the sporozoites (white arrow). In the quantification of (A), only parasites with UIS4 PVM staining were counted positive for UIS4. Anti-CSP antibody (green) was used to visualize al parasites (intracellular and extracellular). The nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue). (C) Schematic of PyROM4TMGFP construct displaying the truncated sequence of PyROM4 used to clone into a vector containing an IgK leader sequence, an N-terminal GFP tag (green hexagon), and a C-terminal 2xMyc tag (gray triangle). Dashed blue parallel lines represent the boundaries of the TMD (amino acid sequence in red font color) as predicted by HMMTOP and TMHMM analysis tools (Expasy.org). Arrow depicts the predicted rhomboid cleavage site between an Alanine and a Glycine. Predicted full length size for PyROM4TMGFP is 40 kDa, and the predicted size for the N-terminal rhomboid cleaved product is a 34 kDa. (D and E) Western blot analysis of transiently transfected COS7 cells used to detect proteolytic activity of rhomboid against PyUIS4TMGFP. (D) Western blot of cell lysates probed with anti-HA antibody (Cell α-HA) show proper expression of DmRho-1 (Dm), TgROM5 (TgR5), and TgROM5<sup>SA</sup> (TgR5<sup>SA</sup>) in the first three lanes and no detection of protein in the “no rhomboid” (–) negative control in the fourth lane. (E) Processing of PyUIS4TMGFP (anti-GFP_UIS4) was analyzed by western blot of cell lysates (upper panel, Cell) and concentrated media fraction (lower panel, Media) by probing with anti-GFP antibody. Full length PyUIS4GFP is observed in the cell fraction at the expect size of ∼40 kDa. A lower molecular weight product (∼34 kDa) is detected in both cell and media fractions (arrow) only in the first lane where DmRho-1 (Dm) is co-expressed. No cleaved product is seen when PyUIS4TMGFP is co-expressed with TgROM5 (TgR5), TgROM5<sup>SA</sup> (TgR5<sup>SA</sup>), and the “no rhomboid” negative control (–).</p>

Therefore, it can be concluded that PyROM4, and potentially other eTRAMPs, can serve as substrates to rhomboid proteases.</p>
        <p>Our analysis of UIS4 in <italic>Pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites show that there is an inability to properly secrete UIS4 into the PVM. Furthermore, a rhomboid protease may be involved in the proper maturation, processing and targeting of PyUIS4 to the PVM since the TMD of UIS4 serves as a rhomboid substrate.</p>

        <title>Electron microscopic analysis of <italic>Pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites reveals a difference in PV formation</title>
        <p>To investigate whether <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites have a defect in PVM formation, we carried out ultrastructural analysis of R1KO parasites during early intra-hepatocytic development. Intracellular parasites at 4 hours post infection of Hepa1–6 cells were analyzed by electron microscopy. R1KO parasites (19 of 42) exhibited a strikingly reduced intravacuolar space with the PVM in close apposition to the plasma membrane of the parasite. In wildtype vacuoles this parasitophorous vacuole space has expanded and appears as a white “halo” surrounding the developing parasite inside a PVM and only one of 38 vacuoles had a closely apposed PVM <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002197.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002197.s006">Table S2</xref>). To quantify this phenotype we measured the area of the PV space (halo) as the difference between the area of the total PV space and the parasite area. This value was then normalized to the area of the parasite to give a ratio that represents the percentage of the PV space area relative to the parasite and is a representation of the extent of PV space expansion. Wildtype parasites had a significantly (P-value 0.0007) larger ratio value (0.17±0.02) compared to R1KO parasites (0.09±0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). To quantitatively show the existence of two populations, we plotted the distribution of parasites as a function of PV space area/parasite area ratio. The distribution plot clearly shows the existence of two parasite populations within the R1KO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002197-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). We hypothesize that the R1KO parasites with a normal PV space go on to develop past the initial 24 hours of development and the R1KO parasites with a reduced PV space abort development within the initial 24 hours. A few parasites in direct contact with the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm were observed in both wildtype (4/38) and R1KO (2/42) parasites, which we assume be sporozoites in traversal mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Silvie2">[64]</xref>. This ultrastructural analysis indicates that while R1KO parasites are capable of productively invading host cells with the formation of a PVM, a fraction of them have a defect in the subsequent PV expansion and modification in early development.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Successful transmission of malaria into the mammalian host is dependent on the ability of sporozoites to invade and establish a proper PV within the host hepatocyte. To date, only a handful of genes have been identified that play a role during invasion or early development of the sporozoite within hepatocytes. In this study we have characterized the rhomboid protease, ROM1, throughout the lifecycle of the malaria rodent model, <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic>.</p>
      <p>Quantitative expression analysis of <italic>pyrom1</italic> shows it is expressed at various invasive stages of the malaria life cycle. Expression of <italic>pyrom1</italic> follows a pattern similar to genes involved in merozoite invasion with maximal erythrocytic stage expression in schizonts. Relative to schizont stages, expression of <italic>pyrom1</italic> is increased by at least 10-fold during the sporozoite stages with <italic>pyrom1</italic> transcript levels upregulated by 2-fold from midgut sporozoites to salivary gland sporozoites. Midgut sporozoites are substantially less infectious in the mammalian host compared to salivary gland sporozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Matuschewski1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Touray1">[65]</xref>. This gain of infectivity has been ascribed in part to transcriptional changes that occur when sporozoites invade mosquito salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Matuschewski1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Kaiser1">[15]</xref>. In addition, we observe that, although transcript expression of <italic>pyrom1</italic> is elevated in midgut sporozoites, protein expression is barely detectable by Western blot, suggesting regulation of <italic>pyrom1</italic> gene expression at the level of transcript translation in midgut sporozoites. The upregulated expression of ROM1 mRNA and protein in salivary gland sporozoites is consistent with a role during infectivity and transmission into the vertebrate host. Supporting our observations, a microarray study looking at gene expression changes triggered by different host environments (i.e. mosquito host to mammalian host) reported that <italic>pfrom1</italic> is upregulated 4-fold when salivary gland sporozoites are shifted to 37°C in the presence of hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Siau1">[66]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have localized PyROM1 at various stages during the malaria life cycle. In schizonts, PyROM1-HA is localized to the apical end. In salivary gland sporozoites PyROM1-HA has a diffuse granular staining pattern similar to microneme proteins such as PyMAEBL. Microneme localization of PyROM1 agrees with previous studies of ROM1 localization in both <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Brossier2">[67]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Dowse2">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Brossier1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Sheiner1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-ODonnell1">[29]</xref>, but in our study this localization was only partial. Localization of pyROM1-HA in sporozoites during invasion revealed that it remains intracellular and does not seem to be secreted onto to the surface during invasion. There is no consensus on the localization of ROM1 during apicomplexan invasion since some studies report surface expression and posterior translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Singh1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Sheiner1">[43]</xref> and others report internal localization during invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-ODonnell1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Brossier1">[41]</xref>. Because of differences in the experimental conditions and expression constructs used for these localization studies, results are difficult to compare.</p>
      <p>Using a gene deletion approach, we demonstrate that pyROM1 functions during intracellular growth, within hepatocytes and erythrocytes, to provide a fitness advantage. Quantitative analysis of parasite development within Hepa1–6 cells revealed that PyROM1 is not essential for sporozoite invasion into the host cells. Instead, survival of <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites decreases within the first 24 hours post invasion. It is during these first 24 hours of development that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites undergo critical morphological changes such as PV modification, sphericalization of the elongate sporozoite, and increase in cytoplasmic size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Bano1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Jayabalasingham1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Sinnis1">[69]</xref>. PyROM1 may facilitate these initial vital steps during liver stages by allowing parasites to reach the critical threshold required to survive past the first 24 hours of differentiation. This <italic>in vitro</italic> development phenotype was confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> when mice infected with <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> sporozoites had decreased parasite liver burden at 36 hours post infection.</p>
      <p>Our results agree with previous studies showing that lack of ROM1 expression causes a decrease in parasite survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Brossier1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Srinivasan1">[42]</xref>. In a previous study, disruption of <italic>pbrom1</italic> resulted in attenuation during erythrocytic stages, a decrease in oocyst formation, and a decrease in liver stage burden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Srinivasan1">[42]</xref>. One major difference between the current study and the Srinivasan <italic>et al</italic> study is that we did not detect a decrease in the number of oocyst during development in the mosquito midgut. This difference in phenotypic observation can be attributed to the different methodologies used to analyze this stage. Oocyst development is biologically variable due to multiple factors such as host immunology (mosquito and mammalian), parasite variability, biological bottle necks, and other environmental conditions. Therefore, it is imperative that careful and repeated quantification and analysis of oocyst development be carried out in order to obtain statistically reproducible results. We have analyzed oocyst development in <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites thoroughly through multiple repeated experiments (at least three independent experiments) performed simultaneously with wildtype controls, using different batches of mosquitoes, and multiple parasite clones.</p>
      <p>We have analyzed the development of <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites in hepatocytes thoroughly by using well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> development and invasion assays. Thus our studies have extended our understanding of ROM1 function and have pinpointed more precisely the role of ROM1 during intracellular development. Brossier et al, studied ROM1 in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> tachyzoites and found that TgROM1 knockdown parasites had a 50% reduction in the number of daughter tachyzoites per vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Brossier1">[41]</xref>. Based on measurement of EEF area, we did not detect a defect in <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasite growth per vacuole, but an overall decrease in the number of developing parasites. Therefore, we predict that the intracellular parasites abort development in the stages preceding multiplication. This difference in phenotype between the TgROM1 knockdown parasites and our <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites may be explained by fundamental biological differences in the mode of replication between the two genera. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> tachyzoites divide by endodyogeny, a process where two daughter cells are formed within a mother cell, whereas <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites divide by schizogony a process where nuclear division leads to the formation of a multinuclear syncytium followed by the budding off of daughter merozoites at the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Striepen1">[70]</xref>. Thus, the events that occur post-invasion may have differing effects on the subsequent survival and development of the respective parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Kim1">[71]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The malaria parasite has four invasive stages: the ookinete, the midgut sporozoite, the salivary gland sporozoite, and the erythrocytic stage merozoite. Only two of these invasive zoites, the merozoite and the salivary gland sporozoite, form a PV, within which, growth and division of the parasite ensues. The phenotype displayed by <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites is only observed during the two stages where PV formation is a prerequisite for growth. The PVM provides a barrier that protects the parasite from host cell defenses such as lysosomal clearance or autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Levine1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Zhao1">[73]</xref>. This barrier is also the portal for nutrient acquisition and communication with the external environment. The intravacuolar parasite must modify and rearrange the PV through the secretion of contents from rhoptries and dense granules, with molecules that are yet to be fully characterized. The exclusivity of the <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> phenotype during intracellular development within the mammalian host suggests that ROM1 function is linked to proper PV formation and maturation either during or post invasion.</p>
      <p>Ultrastructural analysis at four hours post invasion reveals that <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites are capable of forming a PVM during hepatic development. But, the PVM in the <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites is intimately associated to the plasma membrane of the mutant parasite. In comparison, after invasion, wildtype parasites have substantially expanded their PV space, which is visible as a white ‘halo’ surrounding the intracellular parasite. When parasites first enter host cells, they have a tight fitting vacuole. Shortly after invasion, the vacuolar space expands, representing a modification of the PV. This modification is accompanied by targeting of parasite proteins to the PVM as well as changes in the lipid composition of the specialized vacuolar membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Bannister1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Notably, a fraction of <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites had a PV space similar to the wildtype parasites. We hypothesize that these are the parasites go on to develop normally into liver schizonts. These parasites may be able to progress due to a redundant function of other proteases such as ROM4 or ROM8, which are also expressed in sporozoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-LeRoch1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Siau1">[66]</xref>. Thus, <italic>pyrom1 (-)</italic> parasites display a partial penetrance phenotype where only a fraction (50–70%) of the clonal population display a mutant phenotype and the remainder fraction go on to develop normally. In addition to redundant function and partial complementation by another protease, this partial penetrance phenotype is explained by a stochastic mechanism where levels of processed substrate(s) must reach a threshold level to allow normal parasite development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Avery1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Tawfik1">[76]</xref>. In systems biology, such a stochastic mechanism occurs when a gene encodes for a non-essential phenotypic capacitor that serves to buffer various development, environmental, and genetic stresses. Since PyROM1 encodes an enzyme, it is subject to random biomolecular interactions that promote phenotypic variation.</p>
      <p>A previous study showed that intracellular parasites, deficient in two sporozoite specific proteins, p52 (p36p) and p36, were negative for UIS4 staining at the PVM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Labaied1">[63]</xref>. Like <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites, mutant parasites in p36/p52 have normal gliding, traversal, and hepatocyte invasion. However, unlike <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites, which are capable of establishing a PVM, p52 mutant and p36/p52 double mutant parasites failed to develop inside the hepatocyte due to an inability to establish or maintain a PVM during early infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-vanDijk1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Labaied1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-vanSchaijk1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Tarun3">[79]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasites have a 30% decrease in UIS4 staining at 2 hours and 6 hours post invasion, despite their ability to invade cells normally. If the PVM is established in conjunction with invasion, then the absence of UIS4 in the <italic>pyrom1(-)</italic> parasite vacuoles reflects a defect in the targeting of UIS4 to the PVM shortly after invasion and not necessarily a defect in establishing a PV.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms by which UIS4 or other eTRAMPS are secreted and associate to the PVM are still unknown. A previously published analysis suggested eTRAMP proteins have a TMD with sequence similarity to the canonical rhomboid substrate, Spitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Dowse1">[32]</xref>. Here, we show for the first time that the transmembrane domain of an eTRAMP, PyUIS4, serves as a rhomboid substrate to DmRho-1. Unfortunately, we were not able to express a catalytically active pyROM1 (data not shown) to test activity against candidate substrates, including known substrates of the PyROM1 homolog, PfROM1 such as AMA1 or Spitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Baker1">[39]</xref>. Therefore, we could not determine directly whether PyROM1 cleaves UIS4.</p>
      <p>Little is known about the dynamic processes that occur just after invasion when the parasite has entered a new environment and must undergo dramatic changes. It is well established that cells sense changes in their environment from external cues that activate a signaling cascade through an internal sensor such as a surface receptor. A function in the activation of a signaling molecule has been described for rhomboid proteases in several species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Freeman1">[80]</xref>. A recent study has attributed such a function to rhomboid protease activity in the parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Santos1">[81]</xref>. In this study, TgROM4 dominant negative mutants defective in replication were rescued by the over-expression of the cytoplasmic tail of TgAMA1 or PfAMA1 that resembled the rhomboid cleavage product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Santos1">[81]</xref>. Based on these results, intramembrane proteolysis of AMA1 is hypothesized to link the switch from invasion to replication. A biological role for rhomboid processing of AMA1 in <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic> has not been established since it is a minor event that is enhanced when the subtilisin protease PfSUB2, is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Harris1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Howell1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Howell2">[82]</xref>. Given that PfROM1 preferentially cleaved PfAMA1 relative to the TgROM4 ortholog, PfROM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Baker1">[39]</xref> and our current data, it is possible that ROM1 plays a role in a similar process in Plasmo<italic>dium</italic> species.</p>
      <p>A separate study, using conditional knockdowns, showed TgROM4 functions as a sheddase of surface adhesins during gliding motility and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Buguliskis1">[83]</xref>. Our studies demonstrate that ROM1 does not directly function as a sheddase during cell entry, but instead is important in the stages just after invasion of hepatocytes. Therefore, as proposed for TgROM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Santos1">[81]</xref>, we hypothesize that ROM1 activity links parasite invasion of host cells with parasite development within host cells. In a second model, ROM1 may function as a secretase that promotes the secretion of proteins such as UIS4 that are targeted to the PV or PVM for modification. A secretase activity may also serve to activate the secretion of a signal for parasite differentiation. In both models, ROM1 processing activity could occur prior to or after invasion. Further studies to identify substrates of ROM1 are needed to understand ROM1 function. Most importantly, this study provides new insights into the function of a rhomboid protease during intracellular development of Apicomplexan parasites.</p>

        <p>Thin smears of mixed blood stages were fixed in ice cold acetone/methanol (1∶1) for 3 minutes, blocked with 3% BSA/PBS, incubated with appropriate primary antibody, followed by secondary antibody. Washes were carried out using PBS-Tween 20 (0.005%). Salivary gland sporozoites were centrifuged onto 8-well glass Labtek chambers (Nunc), fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100. Fixed sporozoites were then blocked and incubated with antibody as described above. Washes were carried out using 1× PBS. For IFA of liver stages, infected Hepa1–6 cells at specified time points were fixed with ice cold methanol for 15 minutes and incubated with antibodies as described below. To capture invading R1HA sporozoites, Hepa1–6 cells were infected for 10 minutes, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked, and stained with α-pyCSP to detect extracellular or invading parasites, permeabilized with ice cold 100% methanol, and incubated with rabbit α-HA to detect pyROM1-HA. Primary antibodies used were 1/1000 rabbit α-HA (Sigma), 1/100 α-pyCSP 2F6 from hybridoma supernatants, 1/500 α-HA rat mAb 3F10 (Roche), 1/1000 rabbit α-pyMAEBL YM2T8 antisera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Kappe1">[88]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Noe1">[89]</xref>, 10 ug/ml rabbit α-PfBiP antisera (MR4 ATCC, MRA-20), 1/500 and rabbit αUIS4 antisera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002197-Kaiser1">[15]</xref>.
