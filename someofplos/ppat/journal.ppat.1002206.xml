        <p>The building blocks of bacterial flagella, flagellin monomers, are potent stimulators of host innate immune systems. Recognition of flagellin monomers occurs by flagellin-specific pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in mammals and flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) in plants. Activation of these immune systems via flagellin leads eventually to elimination of the bacterium from the host. In order to prevent immune activation and thus favor survival in the host, bacteria secrete many proteins that hamper such recognition. In our search for Toll like receptor (TLR) antagonists, we screened bacterial supernatants and identified alkaline protease (AprA) of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> as a TLR5 signaling inhibitor as evidenced by a marked reduction in IL-8 production and NF-κB activation. AprA effectively degrades the TLR5 ligand monomeric flagellin, while polymeric flagellin (involved in bacterial motility) and TLR5 itself resist degradation. The natural occurring alkaline protease inhibitor AprI of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> blocked flagellin degradation by AprA. <italic>P. aeruginosa aprA</italic> mutants induced an over 100-fold enhanced activation of TLR5 signaling, because they fail to degrade excess monomeric flagellin in their environment. Interestingly, AprA also prevents flagellin-mediated immune responses (such as growth inhibition and callose deposition) in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants. This was due to decreased activation of the receptor FLS2 and clearly demonstrated by delayed stomatal closure with live bacteria in plants. Thus, by degrading the ligand for TLR5 and FLS2, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> escapes recognition by the innate immune systems of both mammals and plants.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a common environmental bacterium that can infect and cause disease in a wide variety of hosts, ranging from humans to plants. In healthy individuals, the innate immune system can counteract this microorganism effectively; however immunocompromised patients and cystic fibrosis patients suffer from severe infections with this bacterium. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can propel itself through tissue by rotation of its long tail, called the flagellum, which is essential to establish colonization and infection of the host. The building blocks of the bacterial flagellum are over a thousand copies of the highly conserved protein flagellin. Mammals and plants have developed recognition systems to detect many different bacteria by sensing flagellin via Toll-like receptor 5 and Flagellin-sensitive 2, respectively. Bacteria actively try to interfere with this recognition (immune evasion). In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to escape flagellin recognition. The secreted protein alkaline protease of <italic>P.</italic> aeruginosa, degrades immunity activating free flagellin. Bacterial motility is maintained, because flagellin present as building block of flagella is not degraded. In this way, the bacterium impairs recognition and hides itself from destruction by the immune system. Understanding these immune evasion strategies is of extreme importance for the development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The innate immune system detects microorganisms and rapidly responds to invasion by eliminating them. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize various evolutionary conserved structures of microorganisms and play a crucial role in innate immune recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Akira1">[1]</xref>. Stimulation of these receptors triggers intracellular signaling cascades leading to activation of phagocytes and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLRs are type-1 transmembrane proteins characterized by extracellular leucine-rich-repeat motifs and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Dimerization of TLRs is important for activation and ligand recognition, for example TLR2 recognizes diacylated lipopeptides in combination with TLR1 and triacylated lipopeptides together with TLR6. The most studied TLR member is TLR4, which detects the Gram-negative outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR5 senses flagellin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Hayashi1">[2]</xref>, which is the major component of the bacterial flagellum.</p>
      <p>Flagella consist of a basal body, the flagellar hook and a filament which serves as a propeller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Chevance1">[3]</xref>. The filament consists of 11 protofilaments composed of several thousand flagellin monomers. Flagellin molecules from various bacteria have a conserved N- and C-terminus and a hypervariable central domain. The conserved regions are important in protofilament formation and motility. TLR5 recognizes a conserved part of flagellin that is buried in the flagellar filament and is only accessible in flagellin monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Smith1">[4]</xref>. By recognizing this part of flagellin, TLR5 detects almost all flagellated bacteria. Mutation of the TLR5-recognition site generally impairs protofilament assembly and thereby motility and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-AndersenNissen1">[5]</xref>. However, in the human pathogens <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> the flagellin is changed in such a way that it is no longer recognized by TLR5, while motility is not affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-AndersenNissen2">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Plants have evolved a similar sensing system for flagellin as mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-GomezGomez1">[7]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, stimulation of the plasma membrane-located receptor FLS2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Robatzek1">[8]</xref> results in the activation of defense responses, such as callose deposition and the production of pathogenesis-related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-GomezGomez1">[7]</xref>. Flagellin recognition contributes to the resistance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Zipfel1">[9]</xref>. Although TLR5 and FLS2 serve a similar function in pathogen recognition, the composition of the receptor, as well as the downstream signaling pathways differ considerably. Furthermore, FLS2 recognizes a different epitope of flagellin than does TLR5. A peptide, called flg22, consisting of 22 amino acids derived from the highly conserved N-terminal region of <italic>P. syringae</italic> flagellin activates FLS2 even better than purified flagellin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-GomezGomez1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-GomezGomez2">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a common environmental Gram-negative bacterium, which acts as an opportunistic pathogen in humans and plants. Normally, the human host counteracts this microorganism effectively via the innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Lyczak1">[11]</xref>. However, immunocompromised patients, severe burn victims and cystic fibrosis patients are sensitive for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections. Due to its tendency to colonize surfaces in a biofilm, the bacterium is impervious to therapeutic concentrations of many antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Costerton1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Detection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by TLRs activates the innate immune system and protects the host from infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Skerrett1">[13]</xref>. Flagellin of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a potent TLR5 activator. It is released during bacterial growth, because the long flagellum tail is easily disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Nouwens1">[14]</xref>. The contribution of TLR5 to the inflammatory response of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may be masked by activation of TLR4 by bacterial LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Feuillet1">[15]</xref>. Both receptors cooperate to defend the host from infection: the absence of both TLR4 and TLR5 results in hypersusceptibility for lung infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Ramphal1">[16]</xref>. Recognition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> flagellin is important for the efficient clearance of the bacterium in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Balloy1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Two extracellular proteases of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that exert their activity at the invasive stage have been associated with virulence i.e. elastase and alkaline protease. Elastase cleaves collagen, IgG, IgA, and some proteins of the complement system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Matsumoto1">[18]</xref>. It also degrades fibronectin to expose receptors for bacterial attachment on the mucosa of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Azghani1">[19]</xref>. Elastase disrupts the respiratory epithelium and interferes with ciliary function. So far, alkaline protease and elastase together are also reported to cause the inactivation of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Parmely1">[20]</xref>. A <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic> strain, that lacks alkaline protease was shown to be less virulent and persistent in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> infection model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Liehl1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Immune evasion is an important strategy for bacteria to survive in their host. Immune evasion molecules are crucial for this survival, as has been demonstrated for several human and plant pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Rooijakkers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Foster1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Chavakis1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-deJonge1">[25]</xref>. During infection, monomeric flagellin released from bacterial flagella activates TLR5 signaling. To evade innate immune recognition, some bacteria have evolved strategies in which they manipulate flagellin to impair TLR5 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-AndersenNissen2">[6]</xref>. We hypothesized that bacteria secrete proteins that interfere with recognition of TLRs. In our search for immune evasion molecules that act as TLRs antagonists, we identified alkaline protease of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as a TLR5 signaling inhibitor.</p>

        <title>A secreted protein of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> inhibits TLR5 activation</title>
        <p>To identify TLR5 inhibitors, we screened several culture supernatants of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria for inhibitory activity on activation of TLR5-transfected HEK cells (HEK/TLR5) containing an NF-κB luciferase reporter. Stimulation of HEK/TLR5 with flagellin triggers the activation of NF-κB and the secretion of Interleukin 8 (IL-8) into culture supernatants. These cells are insensitive for the TLR4 ligand LPS, whereas they respond to monomeric flagellin in the picomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Most bacterial supernatants did not significantly inhibit IL-8 production upon flagellin stimulation. However, the supernatant of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reduced activation of HEK/TLR5 cells consistently with about 30%. Therefore, this supernatant was chosen to isolate the potential TLR5 inhibitor.</p>

            <p>HEK/TLR5 cells were transfected with a NF-κB reporter construct. Cells were incubated with 20-fold diluted elution fraction from a Q sepharose column (inhibitor) for 30 min and subsequently challenged with various concentrations recombinant flagellin of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (□). Flagellin without inhibitor (▪) and LPS (•). (A) After 6 h the IL-8 concentration in the cell culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. (B) NF-κB activation was determined by measuring luciferase activity in a luminometer and expressed as fold increase of luciferase activity over stimulation with culture medium alone. The presented data are representative for the inhibition of TLR5 signaling that is typically observed with purifications of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> supernatant.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To purify the inhibitory compound from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we fractionated the supernatant with ion-exchange chromatography. In an agonist dose response experiment, specifically eluted fractions inhibited IL-8 production completely when the HEK/TLR5 cells were stimulated with up to 10 ng/ml flagellin of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In a parallel independent assay, the same fractions inhibited flagellin-stimulated NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

To verify that AprA inhibits TLR5-mediated cell activation, we cloned and expressed <italic>aprA</italic> with a 6x His-tag or together with the genes encoding the secretion apparatus in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified AprA from the medium. The TLR5 inhibitory activity of recombinant His-AprA and secreted recombinant AprA (data not shown) was comparable to that of purified AprA from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g002">2B</xref>).

To determine the potency of AprA, different concentrations were tested for inhibition of the flagellin-induced IL-8 production by HEK/TLR5 cells.

        <p>Another possible mechanism to interfere with TLR5 recognition is neutralization or proteolysis of flagellin. To test this hypothesis, isolated flagellin was incubated with AprA and degradation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Flagella from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are composed of either type A or B flagellin, depending on the strain. These two flagellins contain a completely different variable domain, but showed comparable degradation patterns upon incubation with increasing concentrations AprA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>). An identical cleavage pattern was observed for recombinant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> flagellin type B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, AprA cleaved flagellin from another species i.e. <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Degradation of flagellin was time-dependent and started within one minute after addition of AprA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Cleavage of flagellin occurred in multiple steps, dependent on the protease concentration and incubation time. At higher concentrations of AprA, flagellin type A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) flagellin were completely degraded, while for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> flagellin type B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>) a truncated protein of about 37 kD remained visible.

        <p>Flagellin is the most abundant protein of the flagellum, which is essential for bacterial motility and virulence. Secretion of a protease by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that degrades the flagellum would be disadvantageous for the bacterium. Therefore, we investigated whether AprA also degrades complete flagellar filaments isolated from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These filaments consist of polymerized flagellin. Incubation of flagellin polymers with AprA did not result in degradation of flagellin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, after depolymerization, the resulting monomeric flagellin was degraded by AprA. Even at higher concentrations AprA did not cleave flagellar filaments as observed for monomeric flagellin. This indicates that AprA inactivates only monomeric flagellin in the surrounding of the bacterium, while the integrity of flagella is preserved.</p>

        <p>As demonstrated above, purified recombinant AprA effectively blocked flagellin-induced TLR5 activation. To address the importance of this protease in a more natural environment, we compared the TLR5-activating capacity of culture supernatants from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> wild-type (WT) and <italic>aprA</italic> transposon-insertion mutants. In this setup, we tried to understand the dynamic interaction between the endogenous flagellin and AprA when released simultaneously by growing bacteria. Only the supernatant of the <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strains triggered TLR5 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly the supernatant of the wild-type strain did not initiate IL-8 production at all. This experiment indicates that AprA completely degraded flagellin monomers that were released in the supernatant during overnight growth. As expected, dilution of supernatants of the <italic>aprA</italic> mutants limited TLR5 activation due to a decrease in flagellin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To show that the absence of AprA is responsible for the TLR5-activating capacity in the <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strains, we supplemented the culture medium of these strains with recombinant AprA before inoculation. This resulted in the same lack of activation as for the wild-type strain supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), demonstrating that AprA is essential as well as sufficient for degradation of flagellin. Complementary, addition of AprI to the culture medium abolished AprA-mediated cleavage of flagellin in the wild-type strain resulting in activation of TLR5 to comparable levels of that of the <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These results show that the wild-type strain does release flagellin in its environment. To investigate the inflammatory response of naturally TLR4 and TLR5 sufficient cells, we stimulated neutrophils with bacterial supernatant of wild-type and an <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strain. As for HEK-TLR5 cells, the aprA mutant strain triggered higher IL-8 production in comparison to wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Addition of polymyxin B, to neutralize LPS, slightly inhibited IL-8 production of neutrophils in response to supernatant of wild-type and the <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strain, without changing the difference in IL-8 production between the two strains. To verify that the <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strains did not produce AprA, the culture supernatant was probed with a specific antiserum against AprA by western blotting. As expected, the wild-type strain secreted AprA while the two <italic>aprA</italic> mutant strains did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Growth and motility of the mutant strains was comparable with wild-type.

Previously, Melotto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Melotto1">[33]</xref> showed that besides these environmental cues, recognition of bacterial PAMPs, such as flagellin and LPS, trigger plant immune responses that lead to rapid stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In this way, the stomata have an important early defense function that actively prevents bacteria from entering the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Melotto1">[33]</xref>.

Only monomeric flagellin activates TLR5 signaling, while in the polymeric form, which is present in flagella, the TLR5 recognition site is inaccessible. Previous studies showed that the N- and C-terminus of flagellin are located inside the flagellar filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Yonekura1">[34]</xref>. This highly conserved part of flagellin activates TLR5 and is essential for filament assembly. Here we show that AprA fails to degrade polymeric flagellin and therefore does not affect motility. In this way, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> protects its functional flagellin present in flagella, while it neutralizes TLR5-activating monomeric flagellin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The proteolytic activity of AprA can be inhibited with EDTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Caballero1">[29]</xref> and with a natural inhibitor of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, AprI, which blocks the catalytic site of AprA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Hege1">[26]</xref>. We demonstrate that AprI prevents AprA-mediated flagellin cleavage. The physiological role for AprI is unclear. An obvious possibility is that it protects intracellular bacterial proteins from degradation.</p>

          <title>Proposed mechanism for AprA.</title>
          <p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> secretes AprA, which degrades free monomeric flagellin in the surrounding of the bacterium, whereas polymeric flagellin present in flagella is not affected. In this way flagellin is not recognized by TLR5 and FLS2, and thereby <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> escapes activation of the innate immune system in both mammals and plants. AprA is secreted in one step over both membranes and is not present in its active form in the cytoplasm of the bacterium.</p>

      <p>Bacterial release of monomeric flagellin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Nouwens1">[14]</xref> results in the activation of TLR5. Since picomolar concentrations of flagellin can trigger TLR5, highly efficient degradation is a prerequisite to abolish TLR5 signaling. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> produces sufficient amounts of AprA to degrade its own released flagellin completely, resulting in avoidance of TLR5 activation. Mutant <italic>aprA</italic> strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lacking AprA illustrate that AprA is responsible for this effect, because supernatants of these strains activate TLR5 signaling. This is best demonstrated in our experiments where we use supernatants of wild-type bacteria that contain endogenous amounts of flagellin and AprA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002206-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). No TLR5 activation was observed in these experiments, while the same experiments with mutant strains lacking AprA showed high flagellin-mediated stimulatory capacity. The effect of TLR4 and TLR5 in the host defense against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was shown to be redundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Skerrett1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Ramphal1">[16]</xref>. However, TLR5 is the only TLR that is significantly higher expressed on neutrophils in the cystic fibrosis lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Koller1">[35]</xref>. In addition, flagellin triggers phagocytosis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and oxidative burst by peripheral blood neutrophils. Supernatant of an <italic>aprA</italic> mutant enhanced the inflammatory response of human neutrophils in comparison to wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> supernatant. This suggests that flagellin-mediated TLR5 activation is important to stimulate an inflammatory response against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which is inhibited by AprA. Liehl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Liehl1">[21]</xref> recently reported that an <italic>aprA</italic> knockout strain of <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic> showed decreased virulence in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> infection model. In their model, <italic>P. entomophila</italic> AprA is necessary to persist in the host and for pathogenicity. Moreover, AprA protected against the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response. Although no homolog of TLR5 is described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, flagellin does trigger the production of antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Samakovlis1">[36]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that the immune evasion strategy of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is also operational in this model. In this scenario, escape of innate immune detection by AprA-mediated degradation of pathogen-derived monomeric flagellin in the environment, avoids the production of antimicrobial peptides by the host, which results in a more persistent infection with <italic>P. entomophila</italic>.</p>
      <p>In plants we observe the same phenomenon. The FLS2 flagellin receptor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> recognizes a different epitope of flagellin then does TLR5. By affecting the ligand instead of targeting the receptor, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> evades recognition of flagellin by both FLS2 and TLR5. The same was true for the flagellin-derived peptide flg22, which stimulates FLS2. Stomatal closure is important to prevent bacteria from entering the plant and recognition of flagellin by FLS2 plays a profound role in this response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Zeng1">[37]</xref>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lacking a functional <italic>aprA</italic> gene triggers faster closure of stomata in comparison with wild-type. Thus, AprA interferes with this early defense response. Although <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> itself is not a true plant pathogen, other <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species that infect <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> like <italic>P. syringae</italic> also contain an <italic>apr</italic> operon. AprA and its inhibitor AprI of <italic>P. syringae</italic> share similarity with AprA and AprI of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> of 71% and 50%, respectively. Hence, evasion of TLR5 and FLS2 recognition as we observed for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may be a broad mechanism utilized by various bacterial species.</p>
      <p>AprA belongs to the superfamily of metzincin metalloproteases and to the family of serralysins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Stocker1">[38]</xref>. Proteases from <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> belong to the family of serralysins and share high sequence similarity with AprA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Guzzo1">[39]</xref>. These bacteria also possess a highly specific protease inhibitor and a similar secretion system for AprA. In these flagellated bacteria AprA homologs may degrade flagellin in the same way as observed for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. AprA cleaves flagellin from both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. Since the cleavage site of AprA is within the conserved domain of flagellin, cleavage of flagellin from other flagellated bacteria can be expected.</p>
      <p>Innate immune defense systems recognize evolutionary conserved structures. Evasion of immune receptors is a smart strategy of pathogens to escape activation of the host innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-Bestebroer1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002206-deHaas1">[41]</xref>. For a bacterium with a broad host range it is of great advantage to evade activation of the innate immune system by degrading the ligand that is recognized by the host. Here we provide evidence that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has evolved such a system to circumvent TLR5 and FLS2 activation by flagellin degradation. The consequence is that the benefit for the bacterium, in this case intact flagella and movement should be protected. By secreting AprA, which is specific for monomeric form of flagellin, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> has tackled this, without affecting the structure of flagellin in the flagellum. In this way <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> can evade the activation of pattern-recognition receptors such as TLR5 and FLS2 signaling, creating a window of opportunity to evade the immune system of different hosts and cause disease.</p>
