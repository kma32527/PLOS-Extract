        <p>Horizontal transmission of cytomegaloviruses (CMV) occurs via prolonged excretion from mucosal surfaces. We used murine CMV (MCMV) infection to investigate the mechanisms of immune control in secretory organs. CD4 T cells were crucial to cease MCMV replication in the salivary gland (SG) via direct secretion of IFNγ that initiated antiviral signaling on non-hematopoietic cells. In contrast, CD4 T cell helper functions for CD8 T cells or B cells were dispensable. Despite SG-resident MCMV-specific CD8 T cells being able to produce IFNγ, the absence of MHC class I molecules on infected acinar glandular epithelial cells due to viral immune evasion, and the paucity of cross-presenting antigen presenting cells (APCs) prevented their local activation. Thus, local activation of MCMV-specific T cells is confined to the CD4 subset due to exclusive presentation of MCMV-derived antigens by MHC class II molecules on bystander APCs, resulting in IFNγ secretion interfering with viral replication in cells of non-hematopoietic origin.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) infect 50 to 90 % of the world's population and cause severe clinical complication in immunosuppressed individuals. An important tissue for horizontal transmission is the salivary gland (SG). CD4 T cells are crucial for viral control in this organ. However, how CD4 T cells control MCMV and why CD8 T cells, important effector cells in other organs, are inefficient in the SG, remains unclear. Here we show that CD4 T cells exert direct antiviral effector rather than helper functions by secretion of IFNγ acting on non-hematopoietic cells. Although SG-resident CD8 T cells were able to produce IFNγ and outnumbered CD4 T cells, absence of MHC class I expression on infected cells due to CMV-encoded immune evasion genes and concomitant absence of cross-presenting antigen presenting cells prohibited antigen recognition by CD8 T cells. Deletion of CMV-encoded immune evasion genes enabled CD8 T cells to control MCMV replication in the SG in absence of CD4 T cells. Hence, CMV control depends on direct antiviral functions of CD4 T cells because of exclusive MHC class II-restricted CMV antigen presentation by bystander APCs in the SG, exemplifying a strategy of effective immune evasion by which CMVs to promote their own transmission.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs), members of the β-herpesvirus family, establish a latent persistent infection. Although primary infection in immune-competent individuals is in general clinically silent, severe complications caused by reactivation or primary infection are frequent in immune-compromised patients such as transplant recipients or HIV patients. However, even in individuals with a competent immune system, CMV is detectable in mucosal secretions for a long period after primary encounter, representing the main source for both horizontal and vertical transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Mocarski1">[1]</xref>. As sustained replication and shedding of CMVs by the salivary gland (SG) into the saliva is one of the prime reasons for primary and secondary CMV infection (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Boppana1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Britt1">[3]</xref>), in addition to transmission via breast milk and genital secretions, it is of particular interest for the virus to evade its immune recognition in the SG. Prolonged shedding of CMV into the saliva is also observed in murine CMV infection (MCMV), rendering it a valuable model to identify mechanisms of how CMVs are controlled in the SG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Campbell1">[4]</xref>. On the host side, specific immune mechanisms are required to control viral replication in the SG: Depletion of CD4 T cells abolished viral control in the SG with sustained viral replication up to 10 weeks post infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic1">[5]</xref>. Sustained MCMV replication is restricted in the SG to a particular cell subset, the acinar glandular epithelial cells (AGECs). As systemic neutralization of IFNγ and TNFα abolished antiviral MCMV control in the SG, it was proposed, but never directly proven, that CD4 T cells control viral replication via secretion of IFNγ and TNFα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lucin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Pavic1">[7]</xref>. MCMV-specific CD4 T cells were indeed found to produce both of these cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Walton1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Arens1">[9]</xref>, but it remains unclear whether CD4 T cells directly control MCMV replication via secretion of IFNγ and TNFα. Further, although never directly addressed experimentally, it was proposed that IFNγ secreted by virus-specific CD4 T cells may act on other immune cells such as NK cells to induce antiviral activities in these secondary effector cells and not directly on infected target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Campbell1">[4]</xref>. In contrast to CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and B cells seem to be dispensable for MCMV control in the SG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Polic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic3">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many open questions remain as to why CD4 T cells are so crucial to control MCMV in the SG and not - or to a lesser extent – in other tissues. Up to date it is unclear whether CD4 T cells are necessary to support the recruitment or function of other immune cell subsets in the SG during MCMV infection, as immune responses to MCMV have not been investigated comprehensively in this relevant tissue. To investigate in detail local immune control of MCMV replication in the SG, we identified the exact mechanisms of antiviral control exerted by CD4 T cells. We prove that production of IFNγ by CD4 T cells is essential to control MCMV replication and IFNγ needs to be sensed by radio-resistant cells and not by cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Despite being able to secrete IFNγ and outnumbering MCMV-specific CD4 T cells, MCMV-specific CD8 T cells are unable to control MCMV replication in the SG due to extensive virus-induced down-regulation of MHC molecules on infected AGECs. Hence, antigen recognition in the SG depends on local professional APCs having taken up and processed exogenous MCMV-derived antigens. Intriguingly, SG-resident APCs are unable to cross-present particulate antigens, resulting in severe paucity of MHC class I but largely intact MHC class II presentation of MCMV-derived epitopes on these APCs. Thereby MCMV efficiently evades its immune recognition and elimination by CD8 T cells, ensuring prolonged viral shedding into the saliva and promoting horizontal transmission.</p>

        <title>Helper functions exerted by CD4 T cells are dispensable for control of MCMV infection in the SG</title>
        <p>CD4 T cells are crucial to control MCMV infection, especially in the SG where productive viral replication continues in the absence of these cells, at least for 10 weeks which was the longest observation period in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lucin1">[6]</xref>. We corroborated this finding and extended the observation period to more than one year, by comparing viral titers of two mouse strains that lack CD4 T cells, namely MHC class II knockout (MHCII<sup>-/-</sup>) and CD4 knockout mice (CD4<sup>-/-</sup>), with wild type C57BL/6 (B6) mice at different stages post MCMV-Δ<italic>m157</italic> (herein after referred to MCMV) infection. <italic>m157</italic> is expressed on the surface of MCMV-infected host cells and interacts with the activating receptor Ly49H on NK cells of B6 mice, thereby leading to enhanced viral control. We deliberately used an <italic>m157</italic> deletion mutant in our studies as most laboratory mouse strains as well as tested outbred mice lack expression of Ly49H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Scalzo1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Brown1">[14]</xref>. Using plaque forming assays, presence of replicating MCMV was analyzed in several organs including the spleen, lung, liver and SG over more than one year. In the absence of CD4 T cells, increased viral titers and prolonged detection of replicating virus was observed for all organs examined. However, with the striking exception of the SG, infectious virus was eventually controlled in spleen, liver and lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In the SG infectious MCMV was still detectable in MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> mice, even more than one year post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, in CD4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, MCMV replication in the SG was eventually controlled between 200 to 400 days post infection.</p>

        <p>CD4 T cells can control pathogens by several means, a prominent function being provision of help to either CD8 T cells or B cells which then control pathogen replication via cytotoxicity or production of antibodies. To test if CD4 T cells control MCMV by exerting helper mechanisms, we analyzed virus titers of MCMV infected CD8 T cell (CD8<sup>-/-</sup>) and B cell deficient mice (JHT mice). SG virus titers in both of these mouse strains were comparable to wild type animals at four (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>) and eight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>) weeks post infection; at both time points, however, viral titers were markedly increased in MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results are consistent with previous reports of efficient viral control in the absence of CD8 T cells and B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Polic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic3">[12]</xref>. It is possible, however, that MCMV-specific CD8 T cell responses were impaired in the SG of CD4 T deficient animals, leading to impaired viral control. This would be a plausible explanation for the requirement of CD4 T cells to control MCMV replication in the SG which has not been addressed so far. To exclude a role of T cell help for CD8 T cells in the SG, we analyzed CD8 T cell responses in CD4 T cell deficient and control B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g001">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). SG-resident lymphocytes were isolated and CD8 T cells specific for the epitopes M45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g001">Fig. 1B, D</xref>) and M38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g001">Fig. 1C, E</xref>) were quantified by tetramer staining. M45-specific CD8 T cell responses in mice lacking CD4 T cells were largely comparable to wild type mice and M38-specific CD8 T cell responses were generally increased in MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> and CD4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating that MCMV-specific CD8 T cell responses in the SG were not impaired in absence of CD4 T cells up to 120 days post infection.</p>

        <title>CD4 T cells control MCMV replication by secretion of IFNγ</title>
        <p>Previous studies indicated that systemic administration of neutralizing antibodies specific for either IFNγ or TNFα could abolish CD4 T cell-mediated control of MCMV replication in adoptive transfer models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lucin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Pavic1">[7]</xref>. Further, in CMV-seropositive humans, direct cytolytic activity exerted by virus-specific CD4 T cells was proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Casazza1">[15]</xref>. Although IFNγ and TNFα are involved in the control mechanisms exerted by CD4 T cells, it remains unknown if CD4 T cells produce these cytokines themselves and which cell type these mediators act upon. To identify the effector molecules produced directly by CD4 T cells to control SG MCMV replication, we generated the following mixed bone marrow chimeras: CD4<sup>-/-</sup> recipients were γ-irradiated and reconstituted with 50% bone marrow of CD4<sup>-/-</sup> and 50% bone marrow of either IFNγ deficient (IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup>), TNFα-deficient (TNFα<sup>-/-</sup>), perforin-deficient (PKOB), CD4<sup>-/-</sup> or B6 mice. By doing so, CD4 T cells present in the reconstituted animals were the only cell subset being entirely deficient for either IFNγ (IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup>xCD4<sup>-/-</sup>), TNFα (TNFα<sup>-/-</sup>xCD4<sup>-/-</sup>) or perforin (PKOBxCD4<sup>-/-</sup>). Control animals lacked CD4 T cells completely (CD4<sup>-/-</sup>xCD4<sup>-/-</sup>) or CD4 T cells were fully functional (B6xCD4<sup>-/-</sup>). At the time point of infection, frequencies of CD4 T cells were comparable in all experimental groups harboring CD4 T cells (data not shown). The chimeric mice were infected with a recombinant MCMV expressing the firefly luciferase under the control of the <italic>m157</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Klenovsek1">[16]</xref>. In these animals active viral replication is detectable by <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging after intraperitoneal administration of D-luciferin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, two to four months post infection MCMV titers were determined in the SG by plaque assay. Percentages of non-controllers (viral titer above detection limit) and the viral titers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g002">Fig. 2B and C</xref>. Viral control was impaired in (CD4<sup>-/-</sup>xCD4<sup>-/-</sup>) compared to (B6xCD4<sup>-/-</sup>) chimeras, corroborating our results in non-chimeric mice. While a comparable lack of MCMV control was observed in mice in which CD4 T cells were deficient for IFNγ production or in which CD4 T cells were completely absent, MCMV replication was similarly controlled in the SG of chimeric mice in which CD4 T cells lacked TNFα or perforin and in mice with fully functional CD4 T cells. To exclude impaired CD4 T cell priming in any of the experimental groups, frequencies of lung-derived MCMV-specific CD4 T cells secreting IFNγ or TNFα were analyzed and were comparable in all CD4-sufficient animals (data not shown). These data strongly support the notion that CD4 T cells directly control MCMV replication in the SG by secretion of IFNγ.</p>

        <p>Next, we addressed the question whether IFNγ secreted by CD4 T cells inhibited viral replication in the SG by signaling via IFNγ receptors (IFNγR) expressed on non-hematopoietic cells (including infected AGECs) or by triggering IFNγR signaling on hematopoietic cells, thereby stimulating other immune cells such as NK cells to control viral replication. Using either IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup> or wild type mice as recipients or donors, bone marrow chimeras were generated that either lacked IFNγR completely (IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup> → IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup>), that lacked IFNγR on radio-resistant cells (B6 → IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup>), that lacked IFNγR on radio-sensitive cells (IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup> → B6) or that expressed IFNγR on all cells (B6 → B6). 8 weeks post MCMV infection, viral titers increased in the SG when IFNγR was completely absent compared to wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Importantly, increased lytic viral replication was only observed in mice which either completely lacked IFNγR expression or selectively on non-hematopoietic cells. In contrast, mice that lacked IFNγR only on hematopoietic cells controlled MCMV replication. 8 weeks post infection, MCMV-specific CD4 T cell responses were comparable between experimental groups (data not shown). Hence, IFNγ secreted by CD4 T cells signaled on radio-resistant cells to suppress viral replication.</p>

        <p>CD4 T cells were shown to be necessary for the development of fully functional CD8 T cells in a variety of infection models (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Wiesel1">[19]</xref>).

However, in the SG, IFNγ-producing CD8 T cells specific for either the M45 or the M38 epitope were increased rather than decreased in the absence of CD4 T cells at various time points post MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Even IE3-specific CD8 T cell responses, which have previously been shown in the blood and spleen to largely depend on presence of CD4 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Walton2">[22]</xref>, were detected to almost comparable levels in the SG in presence or absence of CD4 T cells. These data clearly argue against a role for CD4 T cells to support CD8 T cell function in the SG at the investigated time points.</p>

        <title>CD8 T cells as well as NK cells infiltrate the SG and migrate to infected cells in the absence of CD4 T cells</title>
        <p>Although MCMV-specific CD8 T cells and NK cells were detectable in the SG tissue by flow cytometric analysis, their migration to close proximity of infected cells might be less efficient in comparison to MCMV-specific CD4 T cells. To determine the homing and tissue distribution of CD8 T cells and NK cells in relation to MCMV-infected cells, we performed confocal immunofluorescence analyses on tissue sections of the SG. B6 and MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> mice were infected with a GFP-expressing <italic>m157</italic>-deficient MCMV mutant. Three weeks later SG sections were stained for CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, B cells and CD11b as well as CD11c expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). As shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Cavanaugh1">[23]</xref>, AGECs were the main cells of the SG that were infected with MCMV at this time point and displayed cell enlargement typical for MCMV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Scattered throughout the SG tissue, dense foci of leukocyte infiltrates were detectable comprising not only CD4 and CD8 T cells but also CD11c and CD11b expressing as well as NK and B cells. However, these dense foci of leukocytes most often did not contain GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s003">Fig. S3</xref>; right columns). We propose that these infiltrates had previously surrounded a GFP-positive MCMV-infected cell that had been eliminated and is hence no longer detectable via GFP expression. GFP-expressing (hence MCMV infected) AGECs were either located distal, proximal or in very rare occasions within leukocyte infiltrates. Only few immune cells were in close proximity to infected cells when situated distal to infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g004">Figs. 4A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s003">Fig. S3</xref>; left columns). Interestingly, in some infiltrates, cells displaying a lower GFP fluorescence intensity were detected which exhibited a much smaller cell size than GFP-expressing AGECs. Furthermore, their morphology was comparable to the surrounding cells of the infiltrate, suggesting that these cells were not directly infected cells but might rather be phagocytic cells which had taken up remnants of MCMV infected cells including GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g004">Fig.4</xref>, middle column).</p>

        <p>We hypothesized that CD8 T cells, in contrast to CD4 T cells, are unable to control viral replication in the SG because they are not exposed to their cognate antigen in this particular organ.

To test this hypothesis, sections of SG were stained for MHC class I and II expression three weeks post MCMV-GFP infection and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Neither MHC class I nor MHC class II molecules were detectable on directly infected GFP-positive cells when distal to cell infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g005">Fig. 5A and D</xref>). However, once proximate to leukocyte infiltrates, very few infected cells expressed very low levels of MHC class I and class II on their cell surface, but to a much lower extent than on the close-by leukocyte infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g005">Fig. 5B and E</xref>). Overall, 86% of all GFP-infected cells had no detectable surface expression of MHC class I and only 14% expressed MHC class I at very low levels. Comparably, only 14% of GFP-expressing cells in the SG were slightly positive for MHC class II on their cell surface. Low or absent MHC expression on directly infected cells stands in line with published data showing that MCMV very potently inhibits antigen presentation via down-regulation of MHC molecules <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Redpath1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Heise1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Mathys1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Doom1">[29]</xref>.

MHC class II expression was completely absent in uninfected AGECs (data not shown).

        <title>SG resident APCs are deficient in cross-presentation</title>
        <p>Although directly infected cells of the SG lacked MHC class I and II expression, other cells present in close proximity expressed high levels of both these molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). It is likely that these non-infected bystander APCs are presenting MCMV-derived antigens to MCMV-specific T cells. As these bystander cells were clearly not directly infected since they lacked GFP expression, these cells would have to present MCMV antigens from an exogenous source. It is conceivable that MHC class II-restricted MCMV epitopes might be presented on these APCs much more efficiently than MHC class I-restricted epitopes. In the spleen, cross-presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules is largely restricted to a distinct dendritic cell (DC) subset, identified by CD11c, MHCII, CD8α, DEC205 expression and concomitant absence of B220 and CD4 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Hildner1">[30]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To formally assess the capacity of SG-resident APCs to process and present exogenous antigen on MHC class I or class II molecules, we isolated SG-resident APCs and splenic DCs. APCs were left untreated or were pulsed with virus like particles (VLPs) linked either to the LCMV-derived MHC class I-restricted epitope gp33 or the MHC class II-restricted gp61 epitope. As controls, APCs were pulsed directly with the respective peptides. We used VLPs to assess cross-presentation capacities of splenic DCs and SG-derived APCs as they represent a well-characterized particulate antigen which has been previously shown to depend on cross-presentation for MHC class I antigen loading using splenic DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Ruedl1">[33]</xref>. Identical numbers of spleen- or SG-derived APCs were then added to naïve CFSE-labeled TCR transgenic CD8 T cells recognizing the gp33 epitope (P14 cells) or TCR transgenic CD4 T cells specific for the gp61 epitope (Smarta cells). P14 cells recognized their antigen on splenic DCs either pulsed with VLP-gp33 or their cognate peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, salivary gland-derived APCs were not able to cross-present the cognate peptide to P14 T cells when pulsed with VLP-gp33. SG-derived APCs were not per se unable to stimulate CD8 T cells as they were able to do so when pulsed with the gp33 peptide. In contrast, Smarta cells proliferated extensively when incubated with either SG-derived APCs or splenic DCs pulsed with VLP-gp61. These results demonstrate, on a functional level, that SG-resident APCs are not able to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8 T cells. As we could never detect GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells in any of the SG sections analyzed, we conclude that they are not directly infected by MCMV and hence do not present endogenous MCMV-derived antigens on MHC class I molecules. However, in line with the notion that SG-resident APCs are responsible for MCMV antigen presentation, we were able to detect in some rare cases CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC class I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>) or MHC class II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s005">Fig, S5B</xref>) expressing cells with focal GFP inclusions which most likely represent APCs which had phagocytosed remnants of infected AGECs. Based on our functional <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we propose that these might be the very cells being responsible for local MCMV-derived antigen presentation to CD4 T cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we unravel the underlying mechanisms of the unique requirement for CD4 T cells to control MCMV replication in the SG. We show that CD4 T cells control MCMV replication in the SG by exerting direct antiviral effector functions via IFNγ secretion and not by providing helper functions to CD8 T cells or B cells. While robust CD8 T cell responses were detected in presence or absence of CD4 T cells in the SG, they were unable to control MCMV replication due to the exquisite efficiency of MCMV to downregulate MHC class I expression on infected AGECs. In absence of MCMV-encoded MHC class I immune evasion genes, CD8 T cells gained ability to control SG MCMV infection also in absence of CD4 T cells.</p>
      <p>However, in the absence of antiviral active CD4 T cells, B cells and antibodies can contribute to control viral replication in the SG on the long term, as infectious virus was eventually cleared in CD4<sup>-/-</sup> mice in all organs examined as opposed to MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> mice. One major difference between MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> and CD4<sup>-/-</sup> mice is that the latter strain is able to mount isotype-switched antibody responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Pearce1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Tyznik1">[36]</xref>. MCMV-binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies were indeed detectable in MCMV-infected CD4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but were completely absent in MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s006">Fig. S6</xref> and ). As MCMV-specific antibodies were previously shown to inhibit viral dissemination during MCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Jonjic3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Wirtz1">[37]</xref>, they are likely to be responsible for late differences in MCMV control observed between MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> and CD4<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
      <p><italic>In vitro</italic>, IFNγ and TNFα can exert strong and synergistic inhibition of MCMV replication in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lucin2">[38]</xref>. Systemic <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization of IFNγ and TNFα in CD8 T cell depleted MCMV infected BALB/c mice or in MCMV-infected lethally irradiated mice transferred with MCMV-primed splenocytes resulted in decreased MCMV control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lucin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Pavic1">[7]</xref>. Thus, CD4 T cells were suggested to act via secretion of IFNγ and TNFα to limit viral replication in the SG. However, in these studies, unlike ours, there was no formal proof that CD4 T cells themselves and no other cells secrete those cytokines. We were able to show for the first time that CD4 T cells exert direct antiviral mechanisms by producing IFNγ and to a much lower extent - if at all - via TNFα production or perforin-mediated effector mechanisms. At this point we cannot formally exclude that CD4 T cells might interact with other cells which then produce TNFα, thereby leading to control of viral replication in the SG. However, our observation that lytic MCMV replication is not controlled in chimeric mice which specifically lack IFNγR expression on non-hematopoietic cells would rather argue against a pivotal role of additional effectors including TNFα.</p>
      <p>It was proposed that NK-like cells might synergize with CD4 T cells to control viral replication in the SG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Campbell1">[4]</xref>, due to the fact that mice depleted of NK cells by anti-NK1.1 or anti-asialoGM1 antibodies showed increased viral titers in the SG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Polic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Bukowski1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Orange1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Orange2">[41]</xref>. Our data does not exclude a synergism between CD4 T and NK cells, we can only conclude that a potential NK-CD4 T cell interaction is unlikely to be mediated via IFNγ. Further, the NK cell compartment in the SG was not affected by the absence of CD4 T cells: NK cells were present in the SG of CD4 T cell deficient animals, absolute numbers were comparable to wild type mice and we were unable to detect any differences in NK cell function between MHCII<sup>-/-</sup> and B6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s007">Fig. S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002214.s008">Text S1</xref>). Furthermore, SG-resident NK cells were recently shown to have functional deficits and peripheral NK cells appear to be poorly recruited to the SG during MCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Tessmer1">[42]</xref>. Finally, in contrast to many reports demonstrating a role for NK cells in limiting early MCMV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Polic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Bukowski1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Orange1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Orange2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Babic1">[43]</xref>, a recent study showed a negative impact of NK cells on MCMV control due to curtailed MCMV-specific T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Andrews1">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Why then is IFNγ secreted by CD4 T cells so crucial to control MCMV in the SG whereas IFNγ production by other immune cells such as CD8 T cell or NK cells is insufficient? Different reasons could account for this: a) other immune cells might not produce IFNγ in the SG; b) CD4 T cells but no other IFNγ-producing cells migrate into close proximity of infected cells; c) CD4 T cells might enable other immune cells to migrate to infected cells; d) CD4 T cells, in contrast to CD8 T cells, might recognize directly infected cells; e) antigens might not be presented directly on infected cells but on bystander APCs that are unable to cross-present and hence to activate CD8 T cells.</p>
      <p>We show here evidence for the last scenario as both MCMV-specific CD8 as well as CD4 T cells from the SG were able to secrete IFNγ, total numbers of IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells exceeded by far total numbers of IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells were localized at the same sites as CD4 T cells in the SG, the cellular composition of the infiltrates were not changed in absence of CD4 T cells, most directly infected cells in the SG were MHC negative and SG-resident APCs were capable of processing and presenting particulate antigen on MHC class II but not MHC class I molecules. Importantly, we have no evidence for direct infection of SG APCs, at least at the time points analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, we found some MHC class I and II positive CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells within densely populated leukocyte infiltrates in the SG which displayed discrete inclusion of cargo derived from MCMV-infected cells, suggestive of phagocytes which had taken up remnants of MCMV-infected AGECs.</p>
      <p>Our observations that we only rarely detected MHC class I and II molecules on directly infected AGECs stands in line with findings that MCMV down-regulates very efficiently MHC molecules, albeit this has mostly been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> for infected fibroblasts, macrophages and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Redpath1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Heise1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Mathys1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Doom1">[29]</xref>. In fact our study demonstrates for the first time that MCMV can indeed suppress surface expression of MHC complexes on AGECs <italic>in vivo</italic> as well. MCMV expresses several gene products, so called immune-evasins, that impair antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Doom1">[29]</xref>). Interestingly, genetic deletion of these immune-evasins resulted in increased MCMV immune control specifically in the SG in a CD8 T cell dependent manner in BALB/c mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002214-Lu1">[25]</xref>, suggesting that MCMV expressed immune-evasins are particularly potent in AGECs compared to cells of other tissues. We corroborated and extended this observation by showing that CD4 T cells were dispensable for MCMV control in the SG in the absence of the virus-encoded <italic>m04</italic>, <italic>m06</italic> and <italic>m152</italic> immune-evasins. Up to date we were not able to study MHC class I expression on AGECs infected with <italic>Δm04Δm06Δm152</italic> MCMV as the mutant strain currently available does not express GFP. In future experiments we will generate a GFP expressing <italic>Δm04Δm06Δm152</italic> MCMV strain to address this open question.</p>
      <p>In summary, the results of our study strongly support a model in which virus-specific CD4 T cells but not CD8 T cells control viral replication in the SG, thereby eventually curtailing horizontal transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002214-g008">Fig. 8</xref>): In infected AGECs MCMV immune-evasins inhibit trafficking of MHC class I molecules to the cell surface and shut down the induction of MHC class II expression. MCMV antigens released by the infected cells or remnants of infected cells are taken up by local APCs which are unable to cross-present particulate antigens but able to process and present on MHC class II, thereby selectively inducing MCMV-specific CD4 T cells to secrete IFNγ. IFNγ binds to its receptors present on infected cells or / and on adjacent cells and exerts its antiviral function by interfering with viral replication or rendering cells resistant for subsequent MCMV infection.</p>

          <title>Virus-specific CD4 but not CD8 T cells control MCMV replication in the salivary gland.</title>
          <p>Surface expression of MHC class I and II is effectively suppressed in infected acinar glandular epithelial cells (AGECs), thereby inhibiting direct recognition by MCMV-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. Phagocytic APCs situated in close proximity to virus-infected cells take up MCMV antigens, either in from of defective viral particles or apoptotic bodies of infected cells, and present MCMV-derived peptide antigens on MHC class II molecules to CD4 T cells but not to CD8 T cells due to their inability to cross-present particulate antigens. Activated MCMV-specific CD4 T cells secrete IFNγ which consequently binds to its receptor on the cell surface of the infected cell as well as on adjacent AGECs. Activation of IFNγR signaling cascade on adjacent cells induces an antiviral state, rendering them resistant to MCMV replication and IFNγ signaling in infected cells leads to the termination of MCMV replication.</p>
