        <p>Alteration of early haematopoietic development is thought to be responsible for the onset of immature leukemias and lymphomas. We have previously demonstrated that Tax<sub>HTLV-1</sub> interferes with ß-selection, an important checkpoint of early thymopoiesis, indicating that human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection has the potential to perturb thymic human αβ T-cell development. To verify that inference and to clarify the impact of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development, we investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of HTLV-1 infection in a “Human Immune System” (HIS) Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mouse model. These mice were infected with HTLV-1, at a time when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes have been detected. In all but two inoculated mice, the HTLV-1 provirus was found integrated in thymocytes; the proviral load increased with the length of the infection period. In the HTLV-1-infected mice we observed alterations in human T-cell development, the extent of which correlated with the proviral load. Thus, in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γc<sup>-/-</sup> mice, mature single-positive (SP) CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were most numerous, at the expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These SP cells also accumulated in the spleen. Human lymphocytes from thymus and spleen were activated, as shown by the expression of CD25: this activation was correlated with the presence of <italic>tax</italic> mRNA and with increased expression of NF-kB dependent genes such as <italic>bfl-1</italic>, an anti-apoptotic gene, in thymocytes. Finally, hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma/thymoma, in which Tax was detected, were observed in HTLV-1-infected mice, several months after HTLV-1 infection. These results demonstrate the potential of the HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> animal model to elucidate the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus responsible for the development of Adult T cell Leukemia, an aggressive malignant lymphoproliferation that occurs several decades after viral exposure in some individuals infected when neonates <italic>via</italic> breastfeeding. Here, we used mice that were humanized by transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells isolated from cord blood. Such an animal model may reproduce key aspects of <italic>in vivo</italic> infection with HTLV-1 and improve the understanding of the early steps of the leukemogenic process. These humanized mice when inoculated with HTLV-1 were indeed productively infected, as shown by the detection and the expression of the provirus in human cells. We observed that T-cell development in the thymus of these mice was profoundly altered, as ascertained by the increased proliferation of activated mature T lymphocytes that accumulated in the thymus as well as in the spleen. These alterations of human thymic T-cell development may be linked to the development of ATL–like pathologies. These results show that this humanized mouse model provides an invaluable tool not only to study the early stages of the infection leading to the development of malignant lymphoproliferations, but also to design new therapeutic approaches.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>HTLV-1 (Human T cell Leukaemia Virus, type 1), the only retrovirus associated with a neoplastic disease in humans, is the etiologic agent of Adult T-cell Leukaemia (ATL), an aggressive clonal lymphoproliferative disorder of mature CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Yoshida1">[1]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Matsuoka1">[3]</xref>. It is considered that HTLV-1 infection early in life predisposes to ATL. Indeed, epidemiological studies have stressed that ATL develops after an extremely long (several decades) latency period, often in patients who were infected as neonates through breastfeeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Nakano1">[4]</xref>. T-cell leukemias such as T-ALL (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) which mainly occur in children and adolescents, are thought to result from malignant thymocytes arising at defined stages of intrathymic T-cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Aifantis1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Vacca1">[6]</xref>. Thus, HTLV-1 infection within the thymus might be an essential event in the pathogenesis of ATL. <italic>In vitro</italic>, HTLV-1 can productively infect human hematopoietic CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells as well as human immature thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Feuer1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-MaguerSatta1">[9]</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that reconstitution of T lymphopoiesis with HTLV-1-infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice engrafted with human thymus and liver tissues resulted in the alteration of thymopoiesis, as shown by abnormalities in the size of thymocyte subpopulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Feuer1">[7]</xref>. Recently, Banerjee <italic>et al.</italic> have generated a humanized model, which partially recapitulates HTLV-1-induced T-cell leukemogenesis by inoculating immunodeficient mice with human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells infected <italic>ex vivo</italic> with HTLV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Banerjee1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>HTLV-1 is a complex retrovirus that relies upon multiple gene products to accomplish replication and disease. Among them, Tax and HBZ are key regulatory proteins. HBZ, encoded by the antisense strand of the HTLV-1 proviral DNA, is permanently expressed and required for efficient viral infectivity and persistence, whereas Tax has been shown to deregulate a number of cellular genes leading to cellular proliferation, to induce genetic instability, thus contributing to malignant progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Matsuoka1">[3]</xref>. Studies on Tax-transgenic mice that express <italic>tax</italic> under the control of either the HTLV-1 LTR or alternative promoters that target Tax expression to lymphocytes have demonstrated that Tax can perturb lymphocyte functions. The development of tumors in most of these transgenic mouse models also provided evidence of the leukemogenic potential of Tax. Interestingly, when the transgene expression was placed under the control of the Lck promoter, which restricts Tax expression to developing thymocytes, an ATL-like phenotype developed in the transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Hasegawa1">[11]</xref>. These observations suggest that the leukemogenic activity of Tax is related to T-cell development in the thymus. We have previously reported that Tax, by silencing E2A transcription factors, down-regulates the expression of the pTα gene thus perturbing β-selection, the early and critical checkpoint of human T-cell development in the thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Wencker1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Wencker2">[13]</xref>. These <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that HTLV-1 infection in the thymus might be a prerequisite for the malignant lymphoproliferation associated with this retroviral infection.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we first investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development in “Human Immune System” (HIS) mice by transplanting human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood cells into conditioned newborn BALB/c Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> recipient mice. The resulting HIS mice were infected with HTLV-1, at a time when the successive stages of the αβT-cell development are evident in the thymus of these mice. In the HTLV-1-infected Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we observed efficient viral expression and profound alterations in human thymopoiesis, as shown by the accumulation of activated mature single-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in the thymus and in the spleen. The role of Tax in that process is indicated by an increased expression of NF-κB-dependent genes such as CD25 and Bfl-1 in thymocytes of these mice. In addition, abnormalities frequently observed in ATL such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma were detected in HTLV-1-infected mice, several months after HTLV-1 infection. This HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> animal model might be of great interest to decipher the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1.</p>

Eight weeks after transplantation, the population of mature thymocytes predominated over that of immature thymocytes, indicating that human αβT-cell development was completed in the thymus of transplanted HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). At that time, approximately 90% of the cells present in the thymus of the HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice expressed hu-CD45<sup>+</sup>. Circulating human mature T cells were also detected in the blood and secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, mature T cells represented about 17% of the hu-CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen, 10 weeks after CD34<sup>+</sup> transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These observations are in line with those previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Traggiai1">[16]</xref> and confirm that the successive maturational steps of human αβT-cell development were completed in the thymus of these mice within two months following human CD34<sup>+</sup> inoculation.</p>

        <p>Autopsy examination between 10 and 35 weeks after HTLV-1 inoculation revealed a significant increase of the size of the thymus, the spleen and lymph nodes of HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice inoculated with MT2 cells, when compared to those of mock-infected animals. Furthermore tumor-like nodules were frequently observed in the spleen and the liver of MT2-inoculated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To ascertain that the MT2-inoculated HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice were indeed infected, we used ALU-PCR to amplify <italic>gag</italic><sub>HTLV-1</sub> sequences from human DNA isolated from splenocytes.

        <p>The HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice was then evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). An increase in the PVL was observed, which correlated with the length of the infection period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, a PVL value in the range of 10 to 10<sup>3</sup> copies per 10<sup>5</sup> human cells was found in 20 mice that were sacrificed between 5 and 20 weeks after inoculation of MT2 cells. These mice were subsequently referred to as low-PVL mice. Fifteen mice that were sacrificed between 16 and 35 weeks had a PVL between 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> copies per 10<sup>5</sup> cells; these were referred to as high-PVL mice. The low PVL values (median 8.9×10<sup>2</sup> copies/10<sup>5</sup> cells) were similar to those in healthy human HTLV-1 carriers, whereas the high PVL values (median 1.1×10<sup>5</sup> copies/10<sup>5</sup> cells) were similar to those in ATL cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Saito1">[19]</xref>.

        <title>The αβT-cell development in HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice is altered in a PVL-dependent manner</title>
        <p>To investigate the effect of HTLV-1 infection on αβT cell development in HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we proceeded to a comparative FACS analysis of thymopoiesis in infected or in mock-infected mice. In the latter, at either 8 to 20 weeks (early) or 18 to 35 weeks (late) after PBS injection, the relative frequency of the three main human subpopulations (immature, DP and SP) remained mostly unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In the low-PVL HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the respective percentages of these subpopulations were slightly different with a higher frequency of DP cells and a lower frequency of SP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, in the high-PVL mice, a significant depletion of the immature DN subpopulation was observed together with a strong decrease of DP thymocytes and with a large increase of the mature SP cells. Such alterations were evident in mice as young as 18 weeks, <italic>i.e.</italic> 13 weeks after inoculation with MT2 cells. These data show that the main impact of HTLV-1 infection was on the population of the most immature T cells, as indicated by their significant decrease in mice with the highest PVL. In the spleen of infected mice, the population of mature T cells increased with the PVL level to the point where mature T cells were the only human population observed in that organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

        <p>These observations suggested a positive correlation between the PVL and the alterations of human T cell development observed in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup>mice. To verify this suggestion, we analysed CD4 and CD8 expression on thymocytes of either the less mature CD3<sup>-</sup> or the more mature CD3<sup>+</sup> subpopulations of four age-matched mice including one mock-infected mouse and three HTLV-1-infected mice, one with a low PVL and two with high PVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We observed a significant decrease in the CD3<sup>-</sup> subset, which correlated with the increase in PVL. In fact, the immature DN, CD4ISP and DP subpopulations were severely depleted in the mouse with the highest PVL (left panel), whereas the CD3<sup>+</sup> SP cells increased to 78.3% in the same mouse (right panel). The thymocyte subpopulations in three mice with a comparable high PVL, but killed at different times after infection (20, 23 and 35 weeks) displayed a similar profile, <italic>i.e.</italic> depletion of CD3<sup>-</sup> immature and DP cells and increase of CD3<sup>+</sup> mature SP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These results show that HTLV-1 infection led to an increased number of mature T cells in the thymus and in the periphery. We conclude that HTLV-1 infection perturbed the development of αβT lymphocytes in the thymus of HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, mainly by propelling immature thymocytes towards the late stages of maturation. We now propose to investigate whether such an effect is induced by the viral regulatory Tax.</p>

We hypothesized that Tax might compensate for the absence of a functional pre-TCR by inducing NF-κB activation in immature thymocytes. We therefore investigated the impact of Tax overexpression on the transcription of NF-κB-related genes (RelA/p65, p105/p50, c-Rel) in immature thymocytes. We observed that the amount of the respective transcripts was much greater in TaxGFP-expressing immature thymocytes than in GFP<sup>+</sup> control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We also analysed isolated mRNAs to detect transcripts of the anti-apoptotic genes <italic>Bfl-1</italic> and <italic>Bcl-2</italic>, because <italic>Bfl-1</italic> is a target of NF-κB transcriptional activity whereas Bcl-2 is independent of NF-κB.

        <p>We therefore investigated whether the NF-κB dependent expression of these two genes, <italic>bcl2</italic> and <italic>bfl1</italic>, was increased in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice. RT-qPCR analysis showed a clear increase in the transcription of <italic>Bfl-1</italic> in these mice, when compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g006">Figure 6C</xref>); this increase was comparable to that found in Tax-expressing thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The increase in <italic>Bfl-1</italic> mRNA correlated with that of <italic>tax</italic> mRNA, as did CD25 mRNA, which is also dependent on NF-κB factors. Indeed, a comparative FACS analysis of mock-infected and HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice indicated that the number of hu-CD45<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> cells in the thymus and in the spleen cells was significantly higher in high PVL mice than in low PVL or in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g007">Figure 7A, B, C</xref>). Lastly, activated T lymphocytes, which were mainly CD4<sup>+</sup>, were also found in the peripheral blood of an HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002231-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). This finding demonstrates that HTLV-1 infection induced expansion of mature T-cells in the periphery. We conclude that Tax activates the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation in the thymus of HTLV-1–infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice and favours the expansion of mature activated T cells. Thus, the presence of T-cell proliferation in HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice indicates that HTLV-1 infection of the thymus might be a critical pre-leukemogenic event.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>During the last decade, humanized mouse technology has made remarkably rapid progress, allowing the establishment of high levels of human chimerism in various host organ/tissues, particularly the immune system, liver and muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Chicha1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Manz1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Huntington1">[23]</xref>. These humanized mice appear ideally suited for direct investigation of human infectious agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Manz2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Legrand1">[25]</xref>. In the present study, we have used Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which recapitulate the main events in the development of the human lymphoid compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Hiramatsu1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Legrand3">[28]</xref>. These mice have already displayed interesting potential for studying infection with lymphotropic viruses, such as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Cocco1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Banerjee2">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we used HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice inoculated with irradiated HTLV-1-producing cells, at a time when the human lymphoid compartment has been established, <italic>i.e.</italic> within a period of 1 to 2 months after transplanting BALB/c Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> immunodeficient animals with human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood cells. This infection protocol was found to be very efficient, as in most of the inoculated HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice the provirus was found integrated in the genome of human cells. These mice were analyzed at regular intervals within a 7-month period after inoculation. We observe a sequential increase of the proviral load, which correlated with the appearance of critical alterations in the distribution of T-cell subsets in the chimeric thymus. Specifically, we observed slight differences in the respective percentages of the three main thymocyte subsets (immature, DP and SP) between HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice with a low proviral load and mock-infected animals. Conversely, in mice with a high proviral load, the SP cells predominated at the expense of the immature and DP populations. These data provide strong evidence that <italic>in vivo</italic> HTLV-1 infection of HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice perturbs human T-cell development in the thymus at the level of immature cells, by propelling development towards the mature stages. In addition, the infected mice had a high proviral load in the same range as that found in ATL patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Saito1">[19]</xref>. These findings demonstrate that HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with HTLV-1 provide a suitable model for viral-induced malignancy. They further suggest that the combination of immature target cells in the thymus and the immunodeficient environment of HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice favours the rapid development of a T-cell malignancy.</p>
      <p>This model will also be helpful for studying the involvement of other HTLV-1 genes like <italic>hbz</italic> in viral pathogenesis as well as the role of the proviral integration sites. Thus, an oligoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells was observed in the periphery of five infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice. In contrast, preliminary results obtained from one HTLV-1 infected mouse displaying a thymoma indicate an extraordinary degree of polyclonality of integration sites in the thymus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002231.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Interestingly, the three clones that dominated the population in both spleen and lymph nodes were not dominant in the thymus, and the three most abundant clones observed in the thymus were not detected in the periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002231.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, B, C).</p>
      <p>Our observations are consistent with those reported by Banerjee <italic>et al.</italic> who used a different infection strategy as well as different immunodeficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Banerjee1">[10]</xref>. Indeed, these authors generated HTLV-1-infected humanized nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (HU-NOD/SCID) mice by inoculating 4- to- 6-week NOD/SCID mice with human fetal liver-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infected <italic>ex vivo</italic> with HTLV-1. Less than half of these infected mice developed T-cell lymphomas with a CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>low</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>low</sup> phenotype. These mice also showed greater proliferation of infected human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in the bone marrow, leading the authors to propose that HTLV-1 can transform CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. However, HTLV-1 proviral sequences were not detected in CD34<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells from ATL patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Nagafuji1">[35]</xref>. Banerjee <italic>et al.</italic> also reported that HTLV-1 infection skewed T-cell development in the thymus of these HTLV-1-infected HU-NOD/SCID mice, as well as in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HU-NSG (NOD/SCID IL-2γ chain<sup>null</sup>) mice. These data support our present observations which suggest that alterations of T-cell development play a prominent role in the initiation of HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis.</p>
      <p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that the viral Tax regulatory protein can inactivate the activity of bHLH E2A transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Wencker1">[12]</xref>. This inhibitory effect leads to a decrease of the transcription of the pTα gene in immature thymocytes, thus precluding the assembly of the pre-TCR and interfering with the β-selection checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Wencker2">[13]</xref>. The pre-TCR plays a crucial role in T-cell development, by allowing the maturation of thymocytes with a functional β chain. Signalling from the pre-TCR in the β-selected cells leads to the activation of NF-κB, which provides survival and proliferative advantages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Blom1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Spits1">[36]</xref>. We hypothesize that Tax, which is able to activate the NF-κB pathways, compensates for the absence of the pre-TCR in HTLV-1-infected immature thymocytes. Thus, Tax-activated NF-κB would prevent apoptosis and drive proliferation. We indeed observed that activated transcription of the NF-κB pathways in <italic>ex vivo</italic> Tax-expressing immature thymocytes correlated with increased transcription of <italic>Bfl1</italic>, an anti-apoptotic NF-κB-responsive gene. Likewise, we found increased transcription of Bfl-1 in thymocytes of infected mice. We also observed an expansion of mature SP cells in the thymus and in the spleen of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup>, and an increase in the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Finally, pathological features observed in some of these mice might be related to the disturbances of the αβT-cell development induced by HTLV-1 infection.</p>
      <p>We conclude that HTLV-1 infection can override the pre-TCR checkpoint by forcing immature thymocytes to progress towards a more differentiated phenotype (acquisition of CD4 and CD8) in the absence of the pre-TCR. The Tax protein may play a key part in this process. The observed disturbances of thymopoiesis caused by HTLV-1 infection may represent critical events in the initiation of the leukemogenic process associated with this retroviral infection. More specifically, they underline the relationships between dysregulated T-cell development and neoplastic transformation and provide another contribution to the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in leukaemogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Mandal1">[37]</xref>. Indeed, the constitutive expression of Tax in immature thymocytes at the level of the β-selection checkpoint alters the developmentally regulated interplay between pre-TCR signalling and E2A activities, resulting in leukemia/lymphoma promotion.</p>
      <p>HTLV-1-associated T-cell leukaemia strongly resembles the Notch3-induced T-cell malignancies in several respects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Campese1">[38]</xref>. Notch3, a member of the Notch family, is known to play a critical role in T-cell development and its constitutive activation has been related to T-cell leukaemia in both animal models and human diseases. The development of the T-cell leukaemogenic process requires the combined expression of Notch3 and the pre-TCR linked to a sustained down-regulation of E2A activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002231-Mandal1">[37]</xref>. It is noteworthy that in the absence of the pre-TCR, Notch3, like Tax, can force immature T-cells through otherwise pre-TCR-dependent developmental stages and favour the progression toward a more differentiated phenotype by acquisition of CD4 and CD8. In contrast with Notch3, Tax is able to activate both the alternative and canonical NF-κB pathways, implying that the appearance of lymphoid tumors in HTLV-1 infected is linked to the exclusive activity of Tax. However, even if Tax down-modulates the transcription of pTα, leukemogenesis may also require continued weak expression of the pre-TCR, which cooperates with pTa to reach a critical level of NF-κB activation. Future experiments should be performed to verify that hypothesis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BALB/c Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>γ<sub>c</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice transplanted with human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood cells provides an <italic>in vivo</italic> model to define the early steps of HTLV-1 infection that might lead to a better understanding of the initiation of the HTLV-1 associated leukemia. Our observations provide evidence that HTLV-1 infection in the thymus propels infected thymocytes toward the mature stages of T-cell development and favours the activation and the proliferation of these cells, thus providing a substrate population for further altered gene expression that would allow the emergence of a malignant clone.</p>
