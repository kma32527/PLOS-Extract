        <p>Competence stimulating peptide (CSP) is a 17-amino acid peptide pheromone secreted by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Upon binding of CSP to its membrane-associated receptor kinase ComD, a cascade of signaling events is initiated, leading to activation of the competence regulon by the response regulator ComE. Genes encoding proteins that are involved in DNA uptake and transformation, as well as virulence, are upregulated. Previous studies have shown that disruption of key components in the competence regulon inhibits DNA transformation and attenuates virulence. Thus, synthetic analogues that competitively inhibit CSPs may serve as attractive drugs to control pneumococcal infection and to reduce horizontal gene transfer during infection. We performed amino acid substitutions on conserved amino acid residues of CSP1 in an effort to disable DNA transformation and to attenuate the virulence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. One of the mutated peptides, CSP1-E1A, inhibited development of competence in DNA transformation by outcompeting CSP1 in time and concentration-dependent manners. CSP1-E1A reduced the expression of pneumococcal virulence factors choline binding protein D (CbpD) and autolysin A (LytA) <italic>in vitro</italic>, and significantly reduced mouse mortality after lung infection. Furthermore, CSP1-E1A attenuated the acquisition of an antibiotic resistance gene and a capsule gene <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we demonstrated that the strategy of using a peptide inhibitor is applicable to other CSP subtype, including CSP2. CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A were able to cross inhibit the induction of competence and DNA transformation in pneumococcal strains with incompatible ComD subtypes. These results demonstrate the applicability of generating competitive analogues of CSPs as drugs to control horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, and to attenuate virulence during infection by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a major cause of pneumonia, ear infection and meningitis. Antibiotic resistance among <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolates is increasingly a major clinical problem. The acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is controlled by a peptide pheromone called competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). CSP binds to a receptor called ComD, which in turn activates its cognate transcription factor ComE to initiate DNA uptake and integration into the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> genome. CSP-ComD/E also regulates the expression of virulence factors required for infection. In this study, multiple synthetic analogues of CSP pheromone were examined for their ability to inhibit acquisition of exogenous DNA, and to control infection by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in mice. Two of these analogues, CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A, competitively inhibit the ability of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to acquire the streptomycin resistance <italic>rpsL</italic> gene and the capsule gene <italic>cap3A</italic> during mouse models of acute pneumonia and bacteremia. CSP1-E1A also reduces mouse mortality during lung infection by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This is the first demonstration of the use of CSP analogues to attenuate virulence and to inhibit acquisition of an antibiotic resistance gene in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Because the CSP-ComD/E system is conserved among many pathogenic bacteria, CSP analogues may be applicable to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and to treat infections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is one of the most important pathogens that cause bacterial pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis and sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Weiser1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Kadioglu1">[3]</xref>. The incidence of antibiotic resistance in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has increased dramatically in the recent decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Coker1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Liares1">[6]</xref>. The acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is at least partly due to genetic transformation, which occurs when the bacteria enter the competent state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Morrison1">[9]</xref>. The binding of competence stimulating peptide (CSP) to its membrane-associated histidine kinase receptor ComD initiates competence in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Havarstein1">[10]</xref>. Upon interacting with CSP, ComD phosphorylates the cognate transcriptional regulator ComE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Pestova1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Martin1">[13]</xref>. ComE then initiates the transcription of a set of 24 genes (early genes), including <italic>comX</italic>. As an alternative sigma factor, ComX positively regulates the transcription of 81 genes (late genes) in the competence regulon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Peterson1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Luo1">[15]</xref>. Some of these late genes encode effectors for DNA uptake and recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Peterson1">[14]</xref>. DNA sequence analysis from 60 pneumococcal isolates predicts the existence of six distinct CSP subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Pozzi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Whatmore1">[17]</xref>. However, an overwhelming majority of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains produce two of these subtypes: CSP1 or CSP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Whatmore1">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, apart from CSP1 and CSP2, the ability of other CSP subtypes to induce DNA transformation has not been analyzed. There are two major corresponding variants of ComD, named ComD1 and ComD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Iannelli1">[18]</xref>. CSP1 and CSP2 share 50% amino acid identity. The major sequence variation between CSP1 and CSP2 occurs in the central region of these peptides, which confers receptor specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg2">[19]</xref>. In contrast, the first three amino acid residues of the N-terminus and the last two amino acid residues of the C-terminus are conserved between CSP1 and CSP2. Competence in pneumococcal strains with the ComD1 receptor could be induced more efficiently with the “compatible” CSP1. In contrast, ComD2 strains are more sensitive to induction by the “compatible” CSP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg2">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Competence for DNA transformation plays a crucial role in the ability of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to gain virulence and antibiotic resistance genes from other species. Importantly, in recent years, the competence regulon of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has been shown to cross regulate virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Claverys2">[24]</xref>. For example, Lau <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref> reported that a loss of function in ComB, an accessory protein to the ComA ABC transporter required for the export of CSP, as well as a loss of function in the ComD histidine kinase, attenuate the ability of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to cause pneumonia and bacteremia in mice. This report has been subsequently confirmed by other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Kowalko1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Guiral1">[23]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that competence-mediated cell lysis may mediate the release of pneumolysin, as well as the cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA), the former being an important virulence factor of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Guiral1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Claverys2">[24]</xref>. Microarray analysis has indicated that CSP induces the transcription of both virulence and stress responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Peterson1">[14]</xref>. These above-mentioned studies indicate that activation of the competence regulon is not only essential for DNA uptake and transformation, but also important for virulence. Therefore, the competence regulon represents an attractive drug target to combat both pneumococcal infections and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.</p>
      <p>In this study, we performed amino acid substitutions in CSP1 and CSP2, and examined the ability of these CSP variants to inhibit the development of competence, horizontal gene transfer, and virulence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice. One of these modified peptides, CSP1-E1A, was able to competitively inhibit the development of competence for DNA transformation and expression of virulence gene <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, CSP1-E1A was able to attenuate the virulence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> during lung infection in mice, as well as inhibiting the ability of pneumococcus to acquire both an antibiotic resistance gene and a capsule gene during mouse models of acute pneumonia and bacteremia infections. Significantly, we demonstrated that the same amino acid substitution on CSP2 (CSP2-E1A) also inhibits CSP2-mediated competence development. Moreover, both CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A were capable of cross inhibiting the induction of competence regulon mediated by incompatible receptors, ComD2 and ComD1, respectively.</p>

        <title>The first and the third amino acid residues on the N terminus of CSP1 are critical for the induction of competence</title>
        <p>Because amino acid residues in the central region of CSP1 are important for receptor specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg2">[19]</xref>, we hypothesized that conserved amino acid residues on both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of CSP1 are important for its ability to induce competence. By amino acid substitutions or deletions of the first three amino acid residues on the N-terminus and of the last two amino acids on the C-terminus, we synthesized five CSP1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The ability of these modified peptides to induce competence in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> wild-type strain D39 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t001">Table 1</xref>) grown in Todd Hewitt Broth (THB) was compared to that of CSP1 by: (i) monitoring the transformation frequency of a <italic>rpsL</italic> gene that confers resistance to streptomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Sung1">[25]</xref>, and (ii) monitoring the promoter activity of the competence specific sigma factor gene <italic>comX</italic>. Induction of ComX indicates that <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells have entered a competent state. The promoter activity of <italic>comX</italic> was monitored by assaying the ß-galactosidase activity in D39pcomX::lacZ, a D39 derivative with a <italic>lacZ</italic> gene fused behind the <italic>comX</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Sung2">[26]</xref>. Deletion or substitution of either of the two lysine (K) residues on the C-terminus (CSP1-K16DK17D, CSP1-ΔK16ΔK17) did not alter the ability of these peptides to induce competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g002">Fig. 2A–2B</xref>). In contrast, substitution of the first amino acid (glutamate to alanine) (CSP1-E1A) severely reduced the ability of this peptide to induce <italic>comX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and DNA transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). CSP1-E1A could only induce about 1% of <italic>comX</italic> promoter activity and &gt; 3 logs lower DNA transformation when compared to CSP1. Similarly, alanine substitution of the third residue of the N terminus (CSP1-R3A) impaired its ability to induce both <italic>comX</italic> and DNA transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g002">Fig. 2A–2B</xref>). In contrast, alanine substitution of the second amino acid residue on the N terminus (CSP1-M2A) did not alter its ability to induce both <italic>comX</italic> and DNA transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g002">Fig. 2A–2B</xref>).</p>

        <p>As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g002">Figure 2</xref>, two modified CSP peptides—CSP-E1A and CSP-R3A—are attenuated in their ability to induce the <italic>comX</italic> gene and the competence of DNA transformation. We examined the ability of these two peptides to competitively inhibit the induction of competence by CSP1. D39pcomX::lacZ cells were exposed to 100 ng of CSP1 alone or simultaneously to increasing amounts of CSP1-E1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) or CSP1-R3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In the absence of CSP1-E1A, CSP1 induced the promoter activity of <italic>comX</italic> gene to approximately 45 Miller units of b-galactosidase. However, in the presence of CSP1-E1A, the ability of CSP1 to induce <italic>comX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) was severely inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. CSP1-E1A by itself only induced low expression of <italic>comX</italic>. In contrast, even though CSP1-R3A by itself was unable to induce the expression of <italic>comX</italic>, it did not competitively inhibit CSP1-dependent <italic>comX</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results suggest that CSP1-E1A has the unique ability to competitively inhibit the ability of CSP1 to induce competence.</p>

As expected, in the absence of CSP1-E1A, CSP1 induced DNA uptake and transformation at high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, the presence of increasing concentrations of CSP1-E1A drastically inhibited the transformation of D39. For example, at equal concentration of 100 ng/ml, CSP1-E1A reduced CSP1-mediated transformation by 5.6-fold. Interestingly, increasing concentration of CSP1-R3A failed to competitively inhibit the ability of CSP1 to induce DNA transformation in D39 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). These results are consistent with the inability of CSP1-R3A to inhibit the induction of <italic>comX</italic> by CSP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

        <p>Because CSP1-E1A is capable of competitively inhibiting CSP1-mediated competence induction in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, we examined whether this inhibition occurred in a time-dependent manner. D39pcomX::lacZ cells were pre-exposed to 100 ng/ml CSP1, then chased by the addition of CSP1-E1A at indicated time intervals. Activation of the <italic>comX</italic> promoter was calculated against D39pcomX::lacZ cells exposed to CSP1 alone (100%). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g004">Figure 4</xref>, CSP1-E1A at concentration of 100 ng/ml was able to inhibit approximately 40–50% of <italic>comX</italic> induction 10 minutes after pre-induction with CSP1. The inhibition was abolished at approximately 30 minutes after preinduction with CSP1. At the concentration of 800 ng/ml, CSP1-E1A was highly effective, and able to inhibit 50% of CSP1-mediated <italic>comX</italic> induction 25 min after pre-induction by CSP1. These results suggest that under our <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental conditions, 30 min was roughly the time span required for the distribution and binding of CSP1 to ComD to prevent competitive inhibition by CSP1-E1A. In addition, these results also indicate that 30 minutes was approximately the amount of time required for establishment of full competence when <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 cells are exposed to CSP1.</p>

        <p>We and others have previously shown that the competence regulon regulates both DNA transformation and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Claverys2">[24]</xref>, although the mechanism behind this regulation is not fully understood. Guiral <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Guiral1">[23]</xref> have proposed a possible connection between competence induced cell lysis and virulence. Induction of competence triggers the expression of the murein hydrolases autolysin A (LytA) and Choline-Binding Protein D (CbpD). Together, they induce pneumococcal cell lysis and the release of virulence factors including penumolysin and cell wall component LTA into the hosts. Therefore, we examined whether CSP1-E1A could inhibit the synthesis and the release of pneumococcal murein hydrolases. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 cells were treated with CSP1 (100 ng/ml) alone or simultaneously with increasing amounts of CSP1-E1A (0, 100, 200, 400 or 800 ng/ml), and subjected to zymogram analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g006">Figures 6A–6C</xref>, The expression of CbpD and LytA decreased by 63% and 44% respectively when D39 cells were simultaneously treated with a combination of 100 ng/ml CSP1 and 200 ng/ml CSP1-E1A. The decrease is even more profound as the concentrations of CSP1-E1A was increased to 400 ng/ml or 800 g/ml, reducing the expression of LytA by 73% and 72% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Similarly, at the concentrations of 400 ng/ml or 800 g/ml, CSP1-E1A reduced the expression of CbpD by 87% and 94%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Inhibition of <italic>cpbD</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>) mirrored the zymogram analysis.

        <title>CSP1-E1A attenuates the virulence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> during infection of mouse lungs</title>
        <p>The ability of CSP1-E1A to inhibit the expression of LytA and CbpD <italic>in vitro</italic> reveals the possibility of using this peptide analogue to attenuate pneumococcal infection. We examined whether CSP1-E1A could attenuate the virulence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 using mouse model of acute pneumonia in two independent experiments. In Experiment 1, adult CD1 mice (groups of 10) were intranasally infected with D39 alone or a mixture of D39 and 20 µg CSP1-E1A. Animals were monitored closely, and those that were moribund were considered dead. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, inclusion of CSP1-E1A in the infection mix significantly reduced the mortality rate of infected mice from 60% (D39 alone) to 30% (D39 coinoculated with CSP1-E1A). However, the difference in kinetics of mouse survival between the two groups was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.21) as analyzed by the log rank (Mantel-Cox) survival analysis. Thus, we repeated the experiment with higher number of mice and increased concentration of CSP1-E1A. In Experiment 2, CD1 mice (groups of 20) were intranasally infected with D39 alone or a mixture of D39 and 100 µg CSP1-E1A. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, increasing the CSP1-E1A concentration to 100 µg/mouse in the infection mix significantly reduced the mortality rate of infected mice from 75% (D39 alone) to 40% (D39 coinoculated with CSP1-E1A). In addition, the kinetics of death was delayed, and was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). In contrast, the survival rate and mortality kinetics were indistinguishable between mice infected with D39 alone or in mice infected with a mixture of D39 and 100 µg CSP1-R3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.96).

        <p>Spontaneous transformation of encapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains including D39 occurs at extremely low frequency <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, CSP1 was included to increase the efficiency of DNA transformation experiments reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t003">3</xref>. Inclusion of CSP1 beckoned the question of whether CSP1-E1A could attenuate natural transformation events <italic>in vivo</italic>. Natural transformation experiments were performed using a capsule mutant <italic>cap3A</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t001">Table 1</xref>) derived from a serotype 3 isolate 0100993 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>. The colonies of serotype 3 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolates are large and mucoid, and can be easily distinguished from small colonies formed by non-encapsulated rough mutants. Mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with a mixture of 3×10<sup>9</sup> <italic>cap3A</italic> cells and 100 µg of chromosomal DNA from 0100993, or with a mixture of 3×10<sup>9</sup> <italic>cap3A</italic> cells and 100 µg of 0100993 chromosomal DNA and 100 µg of CSP1-E1A. Higher amount of CSP1-E1A was used because we did not know the length of the inhibitory effect of this peptide analogue <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the timing of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells entering the competent state for DNA transformation <italic>in vivo</italic> was also not clear. Transformation mixtures were assembled under ice-cold condition as described for <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t003">3</xref>. Plating of transformation mixtures immediately before and after inoculation did not recover any transformants (data not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t004">Table 4</xref>, transformants with wild-type capsule were recovered from four of the five mice inoculated with the mixture of <italic>cap3A</italic> bacteria and 0100993 genomic DNA. In contrast, transformants with wild-type capsule were only recovered from one out of five mice co-inoculated with <italic>cap3A</italic> bacteria and 0100993 DNA and CSP1-E1A. Furthermore, we used CSP1-R3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) as a control to demonstrate the specificity of CSP1-E1A inhibition. CSP1-R3A was unable to inhibit development of natural competence <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t004">Table 4</xref>). In the group treated with a mixture of 3×10<sup>9</sup> <italic>cap3A</italic> cells and 100 µg of 0100993 chromosomal DNA and 100 µg of CSP1-R3A, transformants were isolated from all the 5 mice, indicating high concentration of CSP1-R3A was unable to inhibit natural DNA transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results suggest that CSP1-E1A has the unique ability to reduce the incidence of natural DNA transformation process <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>A CSP2 analogue CSP2-E1A effectively inhibits the competence development and transformation in ComD2 strain TIGR4</title>
        <p>Because CSP1-E1A is an efficient inhibitor of competence induced by CSP1, we hypothesize that a synthetic CSP2 analogue with the substitution of first residue (glutamate) with alainine (CSP2-E1A) will competitively inhibit CSP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We examined the ability of CSP2-E1A to inhibit the induction of competence by CSP2 in the compatible ComD2 strain TIGR4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t001">Table 1</xref>). CSP2-E1A was barely able to induce the promoter activity of <italic>comX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>), and its ability to induce DNA transformation was reduced by approximately 3 logs when compared to CSP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002241-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>).

At higher concentrations of 400 and 800 ng/ml, CSP2-E1A almost completely abolished CSP2-mediated DNA transformation.

        <title>CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A cross inhibit the competence in <italic>S. penumoniae</italic> strains with incompatible ComD subtypes</title>
        <p>A previous study has shown that individual CSP peptide is capable of inducing the competence of DNA transformation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains expressing an incompatible ComD subtype, albeit at lower efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg2">[19]</xref>. For example, CSP1 is able to induce the competence at lower efficiency in TIGR4, a pneumococcal strain with an incompatible ComD2 subtype. Because the first amino acid (glutamate) at the N-terminus is conserved across all six CSP subtypes, this raises the possibility that our CSP analogues CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A can be broad spectrum in their ability to inhibit the development of competence, horizontal gene transfers and virulence, regardless of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> serotypes or ComD subtypes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002241-t001">Table 1</xref>) to cross inhibit the induction of <italic>comX</italic> and DNA transformation in ComD2 strain TIGR4 or ComD1 strain D39, respectively.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The competence regulon is known to regulate DNA transformation and virulence in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Johnsborg1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Morrison1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Claverys2">[24]</xref>. In this study, we explored the use of synthetic analogues of CSPs to competitively inhibit: (i) the development of competence, (ii) horizontal gene transfer, and (iii) virulence, under both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental conditions. Amino acid substitution or deletion of conserved residues in C-terminus of CSP1 did not alter their ability to induce competence and DNA transformation. In contrast, amino acid substitutions on the first (CSP1-E1A) and third residue (CSP1-R3A) on the N-terminus impair the ability of these CSP analogues to induce competence. Our findings are consistent with the previously thesis work by Coomaraswamy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Coomaraswamy1">[33]</xref>, which has been summarized by Haverstein and Morrison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Havarstein2">[34]</xref>. By alanine scanning, Coomaraswamy demonstrates that both the N-terminus and the central region are more important than the C-terminus of CSP1 for the induction of competence regulon. One discrepancy of our finding from that of Coomaraswamy is on the requirement of 2<sup>nd</sup> amino acid residue on the N-terminus. Coomaraswamy has shown that substituting the methionine with an alanine reduces the ability of the CSP1-M2A to induce competence by 96%. In contrast, our analysis suggests that the methionine residue is dispensable for competence induction. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that our <italic>comX</italic> induction and DNA transformation experiments were performed with 100 ng/ml CSP1-M2A, approximately 10-fold higher than the amounts used by Coomaraswamy. Thus, despite its lower activity, excess amounts of CSP1-M2A might have masked our ability to see reduced efficiency of this analogue to induce competence.</p>
      <p>Of the five CSP1 analogues examined, only CSP1-E1A is capable of competitively inhibiting the induction of competence and DNA transformation by CSP1. CSP1-E1A is able to effectively compete with CSP1 even after 25 min pre-exposure of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to the latter. Furthermore, CSP1-E1A is able to inhibit the development of spontaneous competence in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in a concentration dependent manner. Importantly, CSP1-E1A is able to attenuate the expression of competence-regulated pneumococcal virulence factors LytA and CbpD <italic>in vitro,</italic> and reduced the mortality of mice in a pneumonia model of lung infection by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. In addition, we provide evidence that CSP1-E1A is able to inhibit the horizontal gene transfer of the streptomycin resistance <italic>rpsL</italic> and the capsule <italic>cap3A</italic> genes <italic>in vivo.</italic> Finally, we demonstrate a broader applicability of the peptide inhibitor strategy. CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A are able to cross inhibit the induction of competence and DNA transformation in pneumococcal strains with incompatible ComD subtypes. For example, CSP1-E1A is able to reduce the CSP2-mediated competence and DNA transformation in ComD2 strain TIGR4. Similarly, CSP2-E1A is able to cross inhibit the CSP1-mediated competence and DNA transformation in ComD1 strain D39.</p>
      <p>Among the five CSP1 analogues, we found that only CSP1-E1A inhibits CSP1-mediated competence in time and concentration-dependent manners. These results suggest that glutamate, the first amino acid residue of CSPs, is only required for the activity of CSPs. Substituting the glutamate with alanine disrupts the ability of the analogue to activate ComD1, but does not interfere with its binding affinity to ComD1. Competitive inhibition of CSP1 by CSP1-E1A suggests that this analogue, which barely activates competence, can bind to the receptor kinase ComD1, and outcompete CSP1. In contrast, another CSP1 analogue, CSP1-R3A, not only loses the ability to induce competence, but also could not out compete CSP1 even when added in over-saturating concentrations. This observation indicates that CSP1-R3A has lost its ability to bind and activate ComD1. The importance of the first glutamate residue has been confirmed by our data demonstrating that the synthetic analogue CSP2-E1A also efficiently inhibits the CSP2-mediated DNA transformation in the compatible ComD2 strain TIGR4.</p>
      <p>Several studies have revealed that the competence regulon of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is important for virulence in mammalian hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Claverys2">[24]</xref>. For example, we have previously shown that the loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>comB</italic> gene, which encodes an accessory protein of the ComA ABC transporter for the export of CSP, is attenuated in a mouse model of bacteremia infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>. Mutation of CSP receptor gene <italic>comD</italic> severely attenuates virulence in both mouse models of pneumonia and bacteremia infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>. Also, microarray analysis has showed that some virulence and stress responsive genes are upregulated during development of competence, suggesting that genes that are important for the fitness of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> are also regulated by competence CSP-ComDE cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Peterson1">[14]</xref>. Thus, suppression of the CSP-ComDE cascade or downstream genes dependent on this signaling pathway may attenuate the virulence of this pathogen. Our results, which show that CSP1-E1A delays the kinetics and the rate of mouse mortality, demonstrate that this peptide has the potential to inhibit the virulence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> by disrupting the CSP-ComDE- dependent competence regulon. Our findings are in agreement with previous reports by Oggioni <italic>et al</italic>, which show that administration of CSP in a mouse model of pneumonia infection increases virulence of pneumococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Oggioni2">[35]</xref>, suggesting that competence regulon is important for lung infection. In contrast, the same authors also reported that intravenous (IV) injection of CSP reduces virulence in an IV model of mouse bacteremia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Oggioni1">[32]</xref>. Based on this finding, one can surmise that administration of CSP1-E1A may have the unintended consequence of exacerbating virulence in IV model of mouse bacteremia. However, one unresolved issue with the results of the IV model of sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Oggioni1">[32]</xref> is that it is in disagreement with the findings by Lau et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lau1">[20]</xref>, which showed the requirement of competence regulon during pneumococcal-mediated sepsis. The discrepansy can be explained because the sepsis studies by Lau et al was performed by intraperitoneal model of infection whereas the studies by Oggionu et al was performed by IV model of infection. Neverthelss, collectively, these studies indicate the important contribution of the pneumococcal competence regulon to virulence during mouse model of pneumonia infection, and offer an tentalizing clue that the competence system as interesting drug target to combat pulmonary pneumonia. In contrast, inhibition of competence regulon by systemic delivery of CSP1-E1A in an IV model of bacteremia should be avoided until further clarification.</p>
      <p>Within the last few decades, resistance of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to β-lactams, macrolides, and other antibiotic classes has escalated dramatically throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Coker1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Liares1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Lynch2">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Jacobs1">[39]</xref>. While conjugative elements appear to be the most important causes for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Pozzi2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Shen1">[43]</xref>, horizontal gene transfer of penicillin binding protein genes has occurred in clinical isolates of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Dowson1">[44]</xref>. Importantly, it has been shown that under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, antibiotic stress induces genetic transformability in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Prudhomme1">[45]</xref>. This suggests that under certain <italic>in vivo</italic> circumstances, instead of being killed, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> actively exploits the opportunity of antibiotic stress to acquire exogenous genes. These authors also reported that unlike wild type <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, antibiotic stress-mediated competence could not be induced in a <italic>comA</italic> mutant that lacks the ABC transporter needed to export CSP, suggesting that this process is CSP-dependent. Because antibiotic resistance is a serious clinical concern, the development and use of non-antibiotic based therapy to reduce horizontal gene transfer is urgently needed. Our studies suggest that CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A competitively inhibit CSP from binding to ComD, leading to suppression of horizontal gene transfer. The use of CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A, which does not inhibit the bacterial growth, is predicted to pose less selection pressure toward the survival of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This may alleviate the emergence of resistance in pneumococcus. More importantly, CSP1-E1A and CSP2-E1A have the ability to cross inhibit the induction of the competence regulon in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains with incompatible ComD subtypes. Thus, it may be beneficial to generate analogues of CSPs as drugs to reduce horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, and to attenuate virulence during infection by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> irrespective of their serotypes. In the same context, chemical inhibitors of that interfere with CSP functions may be useful as well.</p>
      <p>In previously published studies, some of the <italic>in vivo</italic> transformation experiments involved infections were allowed to run their course, and success or failure of gene transfers were expressed by the number of deceased animals harboring encapsulated or antibiotic resistant transformants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Griffith1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-AuerbachRubin1">[31]</xref>. However, at these late stages of infection, most transformants are expected to have over-proliferated, and it may be difficult to assess the actual transformation frequency. Other transformation studies lasted for eight hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-OttolenghiNightingale1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-OttolenghiNightingale2">[47]</xref>. In this study, we used both approaches. We assessed the infected lungs for streptomycin resistant transformants 6 hr post-infection in an effort to estimate the actual transformation frequency. Our results suggest that, despite the provision of CSP1 and abundant amounts of DNA, <italic>in vivo</italic> transformation events for the encapsulated wild-type <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strain D39 in mouse lungs remain low, in the range of 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>−7</sup> under our experimentation conditions. In comparison, we also examined the <italic>in vivo</italic> transformation within intraperitoneally-infected mice in which the infection was allowed to take its full course (∼ 24 hr), similar to previously published studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Griffith1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-AuerbachRubin1">[31]</xref>. The percentage of transformants in D39 increases to the range of 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup>. The different rate of transformation may suggest that the environment in the lung is more complex and less conducive to DNA uptake and transformation than the intraperitoneal space. Alternatively, longer period of infection may have allowed more recipient D39 cells to be transformed.</p>
      <p>Importantly, we show that CSP1-E1A is also able to attenuate natural transformation in the absence of exogenously provided CSP1. The capsule-deficient <italic>cap3A</italic> mutant derived from the serotype 3 strain 0100993 was used as recipient. It is well known that natural transformation frequency of capsule-deficient <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> mutants is much higher than their respective encapsulated parental wild-type strains. Furthermore, recipients that have acquired the wild-type capsule gene will be more resistant to phagocytosis by host leukocytes, allowing a better possibility for the transformants to proliferate inside the host. Because of the higher transformation frequency was anticipated for the rough <italic>cap3A</italic> mutants, larger amounts of CSP1-E1A was used to attenuate natural transformation to ensure that the inhibition effect of CSP1-E1A could outlast and suppress spontaneous development of competence of <italic>cap3A</italic> cells in the peritoneal cavity. In contrast, the presence of capsule in D39 cells reduces the spontaneous transformation frequency to a very low level. Not surprisingly, 800 ng of CSP1-E1A was adequate to completely abolish transformation of D39 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have demonstrated the efficacy of using competitive inhibitor of CSPs to attenuate virulence and to inhibit horizontal gene transfer in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Because competence peptide-mediated quorum sensing systems are conserved in many pathogenic species of Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Dunny1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Thoendel1">[52]</xref>, the strategy of using peptide analogue may be applicable to reduce the incidence of horizontal gene transfer and acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes, and to also treat lung infections mediated by this class of pathogens. In addition, competence systems in other streptococcal species, including <italic>S. mitis,</italic> are very similar to that of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, lending to the idea that the former could be transformed by pneumococcal DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Hvarstein2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002241-Kilian1">[54]</xref>. <italic>S. mitis</italic> is generally considered as an avirulent species, but it has the potential to acquire virulence determinants from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to transform itself into a pathogen. In this scenario, CSP1-E1A or CSP2-E1A may be applicable to reduce the emergence of the new pathogen.</p>
