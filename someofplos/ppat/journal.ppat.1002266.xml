        <p>In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the transcriptional regulator <italic>Tri6</italic> is encoded within the trichothecene gene cluster and regulates genes involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite deoxynivalenol (DON). The Tri6 protein with its Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger may also conform to the class of global transcription regulators. This class of global transcriptional regulators mediate various environmental cues and generally responds to the demands of cellular metabolism. To address this issue directly, we sought to find gene targets of Tri6 in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> grown in optimal nutrient conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by Illumina sequencing (ChIP-Seq) revealed that in addition to identifying six genes within the trichothecene gene cluster, <italic>Tri1, Tri3, Tri6, Tri7, Tri12</italic> and <italic>Tri14</italic>, the ChIP-Seq also identified 192 additional targets potentially regulated by Tri6. Functional classification revealed that, among the annotated genes, ∼40% are associated with cellular metabolism and transport and the rest of the target genes fall into the category of signal transduction and gene expression regulation. ChIP-Seq data also revealed Tri6 has the highest affinity toward its own promoter, suggesting that this gene could be subject to self-regulation. Electro mobility shift assays (EMSA) performed on the promoter of <italic>Tri6</italic> with purified Tri6 protein identified a minimum binding motif of GTGA repeats as a consensus sequence. Finally, expression profiling of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions revealed that 49 out of 198 target genes are differentially regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic>. The identification of potential new targets together with deciphering novel binding sites for Tri6, casts new light into the role of this transcriptional regulator in the overall growth and development of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Our knowledge of mechanisms involved in the activation and biosynthesis of DON comes largely from <italic>in vitro</italic> culture studies. Cumulated knowledge suggests that the physiological status of the fungus and the availability of nutrients are the main determining factors for DON production. Integration of various environmental cues to coordinate expression of secondary metabolic genes is thought to be mediated by a combination of global and pathway-specific transcription factors. While the global transcriptional factors respond to broad range of environmental cues such as the availability of carbon and nitrogen, the pathway-specific transcriptional factors regulate genes within a gene cluster. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the transcriptional regulator Tri6 is encoded within the trichothecene gene cluster and regulates genes involved in the synthesis and transport of DON. In this report, we utilized ChIP-Seq to demonstrate that Tri6 can potentially bind to promoters and regulate genes not involved in the synthesis of DON and furthermore, many of these non-trichothecene genes are involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism, including transport and energy. Expression profiling revealed that many of the target genes are differentially regulated by Tri6, thus validating our hypothesis that Tri6 is a global regulator involved in cellular metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> Schwabe [telemorph <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic> (Schwein.) Petch] is the causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most destructive crop diseases in temperate climes throughout the world. In addition to yield reduction, FHB is often associated with the accumulation of the secondary metabolite DON in grain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Kang1">[1]</xref>. DON belongs to the trichothecene family of secondary metabolites; it binds to the peptidyltransferase of ribosomes thereby inhibiting protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Bennett1">[2]</xref>. DON accumulates in infected plant tissues, is phytotoxic, and poses considerable health risk to consumers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Pestka1">[3]</xref>. Although considerable effort has been expended to both detect and regulate the amount of this mycotoxin in the infected cereals, there is less information with regard to the regulation of DON biosynthesis.</p>
      <p>Our knowledge of mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of DON and other secondary metabolites comes largely from <italic>in vitro</italic> culture studies. A considerable amount of evidence gathered over many years suggested that the physiological status of the fungus and the availability of nutrients are the main contributors for secondary metabolite production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Calvo1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner1">[5]</xref>. Other growth conditions such as pH have also been shown to influence the production of secondary metabolite in numerous fungi including <italic>F. graminearum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Yu1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner2">[7]</xref>. Recent studies have assessed the role of various carbon and nitrogen sources in the induction of DON <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Jiao1">[8]</xref>. For example, while the products of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway such as agmatine and putrescine strongly influenced DON biosynthesis, the study also revealed negative effects of other nitrogenous compounds on the induction of DON <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner1">[5]</xref>. Other studies have also demonstrated the importance of carbon sources in the regulation of DON biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Jiao1">[8]</xref>. Growth conditions modified by the addition of salt solutions, hydrogen peroxide, and various phytochemicals and fungicides have also been shown to influence DON production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Ochiai1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the physiological conditions, factors affecting fungal developmental also impact the synthesis of secondary metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Calvo1">[4]</xref>. In <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, the canonical heterotrimeric G protein/cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signalling pathway involved in diverse cellular responses including cell division, morphogenesis and pathogenic development affect the production of the secondary metabolites penicillin and sterigmatocystin. For example, mutations in <italic>fadA</italic>, a gene encoding for the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, negatively impacts aflatoxin biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Hicks1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Roze1">[11]</xref>. Conversely, a dominant active <italic>fadA</italic> mutant inhibited expression of the transcription factor AflR, resulting in the blockage of sterigmatocystin synthesis. Interestingly, introduction of the same dominant active <italic>fadA</italic> mutant in <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> resulted in elevated levels of T-2 toxin, suggesting conservation of signalling pathways between filamentous fungi in the regulation of secondary metabolite synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Tag1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This level of complexity, integrating various environmental inputs to fungal development leading to the activation of secondary metabolic gene clusters, has led to the current working model which proposes a multilevel regulation of secondary metabolism by both global and pathway-specific transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Yu1">[6]</xref>. In this scenario, the global transcription factors would respond and integrate disparate environmental cues such as temperature, pH and various carbon and nitrogen sources. Examples include A<italic>reA</italic> which mediates nitrogen catabolite repression in <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, and PacC which mediates pH regulation of the penicillin and trichothecene gene clusters in <italic>Aspergillus</italic>,and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Pealva1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Merhej1">[14]</xref>. One of the characteristic features of the global regulators is that they possess Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger domains, important for DNA binding and regulating gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Yu1">[6]</xref>. The pathway-specific regulators on the other hand have a characteristic Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> zinc binuclear cluster and positively regulate expression of a specific gene cluster. This is best exemplified by AflR, which regulates the sterigmatocystin biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Fernandes1">[15]</xref>. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic>, the transcriptional regulator <italic>Tri6</italic> is encoded within the trichothecene gene cluster and regulates expression of structural genes involved in the synthesis of DON and T-2 toxin, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Proctor1">[18]</xref>. Targeted disruption of <italic>Tri6</italic> in both <italic>Fusarium</italic> species established its role as a positive regulator of trichothecene genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Proctor1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Peplow1">[19]</xref>. Although this criterion designated Tri6 as a pathway-specific transcriptional regulator, evidence accumulated over the past few years have suggested that Tri6 may be representative of a global transcription factor whose expression is influenced by a variety of environmental factors. In addition to possessing Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger domains, <italic>Tri6</italic> is influenced by the pH of the growth media and by a large range of nitrogen and carbon compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Jiao1">[8]</xref>. For example, polyamines such as agmatine and putrescine induced novel genes regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner3">[20]</xref>. Additionally, expression profiling of FHB-infected tissues identified more than 200 genes that are not part of the trichothecene gene cluster differentially regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>. This included genes in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway which produces farnesyl pyrophosphate, an immediate precursor for trichothecenes, and genes involved in transport and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>. These observations suggested that genes outside of the trichothecene gene cluster are subject to <italic>Tri6</italic> regulation.</p>
      <p>To investigate the possibility that Tri6 is a global transcriptional regulator responsive to both environmental and developmental cues, a genome wide ChIP-Seq experiment was undertaken to identify potential new targets of Tri6. Therefore, ChIP-Seq was performed with <italic>Fusarium</italic> grown in nutrient-rich conditions, a condition optimal to detect targets involved in both growth and development. We identified 198 potential new targets of Tri6 and functional categorization associated them with energy, metabolism and other cellular processes. Expression profiling of <italic>Fusarium</italic> grown in nitrogen-deprived conditions, a condition optimal for the production of trichothecenes showed that 47 of 198 targets were differentially regulated in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δ strain. The over expression of <italic>Tri6</italic> in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δ strain confirmed that Tri6 can auto-regulate its own expression under nutrient rich conditions. Detailed analysis of the <italic>Tri6</italic> promoter revealed a new tandem GTGA DNA binding site, located adjacent to the previously described binding site for Tri6. This finding, together with the identification of new targets, signifies a broader regulatory role for Tri6.</p>

        <title>Targets of Tri6 include structural and regulatory genes involved in metabolism</title>
        <p>Tri6 has been defined as a pathway-specific transcription factor that regulates genes of the trichothecene gene cluster under nitrogen-deprived conditions. However, to characterize Tri6 as a global transcriptional regulator, we sought to identify targets of Tri6 by performing a genome wide ChIP-Seq in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> grown in nutrient-rich conditions. The ChIP-Seq was performed in the <italic>Tri6-HA</italic> complemented strain and was compared to the <italic>Tri6</italic>Δ strain. It should be noted that the addition of the HA epitope to the C-terminus of <italic>Tri6</italic> did not compromise its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Schreiber1">[21]</xref>. Moreover, the presence of Tri6 protein in the <italic>Tri6-HA</italic> complemented strain was confirmed by immunoblot blot analysis using HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). ChIP DNA samples from the <italic>Tri6-HA</italic> and the <italic>Tri6</italic>Δ strains were sequenced by Illumina Genome Analyzer as 38 base tags. The software Novoalign was used to map the tags/reads to the reference genome (<italic>F. graminearum</italic>, PH-1; NRRL 31084) and the software Site Identification from Short Sequence Reads (SISSRs) was used to identify potential binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Jothi1">[22]</xref>. A browser shot of the output from the SISSRs analysis is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Among the 1491 enriched binding sites in the <italic>Tri6-HA</italic> complemented strain, we identified a total of 198 protein-coding genes with at least one binding site 1 Kb upstream of the ORF as potential targets of Tri6, distributed in all four chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The binding site was defined by a high stringent criterion with a minimum of 120 tags and the number of tags per given target is proportional to the affinity of Tri6 to its target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Jothi1">[22]</xref>. This is highlighted by the substantial enrichment of region in chromosome 2, where <italic>Tri6</italic> is located (dotted box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The 198 target genes with their tags are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s003">Table S1</xref>.</p>

For example, genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, such as pyridoxal decarboxylase (<italic>FGSG_08249</italic>) which decarboxylates L-glutamate into GABA and ornithine aminotransferase (<italic>FGSG_02304</italic>) which transaminates L-ornithine into glutamate- γ -semialdehyde were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s004">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Slaughter1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Marzluf1">[24]</xref>. Genes involved in lipid metabolism were also identified as potential targets of Tri6. For example, triacyl glycerol lipase (FGSG_02082) and acyl-CoA thioesterases (FGSG_03286 and FGSG_02848) yield free fatty acids, which are used in the β-oxidation pathway to produce energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Beopoulos1">[25]</xref>. In addition, acetyl-CoA, the by-product of thioesterase activity, is assimilated into the energy generating TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s004">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Beopoulos1">[25]</xref>.

        <p>In addition to the structural genes involved in metabolism, the targets of Tri6 also included genes involved in regulatory functions and signal transduction processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s004">Table S2</xref>). Many of the transcription factors are classified as zinc-binding proteins and some are known to be involved in nitrogen regulation, including two genes (<italic>FGSG_05942</italic> and <italic>FGSG_10774</italic>) with NmrA domains.

        <p>In summary, the genome-wide ChIP-Seq performed in nutrient-rich conditions identified new targets involved in various aspects of metabolism. The targets encompassed not only regulatory genes, but also genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism, energy, and transport. The analysis also identified genes of the trichothecene gene cluster. This was particularly interesting given the fact that these genes are activated only in nutrient-deprived conditions. This suggested that that under nutrient-rich conditions, Tri6 could potentially exert transcriptional control over itself and other <italic>Tri</italic> genes.</p>

        <p>The ChIP-Seq data suggested that Tri6 had high affinity to its own promoter so we were interested to know if Tri6 would bind to its own promoter and self-regulate its expression. To demonstrate that Tri6 protein binds to its own promoter, the DNA-Tri6 complex was immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies from both the <italic>Tri6</italic>Δ and the <italic>Tri6-HA</italic> complemented strains grown in nutrient-rich conditions and PCR was performed using the primers spanning the upstream region of <italic>Tri6</italic> ORF.

        <p>To demonstrate that Tri6 can bind to its own promoter and regulate its expression in nutrient-rich conditions, <italic>Tri6</italic> expression was monitored in the wildtype strain, the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrain, and the strain that over expressed <italic>Tri6</italic> in the <italic>tri6</italic> mutant background strain (<italic>tri6</italic>Δ<italic>Tri6)</italic>. We designed two distinct primer sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s005">Table S3</xref>) to monitor <italic>Tri6</italic> transcripts. The first primer set (Tri6-ORF F/R) was designed in the coding region of <italic>Tri6</italic> (vertical open box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and as shown, over expression of <italic>Tri6</italic> in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δ strain (<italic>tri6</italic>Δ<italic>Tri6)</italic> led to a significant increase of <italic>Tri6</italic> transcripts compared to the wildtype strain (52±4, Tri6-ORF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and 77±7; Tri6-ORF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). As expected, no expression of <italic>Tri6</italic> was detected with these primers in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3B and 3C</xref>). The second primer set was designed to overlap the 5′UTR region and the coding region of <italic>Tri6</italic> (Dotted vertical box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) which allowed us to monitor <italic>Tri6</italic> transcripts originating only in the wildtype and the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrains. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, a significant increase of <italic>Tri6</italic> expression (Tri6-5′UTR, 4.4±0.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and Tri6-5′UTR, 7±0.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) was observed in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrain, compared to the wildtype strain.

        <title>Identification and characterization of the Tri6 binding site in the <italic>Tri6</italic> promoter</title>
        <p>A previous study performed in <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> suggested TNAGGCC as a DNA binding site for Tri6 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Hohn1">[17]</xref>. A recent study that examined the promoters of genes differentially regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic> during the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection process also suggested a similar DNA binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>. The results described here confirmed that Tri6 is able to bind its own promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and regulate its own expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Since the promoter of <italic>Tri6</italic> (−836 to −768) harbours two RNAGGCC (where R =  G or A) binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), we employed EMSA analyses to further delineate the binding site for Tri6. All the EMSA assays were performed with purified recombinant Tri6 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). First, we tested the probe which contained two of the RNAGGCC motifs and as the results indicated, Tri6 did not bind to this probe (Tri6-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This prompted us to examine the region that surrounds this motif. The probe Tri6-2 which included sequences proximal to the binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) also did not bind the Tri6p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, a probe (Tri6-3) which included sequences distal to the binding sites was able to bind Tri6 protein. The specificity of the binding to the Tri6-3 probe was confirmed by the addition of 10-fold excess non-labelled Tri6-3 probe in the EMSA assays (Tri6-3, competitor, ‘+’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In addition, we also used a probe which did not contain this consensus sequence as a negative control (Tri6-NS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results suggested that RNAGGCC motif is not involved in Tri6 binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. To further confirm this, nucleotides GGCC within the motif were mutated in the Tri6-3 probe and the results indicated that the mutations did not abolish Tri6 binding (Tri6-3-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These results confirmed that the YNAGGCC motif is not required for binding of Tri6, but suggested that nucleotides outside of this motif in the Tri6-3 probe are involved in Tri6 binding. Outside of the RNAGGCC motif, three domains in the Tri6-3 probe were recognized that could potentially bind Tri6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). We designated CTGA sequence which partially overlaps the AGGCC site as Domain I and the two GTGA repeats separated by six nucleotides as Domain II and III, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). As the EMSA results indicated, individual nucleotide mutations within Domain I did not have any noticeable effect on Tri6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, individual mutations in Domain II and Domain III of the GTGA sequences, respectively, dramatically decreased Tri6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Furthermore, combined mutations in both Domain II and III completely abolished the Tri6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). These results suggested that either a single GTGA sequence or GTGA repeats in the promoter of <italic>Tri6</italic> are required for Tri6 binding.</p>

        <title>Tri6 targets are differentially regulated under nitrogen limiting conditions</title>
        <p>The 198 Tri6 targets identified in nutrient-rich conditions included several genes of the trichothecene gene cluster (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002266-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since the <italic>Tri</italic> genes are expressed only under nitrogen-limiting conditions, we were interested to know how many of the non-<italic>Tri</italic> gene targets are co-regulated with the <italic>Tri</italic> genes. To address this, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis of wildtype and <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrains grown in nitrogen-limiting conditions. As the microarray analysis indicated, we identified a total of 1614 genes that were differentially regulated in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrain (2-fold cut off; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s006">Table S4</xref>). Among the 870 down-regulated genes, 18 of the <italic>Tri6</italic> targets were represented and another eight were represented in the 744 up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Top five genes from each of the up and -down-regulated genes from the microarray analyses were selected for validation by RT-qPCR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). If the expression threshold was set at 1.5, 49 of the 198 target genes (∼25% of the ChIP targets) were shown to be differentially regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic> in this nutrient-limiting condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s007">Table S5</xref>). Out of 49 targets, 23 genes or ∼53% were annotated as unclassified by the MIPS functional annotation program and although others were classified into four major groups, only one category associated with cellular transport comprised of eight target genes were enriched to a significant level (enrichment of 19% vs 10% in the genome, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.06). Thus expression profiling provided a strong evidence to suggest that <italic>Tri6</italic> extends its regulatory control beyond the trichothecene cluster and additionally, Tri6 can act both as a positive and negative regulator.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Much of our understanding regarding the transcription regulator Tri6 stems from earlier studies that identified its control of the mycotoxin pathway leading to trichothecene biosynthesis and designated it as a pathway-specific transcriptional regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Hohn1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Proctor1">[18]</xref>. Since then, evidence from numerous laboratories have challenged this perception and thus prompted us to hypothesize that Tri6 is a global transcriptional regulator whose influence extends beyond the trichothecene gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Gardiner3">[20]</xref>. Accordingly, the ChIP-Seq experiments performed in nutrient-rich conditions demonstrated that Tri6 could bind to promoters of both structural and regulatory genes associated with many aspects of nitrogen, carbon and lipid metabolisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s004">Table S2</xref>). One of the intriguing revelations was that even under these conditions Tri6 was bound to the promoters of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite, trichothecene 15-ADON (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002266-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since this cluster is only activated in <italic>Fusarium</italic> grown under nitrogen-deficient conditions, binding of Tri6 to the promoters of <italic>Tri</italic> genes suggested that Tri6 could potentially act as a negative regulator, suppressing these genes under nutrient-rich conditions. The results from the RT-qPCR clearly demonstrated that with the exception of <italic>Tri6</italic>, none of the other <italic>Tri</italic> genes are subject to negative regulation by <italic>Tri6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Since the switch from nutrient-rich to deprived conditions led to differential regulation of the target genes, we conclude that Tri6 can act both as a positive and a negative regulator. Furthermore, since the regulation by Tri6 extended beyond the trichothecene gene cluster, we propose that Tri6 is a global transcriptional regulator.</p>

        <p>Nitrogen catabolite repression, or NCR, refers to genes that are repressed when a preferred source of nitrogen such as ammonia or glutamine are present in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Marzluf1">[24]</xref>.

Coincidentally, some of the known <italic>AreA</italic> target genes such as the branched amino acid transferase (<italic>FGSG_05696</italic>; ∼2.2 –fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s006">Table S4</xref>) and the general amino acid permease (<italic>FGSG_05574</italic>; ∼4-fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s006">Table S4</xref>) that are normally expressed in the wildtype <italic>Fusarium</italic> strain under nitrogen-deprived conditions are repressed in the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Schnig1">[34]</xref>. This leads one to speculate that <italic>Tri6</italic>, similar to <italic>AreA</italic>, is involved in NCR.

        <title>DNA binding properties of Tri6</title>
        <p>The EMSA studies demonstrated that mutations in either one of the GTGA elements in the promoter of <italic>Tri6</italic> reduced the binding of Tri6. However, combined mutations in both the GTGA elements completely abolished this binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). This suggested that the presence of two GTGA elements in close proximity to each other in the <italic>Tri6</italic> promoter likely contributes to the affinity of Tri6 to this site. Studies with other global regulators, specifically those responding to nitrogen, such as AreA in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> or its counterpart Nit2 in <italic>N. crassa</italic> showed that binding sites located within 30bp of each other in either orientation enhances their DNA binding affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Chiang1">[38]</xref>. When these criteria were applied to the analysis of Tri6 target genes, 109 of the 198 target genes harboured multiple GTGA/TCAC binding sites in their promoters, separated by eight nucleotides or less, suggesting a common mechanism of binding and regulation by <italic>Tri6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002266-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). It should be noted that GTGA/TCAC motifs separated by more than eight nucleotides are represented in the promoters of all the Tri6 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002266.s003">Table S1</xref>). The GTGA/TCAC motif described in this study is distinct from the previously reported YNAGGCC for Tri6 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Hohn1">[17]</xref>. Unlike this study, Hohn et al. did not use purified Tri6 protein and furthermore, their EMSA analysis with regions of the <italic>Tri3</italic> promoter which contained the putative YNAGGCC consensus binding site did not result in a shift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Hohn1">[17]</xref>.

        <p>Studies with global regulators have outlined several mechanisms that influence both binding affinity and specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Wong1">[31]</xref>. For example, proteins that binds to direct repeats most likely bind as dimers. As an example, Dal80 protein in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, involved in nitrogen catabolism, binds to two closely spaced GATA elements as a dimer in either a tail-to-tail or head-to-head orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Cunningham1">[39]</xref>. Interactions between global and pathway-specific regulators also influence both DNA binding specificity and affinity. For example, some of the genes involved in nitrate assimilation are regulated by the interaction between the global regulators AreA and NirA in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, while other genes are regulated by the global regulator Nit2 and the pathway-specific regulator Nit4 in <italic>N. crassa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Marzluf1">[24]</xref>. Since we observed closely spaced GTGA repeats in the <italic>Tri6</italic> promoter of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, we could envisage a scenario, where Tri6 could function as a dimer and repress the expression of <italic>Tri6</italic> in nutrient-rich conditions. However, under nutrient-deprived conditions, where the expression of <italic>Tri6</italic> increases, Tri6 could interact with other known regulators such as Tri10 or PacC to provide specificity and regulate expression in condition-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Merhej1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Peplow1">[19]</xref>. This interaction may also provide a platform for the Tri6-complexes to bind to an alternate site, such as the YNAGGCC proposed in several studies. Such a scenario could account for the differences between the genes regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic> in this study from those seen in a recent study of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>. It is noteworthy to mention that the authors in that study also observed stark differences between the genes regulated by <italic>Tri6</italic> in culture and <italic>in planta</italic>, albeit the comparison was made between two different <italic>Fusarium</italic> strains. One of the intriguing findings from the <italic>in planta</italic> study was that the promoters of genes, specifically the genes of the isoprenoid pathway essential for trichothecene production in both <italic>in planta</italic> and culture, showed enrichment of the YNAGGCC motif only in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and not in other <italic>Fusarium</italic> species unable to make trichothecenes or in other related fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-KyeY1">[16]</xref>. It was proposed that co-regulation of the isoprenoid genes and the trichothecene genes represent an evolutionary adaptation specific to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. A logical extension of this argument is that the source of nutrition, determined by the environment such as culture conditions or the type of host that this fungus infects, is the driving force behind this adaptation.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this study has identified new or additional role for the transcriptional regulator, Tri6. The findings from this study together with earlier studies have led us to conceive a new mode of action for Tri6. In this model, Tri6 recognizes and binds the GTGA/TCAC elements under one condition such as the nutrient-rich condition where it regulates itself and other genes involved in various aspects of metabolism. However, when the environmental conditions change, be it in culture or <italic>in planta</italic>, activation of other regulators including Tri10 and PacC may change the dynamics of Tri6p-complex and initiate new interactions with the DNA, which could involve recognition of an alternate site such as the YNAGGCC motif. Although, we have no evidence to show that Tri6 directly interacts with either Tri10 or PacC, isolation and identification of Tri6 and Tri10 protein complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> will shed more light on both the dynamics and the links between these regulators.</p>

The rest of the tags were either of low quality or mapped to multiple locations. Of the mapped tags, ∼50% were mapped to sense strand and another 50% were mapped to anti-sense strand. The mapping data were analyzed by the Site Identification from Short Sequence Reads (SISSRs) software for identification of the binding sites with tags originating from the <italic>tri6</italic>Δstrain as control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002266-Jothi1">[22]</xref>. The following parameters were used to run the program: 36,898,000 base pairs for the genome size, 0.8 for the fraction of genome mappable by reads, 1 for the E-value (minimum number of directional tags required on each side of the inferred binding site), 0.1 for the p-value (for fold enrichment of ChIP tags at a binding site location compared to that at the same location in the control data), 2 for the scanning window size, 240 base pairs for the average DNA fragment length, and 350 base pairs for the upper bound DNA fragment length. The switch -u was turned on to allow for identification of the binding sites supported only by reads mapped to one strand. Under these conditions, we were able to identify 1491 potential binding sites with at least 120 tags (Tag#, the sum of the tags mapped to positive strand of the left half of the binding site and the tags mapped to negative strand of the right half of the binding site) and at least 2.15 fold more tags in treatment vs control. We then compiled a list of 198 protein-coding genes with at least one binding site in 1 Kb upstream of the start site. The sum of the Tag# indicates the relative affinity of Tri6 to the binding sites in the promoter of the gene.</p>
