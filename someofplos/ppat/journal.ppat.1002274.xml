        <p>All vector mosquito species must feed on the blood of a vertebrate host to produce eggs. Multiple cycles of blood feeding also promote frequent contacts with hosts, which enhance the risk of exposure to infectious agents and disease transmission. Blood feeding triggers the release of insulin-like peptides (ILPs) from the brain of the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which regulate blood meal digestion and egg formation. In turn, hemocytes serve as the most important constitutive defense in mosquitoes against pathogens that enter the hemocoel. Prior studies indicated that blood feeding stimulates hemocytes to increase in abundance, but how this increase in abundance is regulated is unknown. Here, we determined that phagocytic granulocytes and oenocytoids express the <italic>A. aegypti</italic> insulin receptor (<italic>AaMIR</italic>). We then showed that: 1) decapitation of mosquitoes after blood feeding inhibited hemocyte proliferation, 2) a single dose of insulin-like peptide 3 (ILP3) sufficient to stimulate egg production rescued proliferation, and 3) knockdown of the <italic>AaMIR</italic> inhibited ILP3 rescue activity. Infection studies indicated that increased hemocyte abundance enhanced clearance of the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> at lower levels of infection. Surprisingly, however, non-blood fed females better survived intermediate and high levels of <italic>E. coli</italic> infection than blood fed females. Taken together, our results reveal a previously unrecognized role for the insulin signaling pathway in regulating hemocyte proliferation. Our results also indicate that blood feeding enhances resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> at lower levels of infection but reduces tolerance at higher levels of infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mosquitoes are vectors of several important diseases of humans and other mammals including Dengue fever, malaria and filariasis. These diseases adversely affect worldwide health by killing or debilitating millions of individuals. The key feature of mosquito biology that makes them such important disease vectors is that adult females must feed on the blood of their vertebrate host(s) to produce eggs. In turn, repeated bouts of blood feeding and egg development elevate the risk of mosquitoes feeding on an infected host and transmitting a given pathogen from one individual to another. A key regulator of egg development following blood feeding is the release of insulin-like peptides from the mosquito brain. We have found that insulin-like peptides enhance production of immune cells (hemocytes) that serve as the first line of defense against infection. Conversely, the molecular pathways that regulate egg development and hemocyte proliferation reduce the ability of mosquitoes to tolerate a persistent systemic infection. Taken together, our results indicate that trade-offs exist between reproduction and immune defense in mosquitoes, which is a subject of fundamental interest to evolutionary biologists and of applied importance in understanding disease transmission.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Insects primarily rely on an innate immune system for defense against pathogens and other foreign invaders. Reciprocally, a number of insects including mosquitoes can be infected by and transmit certain pathogens that cause disease in humans and other vertebrate hosts. The key feature of mosquito biology that makes them important disease vectors is that adult females must feed on the blood of their vertebrate host(s) to produce eggs. Repeated bouts of blood feeding and egg development in turn increases the risk of mosquitoes feeding on an infected host and transmitting a given pathogen from one individual to another.</p>
      <p>At the physiological level, blood feeding by the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> triggers neurosecretory cells in the brain to release insulin-like peptides (ILPs) into circulation, which stimulate the ovaries to secrete ecdysteroid hormones (ECDs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Sieglaff1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Wen1">[3]</xref>. ILPs from the brain together with nutrient sensing through the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway also induce the midgut to produce enzymes that digest the protein-rich blood meal into amino acids. These amino acids are then transported from the midgut into the hemolymph where they are taken up by the fat body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Brandon1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-GuliaNuss1">[6]</xref>. Amino acids, ECDs and ILPs together induce the fat body to produce vitellogenin (Vg) and other yolk proteins (YP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Attardo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Roy1">[8]</xref>, which are packaged into eggs that the female lays between 72 and 96 h post-blood meal (pbm). Pathogens in a blood meal infect mosquitoes during this same period by moving across the midgut, disseminating through the hemocoel, and invading other organs like the salivary glands or fat body.</p>
      <p>Constitutive immune defenses in insects refer to factors like hemocytes that are always present and ready to act if an organism is infected, while inducible defenses refer to molecules like antimicrobial peptides that are produced in response to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Haine1">[9]</xref>. In most insects including mosquitoes, hemocytes serve as the most important constitutive defense element against pathogens that enter the hemocoel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Strand1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer1">[11]</xref>. Key functions of mosquito hemocytes include phagocytic and melanotic immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Baton1">[17]</xref>, production of soluble effector molecules with activity against bacteria and protozoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Baton1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Pinto1">[23]</xref>, and enhanced defense associated with immune priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rodrigues1">[24]</xref>. <italic>A. aegypti</italic> produces three types of hemocytes named granulocytes, oenocytoids, and prohemocytes that are distinguished from one another by morphological, antigenic and functional characters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Castillo1">[15]</xref>. In adult females, granulocytes account for more than 90% of the total hemocyte population and are the only cell type that is phagocytic. Oenocytoids in contrast are weakly adhesive cells that constitutively express components of the phenoloxidase cascade that regulate the formation of melanin, while prohemocytes are non-adhesive and may be putative progenitor cells.</p>
      <p>Prior studies indicate that the number of hemocytes in adult <italic>A. aegypti</italic> progressively declines with age, which in turn correlates with age-dependent increases in susceptibility to infection by bacteria like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Castillo1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, blood feeding stimulates an increase in hemocyte abundance in adult females that coincides with the timing of yolk deposition into follicles to produce eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Castillo1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Baton1">[17]</xref>. In the current study, we hypothesized that circulatory hormones that stimulate egg development after blood feeding also mediate increases in hemocyte abundance. Our results show that loss of signaling from the mosquito brain after blood feeding inhibits the increase in hemocyte abundance that occurs after a blood meal while a single dose of insulin peptide 3 (ILP3), sufficient to stimulate egg development, rescues hemocyte proliferation.</p>

        <p>The effects of decapitation on hemocyte abundance were conducted by decapitating females 1–12 h pbm followed by counting the total number of hemocytes recovered from females at 24 h pbm. The effects of ILP3 or 20E on hemocyte numbers at 24 h pbm were determined by decapitating females after feeding, injecting them with 0.5–50.0 pmol of ILP3 or 0.1–1.0 µg of 20E in 1 µl of PBS. Mosquitoes injected with PBS only served as a negative control. Decapitated females heal endogenously and visibly lose no hemolymph.

To compare the percentage of BrdU-labeled hemocytes between intact and decapitated females, data were arcsin square root transformed and analyzed by ANOVA.</p>
        <p>For infection assays, one cohort of adult females was blood fed (BF) on day 4 while a second cohort was left non-blood fed (NBF) followed 24 h later by injection of 1×10<sup>3</sup>–1×10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFUs) of the Migula strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC# 25254), which are streptomycin-resistant. Third and fourth cohorts of mosquitoes were injected with dsEGFP or dsMIR RNA on day 1 followed by blood feeding on day 4 and injection with bacteria 24 h later as described above (BF-dsMIR). Mosquitoes were homogenized at 0, 3 or 24 h post-infection in 100 µl of BHI medium containing 50 µg/ml streptomycin, serially diluted and placed on BHI-streptomycin plates at 37°C for 18 h. The number of CFUs per individual was then determined (n = 5 females per treatment (BF, NBF, BF-dsEGFP, or BF-dsMIR), infection dose (1×10<sup>3</sup>–1×10<sup>5</sup>), and sample time (0, 3, 24 h) for a total of 180 individuals. We then compared the number of surviving bacteria per mosquito treatment and infection dose by Kruskal-Wallis tests. Other cohorts of BF and NBF mosquitoes treated as described above were maintained in cages (20 females per cage) with sugar water for 6 days post-infection. The number of mosquitoes surviving each day was then determined by counting the number of mosquitoes that died during the intervening 24 h period. The survival experiments were replicated three times using cohorts of 20 females per treatment and infection dose. To assess the effect of infection on mortality rates, we used the proportional hazards model where treatment and infection dose were the independent variables and the number of dead mosquitoes on each day was the dependent variable. All analyses were conducted using the JMP 7.0 statistical platform (SAS, Cary, NC).</p>

        <title>A higher proportion of hemocytes incorporate BrdU following blood feeding</title>
        <p>The increase in the number of hemocytes recovered from females after blood feeding could reflect either the entry of previously sessile hemocytes into circulation, an increase in the proportion of actively cycling hemocytes, or both. If events associated with blood feeding increase the number of actively cycling hemocytes, we reasoned that the proportion of hemocytes incorporating an exogenous DNA precursor like BrdU during S phase of the cell cycle should increase. We also reasoned <italic>A. aegypti</italic> should uptake BrdU by feeding since this approach has been successfully used to BrdU label proliferating cells in other insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Truman1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Gordon1">[31]</xref>. We therefore fed adult females sugar water containing BrdU and then compared the proportion of BrdU-labeled hemocytes in intact females 24 h pbm to females that we decapitated immediately after blood feeding. Examination of hemocytes by epifluorescence microscopy showed that feeding of BrdU resulted in strong nuclear labeling of some but not all hemocytes recovered from each female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g003">Fig. 3A–C</xref>). As with earlier experiments, we also recovered significantly more hemocytes from intact than decapitated BF females, which indicated that BrdU feeding did not alter the increase in hemocyte abundance that normally occurs after a blood meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, when we assessed the percentage of hemocytes with incorporated BrdU, our results showed that significantly more hemocytes from intact, BF females were BrdU-labeled than from decapitated, BF females, which suggested that blood feeding increased the proportion of actively cycling hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Based upon morphology, we further concluded that virtually all BrdU-labeled hemocytes (&gt;99%) were granulocytes.</p>

One cohort of females was pretreated with dsMIR RNA while another was treated with dsEGFP which served as both an RNAi and wounding control. Two other cohorts were left untreated. We blood fed on day 4 the dsMIR and dsEGFP-treated cohorts and one of the untreated cohorts followed 24 h later by infection of mosquitoes in each treatment with three different amounts of streptomycin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> (1×10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFUs). This resulted in the following treatments: BF, NBF, BF-dsEGFP injected, and BF-dsMIR injected. We then determined the number of surviving bacteria at 0, 3, and 24 h post-injection by homogenizing each mosquito and culturing the supernatant on streptomycin-containing BHI plates. Overall, the number of bacteria recovered per mosquito varied significantly among treatments, infection dose, and sample time (Kruskal-Wallis test: X<sup>2</sup> = 166.3; df = 35; P = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Focusing on the lowest infection dose (1×10<sup>3</sup> CFUs) and 24 h sampling time, our results indicated that bacterial survival varied significantly among treatments (X<sup>2</sup> = 11.0; df = 3; P = 0.012) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g005">Fig. 5A–D</xref>). Closer inspection of these data showed that clearance of bacteria by BF and BF-dsEGFP females did not differ from one another (X<sup>2</sup> = 0.01; df = 1; P = 0.9) while clearance of bacteria by NBF and BF-dsMIR females also did not differ (X<sup>2</sup> = 0.03; df = 1; P = 0.8). In contrast, BF and BF-dsEGFP females cleared significantly more bacteria than NBF and BF-dsMIR females (X<sup>2</sup> = 10.6; df = 1; P = 0.0012). Taken together, these results argued that increased production of hemocytes by BF and BF-dsEGFP females enhanced clearance of bacteria while pretreatment with dsMIR reduced hemocyte production and associated clearance of bacteria by BF females to similar levels as NBF females. These data also suggested that wounding at the time of dsRNA injection had no effect on the outcome of these assays. At the intermediate infection dose we tested (1×10<sup>4</sup> CFUs), the number of surviving bacteria after 24 h was also lower but no differences were detected among treatments (X<sup>2</sup> = 0.68; df = 3; P = 0.88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g005">Fig. 5E–H</xref>), while at the highest dose (1×10<sup>5</sup> CFUs) the number of surviving bacteria at 24 h had similarly increased in each treatment (X<sup>2</sup> = 3.8; df = 3; P = 0.29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g005">Fig. 5I–L</xref>). Inspection of hemocytes from mosquitoes across all treatments and infection doses showed that most granulocytes contained numerous internalized bacteria at both 3 and 24 h post-infection (data not presented). The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, however, also showed that no mosquitoes fully cleared the infection by 24 h at any of the three infection doses tested.</p>

Effect likelihood ratio tests confirmed, as expected, that death rate increased with infection dose (X<sup>2</sup> = 19.1; df = 1; P&lt;0.0001), but also showed that BF females died at higher rates than NBF females (X<sup>2</sup> = 11.3; df = 1; P&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Most studies of the mosquito immune system focus on defense responses following systemic infection with bacteria or consumption of a pathogen-infected blood meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Baton1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Lowenberger1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Bartholomay2">[33]</xref>. In <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, for example, bacterial infection of the hemocoel elicits a phagocytic response by hemocytes followed by inducible expression of antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Bartholomay1">[21]</xref>, while entry into the hemocoel from the gut by filarial nematodes activates cellular and melanotic defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Christensen1">[34]</xref>. In the malaria vector <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, passage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> to the hemolymph-bathed basal side of the midgut exposes the parasite to complement-like thioester-containing proteins from hemocytes that contribute to parasite killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Blandin1">[18]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection also damages the peritrophic matrix that surrounds the blood meal, resulting in commensal bacteria interacting with the midgut, which in turn stimulates constitutive and inducible defense responses against both bacteria and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rodrigues1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Huber1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Meister1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Far less is known about how mosquitoes invest in immune defenses in the absence of infection. We reasoned that the unique requirement of vector species to blood feed also creates a cyclical pattern of increased nutrient availability and infection risk that could favor cyclical investment in constitutive defenses like hemocytes. Our results support this hypothesis by showing that the number of hemocytes recovered from females increases 40% by 24 pbm. Our results further reveal a previously unrecognized role for the insulin signaling pathway in regulating the cellular arm of the mosquito immune system and synchronizing increased production of hemocytes with reproduction.</p>
      <p>The progressive, age-dependent decline in hemocyte abundance that occurs in the absence of blood feeding suggested to Hillyer and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer3">[13]</xref> that hemocytes do not proliferate in adult mosquitoes. However, our BrdU labeling experiments indicate that actively cycling hemocytes exist in both NBF and BF females, while the significant rise in BrdU-labeled hemocytes following a blood meal strongly suggests that increases in hemocyte abundance are due at least in part to proliferation of phagocytic granulocytes. The longer term priming experiments of Rodriguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rodrigues1">[24]</xref> suggest that granulocytes also proliferate in adult female <italic>A. gambiae</italic>. However, the average number of hemocytes per individual we and others recover from <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Castillo1">[15]</xref> is much lower than the number of hemocytes per mosquito reported by Rodriguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rodrigues1">[24]</xref>. Entry of sessile hemocytes into circulation could also contribute to the increase in hemocyte abundance after blood feeding given evidence that mobilization of sessile hemocytes can elevate the abundance of circulating hemocytes in other insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Mrkus1">[38]</xref>. Our use of an anticoagulant to collect hemocytes, however, reduces adhesion of mosquito hemocytes and likely enhances collection of both circulating and sessile cells. Thus, the increased numbers of hemocytes recovered from BF females is likely not due to NBF females containing more sessile hemocytes that we failed to recover.</p>
      <p>Unlike mammals, which produce both insulin and insulin-like growth factors that preferentially interact with different receptors, <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and other insects encode only a single receptor tyrosine kinase (IR) that functions as the receptor for multiple ILP family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Brown1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Wen1">[3]</xref>. Our own studies indicate that ILP3 exhibits both metabolic (insulin-like) and growth-promoting (insulin growth factor-like) activity in regard to regulating egg development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Brown1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Wen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-GuliaNuss1">[6]</xref>. Our finding during the current study that granulocytes and oenocytoids express the MIR is also consistent with the suggestion that mosquito hemocytes proliferate in direct response to ILP3. The ILP bombyxin has likewise been implicated in stimulating hemocyte proliferation in the silkmoth, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Nakahara1">[39]</xref>, while studies with mammals implicate insulin growth factor-like signaling in proliferation of lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Webster1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Nagatomo1">[42]</xref>. A recent study also implicates a cell surface protein designated crustacean hematopoietic factor (CHF) in survival of certain hemocyte types from the crayfish <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Lin1">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, CHF contains an insulin growth factor binding protein domain, but it remains unknown whether CHF interacts with any crustacean ILP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Lin1">[43]</xref>. The absence of MIR expression and failure to detect any BrdU labeling of prohemocytes suggests that the increases in granulocyte abundance that occur after blood feeding are likely due to proliferation of granulocytes themselves and not the differentiation of prohemocytes into granulocytes. It remains unclear whether prohemocytes proliferate during other life stages but overall the results of the current study do not provide any evidence that the circulating cells named prohemocytes in prior studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Castillo1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Baton1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rodrigues1">[24]</xref> have a progenitor function in adult <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.</p>
      <p>We recognize our in vivo experiments leave open the possibility that the effects of ILP3 on hemocyte proliferation could be indirect. That is, ILP-stimulated nutrient acquisition following blood feeding could be responsible for increased proliferation of hemocytes. Unfortunately, <italic>A. aegypti</italic> hemocytes are labile in primary culture and we currently are unable to maintain them for a long enough period to evaluate whether ILP3 directly stimulates proliferation in vitro. However, we do note that injection of ILP3 (50 pmol) into NBF females stimulates a significant increase in hemocyte abundance relative to NBF controls after 24 h (data not presented). This increase is smaller than the increase observed in decapitated BF females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), but these results strongly suggest that ILP3-stimulated proliferation of hemocytes is not solely due to increased availability of nutrients from digestion of the blood meal.</p>
      <p>In vertebrates, activation of nuclear hormone receptors by their steroid hormone ligands affects both adaptive and innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Webster1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Glass1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Chow1">[45]</xref>. Much less is known about the role of steroid hormones in regulating the insect immune system although 20E does up-regulate expression of a prophenoloxidase gene in an <italic>A. gambiae</italic> cell line of hemocyte origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Mller1">[46]</xref> and selected antimicrobial peptide genes in the S2 and mbn-2 cell lines from <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Silverman1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Flatt1">[48]</xref>. 20E also stimulates proliferation of mbn-2 cells and phagocytosis by <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Dimarcq1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Lanot1">[50]</xref>. As previously noted, release of ILP3 from the brain after blood feeding strongly upregulates the synthesis and release of 20E and other ECDs by the ovaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Brown1">[2]</xref>, which then interact with ILPs and TOR signaling to regulate the enzymes that digest the blood meal and yolk protein expression by the fat body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-GuliaNuss1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Attardo1">[7]</xref>. However, results of the current study indicate that 20E has no stimulatory effect on proliferation of hemocytes in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>.</p>
      <p>We anticipated that blood feeding would elevate resistance to at least some potential pathogens through an increase in the number of phagocytic granulocytes. We examined this possibility using <italic>E. coli</italic> because earlier studies showed that <italic>A. aegypti</italic> granulocytes readily phagocytize this bacterium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Castillo1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Baton1">[17]</xref>, while also showing that <italic>E. coli</italic> elicits a dose-dependent mortality response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer3">[13]</xref>. Consistent with expectations, our results indicate that BF females clear more bacteria than NBF females at the lowest level of infection (10<sup>3</sup> CFUs per female) we tested. Our results showing that pretreatment of BF females with dsMIR reduces bacterial clearance to NBF levels also supports the conclusion that enhanced clearance by BF females is due to increased numbers of granulocytes. No difference in clearance of bacteria was detected among treatments at higher levels of infection. However, this outcome was not entirely unexpected given that hemocyte abundance after blood feeding increases less than 2-fold but females were injected with 10 or 100-fold more bacteria. In effect, infection by 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> exceeded the phagocytic capacity of the granulocytes present in each treatment resulting in higher numbers of surviving bacteria after 24 h. Although Hillyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Hillyer3">[13]</xref> estimated that <italic>A. aegypti</italic> granulocytes can phagocytize more than 1000 <italic>E. coli</italic> per cell, they also detected levels of surviving bacteria 24 h and 5 days post-infection that are very similar to our results with NBF females suggesting substantial numbers of bacteria evaded phagocytosis in vivo when mosquitoes were infected with 10<sup>4</sup> or more cells.</p>
      <p>In contrast, we did not anticipate that NBF females would better survive intermediate and high levels of <italic>E. coli</italic> infection than BF females. When viewed together, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002274-g006">6</xref> indicate that blood feeding enhances resistance at the lowest level of infection we tested as measured by reduced survival of <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, at higher levels of initial infection blood feeding reduces tolerance to <italic>E. coli</italic> which is defined in the insect immunity literature as the ability to survive infection at a given pathogen load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Schneider1">[51]</xref>. Thus, while hemocytes clear substantial numbers of bacteria in the early stages of infection, surviving bacteria adversely affect the survival of BF females more than NBF females. Resistance and tolerance in insects have previously been shown to vary with host genotype and pathogen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-CorbyHarris1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Ayers1">[54]</xref>. Our results add to this literature by showing that resistance and tolerance to the same pathogen dramatically changes in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> as a consequence of blood meal digestion and/or mobilization of resources for reproduction.</p>
      <p>The mechanism(s) underlying reduced tolerance to <italic>E. coli</italic> in BF females remains unclear. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both bacterial infection and infection-independent activation of the Toll signaling pathway suppresses insulin signaling which reduces energy stores but enhances tolerance by potentially increasing investment in inducible defenses under Toll regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Dionne1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-DiAngelo1">[56]</xref>. While blood feeding activates insulin signaling and other processes related to yolk protein production in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Brown1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Attardo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Roy1">[8]</xref>, studies in <italic>A. gambiae</italic> indicate that the presence of Vg diminishes killing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rono1">[57]</xref>. Thus, our finding of diminished tolerance could reflect either the effects of bacterially induced NF-kB signaling, the effects of Vg interfering with killing of bacteria, or changes in allocation of nutritional resources that adversely impact tolerance. Interestingly, activation of NF-kB signaling following <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection also reduces Vg expression in <italic>A. gambiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Rono1">[57]</xref>, which in light of the aforementioned studies with <italic>Drosophila</italic> could reflect an indirect response mediated by reduced insulin signaling. A second possibility for reduced tolerance is that metabolism of vertebrate blood is both energetically expensive and generates toxic compounds like heme or ammonia that must be inactivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Zhou1">[58]</xref>. Recent findings by Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002274-Oliveira1">[59]</xref>, for example, show that blood meal-derived heme reduces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the midgut of <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, which normally regulates growth of gut microbiota but upon down regulation allows the gut microbiota to greatly increase in abundance. It is unlikely reduced ROS production in the midgut affected the systemic infection of the hemocoel we generated in our experiments. However, these results do suggest other processes related to tolerance could be adversely affected by processing the blood meal.</p>
