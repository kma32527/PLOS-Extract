        <p>The liver removes quickly the great bulk of virus circulating in blood, leaving only a small fraction to infect the host, in a manner characteristic of each virus. The scavenger cells of the liver sinusoids are implicated, but the mechanism is entirely unknown. Here we show, borrowing a mouse model of adenovirus clearance, that nearly all infused adenovirus is cleared by the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC). Using refined immunofluorescence microscopy techniques for distinguishing macrophages and endothelial cells in fixed liver, and identifying virus by two distinct physicochemical methods, we localized adenovirus 1 minute after infusion mainly to the LSEC (∼90%), finding ∼10% with Kupffer cells (KC) and none with hepatocytes. Electron microscopy confirmed our results. In contrast with much prior work claiming the main scavenger to be the KC, our results locate the clearance mechanism to the LSEC and identify this cell as a key site of antiviral activity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The liver has long been known as the garbage dump of the body, capable of rapidly removing hazardous pathogens and useless particles from the blood stream, thereby protecting the host. The only cell doing the removal has been thought to be the liver's macrophages. This is likely true for larger particles such as bacteria. But for smaller particles the size of virus or small antibody-antigen complexes, macrophages are probably not the cell responsible for the bulk of removal. We suggest, rather, it is the endothelial cell of the liver's blood circulatory system that takes up and destroys the majority of virus, doing so quickly (minutes) and extensively (&gt;90%), leaving only a small fraction of circulating virus to infect the body in ways peculiar to each virus. To test this possibility, we infused mice intravenously with a harmless common cold virus and tracked its destination by molecular and microscopy methods. Affirming our conjecture, we found that ∼90% of the infused virus homed to the endothelium of the liver and ∼10% went to its macrophages. These data support a unique role, generally underappreciated, for the liver endothelium in viral clearance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It has been known for more than 50 years that viruses of many sorts when injected into the blood stream of an animal are cleared with astonishing rapidity and efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mims1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mims2">[6]</xref>. Half-lives of decay on the order of 2–4 minutes are the rule; within 10 minutes &gt;90% of circulating virus has been cleared, and within an hour 99%. The phenomenon has been described for nearly all viruses tested; exceptions are rare. The liver, filtering one-third of the cardiac output, is the major organ of initial clearance. The cells implicated are the scavengers of the sinusoids, almost exclusively the Kupffer cell (KC). Cleared virus has been shown to be degraded and non-infectious. The small fraction of virus that escapes clearance is free to infect the host in a manner peculiar to each individual virus.</p>
      <p>Of the many viruses studied, one has received special attention. Workers using adenovirus as vectors for gene transfer for genetic vaccine and gene therapy have long known that while these vectors are effectively targeted to chosen tissues, the process is highly inefficient because most of the dose is cleared quickly by the liver. Effective countermeasures to clearance have been elusive, the usual strategies being to increase the dose, to bypass the liver circulation, and to modify the capsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Sack1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Barry1">[8]</xref>. The basic mechanism underlying rapid and efficient clearance remains unknown. Even the widely held conclusion that the sinusoidal KC is the operant scavenger is not solidly grounded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Brunner1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Zhang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Haisma1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Simon1">[10]</xref>. In fact, there are many reasons to suspect that the major sinusoidal scavenger is rather the sinusoidal endothelium (liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, LSEC) (see reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Smedsrod1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Elvevold1">[12]</xref>). LSEC are voracious scavengers, more numerous and voluminous than KC; they pinocytose rather than phagocytose, appropriate to taking up virus-sized particles; they contain abundant coated vesicles and lysosomes; and they display receptors for mannose, collagen, hyaluronan, IgG, and scavenger receptors but not complement receptors. An understanding of the basic mechanism underling immediate virus clearance would be of fundamental importance to our knowledge about the hepatic outpost of the immune system, viral pathophysiology and gene transfer vector biology.</p>
      <p>As the initial step in studying the viral clearance mechanism, we have undertaken to test whether, as is generally assumed, the KC is the major cell responsible for the rapid and efficient clearance of virus from the blood stream, or, as we suspect, that the long-overlooked LSEC is the major scavenger. Using the well-known mouse model of adenovirus clearance we document, employing two physicochemically different methods of virus detection, that adenovirus is rapidly and efficiently cleared, and with 4-color fluorescence confocal microscopy we show the virus to be localized chiefly to the LSEC and to a much lesser extent to the KC. We confirmed our results with electron microscopy.</p>

        <title>Clearance kinetics of recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) from blood</title>
        <p>Borrowing a simple mouse model for Ad5 clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Alemany1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Worgall1">[4]</xref>, we measured the rate of clearance of virus from mouse blood by infusing intravenously three different doses of replication-incompetent rAd5 and sampling retro-orbital blood periodically over 30 minutes, quantifying viral concentrations by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Estimating the rAd5 blood concentration at zero time as the dose divided by the blood volume, we plotted both the log (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> inset) and the mean percent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> full) of virus concentration vs time. We noted a rapid biexponential clearance (<italic>t</italic><sub>½</sub> 1 and 10 minutes) of virus from the bloodstream with ∼70% cleared in 5 minutes and &gt;90% in 20 minutes. Sampling blood frequently during the initial 5 minutes after infusion defined the steep first decay phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Clearance of Cy3-labeled rAd5 was more rapid and extensive (see M&amp;M). The decay rate was not different in antibody-deficient mice (Rag2 KO) suggesting that clearance was antibody-independent (not shown).</p>

The curve describes the mean percent of dose ± SD cleared over time using data averaged from all 3 administered doses as they were not statistically different. Since the blood concentrations of virus after all three doses decreased in a biphasic fashion, a biexponential decay model was employed to fit the viral concentration-time curves. The insert graph displays the log of blood virus concentration <italic>vs</italic> time for each of the 3 administered doses. Each data point represents mean ± SD of three mice. <bold>Panel B</bold>: Time course of blood virus concentration including “early time points” after the dose of 1.6×10<sup>10</sup> DRP. Mice of a separate cohort were used to characterize precisely the viral clearance during 0–5 min period. In order to generate a complete concentration-time profile of viral clearance up to 30 min, the concentrations at later time points (10, 20, and 30 min), previously obtained (Panel A insert, 1.6×10<sup>10</sup>), were normalized to the mean concentration at 5 min using the concentration-decay ratio among time points. The complete curve also followed a biexponential decay model. Each data point represents mean ± SD of three mice.</p>

        <title>Useful antibodies for identifying LSEC and KC in tissue sections</title>
        <p>Requiring for our study a precise and reliable method for distinguishing LSEC from KC by immunofluorescence in liver sections, we tested several antibodies to endothelial and macrophage markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002281-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002281.s003">Table S1</xref>). We found two antibodies that identified LSEC reliably. One was mab 2.4G2 anti-FcγRII/III/IV that identifies only FcγRII on these cells based on our observation that LSEC in liver sections from FcγRII-deficient mice showed no fluorescence with this antibody. A second antibody to this marker, anti-LY17.2, was also useful. The other reliable anti-LSEC antibody was rabbit anti-mannose receptor (MR), a result confirmed with a goat antibody to the MR cytoplasmic tail. These anti-LSEC antibodies bound Kupffer cells either very weakly or not at all. The traditional endothelial cell markers tested on LSEC were negative, weak, or inconsistent. It is noteworthy parenthetically that while antibody to the classical endothelial marker, CD31, gave only a very weak signal with LSEC of Balb/C mice in our studies and those of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-NakamuraIshizu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Knolle1">[14]</xref>, LSEC from a different strain of mice, C57BL/6, were brightly positive, as others have reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Huebert1">[15]</xref> and as has been seen in Sv/129 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Zellweger1">[16]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Colocalization studies on LSEC- and KC-distinguishing antibodies</title>
        <p>Colocalization studies using 2-color confocal immunofluorescence confirmed our choice of antibodies for identifying and distinguishing LSEC and KC. Identifying LSEC simultaneously with mab 2.4G2 (green) and anti-MR (red) gave largely coincidental sinusoidal patterns in green and red and in the merged image, although the cell-associated intensities of the two colors varied independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, top row of 4 images).

        <title>rAd5 localizes mainly in LSEC</title>
        <p>Having documented that nearly all blood-borne virus is cleared by the liver, we asked the whereabouts of liver rAd5 at 1 and 10 minutes after infusion, examining fixed liver sections by fluorescence confocal microscopy. rAd5 was detected either by the use of a rabbit anti-Ad5 antibody (red) applied to the liver sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) or by covalently tagging rAd5 with a Cy3 fluorophor (red) prior to infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). LSEC were tagged green with antibodies to FcγRIIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and MR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), while KC were marked with anti-F4/80 (magenta).

In all of these studies, at 1 minute after infusion we detected abundant virus, appearing as red fluorescent puncta with the sinusoids.

Data are graphed for both strategies for labeling virus, both Cy3-labeling (Cy3) and labeling with anti-Ad5 antibody (Ab). Two different markers identified both LSEC and KC. The table below the Fig illustrates that the 4 experiments were comparable by several parameters including relative fluorescence intensity scored RFI, numbers of mice used (mice), numbers of KC and sinusoid lumens scored (lumens), number of images examined, and the area of tissue examined microscopically (µm<sup>2</sup>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We interpret our data to indicate that in the mouse it is the LSEC and not the KC that clears the bulk of blood-borne human adenovirus. This conclusion is based first on our clearance studies documenting that &gt;90% of infused virus has disappeared from the blood within 20 minutes. Second, it is clear from our data and those of others that the liver is responsible for most of the rapid and extensive clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mims1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Brunner1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Worgall1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Zhang1">[5]</xref>.

Fourth, likely the virus was endocytosed and degraded by the LSEC and KC, as we detect very little Ad5 in the liver at 10 minutes. Others have noted similar rapid disappearance from liver of anti-virus activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mims1">[1]</xref> and Ad5 genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Worgall1">[4]</xref>, although it must be acknowledged that some minor portion of cleared virus may escape degradation to replicate or transcytose or be otherwise processed by the scavenging cell.</p>
      <p>Thus our data support the contention that the LSEC and not the KC is the major cell type involved in clearing adenovirus from blood during the early minutes after virus infusion. Early 20<sup>th</sup> century biologists who described the reticuloendothelial system (RES) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Aschoff1">[18]</xref> would have embraced our conclusion, for they appreciated that liver sinusoidal endothelium was vigorously endocytic. However, the predominant view of today favors the KC as the operant liver scavenger of virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Brunner1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Zhang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Haisma1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Simon1">[10]</xref>. A possible explanation for this historical change in thinking has been presented by Smedsrod and colleagues (reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Elvevold1">[12]</xref>): During the middle part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century most biologists dismissed the ‘endothelial’ portion of the RES. Rather, RES function was reconceptualized in terms of a system of mononuclear phagocytes (MPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-VanFurth1">[19]</xref>, the hallmark of which was the capacity to phagocytose. The KC, which pinocytosed but was most characteristically phagocytic, flourished as virtually the sole sinusoidal scavenger. The LSEC, highly pinocytic but incapable of phagocytosis, appeared to lose its consideration as a liver scavenger. Popular reviews and textbooks minimized LSEC scavenging in favor of KC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mims2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Fawcett1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Nathanson1">[21]</xref>. In the 1980s the Society and Journal of the RES were renamed the Society and Journal of Leukocyte Biology, events that we interpret as manifestations of this cultural shift in view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Stewart1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Only recently has the concept of sinusoidal scavenging been amended: Smedsrod and colleagues, using modern techniques to repeat the vital stain clearance studies of early 20<sup>th</sup> century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Kawai1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Wake1">[24]</xref>, demonstrated that LSEC pinocytose more vigorously than KC. These workers have suggested that the old term RES with respect to the liver be thought of functionally as the MPS (the KC) plus the LSEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Elvevold1">[12]</xref>. Our data showing vigorous adenovirus uptake by LSEC strongly support this renaissance of Aschoff's RES.</p>
      <p>Whether serum factors are required for clearance of rAd5, we know only that immunologically naïve animals were used and that clearance rate was unchanged in Rag2-deficient mice, which would indicate that antibodies were not required. Prior workers have not dealt with this issue systematically and those who have approached the question are at odds. One laboratory noted that Newcastle disease virus was cleared ten-times more rapidly when combined with antiserum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Brunner1">[2]</xref>, but another has shown that the half-life of SIV decay with antibody was virtually unchanged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Zhang1">[5]</xref>. The question of antibody-mediated clearance is especially relevant to our data because receptors for IgG (FcγRII) are abundant on LSEC and are known to take up immune complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Muro1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mousavi1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although all of the relevant studies on the clearance of blood-borne virus utilized the contrived modality of intravenous infusion (cited above), these data should nevertheless be applicable, one would infer, to the clearance of blood-borne virus during any viremic phase of a natural viral infection. Free virions during viremia should be cleared quickly and effectively by the liver just as when infused unless the clearance mechanism is modified by the adaptive immune system. What fraction of total blood-borne virus during a viremic episode of natural infection remains free of immune system modification has not been systematically studied, insofar as we can discern, and remains a worthy challenge. Thus, it appears currently impossible to estimate directly the magnitude of the ‘free virus’ clearance mechanism during the viremia of natural infection. Nevertheless, for these reasons it would seem desirable to explore the mechanism by which the liver clears blood-borne virus after intravenous infusion. The mechanism may yield new strategies for accelerating clearance for therapeutic purposes. Our data suggest that studies should begin with the LSEC.</p>
      <p>Beyond our conclusion that virus is being removed from blood largely by LSEC we can only infer the mechanism of clearance. Note that it is commonly thought that viruses are small enough to be pinocytosed, a process dedicated to small particles (&lt;0.2 µm), and do not require a phagocytic mechanism generally reserved for large particles (&gt;0.5 µm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Mellman1">[27]</xref>. The LSEC almost certainly are endocytosing by the process of pinocytosis, as they are well known to pinocytose vigorously, whereas they phagocytose larger particles only under unusual conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Elvevold1">[12]</xref>. Further we would suppose that KC, which are capable of both pinocytosis and phagocytosis, would be taking up virus by pinocytosis were the particles monodisperse, but the appearance of some clumped Cy3-virus in KC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002281-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) suggests that the labeling process may induce limited aggregation which by size alone would encourage phagocytosis by KC.</p>
      <p>Using the strategy described herein for showing LSEC uptake of virus we should be able to test the prediction that other small particles such as small immune complexes, nanoparticles, and others, are taken up in a like manner by the LSEC. Further, now that we have identified the virus-clearing cell, studies investigating the mechanism of clearance and the fate of endocytosed virus should readily follow.</p>

        <title>Preparation of recombinant Ad5 (rAd5)</title>
        <p>Recombinant adenoviral particles, E1 and E3 deleted Ad5.CMV.eGFP vector (Q-Biogene), were propagated and amplified in HEK 293 A cells (Microbix), cultured in Corning hyper flasks with 10% CCS DMEM. The cells were lysed after 72 hr or once they reached the maximum cytopathic effect by 4x freeze-thaw in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 25 units/ml Benzonase in TMN 200 buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 200 mM NaCl). Adenoviral particles from the supernatant were purified from defective viral particles using two CsCl density gradients. First, a discontinuous step gradient was prepared by loading 20 ml of the clarified viral lysate into a 34 ml polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube, underlaying with 6 ml of a 1.2 g/ml CsCl solution, followed by 8 ml of a 1.4 g/ml CsCl solution. Tubes were centrifuged in a SW28 rotor at 23,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C. The banded virus (∼3 ml) at the 1.2/1.4 g/ml CsCl interface was collected and transferred to a 13 ml ultracentrifuge tube, and approximately 10 ml of 1.35 g/ml CsCl solution added to completely fill the tube. An isopycnic gradient was generated using a NVT65 rotor at 60,000 rpm for 4 hours. The lowest bluish white band containing the purified infectious virus was collected and dialyzed over night against TMN 200 buffer with a minimum of 4 volume exchanges. The rAd5 viral particles were stored in TMN 200 containing 0.1 volume of 50% sucrose at −80°C.</p>

        <title>Titration of rAd5 vector</title>
        <p>The DNase resistant viral particle (DRP) rAd5 titer (measuring DNA containing viral particles) was determined by a method previously described for AAV particle titers by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Clark1">[28]</xref>. Briefly, the rAd5 DRP titers were determined by diluting the viral preparation 100-fold and digesting with DNase 1 (115 units/100 µl) in a Peltier Thermocycler PTC 2000 at 37°C for 30 min followed by 95°C for 10 min. This step removes unencapsidated viral DNA if present. DNase resistant particles were incubated with 10 µg proteinase K incubation at 50°C for 60 min followed by 20 min incubation at 95°C to inactivate Proteinase K. This step degrades the nuclease and viral capsid proteins exposing rAd5 genomic DNA for detection. Digested samples were then subjected to Taqman qPCR by diluting the samples 10 fold (final reaction volume of 25 µl) using Tagman master mix (Applied Biosystems) and the following adenovirus E2A gene primers and probe: E2A forward Primer-5′TTG CG<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">T CGG TGT TGG AGA T</named-content> 3′ (300 nM); Reverse primer- 5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CAA GGC CAA GAT CGT GAA GAA</named-content>; Tagman probe 5′ (6∼FAM) TGC<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple"> ACC ACA TTT CGG CCC CA</named-content> (TAMRA-Q) 3′ (150 nM). Concurrently, an adenovirus DNA plasmid standard curve (pHelp adenovirus plasmid containing E2A gene) was set up in triplicate using 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>10</sup> rAd5 genome equivalents. Tagman quantitative PCR assay was performed on the ABI PRISM Sequence Detector 7900HT (PerkinElmer) using Sequence Detector version 1.7 software. Reaction conditions were as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Fluorescence emission was plotted as a function of increase in reporter fluorescence (Δ R<sub>n</sub>) versus copy number. The data were analyzed using the default settings of the software for determining baseline and the threshold value. For every assay a standard curve for the primer set was generated and used by extrapolation to estimate the copy number of target sequences in unknown samples. As a general confirmation of the DNA containing DRP vector particle titer, purified rAd5 particles were lysed in lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA) and the optical density (OD) at 260 nm measured where an OD of 1 corresponds to 1.1×10<sup>12</sup> virus particles. As expected, the DRP and OD<sub>260</sub> titers of Ad5.CMV.eGFP vector were in general agreement (4.1×10<sup>12</sup> DRP/ml vs 1.4×10<sup>12</sup> VP/ml, respectively).</p>
        <p>Lastly, to confirm that the particles isolated by double CsCl banding were highly infectious, a TCID<sub>50</sub> infectious unit (IU) endpoint titration assay was performed. The high throughput method consists of detecting replicating rAd5 DNA using E2A qPCR following a 3 day infection of HEK 293 cells. Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of a rAd5 stock in replicates of 12 were prepared and used to infect 293 cells in a 96-well plate format. After a 72 hr incubation period, cells were directly lysed with a detergent buffer (1 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% DOC, 1% Tween 20, 0.1% SDS, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K) and sequentially incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, 55°C for 2 hr, and 95°C for 30 min. The plate was centrifuged briefly to clarify the crude cell lysate (2,000 rpm for 1 minute), and a 1∶4 dilution of the lysate in 1X Taqman PCR Buffer was prepared (this step dilutes out cellular PCR inhibitors). The diluted sample (2.5 ul) was then added to a standard 25 µlE2A qPCR reaction and Taqman E2A qPCR performed to detect the presence of rAd genomic DNA as described above. Genomic rAd5 copies are extrapolated from a plasmid DNA standard curve (pHelp plasmid), and total copies present in the well calculated as follows: total lysate volume per well is 185 µl and 2.5 µl of a 1∶4 lysate dilution was used in each PCR reaction (185/(2.5×0.25)  = 296). Coupled with a Limit of Detection (LOD) of 10 rAd5 genomic copies per qPCR reaction (based on the lowest standard on the curve), a minimum endpoint input value corresponds to 2,960 copies/lysate. Therefore at the assay endpoint of 1 infectious unit in an individual well, greater than 2,960 genomic copies/lysate are required to score the well as positive based on our assay sensitivity. Once scored, the data are then applied to the Karber equation to determine the TCID<sub>50</sub> of the sample. Significantly, the human Ad5 Reference Material (ARM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002281-Palmer1">[29]</xref> was used to qualify the assay; very good agreement between the published ARM IU titer and 96-well qPCR IU titer was obtained (7.0×10<sup>11</sup> IU/ml ARM vs. 8.2×10<sup>11</sup> IU/ml E2A qPCR method). Per the ATCC's Product Information Sheet for the Ad5 ARM (Cat. No. VR-1516), the IU titer on HEK 293 cells is 7.0×10<sup>10</sup> Normalized Infectious Units (NIU)/mL, with 95% certainty that the infectious titer on HEK 293 cells lies within the range of 7.0×10<sup>10</sup> to 8.0×10<sup>10</sup> NIU/mL. The average Ad5 ARM TCID<sub>50</sub> IU titer determined by us using the E2A qPCR method was 8.0×10<sup>10</sup> IU/ml (assay performed in duplicate). The IU titer of the Ad5.CMV.eGFP was determined to be 1.6×10<sup>12</sup> IU/ml using the TCID<sub>50</sub> assay method above, and this yielded a DRP to infectivity ratio of 2.6, indicative of a highly infectious rAd5 preparation. We acknowledge that the calculated IU titer is greater than the calculated OD<sub>260</sub> titer, which may reflect the inherent variability in all titration methods measuring single particle events, but note that all experiments use the DRP titer to calculate particle inputs.</p>

Briefly, the viral particles at a concentration of 10<sup>12</sup> DRP/ml in TMN 200 with sucrose were dialyzed overnight with 3 exchanges of PBS pH 7.4. The pH and the molarity of the viral particles in PBS 7.4 buffer was adjusted to 0.05 M sodium carbonate and pH 9.3 by diluting 1∶10 with 0.5 M sodium carbonate pH 9.3. The Cy3 dye was reconstituted with the viral particle solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped using 0.2% glycine and dialyzed against two changes of TMN 200 at 4°C over 16 hr. Adenoviral particles were stored in TMN 200 containing 1∶10 volume of 50% sucrose at −80°C until use. Cy3 dye concentration was determined by recording the absorbance at 552 nm and using the extinction coefficient provided by the manufacturer.

To quantify the relative proportion of virus associated with KC and LSEC we employed Image J software developed in JAVA, using a 3-step procedure. 1.

LSEC were identified as very thin gap-disrupted cells, thick at the nuclei, defining the sinusoidal lumens, overlying the space of Disse. KC were identified as cells in the sinusoidal lumens closely adhering to the LSEC surface.</p>
