        <p>Despite its relatively poor efficacy, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been used as a tuberculosis (TB) vaccine since its development in 1921. BCG induces robust T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses but, for many individuals, this is not sufficient for host resistance against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>) infection. Here we provide evidence that early secreted antigenic target protein 6 (ESAT-6), expressed by the virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> strain H37Rv but not by BCG, promotes vaccine-enhancing Th17 cell responses. These activities of ESAT-6 were dependent on TLR-2/MyD88 signalling and involved IL-6 and TGF-β production by dendritic cells. Thus, animals that were previously infected with H37Rv or recombinant BCG containing the RD1 region (BCG::RD1) exhibited improved protection upon re-challenge with virulent H37Rv compared with mice previously infected with BCG or RD1-deficient H37Rv (H37RvΔRD1). However, TLR-2 knockout (TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup>) animals neither showed Th17 responses nor exhibited improved protection in response to immunization with H37Rv. Furthermore, H37Rv and BCG::RD1 infection had little effect on the expression of the anti-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miR146a) in dendritic cells (DCs), whereas BCG and H37RvΔRD1 profoundly induced its expression in DCs. Consistent with these findings, ESAT-6 had no effect on miR146a expression in uninfected DCs, but dramatically inhibited its upregulation in BCG-infected or LPS-treated DCs. Collectively, our findings indicate that, in addition to Th1 immunity induced by BCG, RD1/ESAT-6-induced Th17 immune responses are essential for optimal vaccine efficacy.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Tuberculosis is a global health problem, with one-third of the global population infected with tubercle bacteria. Numerous studies have shown that Th1 cell responses are indispensable for protective immunity against TB. However, while the vaccine strain BCG induces sufficient Th1 cell response, this response does not appear to be sufficient for immune protection in many individuals. Here, we provide evidence for the first time that Th17 cell responses in the lung play a critical role for enhanced protection against TB. Surprisingly, the virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> strain H37Rv induced Th17 cell responses in the lung. Consequently, antibiotic-treated animals that were previously infected with H37Rv, as compared with similarly treated BCG-infected mice, generated improved protective immune responses against infection with virulent <italic>M. tb</italic>. We also provide evidence that the ESAT-6 protein, which is absent in BCG but present in H37Rv, induces IL-6 and TGF-β in dendritic cells in a TLR-2 and MyD88-dependent manner, which generates an environment that is conducive for the differentiation of Th17 cells in the lung. Our findings indicate that, in addition to Th1 cells, Th17 cells play a critical role in conferring optimal protection against TB.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem, with an estimated one third of the world's population infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</italic> the causative agent of TB, resulting in ∼3 million deaths annually. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only TB vaccine presently used in humans, has been widely used throughout the world since its inception in 1921, and an estimated 3 billion people have received it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Gupta1">[1]</xref>. However, its efficacy against pulmonary TB in adults is highly variable (0–80%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Colditz1">[2]</xref> and depends on ethnicity and geographical location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brewer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine2">[5]</xref>. The antigenic component(s) that is absent in BCG to elicit critical protective immune responses against TB has been an area of intense research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine2">[5]</xref>. Early secreted antigenic target protein 6 (ESAT-6) is one of the most prominent antigens expressed by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>), but not by BCG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brodin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Simeone1">[7]</xref>. ESAT-6-specific T cells are frequently found in TB patients as well as in infected animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brandt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ravn1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ulrichs1">[10]</xref>. Thus, ESAT-6 is being extensively studied for its potential activity as a subunit vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Dietrich1">[11]</xref>. T cell receptor transgenic T cells specific for ESAT-6 exhibit significant protection against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Gallegos1">[12]</xref>. Consistent with this, a recombinant BCG strain that contains region of difference 1 (RD1), which includes ESAT-6, exhibited improved protection against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pym1">[13]</xref>. However, the basis of this improved protection remains elusive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which ESAT-6 vaccination induces protective immune responses against TB remains to be investigated.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, deletion mutants of virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> strains for RD1 or ESAT-6 (a protein product of the RD1 region) resemble BCG in their infectivity and attenuation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lewis1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, these bacterial strains provide insight into the rational selection and design of suitable candidate vaccines for M. tb infection. It is clear that <bold><italic>v</italic></bold>accination with BCG produces Th1 cell-mediated immune responses, and this is moderately effective in protecting against disseminated TB and against meningitis in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Perera1">[15]</xref>. However, immune responses that are critical for protection against adult pulmonary TB remain incompletely understood. Recently, it has been shown that Th17 cell responses play an important role in establishing protective immune responses against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Khader1">[16]</xref>. However, Th17 cells do not contribute to the primary immune responses in tuberculosis infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Khader2">[17]</xref>. The antigen-specificity of protective Th17 cell responses in <italic>M. tb</italic> vaccination has not been reported. The differentiation of Th17 cells involves the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and TGF-β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Bettelli1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Mangan1">[19]</xref>. Earlier studies indicated that IL-6 production in DCs is regulated by microRNA-146a (miR146a) expression, which acts as a negative feedback regulator in TLR signalling by targeting IL-1R associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and TRAF6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Starczynowski1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Taganov1">[21]</xref>. miR146a inhibits the expression of IRAK-1 and TRAF6 and impairs NF-κB activity, which results in suppression of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Taganov1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Nahid1">[22]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that expression of miR146a is also upregulated in viral and bacterial diseases to modulate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Liu1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lu1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesised that miR146a might have a key role in <italic>M. tb</italic> infection by regulating IL-6 production.</p>
      <p>Here we show that H37Rv and recombinant BCG containing the RD1 region (BCG::RD1) induce improved vaccine efficacy compared with BCG and H37Rv deletion mutants for RD1 (H37RvΔRD1). The virulent strain H37Rv and BCG::RD1 induced both Th1 and Th17 cell responses, whereas BCG and H37RvΔRD1 induced only Th1 cell responses. Inhibition of IL-17 by neutralizing antibodies dramatically reduced the vaccine efficacy of H37Rv and BCG::RD1. H37Rv and BCG::RD1 induced IL-6 and TGF-β in DCs, which generated a microenvironment conducive to the differentiation of Th17 cells. In contrast, BCG and H37RvΔRD1 induced dramatically lower levels of IL-6 and TGF-β. Interestingly, production of both IL-6 and TGF-β in DCs induced by H37Rv and BCG::RD1 was dependent on the TLR-2/MyD88 signalling pathway. Furthermore, DCs infected with H37Rv or BCG::RD1 upregulated lower levels of miR146a compared with BCG and H37RvΔRD1, which differentially affected IL-6 production in infected DCs. Consistent with this, ESAT-6-treated DCs produced IL-6 and TGF-β in a TLR-2/MyD88-dependent manner, and facilitated the polarization of Th17 cell responses. miR146a expression in DCs was unaffected by ESAT-6 treatment and comparable to uninfected DCs, and ESAT-6 dramatically inhibited miR146a upregulation in BCG-infected or LPS-treated DCs. Therefore, these results indicate that interaction of ESAT-6 with TLR-2 generates a cytokine environment that facilitates the differentiation of Th17 cells, which in turn contributes to protection against TB.</p>

        <p>It is well accepted that Th1 cell responses are indispensable for host protection against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Flynn1">[25]</xref>. The vaccine strain BCG induces robust Th1 cell responses, yet it is not an effective vaccine against adult pulmonary TB in many individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brewer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine2">[5]</xref>. Therefore, additional immune response(s) are required for optimal vaccine efficacy. Recently, Th17 cells have been implicated in protective immunity against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Khader1">[16]</xref>. Previous studies have demonstrated that RD1, which is absent in BCG, plays a dominant role in protective immune responses and bacterial virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lewis1">[14]</xref>. Thus, an RD1 deletion mutant of H37Rv resembles BCG in its infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Simeone1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, we tested the virulence and cytokine production by virulent strain H37Rv and vaccine strain BCG. We challenged C57BL/6 mice with a low dose (∼110 CFU) of H37Rv or BCG by the aerosol route. We found that H37Rv and BCG replicated to a similar extent during the initial phase of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). However, at later time points, growth of BCG was gradually diminished (p&lt;0.032) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>), suggesting that adaptive immune responses play an important role in clearing BCG. After 21 days of infection, only a few bacilli were found in the lungs of animals infected with BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). These kinetics of BCG and H37Rv infection are in agreement with the published literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Flynn1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Glickman1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-GoterRobinson1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Kelly1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed significantly higher numbers of IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs of animals infected with H37Rv, as compared with BCG (p&lt;0.0001) <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In sharp contrast, both H37Rv and BCG induced IFN-γ in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B &amp; C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. This is further supported by the increased amounts of IL-17 produced in the BAL fluid of mice infected with H37Rv but not BCG (p&lt;0.0001) <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B &amp; C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Although significantly lower, BCG-infected animals produced some IL-17 in the BAL fluid <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. However, we were unable to detect IL-17-producing CD4<bold><italic><sup>+</sup></italic></bold> cells in the lung of BCG-infected animals <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, suggesting that the source of IL-17 in BCG-infected animals is not Th17 cells. It has been previously shown that γΔ T cells are the primary source of IL-17 in the lung during BCG infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Umemura1">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Consistent with the observation that H37Rv induces higher Th17 responses in the lung, we found significant levels of IL-6 (p&lt;0.001<bold><italic>)</italic></bold> and TGF-β (p&lt;0.001), two key cytokines required for the differentiation of Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Bettelli1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Mangan1">[19]</xref>, in the BAL fluid of animals infected with H37Rv <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In contrast, both H37Rv and BCG produced similar amounts of IL-12p40 <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, a cytokine that supports Th1 cell differentiation. These observations suggested that H37Rv creates an environment that is conducive to the differentiation of both Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas BCG promotes Th1 cell differentiation only. To investigate the molecular basis for the capacity of H37Rv to induce high levels of IL-6, we compared induction of microRNA-146a (miR146a), a negative regulator of innate immune components such as IL-6, in infected DCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Starczynowski1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Taganov1">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that BCG significantly upregulated miR146a in DCs as compared with H37Rv-infected DCs (p&lt;0.01) <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Furthermore, specific knock-down of miR146a expression dramatically upregulate both mRNA and protein level of IL-6 in BCG-infected DCs <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1E &amp; F</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. These data indicated that H37Rv promotes the differentiation of both Th1 and Th17 cell responses, whereas BCG induces Th1 responses but fails to support Th17 cell differentiation due to its induction of miR146a in infected cells. Nonetheless, a recent study indicated that BCG is unable to induce IL-17-producing cells during primary challenge but can do so after several rounds of challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Cruz1">[<bold>30</bold>]</xref>. Therefore, it is highly likely that repeated immunization with BCG induces IL-17 production by innate-like cells or recruits IL-17-producing cells to the lung due to the local chemokine milieu.</p>
        <p>Compared with virulent H37Rv, BCG possesses multiple deletion mutations. These mutations are called regions of difference (RD). Among these RD regions, RD1 is the most dominant and plays an important role in virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ganguly1">[31]</xref>. Thus, an RD1 deletion mutant of H37Rv resembles BCG in its infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lewis1">[14]</xref>. Within the RD1 region, the proteins ESAT-6 and CFP-10 have been shown to form a complex and participate in a type VII secretion system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brodin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Guinn1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, we tested the virulence and cytokine production induced by H37RvΔRD1. Consistent with the results obtained for BCG, we observed that H37RvΔRD1 initially grew to a similar extent as the parental H37Rv strain, but at later time points its growth gradually diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). Akin to BCG, H37RvΔRD1 failed to induce IL-17 production in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B &amp; C</bold></xref>). However, both strains induced similar quantities of IFN-γ <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B &amp; C</bold></xref><bold>).</bold> Furthermore, IL-12 production was comparable between these strains, whereas IL-6 and TGF-β production was dramatically reduced as compared with H37Rv <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. To provide further support for these findings, we performed similar experiments with the BCG recombinant strain in which the RD1 region was reintroduced (BCG::RD1). In agreement with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pym2">[33]</xref>, BCG::RD1 showed a dramatically higher virulence as compared with the parental BCG strain, but was comparable to H37Rv <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.

        <title>IL-17 induced by H37Rv or BCG::RD1 mediates improved vaccine efficacy</title>
        <p>Previously, it has been shown that IL-17 plays an important role in the secondary immune response following vaccination with virulent H37Rv <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Khader1">[16]</xref>. Thus, we examined whether IL-17 induced by virulent strains contributes to improved vaccine efficacy. For this purpose, we infected animals with H37Rv, BCG, H37RvΔRD1, or BCG::RD1 for 30 days. These animals were subsequently treated with antibiotics for four weeks, and then rested for an additional month. We could not find any detectable <italic>M. tb</italic> organisms in these animals. These mice were then challenged with H37Rv through aerosol infection. We found that animals previously infected with BCG or H37RvΔRD1 exhibited robust protective immunity compared with primary infection (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). Interestingly, we found that animals that were previously infected with H37Rv produced dramatically enhanced protective immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that virulent strains of <italic>M. tb</italic> H37Rv induce superior protective immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Jung1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Kamath1">[35]</xref>. However, the kinetics of host protective responses in our hand are somewhat different from these studies, which may be due to differential environmental factors in different geographical regions. In fact, it has been well documented that the efficacy of BCG in human vaccine trials dramatically varies depending on the geographical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brewer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Fine2">[5]</xref>). Nevertheless, we tested M. tb antigen-specific responses induced by randomly selected animals from our colony. We challenged splenocytes from sixteen animals with M. tb-derived complete soluble antigen (CSA) or the unrelated antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and measured lymphoproliferation. We observed that animals from our colony responded weakly to CSA, whereas no response was detected against OVA. Therefore, these animals were likely exposed to environmental organism(s) that share antigenic similarities with M. tb. As a positive control, we used spleen cells from CSA immunized mice, which showed dramatic proliferation against in vitro rechallenge with CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These observations might also be relevant to the variable vaccine response of BCG. In either case, our findings suggested that, while BCG and H37RvΔRD1 induced significant protective immunity against TB, this was not sufficient to confer complete protection against disease pathology. In contrast, H37Rv and BCG::RD1 induced improved protective immune responses. Collectively, these observations suggested that the RD1 region enhances protective immune responses. Importantly, we found that animals that were previously infected with H37Rv or BCG::RD1 induced significantly higher numbers of Th17 cells in the lungs than animals infected with BCG or H37RvΔRD1 (p&lt;0.001) <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Therefore, we tested whether IL-17 was responsible for the improved vaccine efficacy of H37Rv or BCG::RD1. For this purpose, we injected animals with anti-IL-17 or control mouse IgG antibodies every 72 hours during re-challenge with H37Rv or BCG::RD1. Treatment with anti-IL-17 abrogated the observed enhancement in protective immune responses induced by H37Rv or BCG::RD1 <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.

        <title>Dendritic cells infected with H37Rv or BCG::RD1 direct Th1 and Th17 cell responses, whereas BCG and H37RvΔRD1 selectively induce Th1 cell responses</title>
        <p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated that H37Rv induces Th17 cell differentiation. Therefore, to provide insight into the mechanism whereby H37Rv promotes Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation, we compared the cytokines induced by DCs (characterized with CD11c, CD11b, CD80, CD86, and MHC Class II markers <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>) infected with H37Rv, BCG::RD1, BCG, and H37RvΔRD1. We found that H37Rv- or BCG::RD1-infected DCs produced substantial amounts of IL-12p40, IL-6, and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). However, BCG and H37RvΔRD1 induced dramatically reduced amounts of IL-6 (p&lt;0.001) and TGF-β (p&lt;0.001) by DCs than H37Rv and BCG::RD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). Nevertheless, IL-12p40 was induced at comparable levels by all bacterial strains. Interestingly, we found that IL-6 and TGF-β production was dependent on TLR-2 and MyD88, whereas IL-12p40 production was independent of TLR-2 but required MyD88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). To determine whether these cytokines play a role in Th cell differentiation, we co-cultured ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from OT-II T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) animals with infected DCs in the presence of OVA peptide and collected supernatant to determine the production of IFN-γ and IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref>). The results, which were supported by intracellular cytokine staining, indicated that H37Rv-infected DCs directed the differentiation of both IL-17- and IFN-γ-producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref><bold> &amp; </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g004"><bold>4A</bold></xref>). In sharp contrast, DCs infected with BCG or H37RvΔRD1 supported only Th1 cell differentiation. While the levels of IFN-γ production were similar for DCs infected with H37Rv, BCG, H37RvΔRD1 or BCG::RD, production of IL-17 was significantly higher in DCs infected with H37Rv or BCG::RD1 as compared with cells infected with BCG or H37RvΔRD1 (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, it is known that IL-22 is also secreted by IL-17 producing Th cells and recent study suggested that IL-22 was upregulated during M. tb infection in rhesus macaques and protective in function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Zeng1">[36]</xref>.

        <p>Our findings indicated that ESAT-6 induces IL-6 and TGF-β production in DCs, which drives Th17 cell differentiation. Previous reports have suggested that ESAT-6 binds to TLR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pathak1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether TLR-2 is required for the capacity of ESAT-6 to induce IL-6 and TGF-β production. For this purpose, we compared cytokine production by DCs derived from wild type and TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found that DCs from TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were unable to produce IL-6 and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). To confirm that innate immune signalling is required for the capacity of ESAT-6 to induce IL-6 and TGF-β production in DCs, we performed experiments with DCs isolated from MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice. As expected, DCs from MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice were also unable to produce IL-6 and TGF-β in response to ESAT-6 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Interestingly, we observed that ESAT-6 dramatically inhibited miR146a expression in both LPS- and BCG-treated DCs <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Thus, ESAT-6 allows IL-6 production in DCs by inhibiting the induction of miR146a. Taken together, our findings indicated that IL-6 and TGF-β induced by ESAT-6 in DCs generate an environment that promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells.</p>
        <p>Next, we determined the capacity of DCs treated with H37RvΔRD1 to produce IL-6 and TGF-β. Our results clearly showed that neither H37RvΔRD1 nor BCG were able to induce IL-6 and TGF-β in DCs derived from either wild type, TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>, or MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). Interestingly, we found that the parental strain H37Rv, BCG::RD1, H37RvΔRD1 and BCG induced IL-12p40 production in DCs isolated from both wild type and TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, none of these strains induced IL-12p40 production in DCs derived from MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therefore, taken together, these observations suggested that ESAT-6 induces IL-6 and TGF-β production in a TLR-2-dependent manner. In contrast, production of IL-12p40 by DCs following infection with mycobacteria is independent of ESAT-6 and TLR-2 expression. However, IL-12p40 production induced by mycobacteria is dependent on MyD88 signalling.</p>

H37Rv-immunized TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice generated protective immunity against H37Rv at a level similar to wild-type mice immunized with BCG during primary challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>). However, TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited reduced protective immune responses as compared with wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>). H37RvΔRD1 and BCG::RD1 also showed reduced protection in TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002378-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold> similar to BCG and H37Rv. Other mycobacterial components, such as LAM and lipoproteins, can also activate TLR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Srivastava1">[39]</xref>. Therefore, the observed differences in protective immune responses in TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> animals could be caused by multiple TLR-2-dependent agonists. However, most of the <italic>M. tb</italic>-derived TLR-2 ligands induce only suppressive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Srivastava1">[39]</xref>. Therefore, the observed protective responses are most likely contributed by RD1-derived proteins. Furthermore, these differences are comparable with responses induced by H37Rv versus BCG in wild-type animals.</p>

        <p>Next, we analyzed effector T cells in the lungs. We found that TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> animals generated IFN-γ-producing cells comparable to wild type littermates.

      <p>It is well accepted that Th1 cells play a central role for protection against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ottenhoff1">[41]</xref>. Therefore, animals that are deficient in IFN-γ, IFN-γ receptor, Stat-4, T-bet, or IL-12 exhibit increased susceptibility to <italic>M. tb</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Flynn1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Cooper1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Cooper2">[43]</xref>. BCG induces a robust Th1 response, but this does not appear to be sufficient for optimal protection against challenge with virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Majlessi1">[44]</xref>. Abundant Th1 cell responses have been found in TB patients as well as <italic>M. tb</italic> infected animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Bhattacharyya1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Leal1">[46]</xref>. Thus, Th1 cells alone are not sufficient for protection against TB. Therefore, in addition to Th1 cell responses, a vaccine needs to induce additional Th cell response(s) to provide optimal protection against TB. Recently, it has been shown that Th17 cells play an important role in the secondary immune response against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Khader1">[16]</xref>. However, Th17 cells do not appear to participate in the primary immune response against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Khader2">[17]</xref>. Our findings clearly demonstrated that BCG and H37RvΔRD1 are unable to induce Th17 cell responses in the lung. Therefore, we considered the possibility that BCG lacks an antigen that drives Th17 cell differentiation and that such a response is required for optimal protection against TB. We observed that the virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> strain H37Rv and the engineered BCG::RD1 strain induced Th17 cell responses, which correlated with improved protection against re-infection and, thus, improved vaccine efficacy. This is in agreement with a previous report indicating that immunization with virulent <italic>M. tb</italic> H37Rv induces superior protective memory T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Jung1">[34]</xref>. However, unlike our results these authors found only 2–3 log differences in CFUs upon re-challenge with virulent H37Rv. This apparent discordance could be due to several differences in the experimental procedures employed. Jung et al. (2005) employed an extended (100 days) antibiotic treatment protocol, which may have influenced immune responses, and increased the age of the mice at re-challenge. Furthermore, these investigators rechallenged mice with a higher (two-fold) dose of bacteria. In addition, it is also possible that differences in the microflora in different animal facilities might contribute to these apparent differences. Indeed, our results demonstrated that unimmunized animals from our facility were able to respond to M. tb antigens, albeit weakly, suggesting that exposure to environmental organisms that share antigenic properties with M. tb might contribute to improved protection. This may explain the differential vaccine responses against BCG that have been observed in different geographical locations and in subjects from different ethnicities.</p>
      <p>Previous reports have suggested that ESAT-6, a protein within the RD1 region that is absent in BCG, is a promising vaccine candidate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brandt1">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, deletion mutants of H37Rv for RD1 resembled BCG in many aspects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brandt1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that the RD1 mutant of virulent H37Rv was unable to induce Th17 cell responses. BCG and H37RvΔRD1 were unable to induce persistent infection and, hence, the bacterial load declined much more rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lewis1">[14]</xref> over time as compared with H37Rv or BCG::RD1. Therefore, the observed differential Th1 and Th17 cell responses could be related to bacterial replication and antigenic load. However, previous reports indicated that BCG inhibits Th17 cell responses in lung and other organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lagranderie1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Lee1">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, primary infection with a high dose (2.5×10<sup>5</sup> CFU) of BCG by intratracheal injection was unable to induce IL-17 in the lung, until re-challenge with PPD-coated beads, and the cellular source of IL-17 produced in this situation is not known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ito1">[49]</xref>. Therefore, BCG alone, even at a high dose, is unable to induce Th17 cell responses. Nonetheless, a recent report indicated that BCG was unable to induce IL-17-producing cells in a primary challenge, however it did so upon repeated re-challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Cruz1">[30]</xref>. Although our study indicated that the RD1 recombinant strain exhibited an improved vaccine efficacy compared with the parental BCG strain, it does not exclude a role for other RD regions in inducing improved host protective immune responses. We found that H37Rv and BCG::RD1 induce both Th1 and Th17 cell responses that contribute to improved vaccine efficacy as compared with BCG, which selectively induces Th1 cell responses. Th17 cell responses are directed by IL-6 and TGF-β, derived from antigen presenting cells (APCs). Therefore, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) encoded within the RD1 region are likely responsible for inducing these two cytokines. Considering that ESAT-6 induces protective immune responses and that the RD1 mutant was unable to induce Th17 cell responses, we considered the possibility that ESAT-6 induces Th17 cell-polarizing cytokines in APCs. Therefore, we tested IL-6 and TGF-β production in DCs infected with the wild-type and RD1 mutant H37Rv strain. These studies revealed that the mutant strain induced significantly lower levels of IL-6 and TGF-β in DCs. Furthermore, our studies with miR146a, a negative regulator of innate immune components such as IL-6 in infected DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Taganov1">[21]</xref>, suggested that BCG and H37RvΔRD1 significantly upregulated miR146a in DCs as compared with H37Rv- or BCG::RD1-infected DCs or uninfected DCs. Consistent with these findings, knock-down of miR146a expression dramatically upregulated IL-6 production in BCG-infected DCs. Of note, however, our studies cannot exclude the possibility that, in addition to ESAT-6, other factors encoded within the RD1 region contribute to the enhanced vaccine efficacy of BCG::RD1.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have provided evidence that ESAT-6 directly binds to toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pathak1">[38]</xref>. This led us to investigate the capacity of DCs from TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> animals to produce Th17 cell-polarizing cytokines in response to ESAT-6 treatment. Indeed, we found that production of IL-6 and TGF-β was dependent on TLR-2. To further substantiate this observation, we performed experiments with DCs from MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> animals. Consistent with the results obtained with TLR-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, DCs from MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice were unable to produce IL-6 and TGF-β in response to ESAT-6 treatment. However, a previous report suggested that engagement of TLR-2 on macrophages by ESAT-6 inhibits LPS-induced cytokine production, especially IL-6 and IL-12p40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pathak1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, we revisited this issue for DCs. In our hands, we did not observe any influence of ESAT-6 on IL-12 production by DCs. However, ESAT-6 augmented IL-6 and TGF-β production by LPS-stimulated DCs. While the reasons for these discordant findings remain unknown, we speculate that the cell line used in the experiments by Pathak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pathak1">[38]</xref> might have already been tolerized by LPS, so that secondary stimulation with ESAT-6 resulted in even lower production of IL-6 due to higher steady-state miR146a levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Nahid1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been well-established that ESAT-6-specific T cells are prevalent in TB patients and in animal models of TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Brandt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ravn1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Ulrichs1">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, ESAT-6-reactive TCR Tg cells confer substantial protection against TB in an animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Gallegos1">[12]</xref>. In fact, it has been shown that ESAT-6 recombinant BCG provides protection against TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Pym1">[13]</xref>. However, the mechanism of ESAT-6-mediated protection has been unclear until now.</p>
      <p>One difference between mouse models and human infection with <italic>M. tb</italic> is that wild-type <italic>M. tb</italic> does not offer significant protection against reinfection in humans, despite containing ESAT-6 and other major antigens. This could be due to various reasons. First, there might be genetic differences between mice and humans that cause altered immune responses. Second, environmental exposures may alter protective immunity. Third, different individuals might respond differently to drugs used to treat TB and, thus, it is difficult to determine whether treatment was complete, while the remaining bacteria may cause secondary infection. Fourth, <italic>M. tb</italic> evolved many different types of immune evasion mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Flynn2">[50]</xref>. For example, we have recently shown that bacteria that are within granuloma-like structures are sequestered from host protective immune responses by mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002378-Raghuvanshi1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings indicate that, in addition to Th1 cells, Th17 cells play a critical role in conferring optimal protection against TB. The ESAT-6 protein, which is present in H37Rv and BCG::RD1 but not in BCG and H37RvΔRD1, directs Th17 cell differentiation by inducing IL-6 and TGF-β in DCs in a TLR-2- and MyD88-dependent manner. Therefore, ESAT-6 can contribute to vaccine preparations by promoting Th17 cell responses.</p>

Total RNA, including miRNAs was isolated by miRNAeasy isolation kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using BioRad Real-Time thermal cycler (BioRad, USA) and miRCURY LNA universal reverse transcriptase microRNA PCR SYBR green master mix (EXIQON, Denmark) for miRNA amplification and IQ BioRad SYBER green master mix (BioRad, USA) for IL-6 expression, respectively. cDNA was synthesized by the miRCURY LNA universal reverse transcriptase microRNA cDNA synthesis kit (EXIQON) and the reaction was set up according to the manufacturer's protocol. For amplification of miR146a, LNA PCR miR146a and reference 5S rRNA primer sets were used and the reaction was set up as recommended by EXIQON. The relative expression level of miRNAs was normalized to that of internal control 5S rRNA by using 2-ΔΔCt cycle threshold method. Furthermore, for amplification of IL-6 or IL-22, cDNA was synthesized by Omniscript RT kit (QIAGEN) using oligodT primers (Fermentas, Maryland, USA). For IL-6 mRNA expression analysis primer sequences were IL-6F, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGGAGTCACAGAAGGAGTGGCTAAG-3′</named-content> and IL-6R, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- TCTGACCACAGTGAGGAATGTCCAC-3′</named-content>, and control GAPDH-F, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- CGTCCCGTAGACAAAATGGT-3′</named-content> and GAPDH-R, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- TTGATGGCAACAATCTCCAC-3′</named-content> and for IL-22 mRNA expression analysis primer sequences were IL-22F <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GTGACGACCAGAACATCCAG-3′</named-content> and IL22R <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ATCTCTCCGCTCTCTCCAAG-3′</named-content>. Data were normalized by the level of GAPDH expression in samples as described above.</p>

        <title>Knock-down of miR146a using anti-miR146a</title>
        <p>For transfection of anti-miR146a and scramble control (EXIQON) into DCs, cells were transfected at day 4 of culture in antibiotic free media using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, UK) reagents and at day 5 cells were infected with H37Rv, H37RvΔRD1, BCG or BCG::RD1. After 24 hours of bacterial infection, cells were harvested for RNA preparation and analyzed for miR146a and IL-6 expression by quantitative real-time PCR as described above.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>All data were derived from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software and values were presented as mean±SD. Significant differences between the groups were determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (SPSS software). A value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted as an indication of statistical significance.</p>
