        <p>Small RNA viruses have evolved many mechanisms to increase the capacity of their short genomes. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel open reading frame (ORF4) encoded by the murine norovirus (MNV) subgenomic RNA, in an alternative reading frame overlapping the VP1 coding region. ORF4 is translated during virus infection and the resultant protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria. Using reverse genetics we demonstrated that expression of ORF4 is not required for virus replication in tissue culture but its loss results in a fitness cost since viruses lacking the ability to express ORF4 restore expression upon repeated passage in tissue culture. Functional analysis indicated that the protein produced from ORF4 antagonizes the innate immune response to infection by delaying the upregulation of a number of cellular genes activated by the innate pathway, including IFN-Beta. Apoptosis in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was also increased during virus infection in the absence of ORF4 expression. <italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of the WT and mutant virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 demonstrated an important role for ORF4 expression in infection and virulence. STAT1-/- mice infected with a virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 showed a delay in the onset of clinical signs when compared to mice infected with WT virus. Quantitative PCR and histopathological analysis of samples from these infected mice demonstrated that infection with a virus not expressing ORF4 results in a delayed infection in this system. In light of these findings we propose the name virulence factor 1, VF1 for this protein. The identification of VF1 represents the first characterization of an alternative open reading frame protein for the calicivirus family. The immune regulatory function of the MNV VF1 protein provide important perspectives for future research into norovirus biology and pathogenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>This report describes the identification and characterization of a novel protein of unknown function encoded by a mouse virus genetically similar to human noroviruses. This gene is unique to the mouse virus and occupies the same part of the genome that codes for the major capsid protein. The protein that we have described as virulence factor 1 (VF1) is found in all murine norovirus isolates, absent in all human strains but is indeed expressed during infection. Its expression enables MNV-1 to establish efficient infection of its natural host through interference with interferon-mediated response pathways and apoptosis. Our data would indicate that the VF1 protein is multi-functional with an ability to modulate the host's response to infection. Murine noroviruses are frequently used firstly as a model to study human norovirus replication and pathogenesis, studies hampered by their inability to replicate in cell culture. Secondly, persistent infection of laboratory animals with murine norovirus may affect other models of disease using experimental mice. The role of VF1 in infection and pathology in the differential outcome of infection is the source of continued research in our laboratory.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Collectively, the innate and adaptive immune systems result in a strong evolutionary pressure on pathogens to develop countermeasures to allow their continued existence. Therefore pathogens, including viruses, have evolved a multitude of mechanisms for evading the host response to infection, often by the expression of proteins that interfere with cellular antimicrobial response mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Richards1">[1]</xref>. The size of RNA virus genomes is thought to be limited by the error prone nature of the viral polymerase. As a likely direct consequence, RNA viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to increase the coding capacity of their genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Belshaw1">[2]</xref>. These include the use of ribosomal frameshifting where a proportion of translating ribosomes change the reading frame to produce proteins with common N-terminal but a different C-terminal from the read-through sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Brierley1">[3]</xref>. Many viruses have also evolved to use a mechanism that creates overlapping reading frames through the use of two or more transcription initiation sites or translation start codons within the same RNA sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Huang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-vanEyll1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Murine norovirus (MNV) was identified in 2003 as a virus that caused a lethal infection in immunocompromised mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Karst1">[6]</xref>. However, MNV is now known to be a widespread infectious agent of laboratory mice with a reported seroprevalence of 20-64% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Hsu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Muller1">[8]</xref>. MNV is currently the only norovirus which replicates efficiently in tissue culture, where it has a tropism for dendritic and macrophage cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Wobus1">[9]</xref>. The availability of immortalized macrophage cell lines such as the murine macrophage RAW264.7, has allowed significant advances to be made in understanding the life cycle of this virus. For the first time critical processes in the norovirus life cycle have been dissected e.g. the mechanism of tissue culture mediated attenuation of MNV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bailey1">[10]</xref> , the requirement for dynamin II and cholesterol during virus entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Gerondopoulos1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Perry1">[12]</xref>, the identification and functional requirement for RNA secondary structures in virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Simmonds1">[13]</xref> and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bailey2">[14]</xref> as well as the induction of apoptosis during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bok1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Furman1">[16]</xref>. In addition, MNV has allowed an unprecedented analysis of the immune response to norovirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-McCartney1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chachu1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Mumphrey1">[21]</xref>. This broadening in understanding of norovirus replication has been facilitated greatly by the development of murine norovirus reverse genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chaudhry1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Ward1">[23]</xref> and its recent optimisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Yunus1">[24]</xref>. The role of murine norovirus in potential exacerbation or complication of other diseases, especially murine models of infection, has also been investigated. This is certainly warranted given the seroprevalence of MNV in animal houses. Studies with models of Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Cadwell1">[25]</xref> or bacterial induced inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Lencioni1">[26]</xref> showed a significant impact of MNV and MNV infection prolongs the shedding of mouse parvovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Compton1">[27]</xref>. In contrast, MNV co-infection had little or no impact on murine CMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Doom1">[28]</xref>, Friend retrovirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Ammann1">[29]</xref> or models of diet induced obesity and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Paik1">[30]</xref>. These contrasts warrant further studies into the nature and mechanisms of interference observed in mouse models of disease. MNV has also provided a useful experimental system in determining the immune responses required for efficient norovirus vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chachu1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Liu1">[31]</xref>. Collectively, this highlights both the relevance of MNV as a significant infectious agent in its own right and also the utility of MNV as a model for human norovirus. Continued research into what differentiates murine and human noroviruses and how norovirus infection affects the host cell is therefore of upmost importance to both fields of research.</p>
      <p>Unlike other members of the <italic>Caliciviridae,</italic> which typically encode three open reading frames <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Karst1">[6]</xref>, our analysis and that presented during large scale sequencing of many MNV genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Thackray1">[32]</xref> indicates the presence of a fourth potential ORF in the MNV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) In this study we demonstrate that the protein encoded by ORF4 is expressed during virus infection, is not essential for virus replication in tissue culture but plays a role in viral virulence and therefore represents a novel viral virulence factor. Based on the findings that it possesses anti-innate immune activity, contribute towards the regulation of virus induced apoptosis during infection and modulates the outcome of experimental infection of mice, we have described the ORF4 gene product as virulence factor 1 (VF1). The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of norovirus avoidance of the innate immune response and norovirus pathobiology.</p>

        <p>The region of the genome encoding VF1 contains an intact reading frame in all available MNV sequences derived from different isolates or strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref> and data not shown). In contrast to the typical 8–15% sequence divergence seen between MNV variants in the amino acid sequences of ORF1, ORF3 and the predicted single coding region of ORF2, variability is markedly suppressed in the predicted ORF4 and double coding region of ORF2 (3%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002413-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Almost all sequence variability between MNV variants in the single coding regions (ORF1 and ORF3) occurs at synonymous sites. dN/dS ratios, namely the substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites, ranging between 0.03–0.10 are indicative of strong negative selection. In the double coding region of ORF2 (i.e. the region which codes for both VP1 and VF1), the restricted variability that is observed occurs at synonymous sites in the ORF2 reading frame (dN/dS: 0.044) consistent with stronger sequence constraints in the conventional reading frame encoding the MNV structural protein than in the ORF4 gene (dN/dS ≈ 2). However, the elevated ratio relative to that of ORF2 arose through greater suppression of synonymous variability in this reading frame, rather than increased amino acid sequence variability. dN values were 0.04 and 0.03 in ORF2 and ORF4 respectively.</p>

        <p>As well as suppressing variability, the existence of a second reading frame in ORF2 leads to altered codon usage by the ORF4/VF1 coding sequence. For example, there was a significant overrepresentation of the UUG triplet coding for Leu in ORF4 (15 from 33, compared to 17 from 128 in ORF1; p&lt;0.001 in a 6×2 contingency table for the 6 synonymous Leu codons), whereas there were no differences in Leu codon usage between ORFs 1, 2 (single coding region) and ORF3. The program MLOGD identifies overlapping coding sequences by specific codon usage signatures arising from mutational constraints consequent to the requirement to maintain protein function in two putative genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Firth1">[33]</xref>. The relative likelihood that a given sequence region is single-coding or double-coding was calculated using a codon usage table and nucleotide mutation and amino acid substitution matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This analysis provides independent support for the existence of ORF4/VF1, independent of its effect on sequence variability and evolutionary conservation. The first methionine codon in ORF4 at 5069 lies two residues downstream from a stop codon in that reading frame, and is 2 and 4 residues away from Met codons in ORF1 (including the -1 frameshift). The ORF4 start codon is in a strong Kozak context (G at +4 and -3) and likely represents the translation start site of VF1.</p>

        <p>To examine the expression of VF1 during MNV-1 replication in tissue culture, the well established RAW264.7 cell culture system for MNV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Wobus1">[9]</xref> was used and the production of VF1 analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

In contrast, the viral RNA polymerase NS7 was detected as early as 6 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Whilst we were unable to detect VF1 and VP2 prior to 9 hours, this may simply be a reflection of the sensitivity of the antisera used in the assay, but may also reflect the kinetics of viral sgRNA synthesis, as this is likely to occur after the initial rounds of viral genomic RNA synthesis. VF1 and VP2 expression levels observed over the course of the infection were also significantly different, with VF1 being expressed to a higher degree than VP2. Whilst this may be a reflection of the differences in the ability of the antisera to detect both proteins, it is known that VP2 synthesis requires translation re-initiation at the end of VP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Napthine1">[34]</xref> which is likely to produce reduced levels of VP2 relative to the other proteins expressed from the viral sgRNA.</p>

        <title>VF1 is not essential for MNV-1 replication in tissue culture</title>
        <p>To determine if VF1 was required for MNV-1 replication in tissue culture we used a recently developed reverse genetics system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chaudhry1">[22]</xref> to truncate the VF1 coding region at various positions. Three mutants were created containing single nucleotide changes that lead to the introduction of a stop codon in the VF1 coding region but which did not alter the VP1 coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3A</xref>): M1 containing the mutation T5118A truncating the VF1 protein at amino acid 16; M10 containing the mutation T5364A, truncating VF1 at amino acid 98; M20 containing the mutation G5655A, truncating VF1 at amino acid 195. All mutations were introduced at positions where it was possible to change the VF1 coding sequence without affecting the major capsid protein VP1. Single nucleotide substitutions were used due to the nature of the overlapping coding regions. The interruption of VF1/ORF4 was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> coupled transcription and translation of a PCR product encompassing the sgRNA of each mutant compared to wild-type MNV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). VF1 was readily detected after <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of the wild type sgRNA product as well as the sgRNA from the M20 mutant that encodes a C-terminally truncated form of VF1. VF1 was not detected after <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of the sgRNA from either the M1 or M10 VF1 truncations as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Recovery of wild-type and VF1 mutant viruses was performed using fowlpox mediated expression of T7 RNA polymerase to drive the synthesis of MNV-1 RNA in cells transfected with full length cDNA constructs of MNV-1 as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chaudhry1">[22]</xref>. As we have previously reported, the BHK cell line used during virus recovery, although permissive to virus replication, cannot be infected with MNV due to the lack of a suitable receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chaudhry1">[22]</xref>, therefore the yield of virus from this system represents a single round of virus replication only. The initial yields of VF1 knockout or truncation viruses were comparable to that derived from wild-type cDNA (∼1–5×10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> per 35mm dish, data not shown), indicative that VF1 was not required for virus replication in tissue culture. Western blot analysis of cells infected with the sequence verified M1, M10, M20 viruses confirmed that VF1 was not expressed in cells infected with either M1 or M10, but low levels of VF1 were observed in M20 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The levels of VP2 produced by the VF1 knockout viruses were comparable to the wild-type MNV-1 derived from cDNA, confirming comparative levels of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). It is possible that the truncation of VF1 in the mutant M20 results in some protein misfolding, decreasing the half-life of the resulting truncated protein. The growth kinetics of low passage, sequence verified M1, M10 and M20 viruses was examined by both single-step (data not shown) and multi-step growth curve analysis and were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type parental MNV-1 derived from cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that VF1 is not required for MNV-1 replication in tissue culture.</p>

Nucleotide numbers refer to the positions in the MNV-1 genome. The effect of the introduced nucleotide changes on the VF1 and VP1 protein sequences are also illustrated. Note that the mutations introduced in M1, M10 and M20 do not affect the coding sequence of the capsid protein VP1 but introduce a stop codon into VF1 at various positions. (B) Coupled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation reactions confirming the lack of VF1 expression in M1 and M10 viruses, with M20 producing a marginally shorter VF1 product. PCR products containing the subgenomic RNA region under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter were generated from cDNA constructs of either wild-type (WT), M1, M10 or M20 VF1 mutants and subsequently used for transcription and translation (TNT) <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of S35 methionine. Radioactively labeled proteins were subsequent resolved by SDS-PAGE, prior to exposure to film. VP1* represents a potential shorter VP1 product generated by translation initiation from an AUG initiation codon in-frame yet downstream from the authentic VP1 AUG. (C) Western blot analysis of RAW264.7 cells infected with low passage, sequence verified stocks of either wild-type (WT), M1, M10 or M20 VF1 mutant viruses. RAW264.7 cells were infected at a MOI 10 TCID<sub>50</sub> per cell and harvested 12 hours post infection, prior to separation by SDS-PAGE and western blot using either anti-VF1 or anti-VP2 antisera.

Cells were infected with a MOI of 0.01 TCID<sub>50</sub> per cell and samples harvested at various times post infection prior to titration on RAW264.7 cells. Virus yield is expressed as TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml. Infections were performed in triplicate, with the average virus titer and standard deviation plotted. (E) Sequence chromatograms of M1, M10 and M20 VF1 mutant viruses after passage 1 or 5 in RAW264.7 cells. Viruses obtained from passage 1 and 5 low multiplicity infections (MOI) of RAW264.7 cells were used to infect a subsequent monolayer at high MOI prior to RNA isolation, RT-PCR amplification of the region encompassing ORF4 and sequence analysis.

        <title>Lack of VF1 results in a ‘fitness cost’ in tissue culture</title>
        <p>The observation that all MNV isolates identified to date retain ORF4/VF1 and that repeated passage of wild-type virus in tissue culture does not result in the loss of VF1 (data not shown), indicates that although VF1 is not essential for virus replication in tissue culture, it confers some benefit to virus replication. To address this, we examined the stability of the mutations in the M1, M10 and M20 viruses following repeated low multiplicity of infection (0.01 TCID<sub>50</sub> per cell), multi-cycle replication in tissue culture. We observed that the mutations M1 and M10 were under negative selection in tissue culture whereas M20 was stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Sequence analysis of the virus population after 5 low multiplicity, multicycle passages in tissue culture, subsequent to the initial amplification after reverse genetics recovery, demonstrated that the M1 virus, which at passage 1 contained the mutation T5118A introducing a stop codon at position 17 in VF1, had introduced the mutation A5118G by the 5<sup>th</sup> additional passage, restoring full-length VF1 production by the insertion of a tryptophan residue. Analysis of the M10 virus population, which had the mutation T5364A at the first passage, also indicated that the population was heterogeneous and that in a proportion the VF1 open reading frame was restored by the introduction of the mutation A5364G. As with the M1 virus, this mutation is predicted to result in the introduction of a tryptophan at position 99. In contrast however, sequence analysis of the M20 virus after repeated multicycle passage in tissue culture demonstrated that the introduced mutation (G5655A) was in fact stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), which may indicate that the major functional domain lay within the 195 amino acids. Western blot analysis of cells infected with ‘passage 5’ stocks of M1 and M10 viruses indicated that, as expected from sequence analysis, VF1 expression was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), although the levels were notably lower than observed in WT infected cells. This reduced level may be in part due to the effect of the amino acid change on VF1 protein stability, but clearly for the M10 virus population the heterogeneous nature of the M10 virus stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) is likely a contributing factor. M20 virus stocks maintained the ability to express low levels VF1 as previously seen using the initial virus stocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3C and 3F</xref>). In all cases, the level of virus replication was similar as determined by the expression of the minor capsid protein VP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) and virus titre (data not shown).</p>

        <title>VF1 production affects mitochondrial-dependent innate immune signalling</title>
        <p>RNA viruses frequently encode proteins that antagonize the innate immune response to infection. Mitochondria play a significant role in signaling innate immune responses through the well characterized mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), an integral membrane protein found in the outer mitochondrial membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Seth1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Meylan1">[39]</xref>. MAVS is a key adapter protein in the sensing of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5 that, in part, leads to IRF3 and NFΚB activation and the upregulation of antiviral genes such as IFN-Beta, CXCL10 and ISG54 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Kawai1">[37]</xref>. Given the mitochondrial localization of VF1 in infected cells we assessed the activation of this sub-section of the innate immune response in both M1 and WT infected cells. RAW264.7 cells infected at a low MOI (0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub> per cell) with the M1 VF1 knockout virus exhibited a greater induction of antiviral genes such as ISG54, CXCL10 and IFN-Beta in response to viral infection than those infected with the WT virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Alterations to the levels of mRNA were calculated relative to uninfected cells using the standard ΔΔCT method with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) or actin (data not shown) mRNA levels used as endogenous controls. CXCL10, ISG54 and IFN-Beta mRNA levels were then normalized to the amount of viral RNA present in each sample in order to calculate the rate of induction of the innate immune response over time. This method of data normalization was also used to overcome variations often observed in the rate of virus replication seen in a variety of RAW264.7 cell clones (not shown). Normalizing the mRNA fold change to a constant amount of MNV RNA established that in all cases examined (CXCL10, ISG54 and IFN-Beta) the M1 infection causes a much more rapid induction of the innate immune response. For instance CXCL10 in M1 infected cells is induced 15.5 fold more quickly in response to the same amount of viral RNA than in WT infected cells. This value is calculated by comparing the slope/gradient for M1 and WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) which represents the rate of induction of each gene. Significantly, the IFN-Beta and ISG54 mRNAs are also activated more quickly, 4.6 and 8.3 fold respectively, in M1 infected cells compared to WT equivalents. Of note, the total fold increase in CXCL10, ISG54 and IFN-Beta mRNA induced in M1 infected cells was significantly higher than that observed in WT cells at both 20 and 24 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These time points, and the eight hour window from 16 to 24 hpi, reflect the period of amplification for innate immune related gene activation following low MOI MNV-1 infection of RAW264.7 cells, since quantification of mRNA fold change at 16 hpi showed little or no increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). The activation of the IFN-Beta mRNA in infected cells was also shown to correlate to increased protein production and secretion using ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The amount of IFN-Beta protein in the supernatants of infected RAW264.7 cells was significantly higher in M1 than WT infected cells at 24 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Protein production was again normalized to a constant level of viral RNA to demonstrate the relative response to WT and M1 replication.</p>

        <p>Treating cells with poly (I:C), and analysis of gene expression, confirmed the sensitivity of RAW264.7 cells to dsRNA over an equivalent time course. Induction of ISG54, CXCL10 and IFN-Beta was demonstrated in poly (I:C) treated cells confirming their suitability for the investigation of innate immune responses to RNA stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002413.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, UV inactivated M1 and WT virus showed no significant induction of ISG54, CXCL10 and IFN-Beta when used in equivalent experiments and compared to mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002413.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>This ability of VF1 to antagonize the innate immune response was confirmed independently of infection using an IFN-Beta promoter driven luciferase assay. Murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing firefly luciferase under the control of an IFN-Beta promoter as well as expression constructs for RIGI, MDA5, MAVS or TBK1 whose ectopic over-expression has been shown to drive IFN-Beta production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Mankouri1">[40]</xref>. In addition these cells were co-transfected with either the empty vector or a plasmid expressing the MNV-1 VF1 protein. Over-expression of RIG1, MDA5, MAVS and TBK1 in cells transfected with the IFN-Beta promoter driven reporter resulted in an expected increase in luciferase production in all cases. However, this induction was significantly reduced in all instances where VF1 was co-transfected in comparison to the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This indicates that VF1 in some way antagonizes the induction of IFN-Beta, correlating with the results observed in infected RAW264.7 cells.</p>

        <title>VF1 plays a role in controlling virus-induced apoptosis</title>

There was a notable alteration to the kinetics of viral protein production in the later stages of virus infection; whereas VP1 and NS7 levels continue to increase from 15 hours onwards in cells infected with WT MNV-1, the levels observed in cells infected with the M1 virus remained largely constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

        <p>The observed restoration of VF1 expression in the M1 and M10 viruses after repeated low multiplicity, multi-cycle replication in cell culture indicates that VF1 expression, although not essential for virus replication, confers some benefit to MNV-1 replication in cell culture.

As previously reported, no significant effect of MNV infection on weight loss was observed in this genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We also failed to detect robust levels of viral RNA in the small intestine, feces and spleen over the course of the experiment (data not shown). In contrast however, modest but significant levels of viral RNA were readily detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes of animals infected with WT MNV-1 at days 5 and 7 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

        <p>To examine if VF1 contributes to MNV virulence, the robust STAT1 -/- mouse model for MNV was utilized. However, in order to undertake these studies it was first necessary to generate VF1 mutant viruses in a cDNA backbone virulent in STAT1-/- mice. We have previously demonstrated that the single nucleotide mutation A5941G, changing glutamate 296 to lysine in the major capsid protein VP1, was sufficient to restore virulence to the tissue culture adapted strain of MNV-1, which is attenuated in STAT1-/- mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bailey1">[10]</xref>. The VF1 mutation M1 was generated in an MNV-1 cDNA clone bearing two mutations (G2151A and A5941G) as this sequence more faithfully represents the consensus sequence in viruses isolated from infected STAT1-/- mice [6,referred to as CW1.P1 in 10]. Initial analysis of the levels of virus obtained after reverse genetics recovery of the VF1 mutant virus M1 in the virulent backbone (referred to herein as M1-v), demonstrated identical levels to the wild-type virulent virus (WT-v) of approximately 1-5×10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml (data not shown). This suggests that, as observed in the attenuated background, VF1 expression is not essential for MNV-1 replication in the STAT1-/- virulent backbone. To further verify this, multi-cycle growth kinetics analysis of low passage, sequence verified, WT-v and M1-v viruses in RAW264.7 cells was performed confirming equivalent growth kinetics (data not shown).</p>

Oral inoculation of STAT1-/- mice with 1000 TCID<sub>50</sub> units of low passage, sequence verified, wild-type virulent MNV-1 derived from cDNA (WT-v) resulted in the appearance of clinical signs (sunken eyes, reduced appetite, hunched inactivity and piloerection) as early as three days post inoculation. This was followed by a rapid and statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) weight loss, when compared to animals inoculated with mock RAW264.7 cell lysate (day 4 onwards), and the development of more severe clinical signs culminating in significant weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g008">Figure 8</xref>). All WT-v infected mice succumbed to infection or were euthanized (because of disease severity limits being surpassed) by day 7 post infection. In stark contrast mice inoculated with the VF1 mutant virus (M1-v) showed a delayed onset of clinical signs.

Necrosis was evidenced by eosinophilia (dead cells staining bright pink) with pyknosis (nuclear condensation) and karryorrhexis (pyknotic nuclei become fragmented into several particles). Apoptosis was evidenced by cell rounding, a shrunken nucleus and in some cases cell fragmentation with some of the fragments containing apoptotic bodies. Blunting of the intestinal villi, as determined by measuring the villous height on the digital images taken at the same magnification and a comparison carried out on the mean of 8 villi, was apparent only in sections of the small intestine from animals infected with WT-v (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g010">Figure 10</xref>).

        <title>The M1-v virus does not revert during infection of STAT1-/- mice</title>
        <p>The delayed virulence of VF1 knockout viruses in STAT1-/- mice was suggestive of reversion during replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. To examine this possibility further, sequence analysis of the viral population from all tissues in two animals displaying the highest degree of clinical signs (and viral genomes determined by qRT-PCR) was undertaken. The animals analyzed are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g008">Figure 8B</xref> with a hash and asterisk indicating animals culled on days 5 and 7 respective. The animal culled on day 5 displayed similar disease onset to that of WT-v inoculated animals and had lost ∼12% of its initial body weight. The animal culled on day 7 for sequence analysis was removed from the study due to human end points being exceeded and had lost ∼7.6% of its initial body weight. Consensus sequence analysis, which under the conditions used could reproducibly detect reversion when ∼25% of the population had restored VF1, failed to detect any reversion in any of the tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002413.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In addition, tissues/samples containing the highest viral loads (4×10<sup>6</sup> to 4×10<sup>7</sup> copies per µg of RNA), namely the spleen and feces from the day 5 animal and the spleen from the day 7 animal, were PCR amplified and 10 individual clones sequenced. Of the 30 clones sequenced, none contained a mutation in VF1 that would lead to restoration of VF1 expression, further confirming the lack of detectable reversion upon replication a single pass in Stat1-/- mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Studies on numerous RNA viruses have identified the use of overlapping open reading frames to maximize the coding capacity of their small RNA genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Belshaw1">[2]</xref>. These ORFs and their proteins typically play accessory roles in the viral life cycle such as modulating the host immune response to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chen1">[43]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Conenello1">[45]</xref>. Frequently they dispensable for viral replication in immortalized cell lines; however, it is the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting that the true requirement for these proteins in the viral life cycle is apparent. This study indicates that MNV should now be added to the list of viruses that have adopted this strategy to maximize the coding potential of their genome.</p>
      <p>Initial bioinformatic investigation of MNV complete genome sequences identified a conserved ORF overlapping with ORF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1</xref>), potentially translated from the sgRNA produced during infection. Traditionally the sgRNA is thought to encode only the major and minor capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2. However suppression of variability in this region and conservation of the alternate ORF was shown to be absolute in all available MNV sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002413-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although the resultant full length protein, VF1, was recalcitrant to high level expression and poorly immunogenic, polyclonal antibody specific to this protein was generated and used to confirm expression during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The efficient translation of this protein was confirmed by immmunoprecipitation following translation of the sgRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>This is the first confirmation of the expression of an internal open reading frame protein for any member of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>. The internal open reading frame encoding VF1 can be found in all currently published MNV genome sequences, highlighting the requirement for this feature in the MNV genome. The evolutionary conservation of ORF4 coding sequences and the marked suppression of sequence variability localising specifically to the area of overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) provides evidence independent of the <italic>in vitro</italic> data for a functional requirement to maintain an intact ORF4 reading frame. As indicated by the analysis of leucine and other synonymous codon usage, this selection pressure was sufficiently strong to drive unfavoured codons into the ORF4 coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), a feature exploited by MLOGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Firth1">[33]</xref> to detect regions of multiple coding.</p>
      <p>There were considerable similarities in the arrangement and translation contexts of the ORF2 and ORF4 genes of MNV with documented regions of multiple coding in other viruses. The MNV ORF4 has an initiating AUG triplet at position 5069 in a strong Kozak context (G at -3 and +4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Kozak1">[46]</xref>. It is positioned 13 bases downstream from the first AUG triplet of ORF2 (weak context; U at -3, A at +4) and 7 from the second (adequate context; A at -3 and +4). This arrangement of initiating codons in the MNV sgRNA transcripts is similar to viral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Matsuda1">[47]</xref> and eukaryotic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Smith1">[48]</xref> dicistronic mRNAs in which alternative weak context initiating codons around an initiating codon in a strong context (ORF4 in MNV) can be accessed by random forwards and backwards movements of the ribosome from its initial binding site, termed "leaky scanning". In this case, this would require a backwards movement to the second AUG triplet of ORF2, remarkably similar to the documented dicistronic expression of p206 (strong context) and p69 (weak context 7 bases upstream) from genomic RNA of turnip yellow mosaic virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Matsuda1">[47]</xref>. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that noroviruses that lack ORF4 (genogroups 1–4) show a strong Kozak context around the second AUG triplet in ORF2 (A at -3, G at +4). The evolutionarily conserved nucleotide difference at position 5065 (+4) between MNV (A) and other noroviruses (G) may thus play a key enabling role in the hypothesised dicistronic expression of ORF4 and ORF2 by MNV.</p>
      <p>The juxtapositioning of ORF4 at the start of the sgRNA gives an indication of the additional evolutionary constraints that this ORF, and the respective protein, must be under. This region of the genome contains multiple conserved <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements that play an important role in the viral life cycle (unpublished observations). It is important to note however that the single nucleotide mutation introduced in this region to generate the M1 virus, did not affect the structure of these RNA elements as we have determined biochemically that nucleotide 5118 is positioned within a single-stranded region (data not shown). ORF4 also overlaps with the region of ORF2 that encodes the shell (S) domain of the major capsid protein, VP1. Dimerization of the S domain is thought to be integral for the development of the icosahedral core of the virus particle and is consequently the most conserved domain in VP1. As the S domain is buried inside the virus particle, it is unlikely to be under strong antibody selection pressure, unlike the more variable C terminus of VP1 which contains the protruding (P) domain. The contribution of all these factors is likely responsible for the low divergence observed between MNV VF1 sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002413-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Within the norovirus genus, ORF4/VF1 appears to be a feature unique to MNV as other noroviruses appear not to encode an equivalent open reading frame. The human noroviruses, which represent a significant cause of viral gastroenteritis in man, do not share the extensive suppression of synonymous site variability at the start of ORF2 that first indicated the presence of ORF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Simmonds1">[13]</xref>. Direct analysis of the available human norovirus sequences confirms that no such ORF exists (data not shown). A broader analysis of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family indicates the presence of an equivalent open reading frame in some strains of human sapoviruses (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Liu2">[49]</xref>. Although there is low sequence homology between the respective proteins (25% similarity, 18% identity) the presence of this alternative ORF indicates a potential conserved mechanism for maximizing coding potential. It is also possible that a common ancestor of all caliciviruses possessed an equivalent ORF, which has subsequently been lost in the case of the majority of caliciviruses. Although human noroviruses, as well as other members of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, lack an equivalent ORF4 within the VP1 coding region of the sgRNA, we cannot at this point rule out functional duplication i.e. that the functions of MNV VF1 have been duplicated in human noroviruses by one of the other viral proteins. Further studies are therefore warranted to determine if human noroviruses and other members of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> also possess the ability to modulate the innate immune response.</p>
      <p>The role of the VF1 protein in MNV-1 replication was examined using the permissive macrophage RAW264.7 cell line and the reverse genetics system developed previously in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chaudhry1">[22]</xref>. A series of VF1 truncations, generated by inserting stop codons into ORF4, which importantly left the VP1 coding sequence unaltered, confirmed this protein was a classical viral accessory protein not required for replication. However, repetitive multicycle, low multiplicity of infection passage in the permissive RAW264.7 cell line resulted in a phenotypic reversion for the more severe truncations (M1 and M10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3</xref>), demonstrating that VF1 expression and function benefits virus replication in cell culture. Whilst this observation was reproducible, it was clear that rapid phenotypic reversion did not occur as virus stocks generated by reverse genetics and subsequently amplified in cell culture by a single passage maintained the introduced mutations. The phenotypic reversion observed was the likely result of the multicycle nature of the infections as very low multiplicity of infections were used, resulting in multiple rounds of virus replication to occur in each pass in cell culture.</p>
      <p>As the ‘powerhouses’ of the eukaryotic cell, viruses often modulate the function of mitochondria to maintain an intracellular environment beneficial for viral replication. The mitochondrial localization of VF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g004">Figure 4</xref>) together with its apparent modulation of innate immune signaling and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g006">6</xref>) indicates that this protein may function, like so many other viral proteins, to facilitate viral replication and antagonize anti-viral mechanisms adopted by the cell. The beneficial functions of VF1 expression, e.g. delayed apoptosis and innate immune responses in infected cells, are apparent since analysis of VP1 protein levels produced during infection are clearly reduced at the later stages of infection in the absence of VF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Surprisingly this does not appear to affect the final yield of virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) or the levels of viral RNA produced during replication in RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). The RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line is extremely permissive to infection and it is likely that the total pool of available VP1 protein in the M1 infected cells later in infection does not limit virion production. Of relevance is our observation that the IRF3 modulated gene ISG54, also known as IFIT2 or p54, is significantly upregulated in cells infected with a virus lacking VF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The ISG54 protein (p54 or IFIT2) functions to repress cellular translation by binding and inhibiting the cellular eIF3c protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Terenzi1">[50]</xref>. Previous work has indicated that norovirus translation initiation may require the eIF3 complex via a direct interaction of VPg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Daughenbaugh1">[51]</xref>. The expression of the MNV VF1 protein may therefore delay or block the ISG54 mediated inhibition of cellular and viral VPg-dependent translation by preventing the induction of ISG54 mRNA at the point of mitochondrial mediated activation of the innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Daughenbaugh1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Goodfellow1">[53]</xref>. ISG54 expression has also been linked to apoptosis induced via the mitochondrial pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Stawowczyk1">[54]</xref>, again in agreement with our observed increase in apoptosis in the absence of VF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g006">Figure 6</xref>). It is possible therefore that the increased apoptosis observed during virus replication in the absence of VF1 expression is as a result of the increased induction of the innate immune response.</p>
      <p>It is well established that MNV is sensitive to an effective innate immune response: type I and II interferon are known to inhibit viral translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Changotra1">[20]</xref>, a fact supported by the observed sensitivity of STAT1-/- mice to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Karst1">[6]</xref>. The role of STAT1 mediated, interferon-based, innate immune signaling in combating MNV-1 infection has been well characterized to prevent the progression of MNV-1 infection and dissemination to peripheral tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Mumphrey2">[42]</xref>. We also observed this effect in our studies with immunocompetent C56BL/6 mice as only low levels of viral RNA were detected in the MLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Previous work has also highlighted that at least part of the innate sensing of MNV infection by the host cell can be attributed to the MDA5 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-McCartney1">[17]</xref>. When activated, MDA5 signals the detection of viral RNA through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) adapter protein (also known as IPS-1, VISA or Cardif) embedded in the outer membrane of this organelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Seth1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Xu1">[38]</xref>. One downstream consequence of these signaling events at the mitochondria is the dimerisation and subsequent nuclear shuttling of IRF3. This activation of IRF3 results in the trans-activation of genes responsible for combating viral infection including interferon beta. In our studies, the regulation of genes specifically stimulated by virus infection was monitored by qPCR and ELISA and shown to be elevated in cells infected with a virus lacking the VF1 accessory protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This potential role for VF1 as an antagonist of the innate immune response was investigated using co-expression studies with various auto-stimulatory components of this pathway which, after transient over-expression, are known to trigger interferon production (such as RIG-I, MAVS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In this instance, VF1 was shown to reduce the expression of a reporter protein under the direct transcriptional control of the interferon beta promoter. This occurred at the level of, or subsequent to TBK1 activation, since its stimulation of the IFN promoter was also inhibited by VF1 expression. The mechanism of action of VF1 therefore potentially involves modulation of the interaction of TBK1 with IRF3, or directly acts on IRF3 itself. Inhibition or degradation of IRF-3 is a frequent target of viral evasion strategies among both RNA and DNA viruses, including the Npro protein of pestviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Hilton1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Ruggli1">[56]</xref>, the P protein of rabies virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Brzozka1">[57]</xref> and the G1 protein of hantaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Alff1">[58]</xref>. Mitochondria also serve as a platform for the activation of IRF3 via TBK1 as the mitochondrial import protein Tom70, interacts with MAVS upon RNA virus infection and subsequently recruits the TBK1-IRF3 complex via Hsp90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Liu3">[59]</xref>. The interaction of Tom70 with cytosolic chaperone Hsp90, which is itself constitutively associated with TBK1 and IRF3, plays a critical role in the activation of IRF3. Therefore another possible mechanism of VF1 function may be via the modification of the mitochondrial activation pathway or the formation of the MAVS-Tom70-Hsp90 complex.</p>
      <p>The role of VF1 during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection was initially examined in a wild type immunocompetent mouse background. However, the strain of MNV-1 used during these studies and the only strain for which a reverse genetics system is currently available, namely CW1, is attenuated in this model, failing to produce any obvious clinical signs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g007">Figure 7</xref>). It is worth noting however that this variant of MNV-1, although attenuated in STAT1-/- mice due to a glutamate at position 296 in the major capsid protein VP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bailey1">[10]</xref>, is actually more representative MNV isolates from immunocompetent mice as they typically also contain glutamate at position 296 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Thackray1">[32]</xref>. Using this variant of MNV-1 CW1 in this genetic background we observed viral RNA in the mesenteric lymph node at 5 and 7 days post infection with WT MNV-1 but not when animals were infected with a virus lacking VF1. These data add further strength to our hypothesis that VF1 expression is beneficial to virus replication as it delays the innate immune response and as a consequence, virus induced apoptosis. To examine the role of VF1 in MNV-1 virulence, the M1 VF1 truncation was first engineered into the virulent MNV-1 backbone, previously described by our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bailey1">[10]</xref>. This virus, which represents the closest available progenitor of the original isolate of MNV identified in 2003, causes a lethal infection in STAT1-/- mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Karst1">[6]</xref>. Typically, one might expect to observe a restoration of virulence after infection of STAT1-/- mice with a virus that lacks an interferon antagonist, in this case VF1. One of the best-studied examples of this is in influenza virus where the lack of NS1 has no effect on virulence in STAT1-/- mice but in immunocompetent mice a deletion of NS1 results in attenuation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-GarciaSastre1">[60]</xref>. However, In the case of the MNV-1 studies undertaken here, the <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses are complicated by the already attenuated nature of the strain used (CW1) in an immunocompetent host. Infection of STAT1-/- mice with either 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of WT-v or M1v demonstrated that MNV-1 lacking VF1 was partially attenuated in this system exhibiting delayed replication kinetics in the murine host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g010">10</xref>). This manifested as a delay in both the onset of typical MNV-1 disease and the associated presentation of symptoms (weight loss, piloerection, anorexia, eye discharge that subsequently develop to ataxia, moribundity and death). Quantification of the viral RNA genomes in infected tissues at days 3 and 5 post infection, as well as the gross differences in MNV-1 related pathology at day 5 are testament to the debilitated replicative ability of this virus <italic>in vivo</italic> even in the absence of STAT1. The exact mechanism of this attenuation is unclear since all the inoculated animals (M1-v or WT-v) eventually developed disease and either succumbed to infection or had to be euthanized due to the established humane end points being surpassed. Detailed analysis of the function of VF1 in the avoidance of the innate immune response <italic>in vivo</italic> is likely to require the development of a reverse genetics system for a MNV variant capable of infecting immunocompetent mice. In the absence of this however, we are able to offer at least one possible explanation as to why we observed clinical disease in the STAT1-/- model even in the absence of VF1. In STAT1-/- mice, the absence of an intact STAT1-dependent interferon response pathway prevents the generation of robust autocrine and paracrine interferon responses. There are however many examples of virus infection leading to the induction of host genes classically defined as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the absence of interferon and/or STAT1 mediated signalling; examples include LCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Wacher1">[61]</xref> where the induction of ISG-49, ISG-54, and ISG-56 was observed in the absence of STAT1, and also HSV-1 which elicits an IRF3-dependent, but IFN-independent cellular antiviral response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Paladino1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Collins1">[64]</xref>. Direct IRF3 mediated responses are also known to protect against West Nile virus infection in both interferon dependent and independent mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Daffis1">[65]</xref>. In addition, recent studies have highlighted that STAT2-mediated signalling may stimulate the expression of a subset of ISGs in the absence of STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Perry2">[66]</xref>. Therefore we would propose that during our studies in the STAT1-/- mouse model, it is likely that infection with the virus lacking VF1 leads to the induction of a subset of ISGs during virus replication at the primary site of infection, either directly via an unknown mechanism, or via STAT2. This limited response may slow virus replication, resulting in the delayed virus replication at the initial site of infection, reduced virus production and delayed onset of disease, all consistent with our observations. We would predict however that this limited response is not sufficient to clear virus after multiple rounds of infection. Our preliminary analysis would confirm that infection of STAT1-/- mice with virulent WT MNV-1, can result in the induction of ISGs, even in the absence of STAT1, as we observed increased levels of CXCL10 and ISG54 at 3 days post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002413.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The mechanism of ISG induction in the absence of STAT1-mediated signalling and how VF1 contributes to virulence in the absence of STAT1 will require further studies.</p>
      <p>Expression of accessory proteins from alternate open reading frames can be found in many RNA viruses, many of which parallel the ability of VF1 to antagonize the innate immune system (discussed in more detail below). Many negative strand RNA viruses from the <italic>Paramyxovirus</italic> genus encode alternative proteins from internal ORFs in the phosphoprotein mRNA. These proteins, denoted C, play multiple roles in the viral life cycle that include the facilitation of RNA replication and control of the innate-immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Ramachandran1">[67]</xref>. Sendai and measles virus mutants lacking C are viable in tissue culture but partially attenuated <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Patterson1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Garcin1">[69]</xref>. This inability to replicate as efficiently as the wild-type virus <italic>in vivo</italic> is comparable to the observed results in this study for MNV-1 VF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g010">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>The influenza protein PB1-F2, another viral protein produced from an alternate open reading frame, provides additional evidence for the role of these accessory proteins in disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chen1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Coleman1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Zamarin1">[70]</xref>. PB1-F2 is a recently discovered virulence factor, encoded by the PB1 gene segment, which interacts with mitochondria and stimulates apoptosis by facilitating cytochrome c release via interactions with ANT3 and VDAC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Conenello2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-McAuley1">[72]</xref>. In addition PB1-F2 has been shown to affect influenza polymerase activity in the nucleus, modulate interferon responses during infection and, interestingly, to exacerbate secondary bacterial infections <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Conenello2">[71]</xref>. Despite the mitochondrial interactions of PB1-F2, it is unlikely that VF1 functions in an analogous manner since apoptosis was exacerbated in cells infected with a virus lacking VF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A recent report demonstrates a link between the innate immune response and apoptosis suggesting that both MAVS and IRF3 may play direct roles in stimulating apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Lei1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Chattopadhyay1">[74]</xref>. ISG54 expression is also known to induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Stawowczyk1">[54]</xref>. It is possible that this exacerbation of apoptosis, in the absence of VF1, is a by-product of enhanced activation of the innate immune response in cells infected with the M1 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g006">6</xref>) or an as yet uncharacterized direct or indirect modification of MAVS function by VF1. Interestingly, the HCV NS3/4A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Foy1">[75]</xref> and SARS-CoV NSP15 protein have been shown to be inhibitors of MAVS mediated apoptosis, identifying these proteins as potential orthologs of VF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Lei1">[73]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Other potential ARFP proteins have also recently been shown to associate with the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Ratinier1">[76]</xref> as has the L* protein of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Sorgeloos1">[77]</xref>. L* is only encoded by the TO subgroup of TMEV viruses where it is required for growth in macrophages and has been implicated in the establishment of persistence and the demyelination associated with TMEV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-TakanoMaruyama1">[78]</xref>. This macrophage specific requirement for L* is paralleled, albeit to a lesser degree, for MNV VF1. In our study the M1 and M10 knockout viruses phenotypically reverted upon repeated, low multiplicity, multy cycle replication in the RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line, highlighting that VF1 expression and function confers some benefit to MNV growth in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002413-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). This benefit is the likely combination of the observed increase in apoptosis and innate immune signalling observed in cells infected with a virus lacking the VF1 protein.</p>
      <p>Numerous other examples of viral proteins that interact with the mitochondria during infection include the HBV X gene protein whose interactions are thought to stimulate apoptosis and play a role in the development of cancer in affected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Koike1">[79]</xref>, the HCMV UL37 protein which is thought to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and apoptosis at the mitochondrial ER synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Williamson1">[80]</xref>, as well as three hepatitis virus proteases that have been shown to cleave MAVS (Hepatitis A, B and C), the adapter for RIG1 and MDA5 signaling, thereby antagonizing the innate immune response to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002413-Bellecave1">[81]</xref>. Given the critical role that mitochondria play in cellular responses to infection and stress e.g. innate immune signaling, calcium homeostasis and regulation of apoptosis, it is maybe not surprising that so many viruses target this organelle.</p>
      <p>Our studies have demonstrated that MNV-1 encodes a novel virulence factor from an alternate open reading frame in the sgRNA. This protein localizes to the mitochondria during infection and apparently inhibits the signaling events that take place in and around this organelle during infection of the host cell. This appears to affect the downstream activation of genes regulated by mitochondrial arm of the innate immune response and also the development of apoptosis in response to infection. A mutant virus lacking the ability to express VF1 does not replicate as efficiently in immuncompetent or STAT1-/- mice, which manifests as a delayed onset in the development of disease. However this does not protect the mice from developing serious disease highlighting the sensitivity of this specific model. The role of VF1 in the establishment of persistent MNV infection as well as the exact nature of VF1 interaction with the mitochondria and the mechanism by which this interaction modulates the function of this organelle is the subject of continued research in our laboratory. The identification and preliminary characterization of the MNV-1 VF1 protein provides a unique perspective on this widely used model pathogen and may provide additional insights into the mechanism of norovirus evasion of the immune system.</p>
