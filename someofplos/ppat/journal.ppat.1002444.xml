        <p>Clinical strains of HCMV encode 20 putative ORFs within a region of the genome termed UL<italic>b</italic>′ that are postulated to encode functions related to persistence or immune evasion. We have previously identified UL<italic>b</italic>′-encoded pUL138 as necessary, but not sufficient, for HCMV latency in CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) infected <italic>in vitro</italic>. pUL138 is encoded on polycistronic transcripts that also encode 3 additional proteins, pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136, collectively comprising the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus. This work represents the first characterization of these proteins and identifies a role for this locus in infection. Similar to pUL138, pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 are integral membrane proteins that partially co-localized with pUL138 in the Golgi during productive infection in fibroblasts. As expected of UL<italic>b</italic>′ sequences, the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus was dispensable for replication in cultured fibroblasts. In CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, this locus suppressed viral replication in HPCs, an activity attributable to both pUL133 and pUL138. Strikingly, the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus was required for efficient replication in endothelial cells. The association of this locus with three context-dependent phenotypes suggests an exciting role for the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in modulating the outcome of viral infection in different contexts of infection. Differential profiles of protein expression from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus correlated with the cell-type dependent phenotypes associated with this locus. We extended our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to analyze viral replication and dissemination in a NOD-<italic>scid</italic> IL2Rγ<sub>c</sub><sup>null</sup>-humanized mouse model. The <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> virus exhibited an increased capacity for replication and/or dissemination following stem cell mobilization relative to the wild-type virus, suggesting an important role in viral persistence and spread in the host. As pUL133, pUL135, pUL136, and pUL138 are conserved in virus strains infecting higher order primates, but not lower order mammals, the functions encoded likely represent host-specific viral adaptations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Human cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that, like all herpesviruses, establishes a life long relationship with its host through a latent infection. The molecular basis of viral latency is poorly understood, in part, because viral determinants of latency and the corresponding virus-host interactions are not well defined. We have identified a polycistronic locus encoding the pUL138 latency determinant, as well as three previously uncharacterized proteins, pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136. We have characterized this novel locus, the proteins it encodes and demonstrated the role of the locus in modulating viral replication depending on the context of infection. While this locus is dispensable for productive replication in fibroblasts, it adversely impacts virus replication in primary hematopoietic cells, suggesting a role in establishing latency. Surprisingly, the locus is required for efficient replication in primary human endothelial cells. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a viral locus that can have positive, negative, or null effects on viral replication depending on the context of infection. Our work defines exciting new primate strain-specific determinants mediating viral replication and latency and exemplifies the complex nature of virus-host interactions in cytomegalovirus infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the β-herpesvirus subfamily that, like all herpesviruses, persists indefinitely in infected individuals through a latent infection. HCMV persistence is associated with an increased risk of age-related pathologies including atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Horvath1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Streblow1">[2]</xref>, immune senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Moss1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Brunner1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Pawelec1">[5]</xref> and frailty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-High1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Schmaltz1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Wang1">[8]</xref> in otherwise healthy individuals. Reactivation of HCMV from latency in individuals with compromised T cell immunity, including transplant and AIDS patients, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Boeckh1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Huang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Kedhar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Mocarski1">[12]</xref>. Further, HCMV is the leading cause of infectious disease-related birth defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Mocarski1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Arvin1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Syggelou1">[14]</xref>. The mechanisms controlling the outcome of infection, and in particular the latent infection, in the diverse cell types infected by HCMV in the human host are poorly understood. Understanding these mechanisms is essential to ultimately controlling the overt viral pathologies in individuals with weakened or insufficient T cell-mediated immunity as well as non-overt pathologies associated with viral persistence.</p>
      <p>Clinical isolates of HCMV uniformly contain a unique region of the genome, termed UL<italic>b</italic>′, that encodes 20 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Cha1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Dolan1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Murphy1">[17]</xref>. While the actual coding potential is known for only a few UL<italic>b</italic>′ ORFs, these ORFs are considered dispensable for viral replication in laboratory models such as fibroblasts since laboratory-adapted strains of the virus lacking the entire UL<italic>b</italic>′ region replicate with increased kinetics and to increased viral yields relative to clinical strains. As such, it is postulated that UL<italic>b</italic>′ ORFs function in latency, immune evasion, virus dissemination in the host, or other aspects of pathogenesis. We have previously identified sequences in the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region of the HCMV genome encoding the <italic>UL138</italic> protein (pUL138) that are required for a latent infection in CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) infected <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Goodrum1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. Disruption of the <italic>UL138</italic> coding sequence (cds) results in a virus that replicates with increased efficiency relative to the wild-type virus in HPCs in the absence of a reactivation stimulus. While disruption of <italic>UL138</italic> ablates the latent phenotype, a more robust loss of latency phenotype results from the disruption of additional UL<italic>b</italic>′ sequences around and including the <italic>UL138</italic> locus, indicating that other viral sequences in addition to <italic>UL138</italic> contribute to the outcome of infection in HPCs. The mechanism by which pUL138 functions in viral latency is unknown; however, it has recently been reported that the pUL138 enhances levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Le1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Montag1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have recently reported that <italic>UL138</italic> is part of a larger 3.6-kb polycistronic locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. pUL138 is expressed from the 3′ end of three overlapping transcripts (3.6-, 2.7-, and 1.4-kb) by both canonical and stress-inducible alternative mechanisms of translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. These transcripts encode three additional putative ORFs, <italic>UL133</italic>, <italic>UL135</italic>, and <italic>UL136</italic> upstream of <italic>UL138</italic>. We detected proteins derived from these ORFs during transient expression of <italic>UL138</italic> cDNAs, as well as during HCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. This locus may serve to coordinate the expression of pUL133, pUL135, pUL136 and pUL138 for a common function in dictating the outcome of infection in the cell.</p>
      <p>The present study represents an initial characterization of the unique HCMV genetic locus encoding <italic>UL133</italic>, <italic>UL135</italic>, <italic>UL136,</italic> and <italic>UL138</italic>, the proteins expressed from this locus, and the role of the locus in infection. We collectively refer to this locus as the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus. pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 are previously uncharacterized proteins. Like pUL138, pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 were expressed early during productive infection and ultimately localized to the Golgi apparatus. These proteins were each associated with the Golgi as integral membrane proteins with large C-terminal cytosolic domains. Despite localization to the Golgi, pUL133, pUL135, pUL136, and pUL138 were only partially co-localized. We hypothesized that the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus functions in mediating context-dependent outcomes of infection. As would be expected for UL<italic>b</italic>′ sequences, the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus was dispensable for viral replication in primary fibroblasts. We demonstrate that like <italic>UL138</italic>, the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus or <italic>UL133</italic> alone impeded replication in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, consistent with a role for the encoded proteins in latency. Surprisingly, the locus augmented replication in endothelial cells. The disparate cell-type dependent phenotypes associated with the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus correlated with differential profiles of expression from the locus in endothelial and CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs. While all four proteins were expressed in fibroblasts, we fail to detect pUL136 in endothelial cells and do not detect pUL135 or pUL136 in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs. Further, the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> virus exhibited an increased capacity for replication and/or dissemination in a NOD-<italic>scid</italic> IL2Rγ<sub>c</sub><sup>null</sup>-humanized mouse model following stem cell mobilization relative to the wild-type virus, further suggesting an important role for the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in latency and reactivation. The role of individual proteins encoded by this locus in infection and latency awaits further investigation. These proteins likely represent virus adaptations to higher order primates acquired through co-speciation as the protein sequences are conserved in chimpanzee CMV (ChCMV) and to some extent in rhesus CMV (RhCMV), but are not present in CMV strains infecting lower vertebrates. Our work defines a novel locus that underscores the complexity of the virus-host interactions governing HCMV replication.</p>

        <p>We have previously demonstrated the coding potential of <italic>UL133</italic>, <italic>UL135</italic> and <italic>UL136</italic> within the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region of the HCMV genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 are encoded by three polycistronic transcripts of 3.6-kb, 2.7-kb and 1.4-kb, respectively, which also encode pUL138, an established determinant of HCMV latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. The expression of the transcripts is sensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis, but not to inhibition of viral DNA synthesis, indicating early kinetics of expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. In the present study, we have characterized the expression and localization of these novel proteins as well as identified a role for this novel locus in infection.</p>
        <p>To aid in the analyses of pUL133, pUL135, pUL136, and pUL138, we constructed a series of recombinant viruses in the BAC clones of the FIX strain of CMV. We inserted the myc epitope tag in-frame at the 3′ terminus of each ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting viruses are termed FIX-UL133<sub>myc</sub>, FIX-UL135<sub>myc</sub>, FIX-UL136<sub>myc</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>, and FIX-UL138<sub>myc</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. The kinetics of productive viral replication in primary human embryonic fibroblasts (MRC5) infected with each of these viruses or the parental strain, FIX-WT, were measured by TCID<sub>50</sub> over a time course. Despite variation in the eclipse phase, the recombinant viruses containing epitope tags replicated with kinetics and to yields reflecting that of the wild-type virus in MRC5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1B and S</xref>1). The differences between the viral yields are not significant. The analogous recombinant viruses were also made in the TB40E strain of HCMV. TB40E viruses also replicated with wild-type kinetics similar to the FIX viruses.</p>

        <p>To analyze the kinetics of pUL133, pUL135, pUL136, and pUL138 expression, MRC5 cells were infected with FIX-UL136<sub>myc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) or TB40E-UL136<sub>myc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. FIX-UL136<sub>myc</sub> was used in these experiments to aid in the detection of pUL136 because this protein is expressed at low levels in infected cells and we have not been able to generate an adequate UL136-specific antibody. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody specific to the myc epitope tag to evaluate pUL136 or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against pUL133, pUL135 or pUL138 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. pUL133 and pUL135 have an apparent molecular mass of 39- and 43-kDa, respectively. Similar to pUL138, pUL133 and pUL135 were expressed by 12 hours post infection (hpi). pUL133 and pUL138 were expressed throughout the time course of 120 hpi, while pUL135 expression tapered off dramatically at 84 hpi. Multiple isoforms of pUL136 were detected at 37-kDa, 27-kDa, and 20-kDa, termed pUL136-37K, pUL136-27K, and pUL136-20K, respectively. An additional minor isoform was detected at 24-kDa. The 27K and 20K isoforms of pUL136 are predominantly expressed by 12 hpi and persist throughout the time course of infection. pUL136-37k exhibited slightly delayed kinetics of expression and was detected robustly at 36 hpi. Further studies are required to determine the origins of the pUL136 isoforms. Presumably, full-length pUL136 is derived from the 3.6- and 2.7-kb transcripts encoding <italic>UL138</italic>. We previously detected at least one smaller pUL136 isoform expressed from the 1.4-kb <italic>UL138</italic> transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. The relative ratios of the pUL136 isoforms differ in the TB40E infection relative to the FIX expression. This difference was consistently observed in multiple experiments; however, the reason for this difference is not known. The dynamic expression of pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 from the <italic>UL138</italic> transcripts and their expression patterns are intriguing and may have important implications for their function during infection.</p>

        <title>pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 localize to the Golgi apparatus</title>
        <p>We previously determined that pUL138 localized to the Golgi apparatus during infection or transient expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. To determine the subcellular localization of pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136, we infected MRC5 fibroblasts with FIX-UL133<sub>myc</sub>, FIX-UL135<sub>myc</sub>, or FIX-UL136<sub>myc</sub> at an MOI of 2 and analyzed the subcellular distribution of each protein at 24 and 48 hpi by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody specific to the myc epitope tag. Cells were co-stained with an antibody against the Golgi marker GM130 and with DAPI to identify the nucleus. Cells infected with FIX-UL138<sub>myc</sub> were used as a reference.</p>
        <p>By 48 hours post infection, each protein accumulated in the Golgi similarly to pUL138<sub>myc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002">Figure 2</xref>). pUL136<sub>myc</sub> resembled pUL138 in that pUL136<sub>myc</sub> was Golgi associated at both 24 and 48 hpi. FIX-or TB40E-UL136<sub>myc</sub> express myc-tagged versions of all pUL136 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>); however, these forms cannot be differentiated in these experiments. pUL133<sub>myc</sub> and pUL135<sub>myc</sub> exhibited more diffused cellular staining at 24 hpi with predominant localization to the Golgi by 48 hpi.</p>

        <title>pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 are integral membrane proteins</title>
        <p>Similar to pUL138, pUL133, pUL135, and the full-length pUL136 isoform(s) are predicted to have amino terminal transmembrane (TM) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The TM domains predicted for pUL135 and pUL136 span the membrane once, whereas pUL133 has two predicted membrane spanning domains. We investigated the membrane association of these proteins by analyzing crude membrane preparations from MRC5 cells either uninfected or infected with FIX-UL136<sub>myc</sub> at an MOI of 1. Cells were treated with cycloheximide 4 hours prior to harvest to allow newly synthesized proteins to traffic to their resident compartments. 3K and 12K fractions contain cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes, respectively, whereas the 25K and 100K pellet fractions contain lighter vesicles and microsomal membranes. The 100K supernatant contains soluble proteins. Proteins were detected in each fraction using the myc antibody to detect pUL136 or polyclonal antibodies to each HCMV protein. The major histocompatability complex I (MHC I) protein was analyzed as a control using a monoclonal antibody. Similar to pUL138, pUL133 and pUL135 were concentrated in the 25K and 100K pellets indicating their association with lighter microsomal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This data is consistent with the localization of these proteins to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002">Figure 2</xref>). pUL133, pUL135 and pUL138 also accumulated in the 3K pellet representing heavier membranes. This broad distribution may reflect trafficking of these proteins through the secretory pathway and is similar to the distribution of MHC I.</p>

        <p>pUL136-20K was predominantly associated with the 100K supernatant, suggesting that this is a cytosolic protein. Consistent with this finding, we have previously demonstrated that smaller truncated forms of pUL136 are expressed from the 1.4-kb <italic>UL138</italic> transcript, which begins 300 nucleotides downstream of the full-length <italic>UL136</italic> start codon and lacks a predicted TM domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. The pUL136-27K protein was associated with the 25- and 100-K pellets as observed for pUL133, pUL135, and pUL138, suggesting that this protein contains the N-terminal portion of the protein, including the transmembrane domain. The predicted molecular mass of the full-length pUL136 protein based on amino acid sequence is 27-kDa. Intriguingly, we did not detect pUL136-37k in experiments with a cycloheximide chase. This may be due to the low abundance and/or the narrow window of expression of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Alternatively, this result may be due to the rapid turnover of the protein or the sensitivity of a modification resulting in the 37-kDa mass to cycloheximide treatment.</p>
        <p>The predicted TM domains for pUL133, pUL135, and full length pUL136 are in the N-terminus of each protein, as is the case for pUL138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In order to determine if pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136-27k are integral membrane proteins, we treated 25k microsomal membrane fractions with buffer containing 100mM sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which is typically used to disrupt protein-protein interactions without affecting protein-lipid interactions. Following salt extraction, the pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies as described for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. pUL133, pUL135 and pUL136-27k were resistant to Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> extraction and recovered exclusively in the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that these proteins are integral membrane proteins similar to pUL138 and MHC I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To determine the orientation of pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 in membranes, 25k microsomal membrane fractions from cells infected with FIX-UL136<sub>myc</sub> were treated with proteinase K in the presence or absence of 1% Triton-X100. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3B</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Approximately 50% of MHC I was digested by proteinase K under native conditions to yield a lower molecular mass band as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Pischel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Stam1">[24]</xref>. MHC I was completely converted to the lower molecular mass form in the presence of detergent. As previously reported, pUL138 associated with microsomal membranes was efficiently digested (60–90%) in the absence of detergent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. Similarly, proteinase K treatment of microsomal membranes resulted in efficient digestion of pUL133 (60–90%), pUL135 (80–90%), and pUL136 (95–100%) in the absence of detergent as observed in four independent experiments. The predicted N-terminal position of the TM domains for each of these proteins and the near complete digestion of these proteins in the absence of detergent suggest that, like pUL138, the large C-terminal domains of each protein is exposed on the cytosolic face of Golgi membranes. The less efficient digestion of pUL133 may be related to the possibility that pUL133 may span the membrane twice. Given that the majority of pUL133 is digested, we interpret these results to indicate that both the N- and C-termini of pUL133 are on the cytosolic face of 25K fraction membranes. The membrane association and the topology for each of these proteins were unchanged when expressed individually by lentivirus transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002444.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The observed topology of these proteins in Golgi membranes likely has important implications for their function during infection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the three proteins, pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 expressed with pUL138 from polycistronic transcripts have similar properties to pUL138 with regard to localization and membrane association.</p>

At 6 hpi, cells were then co-transduced for 48 h with four lentivirus contructs expressing pUL133, pUL135, pUL136, and pUL138, each with a different carboxy terminal epitope tag. Antibodies specific to the Flag (FLAG), hemagglutinin (HA), myc, or glu-glu (EE) epitope tags were conjugated with Quantum dots and used to label pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub>, pUL135<sub>HA</sub>, pUL136<sub>myc</sub>, and pUL138<sub>EE</sub>, respectively. When expressed independently, pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub>, pUL135<sub>HA</sub>, pUL136<sub>myc</sub>, and pUL138<sub>EE</sub> localized in part to a perinucler region resembling the Golgi, implying that the localization of these proteins to the Golgi did not require other viral proteins or the context of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002444.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Similar to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002">Figure 2</xref>), both pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub> and pUL135<sub>HA</sub> exhibited a more diffuse localization showing both cell surface and perinuclear staining resembling the Golgi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002444.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Importantly, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002444.s004">Figure S4</xref> demonstrates that there was no appreciable background or bleed through of these signals in each of the five channels.</p>
        <p>When expressed together, there was substantial overlap in the signals for all four proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Due to the high level of pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub> expression, merged images are shown of all viral proteins with and without pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub>. pUL136<sub>myc</sub> and pUL138<sub>EE</sub> exhibited the greatest overlap in their localization pattern. There were some notable differences in staining where pUL135<sub>HA</sub> appears to be excluded from perinuclear regions strongly stained with pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub> and pUL138<sub>EE</sub>. It is interesting that regions of pUL135<sub>HA</sub> staining are typically juxtaposed to regions of intense pUL133<sub>FLAG</sub> and pUL138<sub>EE</sub> staining. Importantly, no signal was detected in infected cells transduced with an empty vector, demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies and that these antibodies were not bound by viral Fc receptors. The significance of these patterns and regions of overlapping and non-overlapping protein localization awaits further investigation.</p>

We first analyzed protein expression from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs. CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, freshly isolated from umbilical cord blood were infected with TB40E-WT or TB40E-UL136<sub>myc</sub> at an MOI of 2. Pure populations of infected (GFP positive) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and seeded into long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) over a stromal support. Whole cell lysates were prepared at 2 and 5 days post infection (dpi) and analyzed for protein expression by immunoblotting using polyclonal antisera to HCMV proteins, the monoclonal antibody specific to IE1 and IE2, or a monoclonal antibody recognizing the myc epitope tag. Representative blots are shown from five independent experiments. We detected transient expression of IE1, which did not persist past 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). IE1 transcript expression in HPCs has been detected previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Goodrum2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Goodrum3">[26]</xref>. Similarly, pUL133 was detected at 2 dpi but not at 5 dpi. As previously observed, pUL138 was expressed in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs at 2 and 5 dpi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. By contrast, we detected very low to undetectable levels pUL135 or pUL136 in these cells under conditions where the expression of pUL138 was readily detected. While we cannot exclude the possibility that pUL135 and pUL136 are expressed in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, their relative abundance is substantially diminished compared to infected fibroblasts and we consistently fail to detect these proteins in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs with our current tools. These results indicate that expression of individual proteins from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus may be differentially modulated based on the context of infection. Given the low levels of expression of pUL135 and pUL136 detected in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, it is uncertain as to what role these proteins may play in the establishment and maintenance of latency.</p>

        <p>The differential expression of <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus proteins in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells may be due to the relative abundance of transcripts encoding pUL138. As we have shown previously, pUL138 can be expressed from 3.6-, 2.7-, and 1.4-kb transcripts, although it appears to be most efficiently expressed from the 1.4-kb transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. By contrast, pUL133 and pUL135 are expressed only from the 3.6- and 2.7-kb transcripts, respectively. We reasoned that if the 1.4-kb transcript was expressed more abundantly in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs than the 3.6- and 2.7-kb transcripts, this could explain the enhanced levels of pUL138 expression. RNA was isolated from infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs at 2 dpi and the 3.6-, 2.7-, and 1.4-kb transcripts were quantitated by real time reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) using primers specific to <italic>UL133</italic>, <italic>UL135</italic>, <italic>UL136</italic> or <italic>UL138</italic>. As a control, we used TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> where none of these transcripts are expressed. We detected significant levels of 3.6-, 2.7- and 1.4-kb transcripts compared to control infection. Transcript levels of IE1 and IE2 were nearly identical in cells infected with both TB40E-WT and TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> (fold change of 1.3 and 1.4, respectively; data not shown). The 3.6-, 2.7-, and 1.4-kb transcripts were present in 1∶3∶3 ratio, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). While these results could explain the higher level of pUL138 expression, they do not explain the absence of pUL135 and pUL136 since the ratio of 2.7- to 1.4-kb transcripts is 1. Therefore, translational regulation of these transcripts may also play a role in protein abundance.</p>

In each case, cells were infected with an MOI of 0.1 and cell lystates were harvested 10 dpi. Surprisingly, TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> exhibited a modest to severe replication defect (5–200 fold) in all endothelial cell types analyzed.

        <p>To further explore the role of the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in endothelial cells, we analyzed multi-step replication of UL133-UL138<sub>NULL</sub> in HMVECs. HMVECs were infected with TB40E-WT, TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> or TB40E-UL138<sub>Stop</sub> at an MOI of 0.2 and whole cell lysates analyzed for virus production over a time course following infection by TCID<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> exhibited a 2-log defect in replication relative to TB40E-WT. This defect in replication was not due to a failure of the mutant virus to enter or spread in HMVEC cells based on the initial number of infected (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells and the formation of plaques, respectively (data not shown). Further, this defect cannot be overcome by infecting cells at higher multiplicities (MOI of 2; data not shown). Viruses lacking only <italic>UL138</italic> exhibited no defect relative to TB40E-WT, suggesting pUL138 is not required for replication in these cells.</p>
        <p>We next analyzed protein expression from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in endothelial cells. HMVECs were infected at an MOI of 2 and whole cell lysates were analyzed for pUL133, pUL135, pUL136 and pUL138 expression at 2 and 5 dpi by immunoblotting. As a control for infection, we analyzed the expression of the IE1 and IE2 proteins. We detect IE1 in HMVECs, but IE2 is consistently expressed at low to undetectable levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). With regards to the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus, we readily detected expression of pUL135 and pUL138 at 2 dpi. pUL133 was detected, but only at the 5 dpi time point. Expression of pUL136 was undetectable in each of three independent infections. The failure to detect pUL136 may be due to the variability in expression of the pUL136 isoforms or in the inherent instability of pUL136 (Cicchini and Goodrum, unpublished results).</p>

At 4 weeks post infection, four mice in each group were treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and AMD-3100 to induce stem cell mobilization and viral reactivation. At two weeks post mobilization, we measured viral genome loads in bone marrow and spleen tissues by quantitative TaqMan PCR with probes and primers specific for HCMV US28.</p>
        <p>HCMV genomic DNA was detected in the bone marrow of both wild type and <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> infected non-mobilized mice (351 copies/µg DNA for TB40E-WT vs. 291 copies/µg for TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub>; p = 0.17; not significant) and did not increase significantly upon mobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Both viruses showed an increase in splenic viral DNA loads following mobilization suggesting that cells infected with both viruses were disseminated to the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). However, mobilization of the mice infected with TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> resulted in a 2- to 3-fold higher levels of viral DNA load in the spleen compared to wild-type-infected animals (p = 0.08). Mice infected with TB40E-WT had an overall 1.4-fold increase in spleen viral DNA load following mobilization versus a 43-fold increase in TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> infected mice. Low levels of viral DNA were detected in the spleens of unmobilized mice infected with either TB40E-WT or <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> because infected cells do not efficiently traffic out of the bone marrow in the absence of mobilization.

        <p>In an effort to understand the possible function of the proteins encoded from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus, we searched the known protein sequence databases for protein sequence similarity using BLASTpsi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>).

Finally, we used Phyre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre/</ext-link>) to predict three dimensional structure using homology modeling, which does not rely on conservation of protein sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Kelley1">[29]</xref>. No cellular or viral homologs were identified by any of these bioinformatics methods for any of the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus cds with the exception of HHV-5/CMV orthologues (data not shown). Further, no protein structures could be predicted.</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of identifiable protein structure, we next analyzed these proteins for regions of disorder using Disopred2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopred" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopred</ext-link>). This algorithm predicted large regions of disorder across pUL133, pUL135, pUL136 and pUL138 suggesting that these are intrinsically disordered proteins (data not shown). Intrinsically disordered proteins typically adapt structure through their interactions and often interact with a large number of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Tompa1">[30]</xref>. These analyses indicate that the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus proteins are unique to CMV and, as such, will require further molecular and biochemical studies to understand their role in infection.</p>
        <p>To determine the extent of conservation of the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus within CMV orthologues, we aligned the UL<italic>b</italic>′ sequences available from NCBI for HCMV (strain TB40E; Accession: EF99921.1; GI: 157779983), ChCMV (strain heberling; Accession: NC_003521.1; GI: 20026600) and RhCMV (strain 68-1; Accession: NC_006150.1; GI: 51556461) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Of note, sequences with similarity to the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region were identified only in ChCMV and RhCMV and not in any CMVs of lower mammals for which a sequence is known. Orthologues to each gene encoded within the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus are present in ChCMV. The ChCMV orthologues for the strains aligned share 44.2%, 46.7%, 53.8% and 56.7% similarity at the amino acid level with pUL133, pUL135, pUL136, and pUL138, respectively. In RhCMV, the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region is positionally conserved. However, few RhCMV genes in this region share substantial sequence identity with HCMV UL<italic>b</italic>′ genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Oxford1">[31]</xref>. RhCMV Rh166 ORF shows similarity to both HCMV pUL133 (26.6%) and pUL138 (35%). In addition, the RhCMV Rh171 ORF also shows similarity to HCMV pUL133 (27.6%). Hence, Rh166 and Rh171 might represent the orthologues for HCMV pUL138 and pUL133, respectively, though the exact corresponding homologues are not clear from the analyses performed. No significant identity between UL135 and UL136 of HCMV and RhCMV proteins was observed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified and characterized a novel locus within the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region of the HCMV genome that encodes three proteins, pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136, in addition to the pUL138 latency determinant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. The pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 proteins have not been previously characterized. Proteins encoded by the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus predominantly localize to Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g005">5</xref>) with large C-terminal domains exposed on the cytosolic face of the membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus proteins exhibit overlapping localization, but did not completely co-localize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The profile of expression of the individual proteins from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus varied substantially depending on the context of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g006">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g008">8C</xref>). As would be expected for UL<italic>b</italic>′ sequences, the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus was dispensable for viral replication in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002444.s003">S3</xref>). Disruption of the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus resulted in a virus, <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL,</sub> with increased frequency of infectious centers formation in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs relative to the wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with a failure to establish a latent infection. Intriguingly, <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> exhibited a severe replication defect in primary human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). These three distinct context-dependent phenotypes indicate that the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus may mediate context-dependent outcomes of infection. The mechanism by which the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus contributes to cell-type dependent outcomes of infection awaits further investigation. Importantly, <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> exhibited increase replication and dissemination in a NOD-<italic>scid</italic> IL2Rγ<sub>c</sub><sup>null</sup>-humanized mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g009">Figure 9</xref>), indicating a role for this locus in mediating viral replication, latency or dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, as the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus is unique to CMV strains of higher order primates, we predict that these proteins represent viral adaptations to infection and persistence in the primate host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>
      <p>The UL<italic>b</italic>′ region of the HCMV genome was first recognized over a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Cha1">[15]</xref>. As this region is unique to CMV strains infecting primates and is dispensable for viral replication in fibroblasts, the most common model for productive viral replication, it presents significant challenge for research and has been understudied. The genes in this region are postulated to encode viral adaptations to the host, involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis, or viral persistence or latency. The coding potential of genes in the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region has been shown for only a few of the 20 putative ORFs. These include <italic>UL138</italic>, <italic>UL141</italic>, <italic>UL142</italic>, <italic>UL144</italic>, and <italic>UL146</italic>. <italic>UL138</italic> encodes a protein that is required, but not sufficient, for the latent infection in HPCs infected <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Goodrum1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. It has been recently demonstrated that pUL138 functions to regulate cell surface levels of TNFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Le1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Montag1">[21]</xref>. <italic>UL141</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Tomasec1">[32]</xref> and <italic>UL142</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Wills1">[33]</xref> encode proteins to evade elimination by natural killer cells. <italic>UL142</italic> is expressed late in infection and encodes a MHC class I related molecule, which renders the cells resistant to NK mediated cell lysis. <italic>UL144</italic> functions as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog that activates NF<sc>k</sc>B, which in turn enhances the expression of CCL22, a chemokine, which attracts Th2 and T regulatory cells. Thus <italic>UL144</italic> may help the virus evade immune surveillance by enhancing the Th2 response while subverting the Th1 response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Benedict1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Poole1">[35]</xref>. <italic>UL146</italic> encodes a viral CXCL chemokine that binds the IL-8 receptor to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Penfold1">[36]</xref>. Another putative CXC homologue, <italic>UL147</italic>, has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Penfold1">[36]</xref>; however, the coding potential of this ORF and its function has not been explored. Most recently, we have extended our studies on pUL138 to characterize the protein coding capacity of the <italic>UL133</italic>, <italic>UL135</italic>, and <italic>UL136</italic> ORFs, encoded on polycistronic transcripts with <italic>UL138</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. The individual functions of pUL133, pUL135, and pUL136 have not yet been determined. The sequence analyses of these proteins do not indicate any obvious sequence motifs or functional domains that suggest protein function. The fact that these proteins share similar cellular and biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g005">5</xref>) to that of pUL138 suggests that they may function together during infection. We hypothesize that these proteins may function with pUL138 in modulating the outcome of infection in a context dependent manner. Our ongoing research focuses on determining the functions of each of these proteins during HCMV infection.</p>
      <p>The proteins derived from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus share identity only with other HHV-5 orthologues. While the proteins encoded by the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus are conserved in chimpanzee CMVs, orthologues have not been identified in cytomegalovirus strains infecting lower mammals, including RhCMV and MCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Oxford1">[31]</xref>. In RhCMV, the UL<italic>b</italic>′ region is positionally conserved, but few proteins have considerable sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g010">Figure 10</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Oxford1">[31]</xref>. Both <italic>UL133</italic> and <italic>UL138</italic> share moderate similarity to <italic>rh166</italic> while <italic>UL133</italic> also shows weak homology to <italic>rh171</italic>. We propose, given the position of the Rh166 and Rh171 ORFs and the moderate conservation of sequence, that these ORFs represent orthologues of pUL133 and pUL138 of HCMV. No orthologues were identified for pUL135 or pUL136, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Oxford1">[31]</xref>. These observations suggest that <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus resulted from co-speciation in higher order primates, and suggest an intriguing possibility that these proteins engage in virus-host interactions that are highly adapted to the host species.</p>
      <p>Our studies indicate, as would be expected for UL<italic>b</italic>′ sequences, that the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus was dispensable for replication in cultured fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, the locus augmented replication in primary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and impeded replication in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Further, profiles of gene expression from the UL133-UL138 locus varied depending on the cell type infected (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g001">Figure 1C and D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g008">8C</xref>). For example, pUL135 was not detected in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, but was expressed efficiently in endothelial cells and fibroblasts, while pUL136 could not be detected in endothelial cells of CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs. This finding suggests that the ultimate outcome of infection may rely on the profile of protein expression from the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in individual contexts of infection. As pUL135 and pUL136 are not expressed in HPCs, they may not be required for establishing or maintaining latency, but may function in some other aspect such as reactivation.</p>
      <p>Interactions between proteins encoded by the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus or with unique cell-type dependent host factors may underlie the role of this locus in mediating cell-type specific infection outcomes. Preliminary studies aimed at understanding the function of <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus proteins have revealed a complex network of interactions and positive and negative acting proteins (Umashankar, Petrucelli, Rak, and Goodrum, unpublished results). The localization of <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus proteins to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g005">5</xref>) and their orientation in the membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g003">Figure 3</xref>) is certainly foretelling of the function of these proteins. Proteins localized in the Golgi may play critical roles in viral assembly and egress, protein trafficking, apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Brune1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Hicks1">[38]</xref>, and the cellular stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Hicks1">[38]</xref>. Accordingly, the recently defined role of pUL138 in modulating surface levels of TNFR, suggests that pUL138 may mediate protein trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Le1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Montag1">[21]</xref> and, therefore, the cellular response to signaling molecules.</p>
      <p>The conclusions drawn from our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies are bolstered by our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in humanized mice. The increased viral loads of TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> virus in the spleens of NOD-<italic>scid</italic> IL2Rγ<sub>c</sub><sup>null</sup>-humanized mice following mobilization suggests increased replication, reactivation or dissemination of this virus relative to the WT virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). This <italic>in vivo</italic> finding further supports an important role for the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in suppressing replication or reactivation for latency. Mobilization did not significantly increase WT or <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub> viral genome copy number in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002444-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), possibly reflecting the fact that mobilized cells quickly exit the bone marrow. The fact that higher genome levels were not measured in the bone marrow of <italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub>-infected mice relative to WT-infected mice prior to mobilization, suggests that these viruses may not behave differently in this system in the absence of a reactivation stimulus. The nature of the humanized mice studies is such that the results cannot completely recapitulate our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, yet they are highly consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, both studies suggesting an important role for the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus in modulating the outcomes of infection. Future studies into the <italic>UL133-UL138</italic> locus promise to reveal intriguing virus-host interactions unique to higher-order primates mediating viral persistence.</p>

        <p>Oligonucleotide primers used for making expression plasmids are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002444-t002">Table 2</xref>. The <italic>UL133</italic>, <italic>UL135</italic> and <italic>UL136</italic> ORFs were PCR amplified using ORF specific primers flanked by a NheI site on the forward primer and a BamHI site on the reverse primer. The reverse primer contained the myc epitope tag sequence to generate 3′ tagged versions of each gene. The PCR products were cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of the pCIG2 vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Grainger1">[22]</xref>. These constructs termed pCIG-UL133<sub>myc</sub>, pCIG-UL135<sub>myc</sub>, and pCIG-UL136<sub>myc</sub>, express proteins with a C-terminal myc epitope tag with a 5 amino acid linker between the protein coding sequence and the myc tag. To obtain HA (YPYDVPDYA), 3X-FLAG (DYKDDDDK), or Glu-Glu (E-E) (EYMPME) (at the C-terminus) versions of these proteins, the PCR products containing a specific epitope tag were cloned into NheI and EcoRV sites of pCIG2 vector as above. The resulting plasmids were named pCIG2-UL133<sub>FLAG</sub>-IRES-BLEO, pCIG2-UL135<sub>HA</sub>-IRES-HYGRO, pCIG2-UL136<sub>myc</sub>-IRES-NEO, and pCIG2-UL138<sub>EE</sub>-IRES-PURO. In these constructs, the eGFP downstream of IRES was replaced by drug resistance markers such as Hygromycin (HYGRO), Neomycin (NEO), Bleomycin (BLEO) or Puromycin (PURO).</p>

        <p>Immunoblotting was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. Briefly, 10–15 µg of protein lysates were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris, (Invitrogen, CA) or 11% Bis-Tris gels by electrophoresis and transferred to 0.45 µm polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-FL, Millipore, MA) membranes. The proteins were immunoblotted using mouse α-myc (Cell Signalling) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each protein (Open Biosystems) and detected using fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies and the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor, NE). All antibodies used are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002444-t003">Table 3</xref>.</p>

        <p>Immunofluorescence to localize viral and cellular proteins in infected cells was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Petrucelli1">[19]</xref>. Briefly, fibroblasts (5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 24-well plates) were mock infected or infected with recombinant viruses encoding myc epitope-tagged pUL133, pUL135, pUL136 and pUL138 at an MOI of 2 for 24 and 48 h. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with a rabbit antibody specific to myc epitope tag and visualized using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.

MRC5 cells were monitored for GFP expression for a period of 14 days. The frequency of infectious centers formed was calculated based on the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at each dilution using software, Extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Hu1">[46]</xref>.</p>

        <p><italic>NOD-scid IL2Rγc<sup>null</sup></italic> mice were maintained in a specific pathogen free facility at Oregon Health and Science University in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved procedures. Mice were sublethally irradiated with 250 cGy by <sup>137</sup>Cs g-irradiation and then engrafted with approximately 150,000 human CD34<sup>+</sup> stem cells (Catalog #CB008F-S, StemCell Technologies; Vancouver British Columbia, Canada) via retro-orbital injection. At 4 weeks post inoculation of stem cells, the level of engraftment (determined as the percentage of human CD45<sup>+</sup> present in the blood of total lymphocytes) was assessed by flow cytometry as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002444-Smith1">[27]</xref>. At 5 weeks post engraftment, the mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of 1×10<sup>7</sup> normal human dermal fibroblasts previously infected with HCMV TB40E-WT or TB40E-<italic>UL133-UL138</italic><sub>NULL</sub>. A third group of engrafted mice were mock infected with uninfected human fibroblasts. At 4 weeks post infection, a group of mice were treated for 7 days with 100 µl of G-CSF (300 µg/ml; Amgen) via a subcutaneous micro-osmotic pump (1007D; Alzet) and AMD3100 (5mg/kg) to mobilize their hematopoietic stem cells. As a direct comparator for the effects of virus reactivation-dissemination following mobilization an additional non-mobilized infected control group was included for each virus (n = 4/group). At 2 weeks post mobilization, mice were euthanized and bone marrow and spleen were harvested and snap frozen for subsequent analysis.</p>

        <p>Total DNA was extracted from 0.8 g of mouse spleen and bone marrow via the DNAzol method (Life Technologies) and analyzed by quantitative PCR (TaqMan) for the presence of HCMV genomic DNA. For Q-PCR analysis, 1 µg of total DNA was analyzed using primers and a probe recognizing HCMV US28 sequences (probe = TGA TC<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">C CGC TCA GTG T</named-content>; forward primer = GAA <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTC ATG CTC GGT GCT TTC</named-content>; and reverse primer = CTT TG<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">T GGC GCG ACT GAG A</named-content>). The probe contains labeled with a 5′-end FAM reporter molecule and a 3′-end quencher molecule (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR reactions were prepared using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To initiate the reaction the AmpliTaq Gold was activated at 95°C for 10 minutes and then 40 cycles (15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C) were performed using a StepOnePlus TaqMan PCR machine. Results were analyzed using ABI StepOne software. The sensitivity of detection for this assay was approximately 50 HCMV DNA genomic copies as determine by using a plasmid containing the US28 amplicon to develop a standard curve. Data were analyzed using the statistical program GraphPad Prism 5.</p>
