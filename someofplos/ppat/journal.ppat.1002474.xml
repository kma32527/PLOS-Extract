        <p><italic>Trans</italic>-sialidase (TS), a virulence factor from <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, is an enzyme playing key roles in the biology of this protozoan parasite. Absent from the mammalian host, it constitutes a potential target for the development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs, an urgent need to combat Chagas' disease. TS is involved in host cell invasion and parasite survival in the bloodstream. However, TS is also actively shed by the parasite to the bloodstream, inducing systemic effects readily detected during the acute phase of the disease, in particular, hematological alterations and triggering of immune cells apoptosis, until specific neutralizing antibodies are elicited. These antibodies constitute the only known submicromolar inhibitor of TS's catalytic activity. We now report the identification and detailed characterization of a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 13G9), recognizing <italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS with high specificity and subnanomolar affinity. This mAb displays undetectable association with the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> superfamily of TS-like proteins or yet with the TS-related enzymes from <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> or <italic>Trypanosoma rangeli</italic>. In immunofluorescence assays, mAb 13G9 labeled 100% of the parasites from the infective trypomastigote stage. This mAb also reduces parasite invasion of cultured cells and strongly inhibits parasite surface sialylation. The crystal structure of the mAb 13G9 antigen-binding fragment in complex with the globular region of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS was determined, revealing detailed molecular insights of the inhibition mechanism. Not occluding the enzyme's catalytic site, the antibody performs a subtle action by inhibiting the movement of an assisting tyrosine (Y<sub>119</sub>), whose mobility is known to play a key role in the <italic>trans</italic>-glycosidase mechanism. As an example of enzymatic inhibition involving non-catalytic residues that occupy sites distal from the substrate-binding pocket, this first near atomic characterization of a high affinity inhibitory molecule for TS provides a rational framework for novel strategies in the design of chemotherapeutic compounds.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Chagas' disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an endemic illness that affects approximately 8 million people in Latin America. The etiologic agent is the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. To survive in the mammalian host and invade its cells, leading to the chronic infection, the parasite incorporates a charged carbohydrate (sialic acid). However, the parasite is unable to synthesize sialic acid, having to scavenge it from the host's sialo-glycoconjugates, through a transglycosylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme <italic>trans</italic>-sialidase, which is unique to these organisms. We have obtained a monoclonal antibody that fully inhibits <italic>T. cruzi trans</italic>-sialidase actually being, at the best of our knowledge, the most potent inhibitor available. We now report a complete characterization of this neutralizing monoclonal antibody, at the functional and molecular levels. The antibody displays very high affinity and specificity for the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> enzyme, labels the parasites' surface and effectively blocks its sialylation and host cell invasion capacities. The determination of the 3D structure of the enzyme-antibody immunocomplex by X ray diffraction, allowed us to unveil the inhibition mechanism, providing clues for rational drug design. Given that sialidases are virulence factors in several pathogenic microorganisms, the reported data shall help to expand informative knowledge in this area.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chagas' disease, the American trypanosomiasis, is a chronic disabling parasitic disease caused by the flagellate protozoon <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi.</italic> With an estimated global burden of 100 million people at risk, 8 million already infected, and approximately 40,000 new cases/year, Chagas' disease represents a major health and economic problem in Latin America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Rassi1">[1]</xref>. The infection is naturally transmitted by triatomine vectors (“kissing bugs”), from the south of the USA to the southern region of South America, although chagasic patients are in fact dispersed worldwide due to migrations. Patients can also transmit the disease either by <italic>in utero</italic> infection leading to the congenitally acquired disease or by accidental transmission through contaminated blood. The acute infection is characterized by patent parasite burden. During this initial stage, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> induces several alterations in the infected mammal including intense polyclonal activation of lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Minoprio1">[2]</xref>, transient thymic aplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Taliaferro1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Savino1">[4]</xref> and other clinical hematological findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tribulatti1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-deTitto1">[6]</xref>. The majority of the patients control the parasitemia, survive the acute phase, and enter into an indeterminate form of the disease that may last for many years or even indefinitely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Rassi1">[1]</xref>. Up to 20 years after the infection, ∼35% of patients develop different pathologies, such as cardiomyopathy, peripheral nervous system damage, and/or dysfunction of the digestive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Rassi1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sialic acids have proven to be crucial during the parasite's life cycle and survival in the mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Schenkman1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-PereiraChioccola1">[10]</xref>. However, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is unable to perform <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of sialic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Previato1">[11]</xref>. This family of nine-carbon carbohydrates, is actually scavenged from the host's glycoconjugates, through a glycosyl-transfer reaction mediated by <italic>trans</italic>-sialidase (TS), a modified sialidase expressed by the parasite. In this way, the surface of the parasite becomes rapidly sialylated, with mucins being the main sialyl acceptors, in a process that allows the parasite to evade its destruction by serum factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tomlinson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-PereiraChioccola1">[10]</xref>. TS activity is also involved in host cell attachment and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Schenkman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Schenkman2">[8]</xref>, as well as in parasite escape from the parasitophorous vacuole into the cytoplasm, where the parasite replicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-RubindeCelis1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the trypomastigote stage, TS is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored non-integral membrane protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Agusti1">[13]</xref>, actively released to the extracellular milieu, leading to a systemic distribution of the enzyme through the bloodstream. Its half-life in blood is significantly extended due to the presence of a <italic>C</italic>-terminal repetitive domain named SAPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Alvarez1">[14]</xref>. TS activity is detectable in the bloodstream of infected humans and mice, until antibodies able to neutralize its catalytic activity are elicited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Leguizamn1">[15]</xref>. The systemic distribution of TS is associated with several pathologies observed during the early steps of infection including depletion of thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Leguizamn2">[16]</xref>, absence of germinal centers in secondary organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Risso1">[17]</xref> and thrombocytopenia and erythropenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tribulatti1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-deTitto1">[6]</xref>, all alterations that can be prevented by the passive transfer of TS-neutralizing antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Risso1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Mucci1">[18]</xref>. In fact, administration of the enzyme in mice before <italic>T. cruzi</italic> challenge, leads to more severe evolution of the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Chuenkova1">[19]</xref>. These finding are also consistent with the fact that increased shedding of the enzyme correlates with increased virulence of the corresponding parasite strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Risso2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>TS has thus been identified as a potential target for drug discovery and design. Added to its key roles in host response evasion, cell invasion and pathogenesis, TS is not present in the mammalian host. The development of suitable drugs to treat/prevent Chagas' disease is urgently needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Munoz1">[21]</xref>. Only two compounds, benznidazol and nifurtimox, are currently available for treating both acute and chronic infections. These drugs are far from being optimal: fairly toxic, they trigger serious side effects, while also showing suboptimal efficacy in a high proportion of patients. The emergence of resistant parasite strains adds a concerning issue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Wilkinson1">[22]</xref>. Several attempts to obtain suitable TS inhibitors have been made, especially once its 3D structure became available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Buschiazzo1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Buschiazzo2">[24]</xref>. However, only low affinity molecules have been obtained so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Neres1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Neres2">[26]</xref>, some of them toxic in <italic>in vivo</italic> assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Buchini1">[27]</xref>, ultimately suggesting that further and more active efforts must be pursued.</p>
      <p>We have obtained a TS-neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 13G9) that displays very high affinity and specificity towards the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> enzyme. This mAb is able to prevent immune system and hematological abnormalities, even when assaying highly virulent parasites under lethal infection conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tribulatti1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Risso1">[17]</xref>. We now report an extensive functional characterization of mAb 13G9, as well as the crystal structure of the 13G9-TS binary complex. The molecular features of the inhibitory mechanism are unveiled, providing novel insight for the development of TS inhibitors, which might also be relevant for related neuraminidases in other pathogens.</p>

        <p>The mAb was purified by Protein A-affinity chromatography from filtered hybridoma supernatants. This purified material was further subjected to anionic chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002474.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The mAb eluted as a single peak as evaluated both by TS-neutralizing activity (not shown) as well as by TS recognition in dot-blot assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002474.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The same sequence was found in several mRNAs encoding for the antibody (not shown), in support of a clonal nature of the hybridoma. Purified mAb was proteolized with papain to generate the Fab fragment. Inhibitory activity of the fragment was determined and compared with that from the whole IgG protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g001">Figure 1</xref>, panels B and C). Although the full-length mAb appears to have a higher inhibitory activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration IC<sub>50</sub> 5.6×10<sup>−11</sup> M), its Fab fragment still retains a nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> (1.6×10<sup>−9</sup> M), clearly conserving its antigen-binding mechanism. These high inhibitory potencies are consistent with the apparent dissociation constant determined by surface plasmon resonance (see above), even though IC<sub>50</sub> figures cannot be compared with affinity constants in absolute terms at this point (allosteric effects, or yet mixed inhibition mechanisms, may flaw a linear relationship). The purified Fab proved to be fairly unstable when non-complexed to TS, requiring immediate use for biochemical characterizations. This may be one of the main reasons for the observed inhibitory potency decrease compared to the entire immunoglobulin molecule. The Fab's instability precluded its use for further <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> biologic assays.</p>
        <p><italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS belongs in fact to a huge superfamily of genes, among which at least four families can be discriminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Campetella1">[31]</xref>. TSs are only included in one of these families, which encodes for a number of enzymatically active and inactive members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Cremona1">[32]</xref>. These two forms of TS can be distinguished by the single Tyr<sub>342</sub>His mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Cremona2">[33]</xref>: only the active TSs have the Tyr<sub>342</sub> residue acting as the enzyme's nucleophile during the ping-pong reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Watts1">[34]</xref>. TS-mAb competition assays performed with the inactive TS showed that both proteins reacted similarly with the mAb. An equimolar mixture of inactive and active TSs, displayed ∼50% reduction of the neutralizing reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In a separate set of assays, heat-inactivated TS was not recognized by the mAb 13G9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002474.s001">Figure S1</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that the neutralizing epitope is conformational <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Buscaglia1">[35]</xref>. In the infective trypomastigote stages, all TSs include the SAPA <italic>C-</italic>terminal extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Campetella1">[31]</xref>, which is absent in all the other TS-related families allowing for clear-cut discrimination. To address whether the mAb 13G9 was specific only for TS proteins, extracts from biotinylated trypomastigotes were reacted with the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Pulled-down material was subjected to Western blot and developed in parallel with anti-SAPA (for TS) and streptavidin for all the biotinylated parasite surface components. Strong signals were readily observed in both lanes, matching the TS expected protein sizes. No differential pattern was detected whatsoever, confirming the very high specificity of 13G9 antibody only towards proteins belonging to the TS family.</p>

        <title>mAb 13G9 Reduces Cell Invasion and Inhibits the Sialylation of the Parasite</title>
        <p>The reactivity of mAb 13G9 with whole parasites was assayed by immunofluorescence showing surface labeling consistent with the expected cellular membrane localization of TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The ability of the mAb to inhibit TS-mediated transfer of sialic acid from the surrounding environment to the parasite's surface molecules was then tested. To reduce the basal sialylation of parasites, sialyl residue donors were largely depleted replacing fetal bovine serum (FBS) by bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the infected tissue cultures; only host cells remained as the unique source of the sugar. Trypomastigotes were then collected and incubated with α(2,3)sialyllactose as sialic acid donor and TS, in the presence of mAb 13G9. The amount of transferred sialic acid was determined by the thiobarbituric acid method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Powell1">[36]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, mAb 13G9 very efficiently inhibited the parasites' sialylation, demonstrating its biologic relevance as a TS-inhibitory molecule. The sialylation observed in the treated parasites corresponds to the sugar acquired before the addition of the mAb. These quantitative results are in agreement with the Western blot assays we have recently reported for sialyl-transfer inhibition by mAb 13G9 using azido-modified sialic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Mui1">[37]</xref>.</p>

        <title>3D Structure of the Immunocomplex Fab/TS</title>
        <p>To gain atomic insight into the antigen-antibody interactions allowing mAb 13G9 to neutralize the TS catalytic activity with extremely high efficiency, we solved the structure of the immunocomplex by X ray crystallography.</p>
        <p>Crystallogenesis screenings were performed under a sitting-drop vapor diffusion setup with a Honeybee963 robotic station, using standard 96-well plates. Several initial hits were obtained. Further manual optimization eventually allowed to grow crystals (0.7×0.05×0.05 mm) in polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000 plus dioxane, suitable for X ray diffraction data to be collected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002474-t001">Table 1</xref>). Limiting resolution was 3.4Å on a Cu rotating anode generator, and indexing was straightforward, indicating a primitive cell in the trigonal/hexagonal system. Cell parameters (a = b = 178.1Å, c = 140.7Å) suggested the presence of as many as 3 binary complexes per asymmetric unit, raising as well the hypothesis that its weak diffraction could respond to limiting X ray beam intensity in the context of a fairly large unit cell (low number of scattering cells per crystal unit volume). To rule out this possibility, several crystals were tested at the ALS (Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA) beamline 5.0.2 (8×10<sup>11</sup> photons/s with 1.5 mrad divergence at 12.4 keV), with no detectable improvement in resolution as judged by standard quantitative statistics, strongly suggesting that crystal disorder linked to high solvent content (66% as determined after full refinement) is the major cause for maximum resolution sphere limitation.</p>

Systematic extinctions were observed in the reciprocal 00l axis, strongly suggesting space groups P3<sub>1</sub> or P3<sub>2</sub>. The structure was solved by molecular replacement confirming SG P3<sub>1</sub>. Two search probes were used to calculate rotation and translation functions: Protein Data Base (PDB) 3CLF (mouse IgG Fab fragment, chosen according to sequence similarity to mAb 13G9) and 2AH2 (high resolution <italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS model). Iterative cycles of maximum likelihood refinement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Blanc1">[38]</xref> were interspersed with manual rebuilding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Emsley1">[39]</xref>. The high resolution of the molecular replacement search models resulted in excellent maps and straightforward rebuilding, mostly adding missing side chains on the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were kept only in the first refinement cycles, thereafter allowing for automatic local NCS detection, with variable weights according to evolving rms deviations, as implemented in the program Buster/TNT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Smart1">[40]</xref>. Model refinement statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002474-t001">Table 1</xref>. Interestingly, the PISA server (European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton) predicts that the TS-Fab 13G9 complex would not be stable in solution, contradicting our experimental results. This discrepancy reveals the still challenging task of predicting energetic and thermodynamic properties of protein/protein associations, based on the analysis of crystal structures of partners and derived complexes, despite the fact that prediction algorithms are complex and attempt integrating enthalpic and entropic effects, as well as solvent accessible surface burial and geometric complementarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Davies1">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Indeed, three binary Fab-TS complexes are located in the asymmetric unit, all very similar at the level of precision of our data. Refined models of immunocomplex 2 (IC2, composed by TS chain B, and chains I and M of the Fab molecule) and IC3 (TS chain C, complexed to Fab J and N) were superposed sequentially onto complex IC1 (TS chain A with H <italic>"heavy"</italic> and L <italic>"light"</italic> chains from the Fab molecule) minimizing root mean squared deviations (rmsd) of atomic coordinates. Such structural alignments resulted in 0.84Å rmsd between IC1 and IC2, and 0.82Å between IC1 and IC3. Regions of highest variation correspond to intrinsically mobile segments, as reflected by detailed analysis of atomic displacement parameters (isotropic B factors). The mean B factor for all atoms is relatively high (59.9 Å<sup>2</sup>), consistent with the low resolution to which these crystals diffract X rays. Crystal packing is indeed loose, leading to high bulk solvent content and corresponding protein flexibility. TS molecules display lower B factors then the Fab dimers to which they are bound. A global tendency is also maintained among the independent complexes, IC3 showing greater mobility than IC2, which in turn is more flexible than complex IC1 (59&gt;53&gt;48 Å<sup>2</sup>), probably due to the different packing environments. In the case of the immunoglobulin heterodimers, chains also display a clear difference among variable domains, more rigid, compared to the constant domains, which show a reproducible flexibility on the distal half, away from the interdomain hinge.</p>
        <p>Given the overall structural similarity among the three complexes and the fact that complex IC1 resulted in a model with lower B factors, subsequent analyses will be referred only to this complex. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the immunocomplex IC1 highlighting that the variable regions of the Fab light chain are interacting with TS loops located closer to the entrance of the enzyme's catalytic pocket, while the heavy chain associates to an adjacent, more distal patch.</p>

The antibody light chain is slightly occluding the entrance of the enzyme's catalytic pocket, while the heavy chain is more eccentric, establishing a large interaction surface on one side of the reaction center.</p>

        <p>The solvent accessible surface that becomes buried due to the enzyme-antibody interaction corresponds to 1810.2 Å<sup>2</sup> (916.5 Å<sup>2</sup> on the TS and 893.7 Å<sup>2</sup> on the Fab, adding 506 Å<sup>2</sup> from the heavy chain, and 387.7 Å<sup>2</sup> from the light chain), within the typical range of antibodies reacting with protein antigens. On this interface, 15 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge can be distinguished, as well as a number of residues that establish contact interactions (van der Waals forces), as listed on <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002474-t002">Table 2</xref>. The resolution limit of the diffraction data allowed for the identification of very few water molecules, none of which are directly involved in the accessible nor the buried surfaces engaged in interaction. The shape complementarity statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Lawrence1">[42]</xref> correspond to 0.673 and 0.645, after analysis of the interface areas with the light and the heavy chains, respectively. These figures are within the typical range (0.64–0.74) of specific protein:protein interfaces. The epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g004">Figure 4</xref>) consists of residues H<sub>171</sub>, Y<sub>248</sub>, R<sub>311</sub>–W<sub>312</sub>, and loops 199–201 (KKK) and 116–128 (SRSYWTSHGDARD - W<sub>120</sub> and A<sub>126</sub> do not interact directly).</p>

            <p>Highlight of the spatial distribution of the epitope residues (in stick representation, colored yellow). TS is shown in orange, light Fab chain in magenta and heavy chain in cyan. For clarity not all the epitope residues are shown nor labeled (see text for full analysis). On top of the cartoon secondary structure representation, residues are represented in lines for the three chains. As a reference for TS positions within the reaction center, the catalytic amino acids Y<sub>342</sub> (on the floor of the pocket) and D<sub>59</sub> are highlighted as green sticks; Y<sub>119</sub> (colored red) forms part of the epitope, normally flexible in free TS. Note how the mAb light chain precludes free mobility of Y<sub>119</sub>, which plays a key function in <italic>trans</italic>-glycosylation.</p>

        <p>The structural bases of the catalytic inhibitory effect that this mAb elicits, can start to be elucidated by modeling the entrance of the sialylated substrate into the TS reactional center in the context of the TS-Fab complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Superimposing TS PDB models 1S0I and 1S0J, onto our structure, allowed to define the positions of the substrates <italic>N-</italic>acetyl-neuraminyl-lactose (α(2,3)sialyllactose) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-neuraminic acid (MU-NANA), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The most readily observable feature is the steric hindrance that TS residue Y<sub>119</sub> imposes, blocking the entrance of the sialyl residue in the reactional pocket.</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) α(2,3)sialyllactose (SL, carbons in yellow) and MU-NANA (carbons in purple) are shown in stick representation, colored according to atom elements (oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue). The carbohydrates are grafted from PDB models 1S0I (for SL) and 1S0J (MU-NANA), after structural superposition of the TS molecules onto the immunocomplex, resulting in their specific positions within the TS catalytic pocket. TS and Fab molecules are shown in ribbons (TS in green, Fab light chain in magenta and heavy chain in blue), with their corresponding solvent-accessible surfaces on top. The surface has been cut to highlight the inner architecture of the TS catalytic pocket: this orientation does not allow appreciating that the site is open from above and beneath the plane of the paper. TS Y<sub>119</sub> (green sticks) is seen directly obstructing the sialic acid position, and its normal mobility is hindered by antibody's light chain S<sub>30</sub> (magenta sticks). (<bold>B</bold>) A similar representation as in panel (A), in a rotated orientation scene, to highlight the ‘roof’ formed by residues S<sub>66</sub>–G<sub>67</sub> of the Fab light chain (in magenta sticks to the top left of the panel) in direct contact with TS residues R<sub>311</sub>–W<sub>312</sub> (in pale green sticks, to the right of the figure). Note the expected clash of the glucosyl residue in sialyllactose against loop 66–67, and the better fit of the smaller MU-NANA substrate, still quite restricted in free torsional movements. Y<sub>119</sub> is again shown (strong green sticks), precluding entrance of the sialic acid moiety of both modeled sugar compounds.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The free mobility of the phenolic side chain of Y<sub>119</sub> is limited by the juxtaposed residue S<sub>30</sub> from the Fab's light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This restraint seems to play a central role in precluding the entrance of sialylated substrates into the catalytic pocket, entrance that absolutely requires the movement of Y<sub>119</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Buschiazzo1">[23]</xref>. A second effect could not be excluded, namely the spatial constraint exerted by the overall architecture of the associated complex. Residues S<sub>26</sub>–S<sub>28</sub> (within the light chain complementarily determining region CDRL1) and S<sub>66</sub>–G<sub>67</sub> on the same Fab chain, establish direct contact with TS residues R<sub>311</sub> and W<sub>312</sub>. This interaction is located just on top of the catalytic pocket entrance, functioning as a ‘roof’ (SG/RW roof), where the catalytic center itself would be the floor. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, when sialyllactose is located in position, the substrate pocket appears to be too small, predicting direct clashes of the glucosyl residue with the SG/RW roof (particularly residues Ser<sub>66</sub>–Gly<sub>67</sub> of the Fab light chain). This scenario of course implies that Y<sub>119</sub> could eventually be forced to move out of the sialic acid binding site, an unlikely event. The light chain loop 29–31 is also prone to interfere with the saccharide, if rearrangements are to be considered during its accommodation (data not shown). In order to obtain further experimental data evaluating the relative effects of Y<sub>119</sub>-mobility hindrance and/or the spatial constraints exerted by the SG/RW roof onto the catalytic pocket cavity volume, MU-NANA was assayed in TS-catalyzed sialidase reactions. MU-NANA is an artificial substrate that allows for TS-catalyzed hydrolytic and trans-glycosidase activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Mucci2">[43]</xref>, and given its smaller volume, could better accommodate, avoiding steric clashes with the SG/RW roof structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). TS-mediated MU-NANA hydrolysis was efficiently inhibited by mAb 13G9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the immobilization of Y<sub>119</sub> does play a central role. The spatial confinement in the pocket, partly due to the SG/RW roof structure, might impose secondary constraints precluding torsional accommodation, even in the case of smaller compounds.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This report describes an extensive biochemical and structural characterization of the mouse mAb 13G9, which is herein demonstrated to act as a powerful inhibitor of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS catalytic activity, displaying high specificity and affinity for the enzyme. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS is a virulence factor required for the survival of the parasite in the mammalian host. Several different biologic activities of the enzyme can be discriminated. The parasite uses TS activity to sialylate its own surface molecules, allowing it to evade lysis by serum factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tomlinson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-PereiraChioccola1">[10]</xref>. In this context, it should be noted that the addition of mAb 13G9 inhibited this sialylation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g001">Figure 1</xref>) in agreement with our previous findings with azido-modified sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Mui1">[37]</xref>. As well, TS is not only directly involved in the parasite/host cell interaction through the generation of a required sialylated epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Schenkman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Schenkman2">[8]</xref> but also in escaping from the parasitophorous vacuole to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-RubindeCelis1">[12]</xref>. In concert with these findings, here we report that mAb 13G9 significantly reduces parasite infection of cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002474-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Passive transfer of neutralizing mAb 13G9 to heavily infected mice, protects them against TS-induced deleterious effects on the immune system and platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tribulatti1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Risso1">[17]</xref>. In this sense, it is well known that antibodies against neuraminidases are also effective in preventing other diseases such as Influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Webster1">[44]</xref>. These protective effects are very much promising to delineate a therapeutic tool. The high molecular weight of antibodies constitutes a main drawback in their use, due to eventual hindrance for effective diffusion into infected tissues, where high concentrations of locally produced TS are expected to be found. On the other hand, Fab fragments, small recombinant antibody-derived molecules (e.g. scFv), or yet antibody-mimetic engineered molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Stumpp1">[45]</xref>, can be cleared exceedingly fast from the bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Holliger1">[46]</xref>, resulting in poor pharmacokinetic figures. PEGylation, and other modifications to improve bioavailability of these smaller protein scaffolds, constitute interesting approaches to be tested using mAb 13G9 as starting lead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Natarajan1">[47]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As a second interesting avenue to explore for therapeutic derivatives, the high affinity and specificity of this mAb, prompted us to elucidate its neutralizing mechanism, as an attempt to thereafter conceive low molecular weight inhibitors, suitable as chemotherapy leads. Some information can be gathered in this respect from previous studies of the neuraminidase from Influenza virus, a protein orthologous to TS. The overall geometry of the antibody/TS association that we are now reporting, is reminiscent of the one described for a Fab/Influenza-N2 neuraminidase complex (PDB 2AEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Venkatramani1">[48]</xref>), which shows interaction with enzyme's loops on the same side of the reaction pocket, opposite to the patch where most other anti-neuraminidase antibodies have been reported (such as the ones involving avian N9 neuraminidase with antibodies NC41 and NC10, PDBs 1NCA and 1NMB, respectively; among others) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Tulip1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Malby1">[51]</xref>. The interaction surfaces of TS-13G9 mAb (this report) and N2NA-Mem5Fab (2AEP) are largely overlapping, although the antibodies are bound in inverted configurations with respect to the location of the heavy and light chains. Well defined escape mutations in Influenza (loops including positions 198–199 and 220–221, following N2 Influenza numbering scheme) identify epidemiologically important antigenic sites of neuraminidase, revealing antigenic drift in human viruses seemingly under natural antibody selection of enzyme variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Gulati1">[52]</xref>. These loops, connecting β2–β3 within the second blade of the six-bladed β-propeller domain, and β4 of this blade with β1 of the next one, are not structurally conserved between <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and Influenza enzymes, being longer in the former. Nevertheless, it is clear that the equivalent loops in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> TS do play a critical role in the 13G9 Fab association that we are now reporting.</p>
      <p>One of the specific mAb loops that interact in a proximal position to the catalytic pocket of the enzyme, was observed precluding the displacement of Y<sub>119</sub>, a critical residue that has already been shown to be flexible in TS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Buschiazzo2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Amaya1">[53]</xref>. Indeed, the mobility of Y<sub>119</sub> plays a key role in the <italic>trans</italic>-glycosidase mechanism of TS. The determination of the three-dimensional coordinates of the paratope, including these features that lead to spatial constraints, uncovers relevant information. This is to be used as a precise guide, not only to undertake peptidomimetic syntheses, but most importantly, to use as a working template for the synthesis of non-peptidic molecules including critical pharmacophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002474-Cohen1">[54]</xref>.</p>
