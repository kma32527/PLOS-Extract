        <p>Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the causative agent of a major disease of livestock (bluetongue). For over two decades, it has been widely accepted that the 10 segments of the dsRNA genome of BTV encode for 7 structural and 3 non-structural proteins. The non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3/NS3a) play different key roles during the viral replication cycle. In this study we show that BTV expresses a fourth non-structural protein (that we designated NS4) encoded by an open reading frame in segment 9 overlapping the open reading frame encoding VP6. NS4 is 77–79 amino acid residues in length and highly conserved among several BTV serotypes/strains. NS4 was expressed early post-infection and localized in the nucleoli of BTV infected cells. By reverse genetics, we showed that NS4 is dispensable for BTV replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, both in mammalian and insect cells, and does not affect viral virulence in murine models of bluetongue infection. Interestingly, NS4 conferred a replication advantage to BTV-8, but not to BTV-1, in cells in an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral state. However, the BTV-1 NS4 conferred a replication advantage both to a BTV-8 reassortant containing the entire segment 9 of BTV-1 and to a BTV-8 mutant with the NS4 identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein. Collectively, this study suggests that NS4 plays an important role in virus-host interaction and is one of the mechanisms played, at least by BTV-8, to counteract the antiviral response of the host. In addition, the distinct nucleolar localization of NS4, being expressed by a virus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, offers new avenues to investigate the multiple roles played by the nucleolus in the biology of the cell.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Bluetongue is a major infectious disease of ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), an “arbovirus” transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts by biting midges. Historically, bluetongue has been endemic almost exclusively in temperate and tropical areas of the world. However, in the last decade BTV has spread extensively in several geographical areas causing a serious burden to both animal health and the economy. BTV possesses a double-stranded RNA segmented genome. For over two decades, it has been widely accepted that the 10 segments of BTV genome encode for 7 structural and 3 non-structural proteins. In this study we discovered that BTV expresses a previously uncharacterized non-structural protein that we designated NS4. Although BTV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, we found NS4 to localize in the nucleoli of the infected cells. Our study shows that NS4 is not needed for viral replication both in mammalian and insect cells, and in mice. However, NS4 confers a replication advantage to BTV in cells in an antiviral state induced by interferon. In conclusion, we have elucidated a possible route by which BTV can counteract the defences of the host.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bluetongue is a major infectious disease of ruminants caused by an arbovirus (Bluetongue virus, BTV) transmitted by biting midges (<italic>Culicoides spp.</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mellor1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-SchwartzCornil1">[3]</xref>. Historically, bluetongue has been endemic almost exclusively in temperate and tropical areas of the world where the climatic conditions favour both the spread of the susceptible insect vector population and the virus replication cycle within the vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Erasmus1">[4]</xref>. However, in the last decade BTV has spread extensively in several geographical areas including Southern Europe and also, unexpectedly, in Northern Europe causing a serious burden to both animal health and the economy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Maclachlan2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Wilson1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>From a molecular and structural virology perspective BTV is one of the best understood animal viruses. BTV is a member of the <italic>Orbivirus</italic> genus, within the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family, and possesses a double-stranded RNA genome formed by 10 segments (Seg-1 to Seg-10) of approximately 19200 base pairs in total <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mellor1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-SchwartzCornil1">[3]</xref>. Until now, the BTV genome has been shown to encode for 7 structural and 3 non-structural proteins. The BTV genome is packaged within a triple layered icosahedral protein capsid of approximately 90 nm in diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mellor1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Grimes1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Roy1">[10]</xref>. The outer capsid of the virion is composed by 60 trimers of VP2 and 120 trimers of VP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Zhang1">[11]</xref> and differences within this outer capsid define the 26 BTV serotypes which have been described so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Hofmann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Maan1">[13]</xref>. The outer capsid proteins, and VP2 in particular, stimulate virus neutralizing antibodies which in general protect only against the homologous serotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-DeMaula1">[14]</xref>. The internal core is formed by two layers, constituted by VP3 (sub-core) and the immunodominant VP7 (intermediate layer) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Grimes1">[7]</xref>. Three minor enzymatic proteins, VP1 (RNA dependent RNA polymerase), VP4 (capping enzyme and transmethylase) and VP6 (RNA dependent ATPase and helicase) are contained within the core that is transcriptionally active in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mertens1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Wehrfritz1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The BTV genome encodes also 3 non-structural proteins: NS1, NS2 and NS3/NS3a. NS1 and NS2 are highly expressed viral proteins and their multimers are morphological features of BTV-infected cells. Multimers of the NS1 protein form tubules (approximately 50 nm in diameter and up to 1000 nm in length) that appear to be linked to cellular cytopathogenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Owens1">[22]</xref>, while NS2 is the major component of the viral inclusion bodies. NS2 plays a key role in viral replication and assembly as it has a high affinity for single stranded RNA and possesses phosphohydrolase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Horscroft1">[23]</xref>. NS3/NS3a are glycosylated proteins involved in BTV exit. There are two isoforms of NS3: NS3 and NS3a with the latter lacking the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Celma1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Boyce2">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the segmented genome of BTV has been thought to be monocistronic (i.e. ten genome segments encoding for 10 proteins) for almost three decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mertens2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-VanDijk1">[28]</xref>. Segment 9 however, contains the open reading frame (ORF) encoding VP6 but also a smaller coding sequence in the position +1 reading frame that is present in BTV and some related <italic>Orbiviruses</italic> such as African horse sickness virus and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Firth1">[29]</xref>. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the BTV “ORFX” encodes for a protein of 77–79 amino acid residues. This putative ORFX is subject to functional constraints at the amino acid level and its level of conservation is higher compared to that of the overlapping VP6. In addition, the ORFX putative AUG initiation codon has a strong Kozak context suggesting that this protein might be translated by leaky scanning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Firth1">[29]</xref>. Alternative reading frames are expressed in a variety of RNA viruses and they can play fundamental roles in viral replication and virus-host interaction. In this study, we identified a previously unknown non-structural protein and characterized its biological properties.</p>

        <p>Initially, the open reading frame expressing ORFX (NS4) was amplified by PCR from BTV-10 (GenBank accession number D00509) and cloned into the pCI Mammalian Expression Vector (Promega) resulting into pCI-NS4. The BTV-8 NS4 was cloned into the peGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), resulting in plasmid pNS4-GFP. pNS4<sub>7–77</sub>-GFP, pNS4<sub>13–77</sub>-GFP and pNS4<sub>19–77</sub>-GFP are mutants derived from pNS4-GFP expressing NS4 truncated of the amino terminal 6, 12 and 18 amino acid residues, respectively. pNS4<sub>7–77</sub>-GFP, pNS4<sub>13–77</sub>-GFP and pNS4<sub>19–77</sub>-GFP maintain the methionine and valine residues in position 1 and 2 of NS4. Note that BTV-10 and BTV-1 NS4 are 100% identical at the amino acid level. While BTV-8 and BTV-1 NS4 differ for a single amino acid residue in position 6. The set of BTV-1 and BTV-8 plasmids necessary to rescue these viruses <italic>in vitro</italic> by reverse genetics were obtained following the method recently published by Boyce and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Boyce2">[26]</xref>. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from infected cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each BTV genome segment was amplified by RT-PCR using the AccuScript PfuUltra II RT-PCR Kit (Agilent) from either BTV-1 or BTV-8 dsRNA preparations and the resulting PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen) and cloned into either pUC57 (Fermentas) or pCI. Each BTV segment was cloned downstream of a T7 promoter and upstream of a <italic>BsaI</italic> or <italic>SapI</italic> restriction site. All of the mutants described in this study were obtained using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All plasmids used in this study were completely sequenced before use. Sequences of PCR primers used in this study are available upon request. Antisera used in this study included polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against BTV VP7, NS1, NS2, NS3 and ORFX (NS4) expressed in bacteria as Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant proteins (Proteintech Group, Inc.). Antiserum against BTV-1 NS4 was raised against a recombinant GST fusion protein including the entire NS4 protein expressed in bacteria. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against BTV VP6 was kindly provided by Polly Roy as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Matsuo1">[32]</xref>.

        <p>BTV-8 (IAH reference collection number NET2006/04) was originally isolated from a naturally infected sheep during the 2006 outbreak in Northern Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Maan2">[33]</xref>. The virus was passaged once in KC cells and once in BHK<sub>21</sub> cells. The reference strain of BTV-1 was originally isolated at the ARC – Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (IAH reference collection number RSArrrr/01) and was adapted to cell culture by passaging it twice in embryonated eggs and 9 times in BHK<sub>21</sub> cells. Both viruses were kindly provided by Peter Mertens. Virus stocks were prepared by infecting BSR cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and collecting the supernatant when obvious cytpopathic effect (CPE) was observed.

Monolayers of 95% confluent BSR cells grown in 12 well plates were transfected twice with BTV RNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Firstly, 0.5×10<sup>11</sup> (BTV-1) or 1×10<sup>11</sup> (BTV-8) molecules of each of the BTV segments encoding VP1, VP3, VP4, NS1, VP6 and NS2 were diluted in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium containing 0.5 U/µL of RNAsin plus (Promega) and then mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium. After 25 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added to the cells. 16 to 18 h after the first transfection, the cells were transfected as before but with all 10 BTV segments. 3 to 4 h after the second transfection the cells were overlaid with 2 ml of minimal essential media containing 1.5% agarose type VII and 2% FBS, and monitored for development of plaques. Finally, individual BTV rescued clones were picked through the agarose overlay and used to infect fresh BSR cells in order to obtain a virus stock. Where necessary, BTV dsRNA was extracted from infected cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). The ssRNA fraction was precipitated using lithium chloride, and the harvested dsRNA fraction was precipitated using isopropanol in the presence of sodium acetate.</p>

A stretch of 11 basic amino acid residues is present in the N terminal portion of the protein (residues 3 to 20). In addition, there are two putative alpha helices. Of note, the C terminal helix (residues 34 to 75) contains a conserved leucine zipper domain, with leucine residues at positions 49, 56, 63 and 70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

The NS4 coding sequence is located in the +1 open reading frame (ORF) between nucleotides 182 to 418. VP6 (residues 57 to 135) and NS4 (residues 1 to 79) amino acid conservation plots are shown. NS4 secondary structure prediction indicated the presence of two putative α-helices, drawn in blue and red. The N-terminal domain (blue) is highly basic and the C-terminal domain (red) contains a conserved leucine zipper motif.

        <p>We generated a polyclonal antiserum towards ORFX, in order to assess whether BTV expressed this previously uncharacterized protein. We detected ORFX in BSR cells infected with either BTV-8 or BTV-1 by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Controls included BSR cells transfected with plasmids expressing ORFX either in its native form, or with eGFP fused to its C terminus. These data confirm that BTV expresses a protein encoded by an alternative reading frame located in segment 9.</p>
        <p>We subsequently investigated whether ORFX was a structural or non-structural protein. We infected BFAE cells with BTV-1 and analysed supernatants (containing viral particles) and total cellular protein extracts. Unusually for mammalian cell lines, BFAE cells show very little BTV induced cytopathic effect (CPE), thus facilitating the efficient discrimination between all BTV proteins present in the cellular fraction and the structural proteins present in purified and concentrated viral particles released from infected cells. By western blotting, we detected NS1 and ORFX in the cellular fraction, while VP7 was abundantly present in the viral fraction (concentrated by ultracentrifugation) and barely visible in the cellular fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We obtained the same results by infecting C6/36 mosquito cells (data not shown). We detected VP6 in both the cellular and the viral fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, unlike VP7, VP6 appeared to be relatively more abundant in cell lysates compared to the viral pellets, suggesting that there is an intracellular pool of this protein that is not incorporated in the BTV virions.</p>
        <p>The absence of ORFX in the viral pellet strongly suggested that this is a non-structural protein expressed by BTV. In light of these data, we designated this protein NS4. NS4 was also expressed <italic>in vivo,</italic> as shown by immunohistochemistry of brain sections of mice inoculated intracerebrally with BTV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <p>The data above clearly show that a previously uncharacterized BTV protein, here referred to as NS4, is a non-structural protein that localises to the nucleolus of infected cells.

        <title>BTV NS4 confers a replication advantage to BTV-8, but not BTV-1, in mammalian cells treated with interferon</title>
        <p>BTV, like most RNA viruses, is a strong inducer of interferon, both <italic>in vivo</italic> in its natural hosts and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Foster1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Rinaldo1">[44]</xref>. Given that other RNA viruses express proteins that counteract the innate immunity of the host, we hypothesised that NS4 might aid BTV replication in the presence of interferon (IFN). We treated cells with two type I IFNs: IFN <italic>tau</italic> (IFNT) and universal IFN (UIFN). IFNT is secreted by the ruminant conceptus and it is intimately linked to pregnancy recognition signalling and possesses antiviral activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Bazer1">[45]</xref> while UIFN is an alpha interferon hybrid constructed from recombinant Human IFNs alpha A and alpha D, and is known to stimulate an antiviral response in a wide variety of mammalian cells.</p>
        <p>CPT-Tert cells were pre-treated with IFNT or UIFN for 20 h prior to infection with BTV-1 or BTV-8 (or mock infection) with MOIs ranging from 0.001 to 0.1. Both wt and the ΔNS4 mutants, destroyed 80 to 100% (depending on the MOI used) of the monolayer of infected cells in absence of IFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g006">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, pre-treatment with both types of IFN significantly reduced BTV-induced CPE. Interestingly, in the presence of IFN, BTV-8 wt consistently induced a more pronounced CPE than BTV8-ΔNS4. Conversely, only minor differences were observed in the CPE induced by both wt BTV-1 and BTV-1ΔNS4 in the presence of IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we performed multi-step virus growth curves in order to further assess the replication of BTV wt and ΔNS4 in the presence or absence of IFN. CPT-Tert cells were treated with interferon, as described above, and infected at a MOI of 0.01 with wt and mutant viruses. At 24, 48 and 72 h post infection the cell supernatants were collected and the virus titrated in susceptible cells.</p>
        <p>BTV-8ΔNS4 consistently reached lower titres (approximately 10 to 25 fold) than wt BTV-8 in cells treated with 1000 AVU/ml of either IFNT or UIFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Similar to what was observed in the IFN protection assays, there was no discernable difference in the replication growth of BTV-1 and BTV-1ΔNS4 after treatment with either IFNT or UIFN. Similar patterns with both BTV-1 and BTV-8 wt and the ΔNS4 mutant viruses where observed when the input viruses were used at a MOI of 0.1 and 0.001 in CPT-Tert (data not shown), or in BFAE cells treated with UIFN and infected at a MOI of 0.1 (data not shown).</p>

        <p>We next ruled out that the mutations inserted in segment 9 of BTV-8ΔNS4 had a negative effect on VP6 expression (the other protein expressed by segment 9). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, BTV-8 wt and BTV-8ΔNS4 express similar amounts of VP6, reinforcing the notion that the biological differences observed between these two viruses were indeed due to the expression of NS4.</p>

        <p>Therefore, the data presented so far suggested that either the BTV-1 NS4 was somewhat defective or that the influence of this protein on viral replication in the presence of IFN varies from strain to strain. In order to discern between these two possibilities, we derived BTV-8 reassortants containing either segment 9 of BTV-1 (BTV-8/1S9) or the ΔNS4 version (BTV-8/1S9ΔNS4). Similarly, we derived BTV-1 reassortants containing the wild type or mutated segment 9 of BTV-8 (BTV-1/8S9 and BTV-1/8S9ΔNS4). In addition, we obtained a BTV-8 recombinant (BTV-8/1NS4) with a single amino acid residue mutated in the NS4 (S to N in position 6) in order to render this protein identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Both cytopathic protection assays and multistep growth assays clearly showed that BTV-8/1S9 replicated more efficiently than BTV-8/1S9ΔNS4 in the presence of IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002477-g008">Figure 8C, D</xref>). Similar results were obtained with BTV-8/1NS4, which replicated more efficiently than BTV-8ΔNS4 in cells pre-treated with IFN, while no major differences were observed between BTV-1/8S9 and BTV-1/8S9ΔNS4. Collectively, these data strongly indicate that the NS4 of BTV-1 is not defective and can function within the context of BTV-8.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we have shown that BTV expresses a previously uncharacterised non- structural protein that favours viral replication in cells in an antiviral state. By constructing deletion mutants by reverse genetics, we showed that NS4 is dispensable for viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, both in mammalian and insect cells, and <italic>in vivo</italic> in murine experimental models. However, the coding sequence in the NS4 reading frame of segment 9 is highly conserved in BTV and in related <italic>Orbiviruses</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Firth1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Firth2">[50]</xref>, suggesting that it must be essential for the maintenance of BTV in nature. Indeed, we have found that NS4 confers a replication advantage to BTV-8 in cells pre-treated with type I IFN.</p>
      <p>We found NS4 to have strong nucleolar localization, although it may shuttle between the nucleolus and cytoplasm and possibly carry out its biological functions in the latter. The nucleolus is a dynamic sub-nuclear structure that plays crucial roles in ribosome subunit biogenesis, the response to cellular stress and cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Boisvert1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Boulon1">[52]</xref>. Several examples of viral proteins targeting the nucleolus have been discovered in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Hiscox1">[53]</xref>. The retroviral Rev and Rev-like proteins for example, shuttle between the nucleolus and cytoplasm, and function as post-transcriptional regulators of viral gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Brandt1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mertz1">[57]</xref>. One of the main functions of these proteins is to facilitate the export of unspliced viral mRNA (transcribed from the proviral DNA copy of the retroviral genome stably integrated in the cell genome) by simultaneously binding an RNA structure in the viral RNA and the karyopherin export factor Crm1 (chromosome region maintenance 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Neville1">[58]</xref>. Other RNA viruses (including those that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm) have also been found to possess proteins that target the nucleoli. Examples include, among others, avian infectious bronchitis virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Hiscox2">[59]</xref>, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Lee1">[60]</xref>, Newcastle disease virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Peeples1">[61]</xref>, Semliki forest virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Michel1">[62]</xref>, dengue virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Wang1">[63]</xref>, West Nile virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Yang1">[64]</xref>, influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Volmer1">[65]</xref>, avian reovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-VazquezIglesias1">[66]</xref> and encephalomyocarditis virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Aminev1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Aminev2">[68]</xref> The reasons for the nucleolar targeting of many of these proteins have not always been entirely clear.</p>
      <p>The avian reovirus σA protein is a structural protein and is a major component of the inner capsid shell. Although the σA protein localises mainly in viral factories in the cytoplasm of infected cells, it also localizes in the nucleoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-VazquezIglesias1">[66]</xref>. σA has a strong affinity for dsRNA and it may provide protection against the IFN-induced and dsRNA dependent PKR response. Interestingly, σA mutants that do not bind dsRNA are also unable to reach the nucleoli, suggesting that dsRNA binding and nucleolar targeting may be strictly linked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-GonzalezLopez1">[69]</xref>.</p>
      <p>BTV NS4 may also bind nucleic acids but, unlike the reovirus σA, we show strong evidence that NS4 is not a structural protein. Indeed, by western blotting we did not detect NS4 in viral particles but only in lysates of BTV infected cells. In addition, by confocal microscopy we did not detect NS4 in viral inclusion bodies but predominantly in the nucleoli of viral infected cells. We cannot exclude completely that small amounts of NS4, below the limits of detection of our western blotting analysis, are present in viral particles.</p>
      <p>The predicted structural features of NS4 resemble those of a transcription factor of the bZip family with a basic domain followed by a leucine zipper motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Vinson1">[70]</xref>. Thus, NS4 may function as a nucleic acid binding protein and either repress or enhance transcription of genes linked directly or indirectly to the IFN response of the cell. However, a BTV-8 recombinant virus (BTV-8ΔLZNS4) expressing an NS4 with all the 4 leucine residues forming the putative leucine zipper mutated (into either glutamine or serine) replicated as efficiently as BTV-8 wt in cells pre-treated with IFN (data not shown). Thus, more studies will be necessary to explore this possibility.</p>
      <p>The organization of VP6/NS4 ORFs in segment 9 of BTV mirrors that of NSP5/NSP6 in the rotavirus segment 11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Estes1">[71]</xref>. The rotavirus NSP6 is not essential for virus replication but unlike the BTV NS4, does not localize in the nucleus of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Rainsford1">[72]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To date, limited information is available on the interplay between BTV and the host innate immune system. BTV has been recognized as a potent inducer of type I IFN in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Foster1">[42]</xref>, cattle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-MacLachlan1">[43]</xref> and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Jameson1">[73]</xref>. However, limited data have been available on how BTV induces the IFN response of the cell and, more importantly, what counteracting measures the virus utilises to overcome this response. Our data suggest that BTV may use NS4 to defend itself from the innate immune response of the host given that replication of BTV8-ΔNS4 in cells treated with IFN is 10 to 25 fold less efficient compared to wild type BTV-8. In addition, the cytopathic effect in cells treated with IFN is more pronounced when cells are infected by wild type BTV-8 compared to cells infected by BTV8-ΔNS4.</p>
      <p>Viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to evade the host innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Randall1">[74]</xref>. Other dsRNA viruses such as rotaviruses, use different mechanisms (which vary between strains and the type of infected cells) to modulate the type I IFN response. For example, rotaviruses use NSP1 protein to promote the proteasome-dependent degradation of IRF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Arnold1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Feng1">[77]</xref> and mediate repression of NF-kB, resulting in a reduction of IFN induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Sherry1">[78]</xref>. Rotaviruses also induce shut off of cellular protein synthesis resulting from the detection of dsRNA by PKR which, in turn is responsible for phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Rojas1">[79]</xref>. The blocking of host cell protein synthesis is another likely strategy used by some RNA viruses to counteract the IFN response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Aminev1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Aminev2">[68]</xref>. BTV also blocks host cell protein synthesis early after infection, although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Mertens2">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we found that BTV1-ΔNS4 replicated as efficiently as wild type BTV-1, even in cells treated with IFN. However, the NS4 of BTV-1 appears to possess the same biological properties of the NS4 of BTV-8. Indeed, a BTV-8 reassortant containing the entire segment 9 of BTV-1 (BTV-8/1S9) or a recombinant BTV-8 expressing an NS4 100% identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein (BTV-8/1NS4), maintained the phenotype of wt BTV-8. Thus, it is possible that the role played by NS4 in counteracting the IFN response of the host could vary between different virus strains. It is important to stress that the strain of BTV-8 that we used in this study has been passaged only a few times in culture (once in KC cells and three times in BHK<sub>21</sub> cells) after isolation from blood of an infected animal. On the other hand, BTV-1 was derived from the “reference” South African strain passaged twice in embryonated eggs and 9 times in BHK<sub>21</sub>. BTV-1 appears to grow slightly faster than BTV-8 in culture, especially at the early time points post infection. Thus, faster replication may help BTV1-ΔNS4 to escape the IFN response of the cell more efficiently, as already suggested for some strains of influenza, and this may render NS4 less critical in these <italic>in vitro</italic> assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002477-Grimm1">[80]</xref>.</p>
      <p>More <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments will be needed in order to determine the role of NS4 in the interplay with the natural host of BTV infection. We observed no differences between wild type BTV-8 and BTV8-ΔNS4 in experimental mouse models, although it remains possible that differences could be identified in sheep. It is possible that NS4 is required for viral replication in insects, although we have established in this study that no differences are observed on the replication of the ΔNS4 mutants in insect cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in the present study we have identified a previously uncharacterized non-structural protein of BTV. The identification of this highly conserved protein opens the way to understand finer details of virus-host interaction and pathogenesis. In addition, the distinct nucleolar localization, in a virus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm will offer new avenues to understand the various roles played by these organelles in the biology of the cell.</p>
