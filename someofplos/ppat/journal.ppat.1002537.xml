        <p>Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. In this paper, we show that an essential translation factor, Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast, directly affects replication of <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> (TBSV). To separate the role of Ded1p in viral protein translation from its putative replication function, we utilized a cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p. The <italic>in vitro</italic> data show that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex and Ded1p binds to the 3′-end of the viral minus-stranded RNA. The data obtained with wt and ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants support the model that Ded1p unwinds local structures at the 3′-end of the TBSV (−)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is another host factor for TBSV, play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (−)RNA and the replication proteins. In addition, we have developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for Flock house virus (FHV), a small RNA virus of insects, that also demonstrated positive effect on FHV replicase activity by the added Ded1p helicase. Thus, two small RNA viruses, which do not code for their own helicases, seems to recruit a host RNA helicase to aid their replication in infected cells.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Subverted host factors play a role in plus-strand RNA virus replication. Small RNA viruses do not code for their own helicases and they might recruit host RNA helicases to aid their replication in infected cells. In this paper, the authors show that the Ded1p DEAD-box helicase, which is an essential translation factor in yeast, is recruited by <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> (TBSV) into its replicase complex. They also show that Ded1p binds to the viral (−)RNA and promotes (+)-strand TBSV synthesis when added to a yeast-based cell-free extract depleted for Ded1p. An ATPase defective Ded1p mutant failed to promote TBSV replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the helicase activity of Ded1p is essential for its function during TBSV replication. In addition, the authors also show that another host protein, which also binds to the (−)RNA, namely glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), further enhances TBSV (+)RNA when added together with Ded1p to yeast-based cell-free extract. In summary, the authors show that the major functions of Ded1p and GAPDH host proteins are to promote TBSV replication via selectively enhancing (+)-strand synthesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>All eukaryotic plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses have similar replication cycles in infected cells. After translation of their mRNA-sense genomic RNA(s), the viral RNA and the viral replication proteins are recruited to the site of viral replication in membranous compartments. After the assembly of the membrane-bound viral replicase complexes (VRC), the viral replicase uses the viral RNA as a template to produce complementary (−)RNA. This is then followed by (+)-strand synthesis in an asymmetric manner, producing excess amounts of (+)-strand progeny, which is released from replication for other viral processes. For efficient replication, (+)RNA viruses recruit numerous host proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy3">[5]</xref>. Among the identified host proteins are RNA-binding proteins, such as translation factors, ribosomal proteins and RNA-modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy1">[1]</xref>. The co-opted host proteins likely affect several steps in viral RNA replication, including the assembly of the replicase complex and/or viral RNA synthesis. However, the functions of host factors in (+)RNA virus replication are known only for a small number of host factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> (TBSV) is a model plant RNA virus that is used intensively for identification and characterization of host factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy5">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy7">[12]</xref>. The single genomic RNA codes for two replication proteins, p33 and p92<sup>pol</sup>, which are sufficient to support TBSV replicon (rep)RNA replication in yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) model host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Panavas1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Panaviene1">[14]</xref>. p33 and p92<sup>pol</sup> are components of the membrane-bound VRC that also requires the tombusviral (+)repRNA as a platform during its assembly and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy6">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Panaviene2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pathak1">[17]</xref>. Recent genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches with TBSV based on yeast revealed a large number of host factors interacting with viral components or affecting TBSV replication. A large fraction of the identified host proteins are RNA binding proteins, which might affect viral RNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy5">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Kushner1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Jiang1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The highly purified tombusvirus VRC is known to contain at least six permanent resident host proteins, including the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Hsp70, Ssa1/2p in yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Wang1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Serva1">[24]</xref>, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by <italic>TDH2</italic> and <italic>TDH3</italic> in yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Wang3">[25]</xref>, pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Serva1">[24]</xref>, Cdc34p E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Serva1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li2">[26]</xref>, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li3">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li4">[28]</xref>, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1Bgamma (eEF1Bγ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Sasvari1">[29]</xref> and two temporary resident proteins, Pex19p shuttle protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pathak2">[30]</xref> and the Vps23p adaptor ESCRT protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Barajas1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Barajas2">[32]</xref>. Although the functions of several of these proteins have been studied in some details, additional host proteins might be also present in tombusvirus VRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy3">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy5">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Wang1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pogany2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Wang3">[25]</xref>. One of the intriguing questions is if tombusviruses use host-coded helicases for their replication. This is because, unlike larger RNA viruses, the tombusvirus genome does not code for a protein with helicase function. Thus, can tombusviruses and other small RNA viruses replicate without the use of a helicase or they subvert a cellular helicase(s) to assist their replication?</p>
      <p>DEAD-box proteins constitute the largest family of RNA helicases that are involved in all aspects of cellular metabolism and perform RNA duplex unwinding and remodeling of RNA-protein complexes in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Linder1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Cordin1">[35]</xref>. Ded1p, which is essential for yeast growth, is among the best-characterized DEAD-box helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Chen1">[36]</xref>. It is involved in initiation of translation of every yeast mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Mayas1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Linder3">[39]</xref> and down-regulation of Ded1p level also reduced p33 and p92 levels in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Jiang1">[20]</xref>. Therefore, not surprisingly, TBSV replication also decreased significantly in yeast with reduced level of Ded1p. Due to its essential role in translation, it is critical to separate the possible role of Ded1p in viral replication from its effect on viral translation.</p>
      <p>In this paper, a yeast-based cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p was used to test the role of Ded1p in TBSV replication. We define that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand (+)RNA synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus VRC and binds to the 3′-end of the viral minus-stranded (−)RNA. The obtained data support the model that Ded1p unwinds the 3′-end of the TBSV (−)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and GAPDH play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (−)RNA and the replication proteins.</p>

        <title>Reduced level of TBSV RNA replication in yeast cell-free extract depleted for Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase</title>
        <p>Since Ded1p is an essential translation factor for all yeast mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Iost1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Linder3">[39]</xref>, it is difficult to separate its direct versus indirect effect on TBSV replication in yeast model host. To circumvent this problem, we used whole cell extracts (CFE) prepared from yeast containing reduced level of Ded1p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s001">Figure S1</xref>) to support cell-free TBSV replication. As we have shown previously, TBSV (+)RNA can perform one complete cycle of replication in the CFE-based replication assay when purified recombinant p33 and p92<sup>pol</sup> replication proteins are provided <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pogany2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pogany3">[40]</xref>. The CFE-based replication assay showed that both (+) and (−)RNA synthesis decreased by over 4-fold when Ded1p was down-regulated as compared with the control CFE prepared from yeast with high level of Ded1p expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes 4–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s006">6</xref> versus 1–3). Thus, these data confirm that Ded1p is important for TBSV replication. However, the observed decrease in the CFE-based TBSV replication could be due to either reduced replication when Ded1p is limiting (direct effect) or lesser amounts of other critical host factors needed for TBSV replication in the CFE with reduced level of Ded1p (indirect effect due to Ded1p's role in host translation). To address these points, we first studied if Ded1p is present within the tombusvirus replicase and then, what is the mechanistic role of Ded1p during TBSV RNA synthesis.</p>

        <title>Ded1p is co-purified with the tombusvirus replicase</title>

The control yeast also expressed the tombusvirus replication proteins (including the 6×His-tagged p33, but lacking FLAG-tag) and the HA-tagged Ded1p from yeast chromosome based on the native promoter and supported TBSV repRNA replication (not shown).</p>

        <title>Recombinant Ded1p DEAD-box helicase enhances TBSV RNA replication in yeast cell-free extract</title>
        <p>To address if Ded1p could play a direct role in TBSV replication, we added purified recombinant Ded1p to yeast CFE with reduced level of Ded1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed a ∼2-fold increased level of TBSV RNA replication (based on total single-stranded repRNA level) in the presence of recombinant Ded1p when compared with the MBP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2 versus 4). Interestingly, the amount of double-stranded RNA, which correlates with (−)-strand levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pogany2">[23]</xref>, did not increase in the presence of Ded1p in the CFE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 versus 3). This finding suggests that (−)-strand RNA did not contribute to the 2-fold increase in total TBSV RNA levels when recombinant Ded1p was added to the CFE-based replication assay. Therefore, we conclude that the added recombinant Ded1p selectively increased TBSV (+)-strand RNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>RNA viruses form several different ribonucleic acid-protein complexes (RNP) in infected cells during various steps of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li1">[9]</xref>. Since the viral RNA plays multiple roles during infection, it is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNP complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases or RNA chaperones. Accordingly, the larger RNA viruses all code for RNA helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Koonin1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Zuniga1">[52]</xref>. However, RNA viruses with shorter than 6 kB genomes usually do not code for RNA helicases. They could still use RNA helicases during infections if they can subvert selected host helicases for viral purposes. Indeed, we show here that Ded1p helicase is recruited for TBSV replication to aid (+)-strand RNA synthesis.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known if Ded1p is the only host helicase needed for TBSV replication, since genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches with TBSV have identified additional host helicases as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Nagy5">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li4">[28]</xref>. However, Ded1p helicase seems to be an ideal host factor to be recruited for viral replication because it is involved in mRNA and viral RNA translation, thus it is co-localized with the viral RNA prior to replication. Also, by recruiting Ded1p, viruses could affect RNA degradation (P-body formation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Beckham1">[53]</xref>) and initiation of translation of new RNAs, likely affecting subsequent host translation (including virus-induced mRNAs coding for anti-viral proteins or required for anti-viral signaling).</p>
      <p>The essential nature of Ded1p for host mRNA translation, however, makes characterization of Ded1p function as a host factor difficult. Therefore, the combined use of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches might be necessary to dissect the function of Ded1p in RNA virus replication as shown in this paper. By using a Ded1p-depleted yeast CFE in combination with recombinant Ded1p allowed us to define that the ATPase (helicase) activity of Ded1p is required for efficient TBSV (+)-strand synthesis (see below). Ded1p also increased the RdRp activity of the FHV replicase, suggesting that recruitment of DEAD-box helicases might also be useful for additional small RNA viruses (see below).</p>

        <title>Ded1p helicase is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex</title>
        <p>Co-purification experiments revealed that Ded1p is present in the tombusviral VRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, Ded1p affected (+)-strand synthesis, but not the assembly of the VRC <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g004">4</xref>), indicating that Ded1p is likely present in the VRC. Surprisingly, Ded1p, unlike other previously tested host factors Hsp70, GAPDH, or eEF1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Wang1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Pogany2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li3">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Huang2">[54]</xref>, was able to affect TBSV repRNA replication even after the replicase assembly step took place <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that Ded1p can enter the membrane-bound VRC, possibly due to its interaction with p33 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s006">Figure S6</xref>) and the helicase activity of Ded1p might lead to some remodeling of VRC.</p>
        <p>It is not yet known if additional members of the large helicase family could perform similar function to Ded1p during TBSV replication. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data with AtRH20 plant helicase protein, which is very similar to Ded1p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s007">Figure S7</xref>), suggests that this protein can likely perform similar function in plant infections. For example, AtRH20 has been shown to boost TBSV (+)RNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and bind to p33 replication protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s006">Figure S6A</xref>), which can facilitate its recruitment into the VRC. Since more than 50 RNA helicases are present in plants, further experiments will be needed to define if additional host helicases might also be involved in TBSV replication.</p>

        <title>Role of Ded1p helicase in stimulation of TBSV RNA synthesis</title>
        <p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> data, based on the CFE assay containing the membrane-bound VRC as well as the solubilized/purified tombusvirus replicase, showed the Ded1p can mainly stimulate TBSV (+)-strand synthesis, while its effect on (−)RNA synthesis is less pronounced. The ATPase activity of Ded1p is required for this stimulatory effect, suggesting that the helicase function of Ded1p is likely important for unwinding the secondary structure of (−)RNA template with the purified tombusvirus replicase or destabilizing the replication intermediate with the membrane-bound VRC, which might contain dsRNA structure. This function of Ded1p can explain why yeast with down-regulated Ded1p level produced small amount of (+)-stranded RNA progeny, albeit it has also shown that depleted Ded1p reduced the level of p33/p92 in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Jiang1">[20]</xref>. However, the decreased p33/p92 levels are expected to reduce both (+) and (−)RNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Jaag1">[55]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002537.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Since the recombinant Ded1p enhanced (+)-strand synthesis by the purified recombinant tombusvirus replicase, we propose that Ded1p directly affect TBSV RNA synthesis via affecting the structure of the RNA templates. However, we cannot exclude that Ded1p could also affect the activity of the VRC due to its interaction with p33, albeit the assembly of the VRC was not affected by Ded1p in the CFE-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, the recruitment of a host DEAD-box helicase for replication of a small RNA virus is remarkable, since RNA viruses with less than 6 kB genomes are usually do not code for their own helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Koonin1">[51]</xref>. These viruses are thought to replicate without needing a helicase by using RNA chaperones or possibly recruiting host helicases. The emerging picture with TBSV is that this virus utilizes both the viral-coded p33 RNA chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Stork1">[48]</xref> and the host Ded1p helicase for replication by promoting (+)-strand synthesis. Both p33 and Ded1p have been shown to open up short DNA/RNA duplexes, although the activity of Ded1p was more robust than that of p33 <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Stork1">[48]</xref>. Why would TBSV utilize both an RNA chaperone and an RNA helicase? It is possible that both proteins are needed for robust (+)RNA synthesis to make excess amount of progeny RNA. Also, Ded1p helicase could be involved in remodeling the viral RNA bound by the viral RdRp or host proteins prior or during RNA synthesis. Since Ded1p can work in both 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-DelCampo1">[56]</xref>, it could be used for multiple purposes during RNA synthesis.</p>

        <title>A model on the synergistic roles of host factors in TBSV (+)RNA synthesis</title>
        <p>Based on the available data, it seems that TBSV (+)RNA synthesis is not only affected by the p33/p92 replication proteins, but by GAPDH and Ded1p host proteins as well. Since the viral replication proteins were shown to bind to TBSV (−)RNA nonspecifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Rajendran1">[57]</xref>, we propose that the above host proteins, which bind strongly to the TBSV (−)repRNA, are involved in facilitating the proper and efficient recruitment of the p92 RdRp protein to the (−)RNA template (or alternatively to the dsRNA intermediate) within the VRC as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g009">Figure 9</xref>. For example, Ded1p might unwind either local secondary structure in (−)repRNA or dsRNA region and that, in turn, could favor binding of GAPDH or p92 to the (−)RNA template. This is followed by binding of GAPDH to an AU-rich internal site and proper positioning of the p92 RdRp (bound to GAPDH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Huang1">[50]</xref>) over the (+)-strand initiation promoter, leading to (+)RNA synthesis. The synergistic effect of these host proteins could promote efficient recycling of the viral RdRp resulting in multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002537-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, the roles of these host proteins are to serve as “matchmakers” between the viral RNA template and the viral RdRp. It is intriguing that two host proteins, eEF1A and eEF1Bγ, are proposed to serve somewhat similar functions during (−)RNA initiation for TBSV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Li3">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002537-Sasvari1">[29]</xref>. Therefore, the emerging picture is that TBSV utilizes different host proteins for promoting (−) versus (+)RNA synthesis. This strategy could be beneficial for the virus by allowing asymmetric RNA synthesis, thus leading to excess amount of progeny (+)RNA.</p>

            <p>The (−)repRNA, which is shown with a “closed” 3′ end due to either a secondary structure within the promoter (cPR) in the (−)repRNA or part of a dsRNA structure, could be unwound by Ded1p around the 3′ end, making the (−)repRNA “open”. The open ssRNA structure would facilitate (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus p92 RdRp protein. GAPDH could facilitate (+)RNA synthesis via binding to a 3′ AU-rich sequence (indicated as a box) and also bringing in the p92 protein and positioning it over the cPR promoter as shown. Thus, Ded1p and GAPDH might play a complementary role, leading to synergistic effect on (+)RNA synthesis. In the absence of Ded1p, GAPDH could promote both 3′-terminal extension and (+)RNA synthesis by facilitating the positioning of p92 over the 3′ end.</p>
