        <p>Cell-cycle progression is governed by a series of essential regulatory proteins. Two major regulators are cell-division cycle protein 20 (CDC20) and its homologue, CDC20 homologue 1 (CDH1), which activate the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in mitosis, and facilitate degradation of mitotic APC/C substrates. The malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, is a haploid organism which, during its life-cycle undergoes two stages of mitosis; one associated with asexual multiplication and the other with male gametogenesis. Cell-cycle regulation and DNA replication in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> was recently shown to be dependent on the activity of a number of protein kinases. However, the function of cell division cycle proteins that are also involved in this process, such as CDC20 and CDH1 is totally unknown. Here we examine the role of a putative CDC20/CDH1 in the rodent malaria <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (<italic>Pb</italic>) using reverse genetics. Phylogenetic analysis identified a single putative <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20/CDH1 homologue (termed CDC20 for simplicity) suggesting that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> APC/C has only one regulator. In our genetic approach to delete the endogenous <italic>cdc20</italic> gene of <italic>P. berghei</italic>, we demonstrate that PbCDC20 plays a vital role in male gametogenesis, but is not essential for mitosis in the asexual blood stage. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis in parasite lines with deletions of two kinase genes involved in male sexual development (<italic>map2</italic> and <italic>cdpk4</italic>), showed a significant increase in <italic>cdc20</italic> transcription in activated gametocytes. DNA replication and ultra structural analyses of <italic>cdc20</italic> and <italic>map2</italic> mutants showed similar blockage of nuclear division at the nuclear spindle/kinetochore stage. CDC20 was phosphorylated in asexual and sexual stages, but the level of modification was higher in activated gametocytes and ookinetes. Changes in global protein phosphorylation patterns in the Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> mutant parasites were largely different from those observed in the Δ<italic>map2</italic> mutant. This suggests that CDC20 and MAP2 are both likely to play independent but vital roles in male gametogenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Malaria parasites are single cell organisms that multiply via asexual division at different stages in the life-cycle: in the liver and red blood cells of the vertebrate host and gut of the mosquito vector. The precursor sexual stages (male and female gametocytes) form in red blood cells, then following ingestion in a blood meal the male gametocytes undergo three mitotic divisions resulting in eight male gametes in the mosquito gut. In many organisms including yeast and mice it has been shown that cell division and mitosis are tightly regulated by a set of cell division cycle proteins, namely CDC20 and CDH1. We studied the function of the single homologue of CDC20/CDH1 expressed in the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. We found that <italic>P. berghei</italic> CDC20 is not required for asexual multiplication but is essential for male gamete formation. Analysis of these mutant parasites revealed a defect in male gametocyte division and differentiation resulting in no male gamete formation with major defects in cytokinesis. This phenotype is similar to that of a kinase mutant (<italic>map2</italic>), suggesting that they play an independent but essential role in progression of the sexual stage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Progression of mitosis in the cell-cycle is dependent upon a number of complex, sequential processes that are governed by a series of essential cell cycle regulatory proteins. Anaphase and mitotic exit is regulated by the conserved multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase <underline>A</underline>naphase <underline>P</underline>romoting <underline>C</underline>omplex/<underline>C</underline>yclosome (APC/C), which targets mitotic regulators such as securin and cyclin B for destruction by the 26S proteosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Morgan1">[1]</xref>. Two of the major regulators of APC/C activity are cell-division cycle protein 20 (CDC20) (also known as <italic>Fizzy, p55<sup>CDC</sup> or Slp1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Dawson1">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Wada1">4</xref>) and its homologue, CDC20 homologue 1 (CDH1 – also known as <italic>Cdh1p/Hct1p, Fizzy-related, Ste9, Srw1</italic> or <italic>Ccs52</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Schwab1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Cebolla1">[8]</xref>). CDC20 and CDH1 are related tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD)-40 repeat-containing adaptor proteins, which are highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. They consist of approximately 40 amino acid-repeat motifs that often contain a C-terminal Trp-Asp (WD) sequence, as well as an N-terminal C-Box motif and C-terminal Ile-Arg (IR) residues, along with a KEN-box, Mad2-interacting motif (MIM) and a CRY-box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Yu1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CDC20 protein accumulates during S-phase, peaks in mitosis and activates the phosphorylated APC/C complex (which is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and other mitotic kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Fang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kraft1">[11]</xref>) by physical association, which results in the activation of the metaphase-anaphase transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Shirayama1">[12]</xref> and degradation of mitotic cyclins via ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Glotzer1">[13]</xref>. Phosphorylation of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> and high levels of CDK prevent CDH1 interacting with APC/C during early mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Crasta1">[14]</xref>, whereas a reduction in CDK levels by the activity of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> during telophase/G1 results in CDH1 maintaining APC/C activity and cyclin degradation in proliferating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sigrist1">[6]</xref> and exit from mitosis. This shows that activity of CDC20 and CDH1 in the cell cycle is temporally controlled and ensures that exit from mitosis does not occur before sister chromatid separation has been initiated.</p>
      <p>The activity of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> is tightly regulated by a surveillance mechanism known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Musacchio1">[15]</xref>. The SAC is a pathway that prevents the unregulated separation of sister chromatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Taylor1">[16]</xref> and consists of a number of regulatory proteins including mitotic-arrest deficient (MAD) 1, MAD2, MAD3, budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles (BUB) 1 and BUBR1. The SAC negatively regulates the activity of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> by preventing ubiquitination of securin and cyclin B and subsequently prolongs prometaphase until all chromosomes have been correctly oriented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Musacchio1">[15]</xref>. This process occurs at the kinetochores, where MAD2 and BUBR1 interact with APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> to form a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-DeAntoni1">[17]</xref>, which inhibits its activity. Once the chromatids are correctly oriented, APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> becomes active as it is released from the MCC and initiates anaphase, degrading securin and cyclin B and resulting in reduced CDK activity. This reduction in kinase activity promotes the formation of APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup> and results in exit from mitosis via degradation of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup>, maintaining cyclin degradation in G1 prior to a new round of DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Peters1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Pesin1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Regulation of the cell-cycle and DNA replication in the unicellular apicocomplexan malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, is known to be highly complex and dependent on the activity of a number of protein kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Tewari1">[20]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is a haploid organism lacking sex chromosomes but with a complex life-cycle involving both asexual and sexual processes. Asexual multiplication occurs at three particular stages of the parasites life-cycle: blood stage schizogony, sporogony in the mosquito and pre-erythrocytic schizogony in liver hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Bannister1">[21]</xref>. As with some, but not all apicomplexan parasites multiplication involves repeated nuclear divisions before daughter formation by a process termed schizogony. During these stages genome duplication and segregation is accomplished using an intra-nuclear spindle while retaining an intact nuclear membrane without the formation of the typical morphological features of mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Aikawa1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Brooks1">[23]</xref>. In contrast, DNA replication during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sexual stages within male gametocytes occurs in the mosquito vector and involves three rounds of genomic replication resulting in eight microgamete nuclei and ultimately eight microgametes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sinden1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Gerald1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Upon ingestion of a blood meal by the female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, exposure of the male gametocyte to a slight drop in temperature, a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the mosquito-derived metabolic intermediate xanthurenic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker3">[30]</xref> result in rapid DNA replication (within 12 min) and mitosis giving rise to eight gametes, which egress out of the cell in a process termed exflagellation. This process is known to be dependent upon two protein kinases – calcium-dependent protein kinase 4 (CDPK4) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (MAP2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Tewari1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Khan1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Rangarajan1">[33]</xref>. Activation of CDPK4 results in genome replication, mitosis and axoneme assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker1">[28]</xref> and in a subsequent step; MAP2 is activated and results in axoneme motility and cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Tewari2">[32]</xref>. However, the cell division cycle proteins that interact with these kinases are unknown. As described earlier, in human and yeast cells CDC20 and CDH1 are known to play a major part in cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Yu1">[9]</xref> particularly during early mitosis, and interact with regulatory kinases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Weinstein1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kramer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kramer2">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To examine the function of a single homologue of CDC20/CDH1 (termed CDC20 for simplicity) in the complex life-cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> we used a rodent malaria model, <italic>P. berghei (Pb)</italic> in laboratory mice, which is very amenable to analysis by reverse genetics and where the entire life cycle, including within the mosquito vector, can be analysed. The results presented here suggest that CDC20 has an essential role in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> male gamete formation, possibly through interacting with the kinase regulator MAP2, but has no essential involvement in asexual multiplication.</p>

        <p>Sequence analyses of <italic>P. berghei</italic> identified a <italic>cdc20</italic> gene (PBANKA_051060) comprised of one exon. The protein contains a classical KEN-box, RVL-cyclin binding motif, IR motif and seven WD-40 repeat motifs as found in CDC20 and CDH1 of other organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), but does not contain a C-box, D-box or a Mad2-interacting motif. We were only able to identify a single CDC20/CDH1 homologue coded in the genomes of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, which has also been suggested for <italic>Trypanosomatidae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Listovsky1">[35]</xref>. To assess the evolutionary relationships between these CDC20 homologues we aligned (using ClustalW – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002554.s001">Figure S1</xref>) the WD domains and used the alignment to draw a phylogenetic tree using the meiotic APC/C activator from yeast as an out group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In the resulting tree we see four clusters. Two clusters, as expected, represent the CDC20 and CDH1 homologues from a range of eukaryotic species. Another cluster contains the CDC20/CDH1 homologues from <italic>Trypanosomatidae</italic> species. The final cluster includes all the CDC20/CDH1 homologues from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. These results suggest that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species contain only a single CDC20/CDH1 homologue and that the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> APC/C has only one regulator.</p>

        <title>CDC20-GFP shows nuclear expression through-out the life-cycle, with highest expression in activated male gametocytes</title>
        <p>Little information is available regarding CDC20 expression and localisation in the malaria parasite in both vertebrate and mosquito hosts. Therefore, we generated a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein from endogenous <italic>cdc20</italic> using a single crossover recombination strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002554.s002">Figure S2A–D</xref>).

Expression of CDC20-GFP in transgenic parasites was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002554.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). A protein band of ∼92 kDa was present for all analysed CDC20-GFP samples, which corresponds to the predicted mass of the CDC20-GFP fusion protein (92.4 kDa). The line expressing the unfused GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Janse1">[36]</xref> produced a band at 29 kDa and was used as a control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002554.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Expression of the CDC20-GFP fusion protein resulted in no visible abnormalities. Low intensity CDC20-GFP expression was detected during all stages of the life-cycle (data not shown) apart from activated male gametocytes, which had the highest intensity of GFP expression that co-localized with Hoechst nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We also generated a parasite line whereby CDC20-GFP was expressed episomally (using the same plasmid utilised to target the endogenous locus) under the control of the <italic>cdc20</italic> promoter. This line showed high GFP fluorescence intensity at all stages, which co-localised with Hoechst nuclear staining in asexual, gametocyte and oocyst stages and an additional cytoplasmic localisation in ookinetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002554.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>CDC20 is critical to male gamete formation and exflagellation</title>
        <p>To discover the function of CDC20 in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life-cycle, we used a double crossover homologous recombination strategy to knockout the gene. This was achieved by replacing the endogenous gene with a pyrimethamine resistant allele of the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidine synthetase (<italic>dhfr</italic>/<italic>ts</italic>) gene from <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002554.s002">Figure S2E</xref>).

        <p>Analysis of two <italic>cdc20</italic> deletion mutant clones, N10 cl7 and N10 cl9 (henceforward called Δ<italic>cdc20</italic>), showed no developmental abnormalities during asexual proliferation or gametocyte formation, as assessed on blood smears (data not shown). However, <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures analysed for differentiation into ookinete stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Tewari1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Liu1">[37]</xref> showed complete ablation of ookinete development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). To ascertain whether the block in ookinete formation was a defect along the male or female line, we performed genetic crosses as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Liu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Reininger1">[38]</xref>. Crossing of Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> with a <italic>cdpk4</italic> deletion mutant (a previously characterised male mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker1">[28]</xref>, henceforward called Δ<italic>cdpk4</italic>) showed no rescue of the phenotype. Conversely, crossing with a <italic>nek4</italic> deletion mutant (a previously characterised female mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Reininger1">[38]</xref>, henceforward called Δ<italic>nek4</italic>) resulted in 36% ookinete formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These data prove that Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites are defective along the male line. As a result of this observation, we analysed exflagellation of the activated male gametocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sinden3">[26]</xref>, which was completely blocked in Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites. To substantiate the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we fed mosquitoes on mice infected with either wild-type or Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites and analysed oocyst development. Wild type parasites developed normally and oocysts were detected in the mosquito gut, whereas no oocysts were found in the guts of mosquitoes fed on Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites and analysed 14 or 21 days after feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This result confirms that CDC20 is vital to male gamete development and that fertilization/zygote formation/ookinete development is completely blocked in the Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites, preventing oocyst formation.</p>

        <title>CDC20 is not essential for genome replication in activated microgametocytes, but regulates cytokinesis and subsequent exflagellation</title>

However, differentiation and shortening of the spindle microtubules did not occur in either mutant 15 mpa. Furthermore, nuclear DNA in the enlarged nucleus of activated microgametocytes remained uncondensed in both mutants at 15 mpa; whereas wild-type microgametocytes had started to undergo exflagellation and nuclear divison resulting in the release of normal microgametes containing haploid nuclei with condensed DNA. These observations suggest that development of mutant microgametocytes after activation is blocked at a very late stage, possibly after the third round of DNA replication.</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of CDC20 during gametogenesis</title>
        <p>Reversible phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism in mitotic progression. In human and yeast cells, phosphorylation of CDC20 is known to be an essential step during anaphase and early mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kraft1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Dulla1">[39]</xref>. As exflagellation of Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites is completely ablated, but DNA replication and axoneme motility in activated microgametocytes was indistinguishable from wild-type parasites, we hypothesised that phosphorylation of CDC20 could be a vital regulator of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametogenesis. Analysis of CDC20 phosphorylation was performed before, during and after completion of microgametogenesis (i.e. in schizont, activated gametocyte and ookinete stages respectively) in CDC20-GFP parasites metabolically labelled with <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Solyakov1">[40]</xref> and immunoprecipitated by GFP-trap. <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate labelling in whole cell lysates of schizonts, activated gametocytes and ookinetes showed similar profiles and confirmed efficient uptake of <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate in all stages. Autoradiography showed that CDC20 is phosphorylated at all three stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) but phosphorylation levels were higher in activated gametocytes and ookinetes compared to schizonts (1.70 and 2.48 times higher respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The GFP-tagged CDC20 protein appeared as a doublet by Western Blot in schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), whereas only a single band was detected on the corresponding autoradiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the upper band on the Western Blot may represent a phosphorylated form of CDC20-GFP and the lower band a non-phosphorylated form of the protein. Interestingly, in activated gametocytes and ookinetes, only the upper GFP-immunoreactive band is present, which may reflect a higher degree of phosphorylation of CDC20-GFP in sexual stages compared to schizonts.</p>

        <title>Deletion of <italic>cdc20</italic> and <italic>map2</italic> affects specific protein phosphorylation in activated gametocytes</title>
        <p>In order to examine whether or not CDC20 has a role in pathways of protein phosphorylation similar to those of the kinase MAP2, we compared the global phosphorylation profile of wild type activated gametocytes with that of Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> and Δ<italic>map2</italic> lines using metabolic labelling with <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Solyakov1">[40]</xref>. This approach employs metabolic labelling of parasites followed by fractionation by ion exchange chromatography. The experiment was performed in triplicate and in each experiment 20 fractions were collected, resolved by SDS-PAGE and an autoradiograph obtained for seven of them to reveal the phosphorylation profile. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g007">Figure 7</xref> are three fractions from the ion exchange fractionation where differences in the phosphorylation profile between the wild type and mutant parasite strains were observed. Importantly, the Coomassie blue stain of the SDS-PAGE gels demonstrated that the overall protein expression profiles of the wild type and mutant parasite lines were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Despite this similarity, there were clear differences in the phosphorylation profile between the parasite lines. The phosphorylated band labelled A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g007">Figure 7</xref> was significantly decreased in the Δ<italic>map</italic>2 mutant, whereas the Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> mutant showed increased phosphorylation. Bands C, D, F, G, H and J showed altered phosphorylation status only in the Δ<italic>map2</italic> mutant, whereas bands A, E and I were changed only in the Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> mutant. Only one band (band B) showed a similar change in both the Δ<italic>map2</italic> and Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> mutants. This analysis indicated that although the phosphorylation profile of the parasite was affected by the deletion of <italic>map2</italic> and <italic>cdc20</italic>, the proteins that showed a change in phosphorylation status in the two mutant lines were (with the exception of one protein) different. It seems unlikely therefore that MAP2 and CDC20 regulate the same network of phospho-proteins. We are currently investigating this result further using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic approaches.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mechanisms to control cell division and the cell cycle are essential parts of the cell regulation machinery. These processes are not well understood in unicellular protozoa such as the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> undergoes two distinct mitotic processes; one involving repeated DNA duplication, in which karyokinesis occurs after each replication and is associated with asexual proliferation and the other involving endoreduplication, with three rounds of replication prior to the simultaneous formation of eight microgamete nuclei during microgametogenesis. Here, we describe a CDC20/CDH1 orthologue in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> as an important regulator of mitosis during male gametogenesis, but interestingly it has no effect on the mitotic process undergone during schizogony.</p>
      <p>Our bioinformatic studies suggest that in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> there is only one gene representing CDC20 and its homologue CDH1, and that the protein is a true structural homologue of CDC20/CDH1, even though we could not complement CDC20 function in yeast (data not shown). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that we failed to detect a second highly spliced <italic>Plasmodium cdc20/cdh1</italic> homologue, the phylogenetic clustering of all the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20 homologues gives confidence that there is only a single CDC20 orthologue in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. This suggests that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> diverged from other eukaryotes prior to the duplication event that presumably gave rise to CDC20 and CDH1 genes. It is interesting to note that the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cluster is distinct from the <italic>Trypanosomatidae</italic> cluster where there is also a single corresponding gene in each genome. Furthermore, this orthologue has a classical KEN box-like domain at the N-terminus and an RVL domain and IR motif at the C-terminus, all of which are required for cyclin degradation and binding to the APC/C core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kramer1">[7]</xref>. The presence of these domains suggests that CDC20 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> could influence the cell cycle in a similar manner to other systems, such as yeast, mammals and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Yu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kevei1">[41]</xref>. The lack of a D-box and presence of a KEN-box are consistent with the structure of CDC20 in humans, with the presence of a KEN-box suggesting that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20 is a prime target for ubiquitination, as suggested in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Ponts1">[42]</xref>. Alternatively, as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20 is the only orthologue of both CDC20 and CDH1 present in other systems, it is plausible that ubiquitination of CDC20 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is self-regulating, as CDC20 is known to be degraded by APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup> via its KEN-box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Pfleger1">[43]</xref> and could therefore act as a “negative feedback” mechanism as seen in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Rape1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Rape2">[45]</xref>. The seven conserved WD repeats in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20 protein also suggests that it does bind an as yet unknown multi-protein complex. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20 shows some differences from the <italic>ccs52</italic> homologue reported in plants, such as <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Cebolla1">[8]</xref>, since it lacks a MAD-binding box and also the D-box that appears to be specific for CDH1 and is not conserved in CDC20 and FZY proteins. It has been reported recently that in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> there are five isoforms of CDC20, and two of them are functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kevei1">[41]</xref>. We did not observe any such expansion of genes for this protein in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p>
      <p>Our CDC20-GFP expression studies showed that CDC20 is highly expressed in activated male gametocytes (with gametocytes showing highest expression at the mRNA level, in agreement with previous transcriptomic studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Hall1">[46]</xref>) but it is also present throughout the life-cycle and located mainly in the nuclear compartment, with some cytoplasmic localisation, consistent with expression in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kallio1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sironi1">[48]</xref>. However, although previous studies have shown <italic>cdc20</italic> transcripts and protein to be highly expressed in sporozoites of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Hall1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-LeRoch1">[49]</xref>, we did not observe high protein expression levels of CDC20-GFP in sporozoites.</p>
      <p>Functional studies using a gene deletion strategy showed that CDC20 controls male gamete development and deletion mutants are impaired during transmission of the parasite to the mosquito vector. Further in-depth analysis of these mutants using a cross fertilisation approach showed that this defect is limited to male gamete differentiation (exflagellation) and formation since Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> macrogametocytes are fully capable of cross fertilization with microgametes from donor strains. Hence, CDC20 has an essential function for the transition of male gametocytes to gametes. Gametogenesis in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> involves three rounds of mitotic division in male gametocytes resulting in eight gametes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sinden1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sinden3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Sinden4">[50]</xref>. We have previously shown that CDPK4 is involved in cell cycle progression to S phase and MAP2 may be essential for replication and mitosis to be completed before cytokinesis commences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Tewari2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Rangarajan1">[33]</xref> (although it is important to note that MAP2 is essential for asexual development in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-DorinSemblat1">[51]</xref>, so there may be species-specific differences in the roles of different kinases). As <italic>cdc20</italic> mRNA levels are up regulated in both Δ<italic>cdpk4</italic> and Δ<italic>map2</italic> mutants, this suggests that CDC20 may be interlinked with these kinases and orchestrates the process of male gametogenesis and is perhaps up-regulated to compensate for the loss of these two kinases, but this suggestion requires further investigation. The <italic>cdc20</italic> deletion mutants formed axonemes and mitotic spindles but failed to undergo karyokinesis or cytokinesis and also did not form motile, flagellar gametes, a phenotype similar to what we have observed with <italic>map2</italic> deletion mutants. The requirement for CDC20 during karyokinesis is consistent with the known function of CDC20 and CDH1 in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Kramer1">[7]</xref>. As described earlier, CDC20 is active during early mitosis in other cells and its up-regulation in gametocytes suggests that it has an essential role in the multiple rounds of DNA replication and the chromosome separation specifically associated with this process. However, mutant <italic>cdc20</italic> parasites do not arrest during asexual proliferation and this suggests that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDC20 is specifically required for microgametogenesis.</p>
      <p>Functional studies in human systems have shown that a deficiency of CDH1 results in delayed mitotic exit as well as an accumulation of mitotic errors and difficulty in completion of cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-GarciaHiguera1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Li1">[53]</xref>, similar to what is observed in our <italic>cdc20</italic> and <italic>map2</italic> mutants. Therefore we suggest that CDC20 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> fulfils the function of both CDC20 and CDH1. Moreover, loss of <italic>cdc20</italic> results in arrest during metaphase to anaphase transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Shirayama1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Li2">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Lim1">[55]</xref>, with sister chromatids failing to form. How the single CDC20 protein may fulfil the roles of both CDC20 and CDH1 requires further investigation. Our ultrastructure studies for both Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> and Δ<italic>map2</italic> lines, reported for the first time to our knowledge; show that these mutants have a similar arrest in cytokinesis and karyokinesis detected by EM, with defects in nuclear spindle/kinetochore movement and chromatin condensation, confirming our initial light microscopy observation of Δ<italic>map2</italic>. Unlike the Δ<italic>map2</italic> line, we never observed any exflagellation in the Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> line. As suggested before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Billker4">[56]</xref>, classical spindle checkpoints are not present in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> since blockage of microtubule organisation does not appear to block DNA synthesis. Therefore, MAP2 and CDC20 may be involved in a critical cell cycle checkpoint during microgametogenesis that controls DNA replication and mitosis, prior to karyokinesis and cytokinesis and is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002554-g008">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

      <p>DNA replication in the Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> line was similar to that in the Δ<italic>map2</italic> line, with both mutants undergoing octoploidy 8 mpa, but not undergoing karyokinesis. As a result, we analysed whether phosphorylation of CDC20 could be involved in mitotic progression during microgametogenesis. In other systems, phosphorylation of CDC20 can be achieved by BUB1, CDK1, MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Tang1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-DAngiolella1">[58]</xref> and also NEK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Liu2">[59]</xref>, another protein kinase required for zygote development in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Reininger2">[60]</xref> and this modification is an essential step for CDC20 inhibition by the SAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Chung1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002554-Yudkovsky1">[62]</xref>. Here, we have shown that CDC20 is more phosphorylated in activated gametocytes and ookinetes (i.e. sexual stages) compared to schizont (asexual stages), which suggests that phosphorylation of CDC20 may be a possible mechanism involved in gametogenesis.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the global phosphorylation profile of Δ<italic>cdc20</italic> parasites suggests that CDC20 regulates the phosphorylation of specific proteins within the gametocytes. The proteins that are regulated by CDC20 are; however, largely different from those that appear to be regulated by MAP2. This would suggest that at the level of phosphorylation CDC20 and MAP2 regulate different pathways. It would be interesting in future studies to dissect out the proteins regulated by MAP2 and CDC20 and in this way build a network of phospho-proteins that regulate male gametogenesis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study identified significant differences in the control of mitosis during asexual development compared to microgametogenesis in the malaria parasite. We have also shown that CDC20 and MAP2 may play independent but essential roles in the mitotic division associated with microgametogenesis but are not essential for mitosis during asexual stages in the malaria parasite.</p>
