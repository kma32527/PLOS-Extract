        <p><italic>Bordetella</italic> adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA) penetrates the cytoplasmic membrane of phagocytes and employs two distinct conformers to exert its multiple activities. One conformer forms cation-selective pores that permeabilize phagocyte membrane for efflux of cytosolic potassium. The other conformer conducts extracellular calcium ions across cytoplasmic membrane of cells, relocates into lipid rafts, translocates the adenylate cyclase enzyme (AC) domain into cells and converts cytosolic ATP to cAMP. We show that the calcium-conducting activity of CyaA controls the path and kinetics of endocytic removal of toxin pores from phagocyte membrane. The enzymatically inactive but calcium-conducting CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoid was endocytosed <italic>via</italic> a clathrin-dependent pathway. In contrast, a doubly mutated (E570K+E581P) toxoid, unable to conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cells, was rapidly internalized by membrane macropinocytosis, unless rescued by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promoted <italic>in trans</italic> by ionomycin or intact toxoid. Moreover, a fully pore-forming CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin failed to permeabilize phagocytes, unless endocytic removal of its pores from cell membrane was decelerated through Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promoted by molecules locked in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting conformation by the 3D1 antibody. Inhibition of endocytosis also enabled the native <italic>B. pertussis</italic>-produced CyaA to induce lysis of J774A.1 macrophages at concentrations starting from 100 ng/ml. Hence, by mediating calcium influx into cells, the translocating conformer of CyaA controls the removal of bystander toxin pores from phagocyte membrane. This triggers a positive feedback loop of exacerbated cell permeabilization, where the efflux of cellular potassium yields further decreased toxin pore removal from cell membrane and this further enhances cell permeabilization and potassium efflux.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) of pathogenic <italic>Bordetellae</italic> eliminates the first line of host innate immune defense by inhibiting the oxidative burst and complement-mediated opsonophagocytic killing of bacteria. The toxin penetrates myeloid phagocytes, such as neutrophil, macrophage or dendritic cells, and subverts their signaling by catalyzing a rapid and massive conversion of intracellular ATP to the key signaling molecule cAMP. In parallel, the toxin forms cation-selective pores and permeabilizes the cytoplasmic membrane of phagocytes. This so-called ‘hemolysin’ activity synergizes with the enzymatic AC activity of CyaA in promoting apoptotic or necrotic cell death, depending on the toxin dose. Moreover, the pore-forming activity promotes activation of NALP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin IL-1β. We show here that the capacity of CyaA to permeabilize phagocytes depends on its ability to mediate influx of extracellular calcium ions into cells. This enables bystander CyaA pores to escape rapid macropinocytic removal from cell membrane and exacerbate the permeabilization of cells. These observations set a new paradigm for the mechanism of action of pore-forming RTX leukotoxins on phagocytes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>By instantaneously disrupting bactericidal functions of host phagocytes, the adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA, ACT, or AC-Hly) plays a major role in virulence of pathogenic <italic>Bordetellae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Vojtova1">[1]</xref>. The toxin rapidly paralyzes phagocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Vojtova1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Confer1">[2]</xref> by translocating across their cytoplasmic membrane an N-terminal adenylate cyclase enzyme (AC) domain (∼400 residues) that binds cytosolic calmodulin and converts ATP to a key signaling molecule, cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Vojtova1">[1]</xref>. In parallel, the multidomain ∼1300 residues-long RTX (<underline>R</underline>epeat in <underline>T</underline>o<underline>X</underline>in) cytolysin moiety of CyaA acts independently as a pore-forming leukotoxin and hemolysin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Vojtova1">[1]</xref>. This employs a hydrophobic pore-forming domain (residues 500 to 700), a domain with covalently palmitoylated lysine residues 860 and 983, and a typical calcium-binding RTX repeat domain within the last 700 residues of CyaA that accounts for receptor binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Vojtova1">[1]</xref>. CyaA can oligomerize into small cation-selective pores that mediate efflux of cytosolic potassium ions from cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-VojtovaVodolanova1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova1">[6]</xref>, eventually provoking colloid-osmotic cell lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bellalou1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Hewlett1">[9]</xref>. This activity synergizes with cytotoxic signaling of the translocated AC enzyme in bringing about the final cytotoxic action of CyaA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Basler1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Hewlett1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The structure of CyaA in target membrane remains unknown. Accumulated indirect evidence strongly suggests that the cell-invasive AC and the pore-forming activities are associated with distinct subpopulations of CyaA conformers within target cell membrane. Indeed, translocation of the AC domain across cellular membrane and the pore-forming activity of CyaA can be dissociated by temperature, calcium concentrations, or altered acylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Gray1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Rogel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Sebo1">[11]</xref>. Moreover, the balance between the two activities can be largely shifted in either direction by specific residue substitutions. Several CyaA variants with strongly enhanced pore-forming activity and reduced or nil capacity to deliver the AC domain into cells could be generated. Recently, a CyaA defective in formation of toxin pores but intact in AC delivery into cells could also be constructed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-VojtovaVodolanova1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova2">[12]</xref>. Summarizing this evidence, a model was proposed that predicts the co-existence of two distinct toxin conformers inside target cell membrane. These would operate in parallel and would employ the same segments of the hydrophobic domain in an alternative manner. One conformer would insert into cell membrane as toxin translocation precursor that accomplishes delivery of the AC domain into cells (cell-invasive activity). The second conformer would account for formation of oligomeric CyaA pores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-VojtovaVodolanova1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova2">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The primary targets of CyaA appear to be host myeloid phagocytes, to which the toxin binds through their α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin, known as CD11b/CD18, CR3 or Mac-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Guermonprez1">[13]</xref>. Recently, we could show that AC translocation into cells occurs in two steps. First, the membrane–inserted translocation precursors of CyaA generate a calcium-conducting path across cell membrane and mediate influx of extracellular calcium ions into cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Fiser1">[14]</xref>. The incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> than activates calpain-mediated processing of the talin tether of CD11b/CD18, which triggers relocation of the toxin-receptor complex into cholesterol-rich membrane lipid rafts. There the translocation of the AC domain into cytosol of cells across the cytoplasmic membrane of phagocytes is completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. Unlike for most other enzymatic toxins, the capacity of CyaA to deliver its AC enzyme component into target cells does not depend on receptor-mediated endocytosis. Instead, the AC domain translocates into cytosol directly across the cytoplasmic membrane of phagocytes. Indeed, inhibitors of endocytic pathways interfere neither with translocation of the AC domain into cells and elevation of cytosolic cAMP, nor with AC domain-mediated delivery of inserted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes into the cytosol of antigen presenting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Gordon1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Schlecht1">[18]</xref>. Clathrin-dependent endocytic uptake of CyaA together with its receptor CD11b/CD18 has, however, previously been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Khelef1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Martin1">[20]</xref> and it was found to account for the capacity of CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoids to deliver cargo antigens into dendritic cells for endosomal processing and MHC II-restricted presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Schlecht1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we analyzed here the mechanism of endocytic uptake of CyaA from cell membrane and its relevance for toxin action. We show that by conducting calcium ions across the target membrane into cytosol of cells, the translocating CyaA molecules control the rate of toxin pore removal from cellular membrane and thereby support the permeabilization of phagocytes.</p>

        <title>Functional integrity of hydrophobic domain determines the path of endocytic trafficking of CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoid</title>
        <p>Recently we found that despite binding to CD11b/CD18, the CyaA constructs lacking the hydrophobic domain failed to deliver a fused MalE antigen for presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes by dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To address the role of functional integrity of CyaA in its endocytic trafficking, we employed live microscopy imaging.</p>
        <p>To avoid the interference of massive phagocyte ruffling and death from ATP depletion and cAMP signaling provoked by enzymatically active CyaA at concentrations required for imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Basler1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Kamanova1">[21]</xref>, we used fluorescently labeled and enzymatically inactive CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoids. To enable assessment of their capacity to deliver antigens for presentation on MHC class I and II molecules, the toxoids were further tagged by insertion of a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope (SIINFEKL) from ovalbumin at position 336 and of a MalE CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope (NGKLIAYPIAVEALS) at position 108 of the AC domain, respectively. Trafficking of such tagged dCyaA was then compared to that of a doubly mutated CyaA-E570K+E581P-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoid (dCyaA-KP) that carried a combination of debilitating substitutions of glutamate residues at positions 570 and 581 within the pore-forming domain. That construct was previously shown to retain a full capacity to bind the toxin receptor CD11b/CD18, without being able to conduct calcium ions into cells, to associate with lipid rafts and translocate the AC domain across cell membrane, or to form oligomeric CyaA pores within cellular membrane, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-VojtovaVodolanova1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1</xref>, insertion of the epitope tags and fluorescent labeling did not alter the expected properties of the dCyaA toxoid, which elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in J774A.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and relocated into lipid rafts in J774A.1 membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As also expected, the dCyaA-KP toxoid lacked all these activities. When examined by live cell imaging, the two fluorescently labeled toxoids exhibited intriguingly different kinetics and patterns of endocytic uptake. As documented by representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, dCyaA was detected predominantly within the plasma membrane, or in fluorescent vesicles located beneath the membrane of J774A.1 cells throughout the 20 minutes of incubation at 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s005">Video S1</xref>). In contrast, dCyaA-KP was taken-up much faster and accumulated massively within endocytic vesicles dispersed through the cytosol of cells already within 5 minutes from toxoid addition. The dCyaA-KP toxoid was then almost completely removed from cell membrane within 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s006">Video S2</xref>), as quantified by counting of the intracellularly located fluorescent vesicles for a set of inspected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s002">Figure S2</xref> for the method). Identical results were observed upon swapping of the fluorescent labels (not shown), thus excluding the impact of the used dyes on toxoid trafficking. While the two toxoids entered into quite different endocytic pathways, the uptake of both was receptor-mediated and depended on toxoid binding to CD11b/CD18. Blocking of the receptor by the M1/70 antibody abrogated, indeed, cell binding and endocytosis of both toxoids, as documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1E</xref>.</p>

        <p>To corroborate this observation, the uptake of the two toxoids was examined in RAW 264.7 macrophages expressing a dominant negative variant of the EPS-15 protein (DN EPS-15-GFP, DIII), which selectively interferes with clathrin-dependent endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Benmerah1">[23]</xref>. As documented by a representative image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g002">Figure 2C</xref> (left), the accumulation of transferrin and dCyaA at intracellular sites was abrogated in DN EPS-15-GFP-transfected cells (blue) and no co-localization of cell-associated dCyaA with transferrin was observed upon removal of surface-associated transferrin with a low pH buffer wash. As further documented by the z-axis projections, few if any intracellular vesicles containing dCyaA were observed inside DN EPS-15-GFP-transfected cells and the membrane-associated dCyaA was located exclusively inside fluorescent patches on cell surface. In striking contrast, the endocytic uptake of dCyaA-KP was unaffected in DN EPS-15-GFP-transfected cells and intracellular vesicles containing dCyaA-KP were clearly observed in the z-axis projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel).

        <title>Calcium-induced deceleration of endocytic removal from plasma membrane enables CyaA hemolysin pores to permeabilize phagocytes</title>
        <p>We have previously observed that the CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin construct lacking the AC domain of CyaA (Δ1–373) was unable to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into monocytes and was essentially unable to provoke lysis of J774A.1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Fiser1">[14]</xref>. However, on planar lipid bilayers, or on sheep erythrocytes devoid of endocytic mechanisms, the CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin exhibited the same specific pore-forming and hemolytic activities as the full-length dCyaA (CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Benz1">[4]</xref>. We thus hypothesized that its inability to lyze J774A.1 cells might be due to rapid removal of the CyaA-ΔAC pores from the cytoplasmic membrane of J774A.1 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, the CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin elicited much slower efflux of cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> from J774A.1 cells then the full-length toxoid. In cells exposed to 3 µg/ml of enzymatically inactive CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> a complete drop of cytosolic [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> concentration down to 10 mM was reproducibly observed within 20 minutes, while in cells exposed to equal amounts of CyaA-ΔAC the [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> only decreased to 80 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine if this was due to rapid removal of CyaA-ΔAC pores from cell membrane, we assessed the capacity of CyaA-ΔAC to elicit K<sup>+</sup> efflux on cells with membrane trafficking inhibited upon preincubation in media containing 0.01% (w/w) sodium azide and 10 mM 2-deoxy-glucose (2DG). This treatment potentiated the cell-permeabilizing activity of full-length CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>), but did not promote any significant K<sup>+</sup> efflux from cells on its own despite causing an about five-fold drop of cellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7A, 7B and 7C</xref>). As further documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s009">Videos S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s010">S6</xref>), the strong inhibition of the CyaA-ΔAC uptake was accompanied by a steep increase of the specific capacity of CyaA-ΔAC to promote K<sup>+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>) from cells and lyze J774A.1 monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). It can thus be concluded that rapid macropinocytic internalization with cell membrane was strongly restricting the cell permeabilizing and cytolytic capacities of the CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin pores.</p>
        <p>As further shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, despite the prolonged persistence in the cytoplasmic membrane of cells upon inhibition of endocytosis, the CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin failed to associate with lipid rafts (compare CyaA-ΔAC panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g007">Figure 7G</xref> and upper dCyaA panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1B</xref> for comparable toxoid loading). This goes well with our previous observation that mobilization into lipid rafts with CD11b/CD18 depends on the capacity of CyaA to conduct calcium ions into cells to activate talin cleavage by calpain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. More importantly, this result shows that CyaA pores can form outside of lipid rafts within the bulk phase of cell membrane.</p>
        <p>We next tested if Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced <italic>in trans</italic> would delay removal of CyaA-ΔAC from cytoplasmic membrane and extend thereby its capacity to permeabilize J774A.1 cells. Mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cells with ionomycin, however, caused on its own a high unspecific leakage of K<sup>+</sup> from J774A.1 cells (data not shown). Therefore, an alternative approach was used, exploiting the capacity of the 3D1 MAb to lock CyaA molecules in the conformation of membrane-inserted ‘translocation precursors’ that conduct calcium ions across the cytoplasmic membrane of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. CyaA-ΔAC was preincubated with 3D1, or with an isotype control IgG1 MAb (TU-01, 20 µg/ml) and the capacity of the CyaA-ΔAC to elicit K<sup>+</sup> efflux from J774A.1 cells was assessed. As documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, while the 3D1 MAb alone did not cause any elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, the binding of 3D1 conferred on CyaA-ΔAC the capacity to promote rapid influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into monocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, this allowed association of detectable amounts of CyaA-ΔAC molecules with lipid rafts. More importantly, the capacity of CyaA-ΔAC to permeabilize J774A.1 cells for K<sup>+</sup> efflux was strongly enhanced in the presence of 3D1 MAb and equaled the specific cell-permeabilizing activity of the intact and enzymatically active CyaA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g008">Figure 8C and 8D</xref>. Furthermore, this enhancement of cell-permeabilizing activity was accompanied by a strong deceleration of endocytic uptake of CyaA-ΔAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g008">Figure 8E, 8F</xref>).</p>

By redirecting the toxin into a decelerated clathrin-dependent uptake pathway, the calcium-conducting activity of toxin translocation intermediates protracts toxin pore persistence within cytoplasmic membrane, thus extending phagocyte permeabilization and maximizing cytotoxic action of CyaA, as summarized in the model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g013">Figure 13</xref>.</p>

          <title>Model of the calcium influx-triggered positive feedback mechanism of self-exacerbating potassium efflux due to protracted cell permeabilization by toxin pores.</title>
          <p>Upon binding to the α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin (CD11b/CD18), the pore precursor conformers of dCyaA oligomerize within the bulk phase of target cell membrane and permeabilize cells for efflux of cytosolic potassium ions. In parallel, toxin translocation precursors insert into cellular membrane and conduct extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cell cytosol. Elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in the submembrane compartment results in activation of talin cleavage by calpain and liberates the receptor with bound toxin translocation precursor within target membrane for lateral relocation into lipid rafts, where the translocation of the AC domain across plasma membrane is completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. The entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> provokes deceleration of clathrin-dependent endocytic uptake of CyaA, thereby delaying removal of toxin pores from the cytoplasmic membrane. Protracted persistence of CyaA pores within cellular membrane then triggers a self-amplifying (positive) feedback loop mechanism that exacerbates cell permeabilization. The more potassium leaks out form cells, the more the clathrin-dependent endocytic removal of toxin pores from cellular membrane is decelerated and the more is the cell permeabilization and potassium leakage exacerbated. In contrast, the mutated dCyaA-KP and the CyaAΔAC hemolysin variants of CyaA are unable to conduct calcium ions into cells and are thus rapidly removed from the cytosolic membrane of cells by a membrane macropinocytosis mechanism that directs the mutant toxoids for rapid proteolytic degradation.</p>

      <p>This mechanism could be directly demonstrated here for the CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoid and CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin variants that lack the AC enzyme activity and could be used at sufficiently high concentrations for live cell imaging. Imposing on CyaA-ΔAC a conformation that enabled it to conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cells, indeed, rescued the hemolysin from the macropinocytic pathway, and by decelerating its removal form cell membrane, it particularly enhanced the otherwise very low cell-permeabilizing and cytolytic capacity of CyaA-ΔAC.</p>
      <p>Using intact toxin (AC<sup>+</sup>) purified form <italic>B. pertussis</italic> cells at close to physiologically relevant concentrations (200 ng/ml), we found that inhibition of endocytic uptake of <italic>Bp</italic>-CyaA enhanced its capacity to lyze cells. It was, however, not possible to design an experiment that would directly prove the role of calcium-induced deceleration of CyaA uptake in its cytotoxic action. Such demonstration would only be possible if inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx would leave the other cytotoxic activities of CyaA unaffected. This would then allow to test whether cytolytic activity of CyaA is reduced by acceleration of the endocytic uptake of the intact toxin. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells is a prerequisite for CyaA relocation into lipid rafts and subsequent AC domain translocation into cell cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, blocking of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by whatever means inevitably ablates also the major component of the cytotoxic activity of CyaA, namely the capacity of its AC enzyme to reach cell cytosol and catalyze unregulated dissipation of cytosolic ATP into cAMP to impair cellular signaling.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that upon initial binding of the CD11b/CD18 integrin, the CyaA toxin inserts into the membrane lipid bilayer as a translocation precursor, in which the segments of the AC domain cooperate with segments of the pore-forming domain in forming a novel calcium-conducting path across the phagocyte membrane that mediates influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Fiser1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. Activation of calpain by incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> then yields cleavage of the talin tether of CD11b/CD18 and liberates the toxin-receptor complex for recruitment into membrane lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. This process appears to be entirely independent of the cAMP-generating capacity of CyaA in CD11b<sup>+</sup> J774A.1 macrophage cells, as a quite comparable amplitude and even faster initial kinetics of calcium mobilization into cells is observed with the enzymatically inactive dCyaA variant (CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup>) than by intact CyaA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Fiser1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. The results presented in this study then show that it is rather the permeabilization of cells for influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, than the toxin relocation into lipid rafts itself, which allows the toxoid to escape the rapid macropinocytic removal from cell surface with the cytoplasmic membrane. Moreover, lipid rafts are tiny microdomains in the membrane that would accommodate only limited amounts of the hemolysin, while a quantitative escape from rapid macropinocytosis of dCyaA-KP toxoid and its redirection for decelerated endocytosis was observed upon co-incubation with dCyaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This indicates that by permeabilizing cells for calcium influx, the AC-translocating CyaA conformers provoke also deceleration of endocytosis of the bystander CyaA pores that can form outside the rafts, in the bulk phase of cell membrane.</p>
      <p>Such conclusion would also be in line with the observed opposing phenotypes of the CyaA-E509K+516K (CyaA-KK) and CyaA-E570Q+K860R (CyaA-QR) variants of CyaA. While the CyaA-KK exhibits a strongly enhanced specific pore-forming activity, its capacity to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells is very low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Fiser1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Dunne1">[29]</xref>. On the opposite, the CyaA-QR toxin exhibits a very low capacity to form pores, to permeabilize cells and elicit K<sup>+</sup> efflux, while it mediates normal levels of calcium influx into cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Bumba1">[15]</xref>. This suggests that K<sup>+</sup> efflux and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are two parallel and independent processes that are associated with distinct conformational and/or oligomeric states of the two co-existing conformers of membrane-inserted CyaA.</p>
      <p>In this respect, it is puzzling that binding of the 3D1 antibody to CyaA-ΔAC exacerbated at the same time its capacity to conduct calcium ions into cells, as well as its cell permeabilizing capacity. This would, perhaps, be best explained by the bystander effect mentioned above. Due to association-dissociation equilibrium, the antibody would lock only a fraction of membrane-inserted CyaA-ΔAC molecules into a calcium-conducting conformation. The other fraction of hemolysin molecules, not bound with 3D1, would hence be free to form the cell-permeabilizing oligomeric pores promoting K<sup>+</sup> efflux, benefiting from the calcium-induced deceleration of the endocytic uptake of the hemolysin pores. It remains, nevertheless, to be conclusively shown that bridging of CyaA-ΔAC dimers by the bivalent 3D1 antibody does not also contribute to the enhanced cell permeabilization capacity and K<sup>+</sup> efflux mediated by the CyaA-ΔAC hemolysin complexes with the antibody. 3D1 might, indeed, potentially stabilize the formed oligomeric pores against dissociation within the membrane. At present it can neither be formally excluded that the complex of membrane-inserted CyaA-ΔAC with 3D1 might be conducting at the same time the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into cells and the K<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell. For intact CyaA the accumulated evidence strongly argues against such possibility (see above). Due to absence of the translocated AC domain, however, the 3D1-locked conformers of CyaA-ΔAC may be capable of oligomerization into pores enabling K<sup>+</sup> efflux, or the calcium-conducting path formed by these conformers may be accessible for efflux of cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> ions in the absence of the AC domain.</p>
      <p>A particularly intriguing observation is that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and K<sup>+</sup> efflux-promoting activities of the toxin synergize in manipulating the pathway and kinetics of CyaA endocytosis. Indeed, the decrease of intracellular potassium level was repeatedly shown to cause inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Madshus1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Larkin1">[31]</xref>. Hence, the more the cell becomes permeabilized for efflux of K<sup>+</sup>, upon inhibition of macropinocytic uptake of toxin pores by incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the more the potassium leakage from cells through toxin pores further decelerates the clathrin-dependent removal of CyaA pores from cell membrane. Such cooperation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediating activities of CyaA would thus generate a positive feedback loop, exacerbating potassium depletion due to steadily increasing extent of cell membrane permeabilization by persisting and/or newly forming CyaA pores.</p>
      <p>The above outlined positive feedback loop of potassium efflux was apparently operating under the used experimental conditions, since vesicles containing dCyaA were observed to accumulate as tightly attached to, or located just beneath the cell membrane, for over 20 minutes from toxoid addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002580-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002580.s005">Video S1</xref>). This shows that excision of clathrin-coated vesicles from cell membrane was inhibited and protraction of cell membrane permeabilization by the persisting pores then fed back into deceleration of endocytic uptake of dCyaA.</p>
      <p>The enzymatically active CyaA could not be used in this study for analysis of endocytic trafficking of CyaA by live cell microscopy imaging, as at the high concentrations of labeled proteins (&gt;1 µg/ml), required for this type of analyzes, the enzymatically active CyaA uncontrollably impairs intracellular trafficking by rapid depletion of ATP and induction of cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Basler1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Hewlett1">[9]</xref>. Indeed, the cytotoxic action of enzymatically active CyaA on CD11b<sup>+</sup> phagocytes was documented repeatedly at doses lower than 10 ng/ml, where less than 1 ng/ml of active CyaA toxin quantitatively inhibits oxidative burst in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Prior1">[32]</xref>. As low CyaA doses as 5 to 10 ng/ml elicit monocyte ruffling and a near-instant inhibition of CR3-mediated opsonophagocytosis or arrest of the fluid-phase uptake, respectively. This appears to be due to cAMP signaling-mediated inhibition of the small GTPase RhoA and possibly of the PI3 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Kamanova1">[21]</xref>. The results obtained here with the toxoids appear, nevertheless, to be relevant also to the understanding of endocytosis and of cytotoxic action of the enzymatically active CyaA. By using a newly developed FACS assay for cell surface accessibility of bound CyaA, we could approach here the kinetics of endocytic removal of intact CyaA from cell surface at close to physiologically low toxin concentrations (200 ng/ml). Under such conditions, the receptor-bound CyaA was found to be progressively removed from cell surface over 15 minutes of incubation with about one quarter of toxin molecules escaping the uptake into endosomes and remaining exposed on the surface of cell membrane. This endocytic uptake of intact CyaA from cell membrane was noticeably slowed down in the presence of a five-fold excess of enzymatically inactive CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> molecules that promoted Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells and K<sup>+</sup> efflux <italic>in trans</italic>. Moreover, inhibition of the endocytic uptake through inhibition of ATP re-synthesis strongly enhanced the capacity of native <italic>Bp</italic>-CyaA toxin to permeabilize and lyze cells already at as low toxin concentrations as 200 ng/ml. This points towards a more important contribution of the pore-forming activity to the overall cytotoxic action of CyaA than previously recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Basler1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Hewlett1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Enzymatically inactive but pore-forming CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> toxoids have been extensively used over the past 18 years for delivery of AC-inserted CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes from viruses, mycobacteria or tumors into the MHC class I and II-restricted antigen presentation pathways of CD11b-expressing dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Saron1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Dadaglio1">[36]</xref>. As dCyaA-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy are currently in phase I of clinical studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genticel.com" xlink:type="simple">www.genticel.com</ext-link>), the here reported insight into dCyaA endocytosis and trafficking paves the way towards deciphering of the efficacy of T cell vaccine delivery by CyaA toxoids. Moreover, an endotoxin-free CyaA-AC<sup>−</sup> (dCyaA) toxoid was recently observed to alter the expression levels of a dozen of genes involved in innate immune response signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Cheung1">[37]</xref>. This is likely due to the capacity of the toxoid to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells and permeabilize cells for K<sup>+</sup> efflux. A long-sought evidence for a role of the pore-forming capacity of CyaA in <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> infection has, indeed, been recently reported by Dunne and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Dunne1">[29]</xref>. This study showed that by eliciting K<sup>+</sup> efflux from dendritic cells, and perhaps some other CD11b-expressing phagocytes, the pore-forming activity of CyaA contributes to activation of the NALP3 inflammasome and thereby to induction of innate IL-1β response, which supports the clearance of <italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteria at later stages of infection. The results reported herein show that the capacity of CyaA to permeabilize cells for K<sup>+</sup> efflux depends on the capacity of the toxin to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells and escape the rapid macropinocytic removal from target cell membrane. This reveals a further layer of sophistication of CyaA action on host cells, thus underpinning the key role of this toxin with multiple ‘talents’ in the virulence of <italic>Bordetellae</italic> in mammals.</p>

Pearson's correlation coefficients for each image (individual cell recorded in all z-axis planes) were calculated for the given channels. Usually about 60 cells were analyzed and average Pearson's correlation coefficient (P.c.c.) of all z-axis planes ± standard deviation was calculated. A value of 1 represents perfect correlation, zero represents random localization.</p>

Fluorescence measurement of cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> was performed as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002580-Osickova1">[6]</xref>. Briefly, J774A.1 cells were loaded with 9.5 µM PBFI/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 25°C in the presence of 0,05% (w/w) Pluronic F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark. Fluorescence intensity of PBFI (excitation wavelength 340, emission wavelengths 450 and 510 nm) was recorded, ratio of these intensities are shown in the graphs. Calibration experiments were performed in solutions containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), with varying concentrations of potassium acetate (10, 30, 60, or 140 mM) and sodium acetate (5, 85, 115, or 135 mM). Cellular plasma membrane was permeabilized for potassium ions and protons by valinomycin and nigericin (3 µM; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min.</p>

BMDC (10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were pulsed with proteins or peptides for 4–5 hours, followed by medium disposal and cultivation with CRMC3 hybridoma (10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) for 18 hours or the MF2.2D9 hybridoma (5×10<sup>4</sup>) for 14 hours, respectively. Prior to CRMC3 hybridoma addition the BMDCs were washed with PBS. After cell co-incubation, cultures were frozen for at least 2 hours at −80°C. T cell stimulation was monitored by determination of IL-2 amounts released into culture supernatants using two alternative methods. CRMC3 culture supernatants (100 µl) were added to cultures of the IL-2-dependent CTL-L cell line (10<sup>4</sup> cells/well, final volume 200 µl) for 48 hours, followed by addition of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine (50 µCi/ml; Perkin Elmer, Courtabeuf, France). Cells were harvested 6 hours later using an automated cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Lier, Norway) and the incorporated thymidine was determined by scintillation counting. The concentration of IL-2 released into MF2.2D9 cell culture supernatants was determined using a sandwich ELISA with noncompeting pairs of anti–IL-2 mAbs (JES6-1A12 and biotinylated JES6-5H4, both from BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA.</p>

          <p><bold>CyaA constructs with the deletions in the hydrophobic domain failed to deliver their MalE protein for MHC Class II-restricted presentation by dendritic cells, despite a preserved capacity to bind the CD11b/CD18 receptor.</bold> (A) Schematic depiction of the various CyaA variants carrying MalE protein in place of the AC domain. The sequence encoding maltose binding protein (MalE) was amplified from a genomic DNA of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 by PCR and cloned into the pET28b vector (Novagen) for the expression of MalE-C-His, or into the pT7CT7ACT1 plasmid (J. Holubova-Hejnova, unpublished) for the expression of MalE-RTX. Plasmids for the production of deletion variants of MalE-RTX (MalE-RTX-Δ374–647, MalE-RTX-Δ647–855 and MalE-RTX-Δ374–855) were constructed using restriction endonucleases and standard cloning techniques. In the names of the CyaA variants the symbol Δ is followed by the numbers of the first and last amino acid residues of the deleted parts of CyaA. Deleted portions are indicated by the lines. MalE protein is represented as a grey bar. All constructs were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL-21 and purified by chromatography on DEAE Sepharose. MalE-C-His was purified by combination of chromatography on Amylose, Ni-NTA-Agarose and Phenyl Sepharose. (B) Deletions in the hydrophobic domain of CyaA partially impair CD11b/CD18 binding. CHO-CD11b/CD18 cells were preincubated with different concentrations of deletion variants of CyaA carrying MalE protein in place of the AC domain (1–373) for 30 minutes on ice. Then, CyaA-biotin (30 nM) was added and the amount of surface-bound CyaA-biotin was determined by streptavidine-PE and flow cytometry. As a negative control, the entire MalE-C-His protein unfused to CyaA was used. Results are expressed as % of CyaA-biotin in the presence of the various CyaA competitors determined as (bound CyaA-biotin in the sample)/(maximal CyaA-biotin binding in the absence of competitor CyaA)×100%. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments performed in duplicates. (C) Deletions in the hydrophobic domain of CyaA completely abolish delivery of the MalE protein into the MHC Class II antigen presentation pathway. BMDCs from C57BL/6 mice were incubated for 5 hours with various concentrations of dCyaA, MalE-RTX or deletion toxoid variants. After incubation, BMDCs were washed and incubated with anti-MalE class II restricted specific hybridoma CRMC3 for 18 hours. The amounts of IL-2 secreted by cell hybridoma during the 18 hours culture were monitored using the IL-2-dependent CTL-L cell line. The results are expressed in cpm.</p>

For this purpose a script based on WCIF ImageJ (v. 143 g) software was used (</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link><bold>, </bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej</ext-link><bold>).</bold> All images were converted to monochromatic 8-bit scale and processed in format 672×512 pixels. A copy of original image was smoothed by Gaussian blur (radius 2.5 pixels). This blurred image was subtracted from the original image and the result served as template for subsequent particle (endosomal) recognition. Threshold intensity was found by “MaxEntropy dark” automatic algorithm and all particles brighter than the threshold and larger than 3 pixels were recognized and recorded. For visual inspection, original image was shown in green and recognized endosomes in red (see picture). Due to colocalization of recognized endosomes with the higher intensity in the original image the endosomes are yellow. Endosomes within cell were recognized by this approach (left panel) whereas most of the endosomes remaining attached to the bright membrane cell membrane, or localized in its close proximity, remained unrecognized and were not counted (right panel). This algorithm was used repeatedly for all images of the time series. Subsequently, individual cells in the images were analysed semi-manually, in order to obtain average numbers of recognized endosomes per cell. These values are plotted in the main text Figures. Each plot shows one representative experiment (n = 3) and error bars correspond to standard deviations of endosomal numbers for this experiment, including values form 20–40 cells.</p>
