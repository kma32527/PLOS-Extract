        <p>The marine bacterium <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is a leading cause worldwide of gastroenteritis linked to the consumption of contaminated seafood. Despite the prevalence of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced gastroenteritis, there is limited understanding of how this pathogen causes disease in the intestine. In part, the paucity of knowledge results from the absence of an oral infection-based animal model of the human disease. We developed a simple oral infection-based infant rabbit model of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced intestinal pathology and diarrhea. This experimental model enabled us to define several previously unknown but key features of the pathology elicited by this organism. We found that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> chiefly colonizes the distal small intestine and that the organism's second type III secretion system is essential for colonization. The epithelial surface of the distal small intestine is also the major site of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced damage, which arises via a characteristic sequence of events culminating in the formation of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-filled cavities in the epithelial surface. This experimental model will transform future studies aimed at deciphering the bacterial and host factors/processes that contribute to disease, as well as enable testing of new therapeutics to prevent and/or combat infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in the marine environment, often in association with shellfish. It is a leading cause of gastroenteritis linked to consumption of raw or undercooked seafood throughout the world, and especially in Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Su1">[1]</xref>. Infections caused by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> can occur sporadically or in outbreaks, which can be relatively large. For example, in 2005, more than 10,000 people were sickened by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-contaminated clams and mussels in Chile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Cabello1">[2]</xref>. The most common clinical manifestation of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection of the gastrointestinal tract is acute, self-limited watery diarrhea that is often accompanied by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. However, the severity of symptoms can range from mild watery diarrhea to a severe dysentery-like illness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Joseph1">[3]</xref>. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> has also been linked to wound infections and septicemia; however, such infections are far less common and generally not food-borne.</p>
      <p>Despite the prevalence of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced gastroenteritis, there is limited understanding of the pathogenesis of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced diarrhea. In part, this paucity of knowledge is explained by the fact that few analyses of intestinal tissue from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected patients have been performed, few human volunteer studies have been carried out, and there is no oral-infection-based animal model that closely resembles the human disease. However, human studies suggest that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection disrupts the intestinal epithelium. Autopsy findings from the first reported epidemic of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> in Japan noted ‘slight erosion of the jejunum and ileum’ in several patients who died due to the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Fujino1">[4]</xref>. In the most extensive study to date, rectal and duodenal biopsies from patients with acute <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infections revealed ‘epithelial degeneration and denudation’ at both sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Qadri1">[5]</xref>, creating some uncertainty regarding the intestinal site (small or large bowel) and processes that give rise to the watery diarrhea that usually accompanies <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection. Additionally, there was evidence of an acute inflammatory response, marked by polymorphonucleocyte (PMN) infiltration at both sites, as well as elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in stool, and TNF-α in blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Qadri1">[5]</xref>. Thus, studies to date suggest that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> causes disease via different mechanisms than the related pathogen <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, which does not disrupt the intestinal epithelium nor induce significant inflammation in infected individuals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie1">[6]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Comparison of clinical and environmental isolates of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> has enabled identification of several likely virulence factors in this pathogen. Of note, most clinical isolates exhibit β-hemolytic activity on Wagatsuma agar (<italic>aka</italic> the Kanagawa phenomenon) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Sakazaki1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Shirai1">[8]</xref>, while this phenotype is lacking in most environmental isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Nishibuchi1">[9]</xref>. Hemolytic activity is mediated by the thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Nishibuchi2">[10]</xref>, and has also been demonstrated for the Tdh-related hemolysin (TRH) using human erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ohnishi1">[11]</xref>. Recently, genome sequencing has revealed that pathogenic isolates of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> also encode two type III secretion systems (T3SS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Makino1">[12]</xref>. T3SS have been found to contribute to the virulence of many bacterial pathogens, as they enable injection of bacterial proteins (effectors) directly into host cells and subsequent modulation of numerous host processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Vossenkamper1">[13]</xref>. T3SS2 of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is encoded in a pathogenicity island on the small chromosome (chrII) of pathogenic strains. This pathogenicity island also encodes TDH; consequently, the Kanagawa phenomenon is indirectly a marker for 2 distinct potential virulence factors. T3SS1 is encoded on the bacterium's large chromosome (chrI), and unlike T3SS2, appears to be ubiquitous within both clinical and environmental isolates of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Makino1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays have been used to characterize the effects of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and its putative virulence loci upon host cells and tissues. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> causes a variety of changes in cultured cell lines, including release of cellular contents, cell rounding, disruption of tight junction complexes and cytoskeletal structures, and ion influx (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Broberg1">[14]</xref>). In particular, tissue-culture-based assays have been useful for linking T3SS1 with cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Zhou1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Bhattacharjee2">[21]</xref>, although the relationship between cytotoxicity and enteritis remains unclear. The effects of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> upon animal tissues have also been studied, primarily using rabbit ligated ileal loops, a model of intestinal fluid response. In this model, both TDH and T3SS2 contribute to fluid accumulation, with T3SS2 exerting the predominant effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Park1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Hiyoshi1">[22]</xref>. Studies using ligated ileal loops also suggest that T3SS2 is linked to inflammation and epithelial denudation. T3SS2 was likewise required to induce mild transient (∼4 hr) diarrhea in 2-day-old piglets orally infected with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>; however, pig intestines showed minimal histopathologic abnormalities, even when infected with wild type bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Pineyro1">[23]</xref>. Limitations in each of these models indicate that studies of the pathogenesis of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-linked enteritis would be transformed by development of a non-surgical small animal model in which bacterial colonization and host response, including diarrhea, histopathology and inflammation, could all be monitored and evaluated.</p>
      <p>Here, we report that infant rabbits oro-gastrically inoculated with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> develop severe diarrhea and enteritis. The pathogen primarily colonizes the distal small intestine, the site where inflammation and dramatic histopathologic and ultrastructural changes in the epithelium were also observed. Similar to attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens such as enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC), which also cause intestinal disease, and in marked contrast to <italic>V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus</italic> causes effacement of the microvilli. However, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> causes more widespread disruption of villus structure than A/E pathogens. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> proliferates in epithelial cavities, initially forming large, dense microcolonies and ultimately inducing extensive extrusion and/or erosion of villous epithelial cells and a loss of epithelial barrier function in the small intestine. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> proliferates in cavities created in the epithelium forming large, dense microcolonies. T3SS2 proved to be essential for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to colonize the small intestine and cause disease, but T3SS1 and TDH also modulate <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> virulence in the intestine. When taken together, our findings suggest that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> damages the host intestine via a previously undescribed process and that infant rabbits are an outstanding model host for investigating <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> pathogenicity.</p>

        <title>Oro-gastric infection of infant rabbits with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> causes severe diarrhea and enteritis</title>
        <p>We tested whether rabbits could be used as a model host to study <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced gastroenteritis, as we previously found that the intestinal diseases caused by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> non-O1 non-O139, and enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC) can be successfully modeled using these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie2">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Shin1">[27]</xref>. Based on our previous experience, 3-day-old rabbits were treated with cimetidine, a histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist that transiently alleviates gastric acidity, prior to bacterial inoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Schlech1">[28]</xref>. Most rabbits oro-gastrically inoculated with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> developed severe diarrhea, but the clinical course and kinetics of disease in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected rabbits differed from the diseases caused by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> non-O1 non-O139 serogroups, or EHEC. In almost all rabbits, inoculation with 1×10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units (cfu) of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> resulted in release of loose, unformed gelatinous stools, followed by liquid yellow diarrheal fluid, which typically developed between 20–40 hr after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and soaked the ventral surfaces of the rabbits. If the experiments were continued, the animals subsequently lost weight, became lethargic and died by 64 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, in most experiments described below, we used end points at or prior to 38 hr to enable a variety of analyses at times when most rabbits exhibited disease but had not yet succumbed to infection. At 38 hr post-infection (PI), the intestines of most surviving rabbits were swollen and filled with fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), with elevated fluid accumulation ratios versus mock-infected rabbits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the fluid contained higher levels of total protein (0.53 vs 0.2 g dL<sup>−1</sup>) and K<sup>+</sup> (35 vs 18 mmol dL<sup>−1</sup>) than the fluid from rabbits infected with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie2">[24]</xref>. The elevations in the levels of protein and K<sup>+</sup> are consistent with the marked disruption of small intestinal villous epithelial cells observed in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected animals (see below) and suggestive of a diarrheal mechanism that is distinct from the classic secretory diarrhea of cholera, where the intestinal epithelium remains intact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Gangarosa1">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The lower half of the small intestine appears to be the primary target of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. The highest numbers of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> were recovered from homogenates of the mid and distal regions of the small intestine (∼10<sup>9</sup> cfu g<sup>−1</sup>); ∼10–200-fold fewer cfu were recovered from the cecum, colon and proximal small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, histologic analyses revealed the more extensive pathologic changes to the tissue occurred within the lower third of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections from the distal small intestine, the tips of the villi appeared ragged and irregular, and epithelial cell debris from the disrupted villi was detected in the intestinal lumen (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figures 1D &amp; E</xref>). Discrete and oftentimes dense clusters of bacteria adherent to the epithelium were also evident in these sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, arrowhead). Heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils, were observed in the lamina propria as well as apparently migrating through the epithelial barrier toward adherent bacteria and the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1F</xref> arrow); degranulated heterophils were seen as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Consistent with the histologic evidence of marked inflammation, 4–20 fold elevations in the abundance of transcripts for IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β by quantitative PCR analyses of RNA were found in homogenates of the distal small intestines of infected relative to uninfected rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). In addition, the zone of proliferating cells at the base of the villi was larger in infected animals than in controls, suggesting that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection induces host cell proliferation (see below). Pathological abnormalities in the cecum were limited to moderate sub-mucosal edema which contained few inflammatory cells. Importantly, attached bacteria and histologic abnormalities were not observed in the colon, despite large numbers of bacteria recovered from tissue homogenates taken from this site. Finally, blood samples and homogenates of the spleen, gall bladder and liver rarely contained <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (bacteria were recovered in 3 of 16 samples at approx. 10–100 cfu mL<sup>−1</sup> homogenate), suggesting that the infection does not ordinarily extend beyond the intestine in the infant rabbits. Collectively, these observations show that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> adheres to and colonizes the distal small intestine of the infant rabbit, where it induces inflammatory enteritis accompanied by severe disruption of the epithelial lining.</p>

        <title>Kinetics of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced intestinal pathology and colonization</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the temporal progression of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-linked pathological changes in the small intestine, as well as their relationship to overt signs of disease, we compared tissue from the distal small intestines of infected rabbits at 12, 18, 28 and 38 hr PI. Bacterial numbers within tissue homogenates increased markedly between 12 and 18 hr PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.) After 18 hr PI, the number of organisms recovered from the distal small intestine remained relatively constant, despite the onset of diarrhea (and the loss of bacteria-laden fluid containing 10<sup>9</sup> cfu mL<sup>−1</sup>) at ∼28 hr; thus, bacterial proliferation clearly continues despite the absence of an increase in the measured bacterial load within the intestine. The amount of fluid accumulated in the distal small intestine increased gradually, reaching statistically greater levels than in mock-infected rabbits at 38 hr PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Bacterial abundance as assessed by plating tissue homogenates only partially corresponded to the microcolonies of bacteria evident in H&amp;E-stained tissue sections. Bacterial microcolonies were not usually detected in tissue sections at 12 hr PI; however, by ∼18 hr PI, small clusters were more frequently found on the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). By 28 hr PI, the bacterial microcolonies were larger and more abundant, and appeared to be located within ‘cavities’ on the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2D–F</xref>). The observed increase in visible bacterial microcolonies at 28 hr relative to 18 hr, which did not correspond with any further increase in the concentration of bacteria recovered in tissue homogenates, may reflect better attachment of the bacteria by 28 hr or better retention of bacteria in the cavities during staining of tissue sections. Finally, at 38 hr PI, large numbers of bacteria, both as individual cells and as large (sometimes exceeding 50 µm in diameter), dense microcolonies, were associated with the villi and the luminal cellular debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Bacteria within tissue sections were confirmed to be <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> via infection of rabbits with a strain that constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP); confocal microscopy analyses revealed that the distribution of GFP-expressing bacteria, both within cavities on the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and in association with epithelial debris corresponded closely to that seen in H&amp;E-stained sections. Furthermore, no bacteria were seen in mock-infected rabbits at any point.</p>
        <p>Serial histologic analyses also revealed a striking characteristic progressive disruption of the small intestine's epithelial morphology during the infection. At 12 and 18 hr PI, intestinal villi appeared intact, with a fairly smooth surface, although by 18 hr, heterophils were observed in the lamina propria of villi, where small clusters of bacteria were also often observed to be attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, data not shown). Even at this earlier time point, adherent bacterial clusters were associated with erosions in the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2C</xref> inset). By 28 hr PI, these erosions were more pronounced, generating cavities in the epithelial surface and resulting in loss of the peripheral actin ring that ordinarily encircles each villus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2D</xref> (inset), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">2E</xref>). Formation of these cavities appears to rely on extrusion of epithelial cells and/or their contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cells were often observed at the base of extruding epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, arrowheads). At 28 hr, heterophils had become more abundant within the lamina propria, and a few were observed in the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, long arrows). However at this point, most of the epithelial layer remained intact and little luminal debris was observed.</p>
        <p>Extensive disruption of the epithelium and disintegration of villi was not evident until 38 hr PI; at this point, bacteria were often associated with epithelial cells that were loosely connected together, giving villi a ‘flower-like’ appearance, and with the abundant epithelial debris within the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Luminal debris consisted of both whole cells (with nuclei) and membrane-bound fragments of cytoplasmic material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). At this time point, while increasing numbers of heterophils continued to be recruited into the intestine, it was somewhat surprising that more were not present given the amount of tissue destruction that was observed. However, immunostaining revealed that macrophages, which were present in low numbers at earlier time points, were more abundant at 38 hr PI, both in the tissue and in the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Collectively, these analyses suggest that the initial attachment of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to discrete areas in the distal small intestine initiates a cascade of changes in the host. As the pathogen adheres and proliferates, small surface erosions give rise to bacterial-filled cavities in the epithelium, followed by disintegration of the villi. An acute (heterophil-based) inflammatory response occurs at the same time as early epithelial surface erosion, when a relatively small number of bacteria are attached to the surface. Thus, the inflammatory response to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection precedes, rather than occurs as a result of, the extensive tissue disruption observed at later (e.g., 38 hr) stages in the infection.</p>
        <p>In normal tissue, the loss of dying or damaged epithelial cells from the villus is balanced by the generation of new progenitor cells by proliferation in the crypts. Thus, to explore the relationship between intestinal cell proliferation and epithelial cell loss, we also assessed cell proliferation at 18 and 28 hr PI. Tissue sections were labeled with anti-Ki67, an intrinsic marker for actively dividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Alferez1">[30]</xref>, and the zone of proliferating cells relative to villus length was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Strikingly, even at 18 h PI, the zone of proliferating cells was significantly greater in infected compared to uninfected rabbits (mean ± SEM: 0.52±0.06 and 0.21±0.02; P&lt;0.01). This difference was also apparent at 28 hr PI (0.65±0.04 and 0.36±0.06; P&lt;0.05). (We did not perform Ki67 staining at 38 hr PI due to the massive tissue disruption that had occurred). These data strongly suggest that epithelial cell proliferation in response to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, like the inflammatory response, does not occur as a result of tissue disruption, but is instead an early step in the host response to infection.</p>

        <p>To further characterize how <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> interacts with epithelial cells, we used scanning and transmission electron microscopy (EM) to visualize the epithelium in the small intestine of infected rabbits. Numerous clusters of attached bacteria were observed with scanning EM by 28 hr PI, particularly near the villus tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3A</xref>); bacteria were not observed within the crypts. Epithelial cells with attached <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> exhibited dramatic ultrastructural changes, whereas epithelial cells without bacteria appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, data not shown). Attached bacteria were typically found in clusters, with individual cells often oriented perpendicular to the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, the appearance of the epithelial surface surrounding bacterial clusters was grossly distorted by the presence of numerous elongated (5–10 µm long) hair-like cellular projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, arrowheads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In transmission EM, depending on the angle of sectioning, these protrusions appear as a disorganized mix of cross-sections or short fragments that extend well beyond the range of the normal brush border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Higher magnification images revealed that these structures were surrounded by a clearly defined membrane and contained internal filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), two features that strongly suggest that these protrusions represent elongated microvilli.

        <title><italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> induces re-distribution of cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins</title>
        <p>Cell shedding is a normal process in which apoptotic epithelial cells are routinely extruded into the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Vereecke1">[35]</xref>. Re-distribution of cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., actin) as well as proteins that form apically located tight junction complexes (e.g., ZO-1, claudins and occludin-1) is thought to contribute to cell shedding while maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Guan1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Marchiando1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, to begin to investigate the molecular processes that underlie <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced cell extrusion from the small bowel epithelium, we compared the localization of host cytoskeletal components in tissues from infected and mock-infected rabbits. Re-distribution of F-actin, ZO-1, and occludin-1 from their normal locations at the apical cell periphery and the apical boundaries between cells to the lateral membrane was apparent for cells undergoing extrusion. The redistributed proteins formed an intense focal point or funnel-like structure at the base of the extruding cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>), similar to structures that have been observed during both physiologic and pathologic epithelial cell shedding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Guan1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Marchiando1">[37]</xref>. These observations suggest that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> may usurp at least certain components of the normal shedding process to promote cell extrusion during the course of infection. However, in contrast to ZO-1 and occludin-1, claudin-1, which is located along the lateral membranes in uninfected tissue, did not appear to co-localize with F-actin at the lateral membrane as occurs in physiologic and pathologic cell shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g004">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Marchiando1">[37]</xref>).

Furthermore, while shedding cells normally exhibit signs of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Vereecke1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Watson1">[40]</xref>, most cells undergoing <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced extrusion did not, as no TUNEL staining was detected in extruding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> appears to elicit extrusion of cells that would not ordinarily undergo shedding. TUNEL-positive cells were present in the luminal debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) especially at later points in the infection, suggesting that cell death occurs after extrusion during <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection.</p>

        <title><italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> disrupts epithelial barrier integrity in the small intestine</title>
        <p>Our observations of increased epithelial cell shedding and the formation of bacteria-filled cavities in the epithelium of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected rabbits raised the possibility that infection might compromise epithelial barrier function, even when the intestinal tissue appears largely intact. Consequently, we tested whether a small molecular tracer, biotin, could penetrate beyond the luminal surface of the epithelium after injection into the dissected distal small intestine or colon of infected and control rabbits at 25 hr PI. In the mock-infected rabbits, biotin remained localized to the luminal side of the epithelial barrier in the small intestine and colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; data not shown). In contrast, biotin was detected in the lamina propria as well as on the luminal surface of tissue from the small intestine of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected rabbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), even though at the time point assayed the villi structure was not extensively disrupted. The route by which biotin reaches the lamina propria cannot definitively be discerned from this experiment; however, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced disruptions in the proteins that form the tight junction complex, and a resulting increase in paracellular permeability, seem likely to play an important role. No penetration of biotin was observed in the colon of infected rabbits, consistent with the previously noted lack of bacterial attachment and pathology at this site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This finding provides additional evidence that the small intestine is the pathologically relevant site during <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection.</p>

        <p>To begin to address which bacterial factors are important in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced enteritis, we assessed colonization by and disease associated with a previously described set of isogenic <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> mutants, each lacking one or more of the 3 principal described virulence factors: TDH (Δ<italic>tdh</italic>), T3SS1 (Δ<italic>vscN</italic>1, an essential component of T3SS1) and T3SS2 (Δ<italic>vscN</italic>2, an essential component of T3SS2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Hiyoshi1">[22]</xref>. A triple Δ<italic>tdh</italic> Δ<italic>vcrD</italic>1 Δ<italic>vcrD</italic>2 mutant (<italic>vcrD</italic>1 and <italic>vcrD</italic>2 are also essential components of T3SS1 and T3SS2, respectively) did not cause disease or elicit inflammation in rabbits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Of the single deletions, inactivation of T3SS2 had the most dramatic attenuating effect, which closely resembled that of the triple mutation. Of 12 rabbits infected with the Δ<italic>vscN</italic>2 mutant, none developed diarrhea, exhibited intestinal fluid accumulation, or induced histological changes in intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Notably, there was a more than 4-log reduction in the number of Δ<italic>vscN</italic>2 mutant bacteria recovered from the small intestine relative to the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Thus, the T3SS2 is essential for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> intestinal colonization. As such, it is likely that the profound attenuation of virulence of the Δ<italic>vscN</italic>2 mutant at least in part reflects its reduced capacity for intestinal colonization. However, since previous studies showed that T3SS2 accounted for most of the epithelial disruption and inflammation in ileal loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Park1">[19]</xref>, a closed system in which many colonization factors may not be essential, it is likely that T3SS2 plays a critical role both in colonization and subsequent events in pathogenesis.</p>

        <p>Inactivation of T3SS1 had a more subtle effect; however, our analyses suggest that this apparatus also contributes to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced enteritis. Intestinal colonization by the Δ<italic>vscN</italic>1 mutant appeared to be slightly lower than that of the wild type strain, although this difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>). As visualized by scanning EM, the Δ<italic>vscN1</italic> mutant induced microvillous elongation and formed microcolonies that were grossly indistinguishable to those observed during wild type infection. However, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of rabbits with diarrhea (27% vs 70% for the wild type strain). Additionally, rabbit intestines contained significantly less fluid when infected with the Δ<italic>vscN</italic>1 mutant, as reflected by the fluid accumulation ratio within the distal small intestine, although unlike the case with the Δ<italic>vscN</italic>2 mutant, some fluid was still observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref>). Inactivation of T3SS1 had no apparent effect on heterophil infiltration, epithelial cell sloughing, or cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Furthermore, a mutant lacking T3SS1 (and also TDH, known as POR-2) showed no reduction in cytokine production relative to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that the secretion system is not required for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to induce an inflammatory response.</p>
        <p>In contrast to T3SS2 and T3SS1, our data suggests that TDH dampens at least some aspects of the host response to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection. Rabbits infected with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> lacking TDH developed diarrhea and had a fluid accumulation ratio significantly greater than that of wild type bacteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref>). Compared to the wild type, similar numbers of the <italic>tdh</italic> mutant were recovered in most intestinal sections; however, significantly higher numbers were recovered in the proximal small intestine suggesting that this mutant is better able to colonize this region of the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). By scanning EM, TDH does not appear to be necessary for microvillous elongation or the formation of microcolonies on the epithelial surface as these features were grossly similar in rabbits infected with the wild type or the <italic>tdh</italic> mutant. Heterophil recruitment and epithelial cell sloughing were also not altered in response to the <italic>tdh</italic> mutant relative to the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6D, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s005">Figure S5</xref>); however, in places, the superficial mucosa appeared necrotic, suggesting a more severe pathological reaction was occurring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Additionally, the zone of proliferating cells was significantly enlarged in response to the <italic>tdh</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g006">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The presence of augmented proliferation in the absence of increased heterophil infiltration observed with the <italic>tdh</italic> mutant suggests that these two responses to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection occur independently.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have developed a simple non-surgical oral infection model of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced intestinal pathology and diarrhea. This experimental model enabled us to define several previously unknown but key features of the pathogenesis of the disease elicited by this common agent of seafood-borne gastroenteritis. First, we discovered that this organism chiefly colonizes the distal small intestine, the region of the intestine that is also the major site of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced damage, increased permeability of the epithelial barrier and inflammation. Together, these observations strongly suggest that disease in this region of the gastrointestinal tract accounts for most, if not all, of the diarrhea that accompanies <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection. Second, we found that the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T3SS2 is essential for the pathogen to colonize the small intestine; prior to our work no <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> intestinal colonization factors had been definitively identified because of the absence of a robust animal model. Third, we observed that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> causes marked disruption of the villous epithelial surface in the small intestine. Effacement of microvilli, re-distribution of cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins, and extrusion of epithelial cells in the small intestine all appear to contribute to villus disruption and the breakdown of epithelial barrier function. Furthermore, the pathogen induces remarkable elongation of microvilli in epithelial cells adjacent to attached <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. Finally, early in the infection, before widespread damage to the epithelium becomes evident, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> induces both proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Thus, our observations suggest that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> elicits disease via a previously undescribed sequence of events that, to our knowledge, differs from those outlined for other enteric pathogens.</p>
      <p><italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, like <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie2">[24]</xref>, preferentially colonizes the distal small intestine. However, the manner in which these two pathogenic vibrios associate with the host epithelial surface differs. Prototypical <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 colonizes as layers of cells embedded in mucin-rich material that covers much of the epithelial surface of the villi as well as the crypts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie2">[24]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> colonizes as more discrete clusters of bacteria (<italic>i.e.</italic> microcolonies) that predominantly localize to the upper half of the villi; furthermore, unlike <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie2">[24]</xref>, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> does not induce goblet cell degranulation. The mechanism(s) that hold the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> microcolonies together are not known. However, since the microcolonies appear to form during contact with the epithelial surface, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> lateral flagella, which can be induced by surface contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-McCarter1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-GodePotratz1">[42]</xref>, may promote microcolony formation. These lateral cell appendages have been reported to form linkages between neighboring bacteria and the surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Belas1">[43]</xref>. Induction of peritrichous flagella is associated with conversion of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> from small (2–3 µm), polarly flagellated swimmer cells to swarmer cells, which are elongated (5–20 µm) as well as peritrichously flagellated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-GodePotratz1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-McCarter2">[44]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cells up to 10 µm in length in electron micrographs of infected tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s003">Figure S3D</xref>, asterisk), consistent with the idea that these cells have switched from the swimmer to the swarmer cell state.</p>
      <p>The consequences of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> colonization of the small intestine are also fundamentally different. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 does not damage the surface of the intestinal epithelium; instead, the cholera pathogen grows on the luminal side of the microvilli which remain largely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Nelson1">[34]</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002593.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). In marked contrast, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> damages the epithelial surface, leading to villus disintegration. Our histologic analyses of samples from 12 to 38 hr PI suggest that there is a characteristic sequence of steps through which <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> proceeds to cause villus disruption in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g007">7</xref>). Initial attachment of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to the epithelial surface is associated with effacement of microvilli and apparent depletion of cytoplasmic contents; thus, even at 18 hr PI, attached <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> was observed situated below the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Both marked depletion of epithelial cell cytoplasmic contents as well as epithelial cell extrusion contribute to the formation of these <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-filled cavities in the epithelial surface. It is not clear if <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> penetration of the paracellular space to reach the base of the extruding cell is a required step for extrusion, though this was often observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g002">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">3G</xref>). The benefit of the epithelial cavities for the pathogen is not known, but it seems plausible that the cavities may provide the pathogen increased access to nutrients, or serve as a niche, offering protection from peristaltic flow.</p>

          <title>Schematic of kinetics of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced damage to the intestinal epithelial surface.</title>
          <p>Following initial attachment, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> induces erosion of microvilli and depletion of cytoplasmic contents resulting in the formation of bacterial clusters located just below the level of the surrounding epithelium. Continued depletion of epithelial cell contents either by cytoplasmic ‘blebbing’, whole cell extrusion and microvilli elongation around the edge of the cluster, leaves <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> clusters situated within deeper cavities in the epithelium. Eventually, this leads to disintegration of normal villus structure and the generation of large amounts of luminal debris. These pathological changes appear to be attributed to T3SS2 as a similar pathology was observed in rabbits infected with mutants lacking TDH or T3SS1. The purple rods represent <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>

      <p>The molecular mechanisms by which <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> elicits epithelial cell extrusion are not known. The process bears some similarity to the normal process that leads to shedding of apoptotic epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Vereecke1">[35]</xref>. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced cell extrusion, as in physiologic cell shedding, is accompanied by redistribution of tight junction-associated proteins, including ZO-1 and occludin-1, towards the basolateral membrane where they co-localized with actin to form a funnel-like structure. However, claudin-1 did not follow this pattern in extruding cells of infected tissues, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic shedding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Marchiando1">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, while paracellular barrier integrity is maintained during physiological cell shedding, there is an increase in paracellular permeability observed in infected rabbits. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced cell shedding could be a direct effect of the pathogen (e.g., perhaps a consequence of the activities of translocated T3SS effectors on tight junction complexes), or an indirect consequence of infection. For example, certain pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF (whose production is stimulated by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>) have been shown to elicit cell shedding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Marchiando1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Marchiando2">[45]</xref>. Regardless of the mechanisms leading to epithelial cell extrusion, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced break down in epithelial barrier function, which has also been observed in a polarized epithelial monolayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Lynch1">[46]</xref>, likely contributes to the loss of intestinal fluid (diarrhea) caused by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>
      <p>Pathogen-induced epithelial cell extrusion has also recently been detected for other enteric pathogens. For example, EHEC induces extrusion of cells from polarized monolayers and during infection of calves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Simovitch1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Nart1">[48]</xref>. Tissue-culture-based studies have revealed that the EHEC T3SS effector EspM, which interferes with the RhoA-signaling pathways that regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics in eukaryotic cells, is sufficient to cause extrusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Simovitch1">[47]</xref>. The purpose of pathogen-induced cell extrusion is difficult to ascertain, particularly since it can have benefits for both the pathogen and the host. For <italic>Salmonella</italic>, intestinal epithelial cell extrusion has been shown to promote the pathogen's spread within, and escape from, the intestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Knodler1">[49]</xref>. Cell extrusion could also promote the egress of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> from the intestine since extruded cells and debris often had adherent <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. However, it is also possible that extrusion aids the host, by enabling shedding of adherent bacteria. In support of this idea, it has been found that several bacterial pathogens (e.g., <italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Neisseria</italic>) produce factors that appear to counteract epithelial shedding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Kim1">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Some of the ultrastructural changes <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> elicits in intestinal epithelial cells are reminiscent of phenotypes previously described for EPEC, a member of the A/E family of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Shaw1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Knutton1">[32]</xref>. Similar to EPEC-induced changes in small intestine explants, we observed long spaghetti-like protrusions from epithelial cells surrounding the edges of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> clusters, effacement of microvilli, and the close apposition of individual <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cells to the effaced epithelial surface within cup-like structures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The mechanism(s) that mediate these dramatic alterations in host epithelial cell morphology remain to be determined. However, it seems likely that, similar to EPEC, the activities of some of the effectors translocated by one or both of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T3SS manipulate the host cytoskeleton and thereby alter cell morphology. Indeed, several type III translocated proteins of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and the related pathogen <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, including the recently described VopV, have been shown to alter actin dynamics in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Liverman1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Hiyoshi2">[55]</xref>. Furthermore, AM-19226, a non-O1, non-O139 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain that encodes a T3SS similar to the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T3SS2 causes villus destruction in the small intestine of infant rabbits, suggesting that common effectors translocated by these systems may contribute to the pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Shin1">[27]</xref>. However, the steps leading to the destruction of intestinal villi by AM-19226 have not been elucidated, and the pathologic features of AM-19226-induced disease differ from those caused by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>
      <p>Besides damaging the villous epithelium in the small intestine, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> also causes elevated proliferation of cells in the crypts. Several other enteric pathogens, as well as the microbiota, have been reported to alter intestinal epithelial dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Kim1">[50]</xref>. In some cases, pathogen-induced changes in epithelial homeostasis are thought to promote bacterial colonization. Similarly, since <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> damages the epithelium, promoting epithelial renewal could enhance colonization. However, the increased cell proliferation occurs early during <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection, suggesting that proliferation is not a direct response to epithelial damage. Identification of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> factor(s) that lead to elevated proliferation, and the manner by which they are antagonized by TDH, may yield insight into mechanisms that normally govern turnover of intestinal stem cells.</p>
      <p>Our findings suggest that each of the three previously proposed <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> virulence-linked loci – TDH and the two T3SSs – modulate the organism's pathogenicity. Our results confirm and extend earlier ileal-loop-based studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Park1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Hiyoshi1">[22]</xref> indicating that T3SS2 is the major virulence factor contributing to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus'</italic> enterotoxicity. We observed that T3SS2 is not only required for intestinal fluid accumulation, but it is also essential for colonization of the small intestine. It will be interesting to explore how T3SS2 promotes colonization and investigate if one (or more) translocated effector(s) act in a similar fashion as the EPEC/EHEC translocated intimin receptor, Tir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-DeVinney1">[56]</xref>, to enable <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> adherence. Alternatively, do the T3SS2 effectors modulate host cell processes, including those of the immune response, to generate a niche permissive for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> proliferation? For example, increased access to nutrients may occur as a consequence of epithelial disruption.</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, we found that TDH negatively impacts colonization of the upper regions of the small intestine and appears to dampen some aspects of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced disease. This result contrasts with findings from studies using ligated ileal loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Hiyoshi1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Park2">[57]</xref>, where TDH was found to contribute to fluid accumulation. Differences between the experimental systems may explain these contradictory results; ligated ileal loops are closed systems where intestinal peristalsis is reduced and infections are of limited duration (typically 18 hr).</p>
      <p>Collectively, our findings suggest that infant rabbits will be a very useful experimental model to shed light on the pathogen and host factors, and mechanisms that explain the pathogenesis of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced intestinal disease. It is important to note however, that while many of the features of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-induced disease resemble those reported in humans, rabbits do not exhibit all the signs of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection that have been reported. For example, infected individuals can have occult blood in their stool and occasionally present with grossly bloody stools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Qadri1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Bolen1">[58]</xref>. The presence of blood in the stool appears to correlate with epithelial damage consisting of ‘superficial ulcerations’ in the lower intestine of patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Qadri1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Bolen1">[58]</xref>; no pathology was detected within the colons of infected rabbits and neither gross nor occult blood was observed in fecal material obtained from the rabbits. Nevertheless, infant rabbits reproduce the inflammatory enteritis and watery diarrhea that are the chief signs of disease in most infected individuals. Thus, studies using this model host should enable dissection of the complex interplay of pathogen and host factors that result in disease as well as testing of new therapeutics to combat and/or prevent infection.</p>

        <p>Litters of two-day old New Zealand White infant rabbits with the lactating doe were acquired from a commercial breeder (Milbrook Farm, Amherst, MA). The following day, the infant rabbits were administered cimetidine (50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> via intraperitoneal injection; Hospira, IL) 3 hr prior to oro-gastric inoculation with either 1×10<sup>9</sup> cfu wild type <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, or one of the isogenic mutants, or sodium bicarbonate solution (2.5 g in 100 mL; pH 9) using a size 4 French catheter (Arrow International, Reading, PA). To prepare the inocula, cultures of bacteria grown for ∼18 hr at 30°C were harvested by centrifugation (5 mins 6000 g), and the cell pellet resuspended in sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 9) to a final concentration of 2×10<sup>9</sup> cfu mL<sup>−1</sup>. Following inoculation, the infant rabbits were monitored frequently for clinical signs of illness. Disease was scored at euthanasia as follows: no gross disease (no adherent fecal material on fur and intestines appear normal), intestinal fluid (no adherent fecal material on fur but intestines appeared red, swollen and contained fluid), diarrhea (liquid fecal material stains or adheres to fur, and intestines appeared red, swollen and contained fluid). In most experiments, rabbits were euthanized at fixed times after infection (i.e. 12, 18, 28 or 38 hr PI), but rabbits were euthanized prior to these time points if they appeared moribund (categorized as ‘dead’ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002593-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002593-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). At necropsy, the intestinal tract from the duodenum to the rectum was removed and processed for microbiological, microscopic and histologic analyses. For some rabbits, the internal organs including the gall bladder, spleen and liver were also collected, homogenized and plated on selective media to check for systemic spread of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>
        <p>To determine fluid accumulation ratios (FARs), an approx. 5 cm length of the distal small intestine was isolated from the rest of the intestine using silk ligatures. The intestinal section was weighed and then cut every 0.5 cm to release any luminal fluid, and the tissue pieces reweighed. The FAR was calculated as the weight of fluid divided by the weight of the drained tissue. The electrolyte and protein concentrations in serum and diarrheal fluid collected from the ceca of infected rabbits were measured on an Olympus Analyzer (AU-2700) at the Brigham and Woman's Hospital clinical laboratory.</p>
        <p>The number of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cfu in tissue samples taken from the small and large intestine, cecum and stool were determined after homogenization, serial dilution and plating on LB media containing 50 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> carbenicillin as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002593-Ritchie2">[24]</xref>. For unknown reasons, rabbits were occasionally not colonized by the pathogen i.e., no <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cfu were detected in any tissue sample. These rabbits (less than 10%, regardless of strain tested) were excluded from all further analyses. However, any rabbits that contained detectable numbers of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cfu in at least one tissue sample were included; for these rabbits, the lower limit of detection was reported for sections where no colonies were detected at the lowest dilution plated, and this value was used in calculation of mean cfu.</p>
        <p>For routine histological analyses, tissue segments were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed for paraffin embedding and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The slides were semi-quantitatively assessed for infiltration of inflammatory cells (heterophils), cell proliferation, and tissue damage by a pathologist blinded to the origin of the tissue. Each histological parameter was evaluated on a 0–4 scale as follows: 0 (normal), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe) and 4 (severe and extensive).</p>
