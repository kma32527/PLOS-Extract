        <p>LPS-activated neutrophils secrete IL-1β by activation of TLR-4. Based on studies in macrophages, it is likely that ROS and lysosomal destabilization regulated by Syk activation may also be involved. Since neutrophils have abundant expression of the ITIM-containing co-receptor CEACAM1 and Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Neisseria</italic> utilize CEACAM1 as a receptor that inhibits inflammation, we hypothesized that the overall production of IL-1β in LPS treated neutrophils may be negatively regulated by CEACAM1. We found that LPS treated neutrophils induced phosphorylation of Syk resulting in the formation of a complex including TLR4, p-Syk, and p-CEACAM1, which in turn, recruited the inhibitory phosphatase SHP-1. LPS treatment leads to ROS production, lysosomal damage, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in neutrophils. The absence of this regulation in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils led to hyper production of IL-1β in response to LPS. The hyper production of IL-1β was abrogated by in vivo reconstitution of wild type but not ITIM-mutated CEACAM1 bone marrow stem cells. Blocking Syk activation by kinase inhibitors or RNAi reduced Syk phosphorylation, lysosomal destabilization, ROS production, and caspase-1 activation in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils. We conclude that LPS treatment of neutrophils triggers formation of a complex of TLR4 with pSyk and pCEACAM1, which upon recruitment of SHP-1 to the ITIMs of pCEACAM1, inhibits IL-1β production by the inflammasome. Thus, CEACAM1 fine-tunes IL-1β production in LPS treated neutrophils, explaining why the additional utilization of CEACAM1 as a pathogen receptor would further inhibit inflammation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Pathogens often evade the immune system by directly binding to and inhibiting neutrophils, abundant white cells that accumulate at the site of infection. For example Gram-negative <italic>Neisseria</italic> pathogens, such as those that cause gonorrhea or meningitis, bind the neutrophil receptor CEACAM1. Gram-negative bacteria express lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that interacts with toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) on neutrophils. Since CEACAM1 is an inhibitory receptor, we hypothesized that LPS activation of TLR4 would be inhibited. In this paper we show that this is the case and that the mechanism of LPS inhibition involves induction of a complex between the LPS receptor TLR4, CEACAM1 and an activating kinase called Syk. In the presence of CEACAM1, an inhibitory phosphatase (opposes the kinase) is recruited to the complex that prevents the activation of Syk. The net effect is the inhibition of the pathway that normally leads to the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We show that this inhibition is lost in CEACAM1 deficient neutrophils leading to hyper production of IL-1β. We think that CEACAM1 fine-tunes the normal inflammatory response at the site of infection preventing hyper-inflammation, but in the case of Gram-negative pathogens that actually bind to neutrophils, inflammation is further blunted, favoring the infectious process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes, respond to and help mediate inflammation by production of chemokines and cytokines, including IL-1β. While much is know about their migration to and activation at the site of inflammation, much less is known about the regulation of their inflammatory responses once they arrive. Importantly, CEACAM1, an ITIM-containing, abundantly expressed receptor on neutrophils, is a frequently used receptor for Gram-negative pathogens that results in an inhibition of the host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Boulton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Rowe1">[2]</xref>. Recently, we have shown that when CEACAM1 is genetically ablated in mice, neutrophils are over-produced and over-activated during infection with the model gram positive pathogen, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, resulting in accelerated mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Pan1">[3]</xref>. We hypothesized that elevated production of IL-1β (2-3-fold over wild type) in response to infection was a major cause contributing to accelerated mortality and was likely attributable directly to neutrophils lacking the inhibitory co-receptor CEACAM1. In the case of Gram-negative <italic>Neisseria</italic> pathogens that bind to CEACAM1, binding leads to both epithelial colonization and inhibition of the inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Sadarangani1">[4]</xref>. The high levels of CEACAM1 on neutrophils suggest that exposure to Gram-negative bacteria would lead to a more general inhibitory response, perhaps through the TLR4 pathway in response to LPS. In order to test this hypothesis in a model system, we have directly analyzed the production of IL-1β from LPS treated wild type versus Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils. LPS was chosen as a well-defined ligand for TLR4 signaling and for its action on neutrophils as a single agent.</p>
      <p>IL-1β belongs to the IL-1 cytokine family and is associated with many inflammatory responses and autoinflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Allen1">[11]</xref>. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) and NF-κB signaling dependent transcription, resulting in the transcription of the IL-1β precursor, pro-IL-1β. The maturation of IL-1β is regulated by the inflammasome, a multi-molecular complex composed of pro-caspase-1, Apoptosis-associated Speck-Like Protein (ASC), and NOD like receptor (NLR) family members, including NLRP1 (NOD like receptor containing pyrin 1), NLRP3 and NLRC4 (NOD like receptor containing CARD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Tschopp1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Ting1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yu1">[13]</xref>. The fully assembled inflammasome converts pro-caspase-1 into its enzymatically active form, caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Tschopp1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Ting1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yu1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>LPS is an endotoxin recognized by pattern recognition receptor TLR4 in myeloid cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, that induces an inflammatory response. LPS triggers the production of pro-IL-1β through the TLR-4-NF-κB pathway in macrophages and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hsu1">[14]</xref>. Since LPS alone cannot activate the maturation of IL-1β in macrophages, IL-1β production in response to LPS treatment is minimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hsu1">[14]</xref>. Macrophages require second signals such as ATP or crystals to activate the NLR family proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yu1">[13]</xref>. In contrast, LPS alone can induce high levels of mature IL-1β in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Rowe2">[15]</xref>. Thus, the mechanism of LPS induced IL-1β production in neutrophils must differ from macrophages in some fundamental manner. Since caspase-1 deficient neutrophils fail to produce mature IL-1β upon stimulation with LPS, it is likely that the caspase-1 dependent inflammasome NLRP3 is downstream from TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Rowe2">[15]</xref>, but the detailed mechanism from TLR4 to the inflammasome is largely unknown.</p>
      <p>In a recent study of the differential expression of NLRP3 among hematopoeitic cells, it was shown that neutrophils express similar levels of NLRP3 as resting macrophages, and the expression of NLRP3 is significantly increased in neutrophils in response to treatment with TLR ligands, including LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Guarda1">[16]</xref>. The expression of ASC, another component of inflammasomes, is also upregulated in neutrophils by inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Shiohara1">[17]</xref>. Since an inflammatory stimulus like LPS may activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils, it is of interest to determine the mechanism of its regulation.</p>
      <p>Cellular signals including ATP triggered induction of pore formation, K<sup>+</sup> efflux, ROS production and lysosomal destabilization have been shown to induce NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, procaspase-1 cleavage, pro- IL-1β cleavage and IL-1β secretion in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Tschopp1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Halle1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mariathasan1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>. Although the molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are still being defined, recent studies identified an upstream kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) as a critical mediator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Shio1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>. Indeed, Syk regulates both ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-VanZiffle1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Underhill1">[23]</xref> and lysosomal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Shio1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Asahi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-He1">[25]</xref>, two major signals for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Tschopp1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Halle1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>. For example, Syk couples the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages in response to fungi and crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Shio1">[20]</xref>. Syk is a non-receptor kinase usually recruited and activated by ITAM containing receptors, such as the Ig-α/β B cell receptor and FcRγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>. However, Syk also associates with receptors in an ITAM-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>. In response to stimulation by TLR ligands, Syk is phosphorylated and associates with TLRs, including TLR4 and TLR9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Lin1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, Syk inhibitors attenuate TLR downstream signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Lin1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>. In the case of human neutrophils, TLR4 directly associates with Syk and LPS stimulation increases this association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>. Similar to neutrophils, Syk constitutively associates with TLR4 and Myd88 in human monocytes, and p-Syk associates with TLR4 after LPS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chaudhary1">[29]</xref>. Although these studies place Syk in a critical downstream position associated with TLR4 signaling, they do not answer the question if activation of Syk through LPS-TLR4 leads to caspase-1 activation, ROS production, lysosomal damage and IL-1β production in neutrophils. Furthermore, since phosphorylated Syk can, in turn, be regulated by inhibitory phosphatases such as SHP1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>, it is of special interest to identify co-receptors responsible for the recruitment of these inhibitory phosphatases.</p>
      <p>In this respect, CEACAM1 (CD66a) serves as a likely candidate based on its role as a co-inhibitory molecule in the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Boulton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-GrayOwen1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Nagaishi1">[36]</xref> and its abundant expression in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Pan1">[3]</xref>. CEACAM1 is composed of a variable number of Ig-like extracellular domains, a trans-membrane domain and either long or short cytoplasmic domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-GrayOwen1">[30]</xref>. There are 4 murine CEACAM1 isoforms, CEACAM1-2L, CEACAM1-2S, CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4S based on the number of extracellular Ig-like domains and the length of the cytoplasmic tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-GrayOwen1">[30]</xref>. CEACAM1 short cytoplasmic domains primarily interact with the actin-cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yokoyama1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chen3">[38]</xref>, while the long cytoplasmic domains in addition contain two immuno-tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which upon phosphorylation recruit Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatases (SHP-1/2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-GrayOwen1">[30]</xref>. Notably, recruitment of SHP-1 by the CEACAM1 long form inhibits T cell activation through dephosphorylation of Zap-70, a Syk family kinase member <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chen1">[33]</xref>. However, the role of CEACAM1-SHP-1 modulation of Syk activation in other immune cells and its downstream effects has been little studied.</p>
      <p>We report here that LPS alone activates the caspase-1 inflammasome in neutrophils. LPS treated neutrophils require ROS production and lysosomal destabilization to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn, is coupled to Syk activation. LPS triggers Syk phosphorylation and an association between p-Syk and TLR4. LPS stimulation also leads to phosphorylation of CEACAM1 on its ITIMs, followed by recruitment of SHP-1 and incorporation into the TLR4-p-Syk complex. As expected, the recruitment of SHP-1 leads to attenuated Syk activation. Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils exhibit elevated Syk activation, leading to augmented ROS production and lysosomal destabilization, along with caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production. Reintroduction of different CEACAM1 isoforms into Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils demonstrates that the inhibition provided by CEACAM1 depends on the ITIMs in CEACAM1 long form and the recruitment of SHP-1. Blocking Syk activation by the inhibitor piceatannol or reduction of Syk amounts by RNAi significantly down-regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils, normalizing their IL-1β production. Therefore, our results indicate that CEACAM1 acts as a critical checkpoint in the regulation of Syk coupled NLPR3 inflammasome activation, limiting the amount of IL-1β production in neutrophils. The importance of the negative regulation of the inflammasome in neutrophils may be related to their abundant accumulation at the site of infection, where the amount of IL-1β release may need to be finely controlled. Yet, the fact that they highly express the components of the inflammasome suggests that they are capable of generating rather large amounts of IL-1β, which may contribute to runaway inflammation in the case of sepsis or diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease where neutrophils predominate and are activated by bacterial products such as LPS. Finally, the fact that potent pathogens such as <italic>Neisseria</italic> are able to suppress inflammation is likely due to the use of CEACAM1 as a receptor and its role in the regulation IL-1β production.</p>

        <title>LPS induced inflammasome activation in neutrophils depends on ROS production and lysosomal destabilization</title>
        <p>Since previous studies show LPS alone is sufficient for neutrophil IL-1β production, we were interested in determining whether the caspase-1 inflammasome is activated and the mechanisms for its activation. Consistent with previous studies, LPS alone activated IL-1β production in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>), but not in macrophages that required the additional signals ATP or alum crystals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). Since ATP and potassium efflux have been implicated in the secretion of IL-1β in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mariathasan1">[18]</xref>, we treated LPS primed neutrophils with KN62, an antagonist of the P2X7 receptor, the receptor largely responsible for mediating these ATP effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Ferrari1">[39]</xref>. Although we did observe ATP release from LPS treated neutrophils (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s001">Figure S1B</xref></bold>), KN62 failed to block caspase-1 activation or IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>). Furthermore, LPS fully stimulated IL-1β production in P2X7 deficient neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>), confirming the dispensability of exogenous ATP for LPS induced IL-1β production. We also examined the role of K<sup>+</sup> efflux by blocking potassium channels with glibenclamide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, a treatment that showed no measureable reduction of IL-1β production (data not shown), excluding the involvement of K<sup>+</sup> efflux in neutrophil LPS induced inflammasome activation. To test whether ROS production was necessary for inflammasome activation in neutrophils, we treated WT neutrophils with (2R, 4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2, 4-dicarboxylate (APDC), an inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase-dependent ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>. Indeed, APDC inhibited LPS stimulated ROS production in neutrophils by 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>), and IL-1β production by 45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>). To further test the role of ROS production on the inflammasome, neutrophils from gp91phox-deficient (Cybb<sup>−/−</sup>) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref> were treated with LPS. In these neutrophils less caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>), indicating that ROS production significantly mediates neutrophil inflammasome activation. Lysosomal destabilization commonly refers to both the release of cathepsin B and the inability of the lysosomal compartment to retain a low pH necessary for its lytic activities. When neutrophil lysosomal acidification was inhibited with bafilomycin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>), demonstrating the critical role of lysosomal destabilization. Besides showing that caspase-1 was activated in LPS treated neutrophils, we also blocked caspase-1 activation using the caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>, resulting in reduced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1A–B</bold></xref>), and suggesting that the caspase-1 containing inflammasome is mainly responsible for neutrophil IL-1β production. We conclude that LPS induced ROS production and lysosomal destabilization, which in turn, activated the inflammasome in neutrophils.</p>

        <title>Genetic ablation of CEACAM1 leads to elevated p-Syk and inflammasome activation in neutrophils</title>
        <p>Since Syk positively regulates LPS induced inflammasome activation in neutrophils, it is of interest to study the regulatory mechanism of Syk activation. CEACAM1 is a likely candidate due to its high expression in neutrophils and since CEACAM1 was shown to negatively regulate the related kinase Zap-70 in activated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chen1">[33]</xref>. We hypothesized that neutrophils lacking CEACAM1 would have unregulated Syk mediated inflammasome activation leading to high IL-1β production. Indeed, genetic ablation of CEACAM1 led to dramatically higher levels of p-Syk in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils compared with WT neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). We also compared global tyrosine phosphorylation for WT versus Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils after stimulation with LPS and found no obvious differences (data not shown), demonstrating that it is important to look at kinases using phosphotyrosine specific antibodies. To study the mechanism of the activation of Syk, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) studies with neutrophils from Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> and WT mice. While Syk was co-IPed with TLR4 before and after treatment with LPS, pSyk co-IPed with Syk and TLR4 only in response to LPS treatment and this association increased in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> compared to wild type neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). We also IPed TLR4 and tested its association with Dectin, a lectin associated with an ITAM response to bacteria with engagement of Syk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Underhill1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Rogers1">[40]</xref>. We found that LPS stimulation did not trigger the association of Dectin to the TLR4 complex (data not shown). Thus, LPS is a specific trigger of Syk activation, and the activated form remains associated with TLR4. Furthermore, when TLR4 was IPed after LPS treatment, the inhibitory co-receptor CEACAM1 was found associated with TLR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Thus, both CEACAM1 and pSyk only associate with TLR4 when activated by LPS. The mechanism by which CEACAM1 negatively regulates p-Syk in this complex will be explored later (see below). In addition, a previous study has shown that CD16/32 is not involved with LPS-stimulated TLR4 signals in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Rittirsch1">[41]</xref>. As a negative control, we IPed CD16/32 followed by immunoblotting with 4G10 on WT vs Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils after LPS stimulation and found a small amount of activation of this ITAM containing FcR, but to the same degree in WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Elevated Syk activation was associated with enhanced ROS production and was greatest for LPS treated Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). In addition, elevated p-Syk correlated with augmented lysosomal destabilization in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils. To demonstrate this on isolated cells, WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils were incubated with DQ ovalbumin, a lysosomal uptake marker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref> with or without LPS. As expected, DQ ovalbumin was restricted to lysosomes in resting stage WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>), but spread into the cytosol upon lysosomal rupture in LPS treated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). Moreover, this effect was greatest in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils due to enhanced inflammasome activation. To quantify lysosomal destabilization, neutrophils were stained with acridine orange, a fluorescent dye that is highly fluorescent in environmentally acidic lysosomes but is shifted to lower fluorescence in disrupted lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>. As expected, we observed a higher percentage of a lower fluorescent peak in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils versus WT neutrophils after LPS treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Consistently, the increased MFI of the LysoSensor Green dye in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils confirmed augmented lysosomal destabilization in these cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). Due to augmented ROS production and lysosomal destabilization, Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils exhibited significantly more IL-1β production (7 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>) and caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>) upon LPS treatment compared to WT neutrophils. Gibenlamide, also known as glyburide, an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, blocked IL-1ß production in both WT and CEACAM1 deficient neutrophils. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3G</bold></xref>). These data demonstrate that the production of IL-1ß in response to LPS is through the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils. Since genetic or inhibitor studies may affect the apoptotic status of neutrophils, we also stained the neutrophils with annexin V. The results of annexin V staining indicate that apoptosis was minimal (&lt;7%) in both WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils before and after LPS treatment (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Although the increased IL-1β production in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils could be due to increased transcription of IL-1β, there was no difference of IL-1β mRNA amounts in WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s003">Figure S3A</xref></bold>), indicating a similar degree of TLR-NF-κB signaling in WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils. This result also suggests that the elevated amounts of p-Syk were not caused by enhanced TLR-NF-κB signaling. In addition, we tested whether various IL-1β inhibitors affect the production of TNF-α, another TLR-NF-κB dependent cytokine. We found no significant difference in the levels of TNF-α among treatment with the various inhibitors in both WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils. (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>) Similar to WT neutrophils, Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils also depended on ROS and lysosomal destabilization for inflammasome activation since they responded similarly to WT neutrophils to KN62, APDC and bafilomycin A as manifested by caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g003"><bold>Figure 3E–F</bold></xref>). Unlike murine neutrophils, murine macrophages only express moderate amounts of CEACAM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Pan1">[3]</xref>, and WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) secreted similar amounts of IL-1β upon stimulation by LPS with ATP or Alum crystals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>), suggesting that the genetic ablation of CEACAM1 does not affect macrophage IL-1β production.</p>

        <p>CEACAM1 functions as a co-inhibitory receptor through phosphorylation of its ITIMs and the recruitment of SHP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Boulton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Pan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-GrayOwen1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Markel1">[35]</xref>.

Since the likely mechanism of inhibition involves phosphorylation of CEACAM1's ITIMs followed by recruitment of SHP-1, we IPed CEACAM1 and performed immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Syk and anti-SHP-1. Significant tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>) and significant amounts of Syk were co-IPed in LPS treated WT neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>), thus indicating that CEACAM1 was phosphorylated on its ITIMs and that Syk was physically associated with CEACAM1 after LPS treatment. As predicted, SHP-1 was recruited to phosphorylated CEACAM1 in an LPS dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>).

        <p>To prove that the inhibition provided by CEACAM1 in vivo relies on phosphorylation of its ITIMs and SHP-1 recruitment, we reintroduced CEACAM1-2L, CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-2S, CEACAM1-4S, ITIM mutated CEACAM1-2L (CEACAM1-2Lm) and ITIM mutated CEACAM1-4L (CEACAM1-4Lm) into Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> bone marrow stem cells using GFP containing retroviral vectors, and then injected GFP positive cells back into lethally irradiated Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> recipients. Two months later, we isolated neutrophils and examined their phenotypes (<bold>scheme shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002597.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). We found that compared to neutrophils recovered from mice reconstituted with empty vectors transduced Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> bone marrow stem cells, p-Syk amounts were reduced in neutrophils receiving CEACAM1 long isoforms, but not in those receiving the short isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). Furthermore, this down-regulation was abrogated by mutation of the ITIMs in CEACAM1 long isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). Consistently, only CEACAM1 long isoforms containing intact ITIMs were able to associate with Syk as shown by IP analysis with CEACAM1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>). As expected, the down-regulation of Syk activation by restoration of CEACAM1 long isoforms in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils attenuated ROS production and lysosomal destabilization (data not shown), leading to reduced IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g005"><bold>Figure 5E–F</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>These results are similar to previous studies on T-cells in which activation of T-cells led to induction of CEACAM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chen2">[34]</xref> followed by phosphorylation of CEACAM1 and recruitment of SHP-1, which in turn, led to down activation of the Syk-related kinase ZAP-70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chen1">[33]</xref>. The main difference is that CEACAM1 is constitutively expressed in neutrophils, thus maintaining a relatively low level of Syk mediated inflammasome activation prior to and after LPS activation.</p>

        <title>Blocking Syk activation or reduction of Syk amounts leads to attenuated inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils</title>
        <p>To further test if elevated Syk activation is indeed responsible for augmented inflammasome activation in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils, we inactivated Syk with a kinase inhibitor and reduced endogenous Syk amounts by RNAi treatment with the expectation of reducing inflammasome activation and IL-1β production comparable to WT levels. Indeed, piceatannol treatment of LPS stimulated Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils blocked Syk phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>), and also dramatically inhibited LPS induced ROS production (data not shown), lysosomal damage (data not shown), caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>) and IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>CEACAM1 (CD66a) has long been used as a marker for neutrophils due to its abundant expression and further up-regulation during activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Singer1">[43]</xref>. Since it is an ITIM-containing type 1 transmembrane protein, its main functional role in lymphocytes generates inhibitory signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Boulton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-GrayOwen1">[30]</xref>. The fact that many pathogens, including <italic>Neisseria</italic>, utilize CEACAM1 as a receptor on neutrophils results in a potent inhibition of the inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Boulton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Rowe1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Lee1">[44]</xref>. Although the mechanism of the inhibition has been studied at the level of CEACAM1's ITIM phosphorylation, the downstream effects on key components of the inflammatory response such as the inflammasome have not been studied. In fact, recent attention has turned to the role of CEACAM3, an ITAM-containing member of the CEA gene family, as the chief regulator of a positive inflammatory response in <italic>Neisseria</italic> infected neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Sadarangani1">[4]</xref>. Yet, the predominantly high levels of CEACAM1 on neutrophils suggest that inhibition would be the main outcome of LPS mediated gram-negative infections. Thus, we speculated that the inhibition was mediated by the LPS signaling pathway and not solely due to the direct binding of the bacteria to CEACAM1 or CEACAM3. Notably, the CEACAM3 response has been directly linked to Syk activation, which according to our findings would be inhibited by CECAM1 inhibition of the LPS-TLR4 pathway.</p>
      <p>While inflammasome activation has been intensively studied in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Tschopp1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Ting1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Yu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mariathasan1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>, the possibility that similar mechanisms apply to the more abundant neutrophils has not been comprehensively explored. In contrast to macrophages which need two signals to activate inflammasomes, in neutrophils, we found that LPS alone not only induced the production of pro-IL-1β, but also induced its processing to mature pro-IL-1β. We found that LPS stimulated neutrophils utilized ROS production and lysosomal destabilization as signals to activate the inflammasome. LPS induced TLR4 and the Src kinase Lyn association with Syk, a kinase previously found coupled to ROS production and lysosomal damage in PAMP stimulated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Halle1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Shio1">[20]</xref>. The inhibitory co-receptor CEACAM1 was recruited to TLR4 after LPS treatment of neutrophils and recruited SHP-1, that in turn, inhibited Syk phosphorylation. As a result, Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils exhibited enhanced Syk phosphorylation and elevated ROS production and lysosomal damage in response to LPS. Correspondingly, LPS treated neutrophils from Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed elevated caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production, demonstrating that CEACAM1 negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p>
      <p>The role of ROS in inflammasome activation has been recently investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Nakahira1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Zhou1">[46]</xref>. Since both macrophages and neutrophils utilize ROS to kill bacteria via activation of NADPH oxidase, it was originally postulated that the source of ROS in macrophages was NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Bedard1">[47]</xref>. However, subsequent studies showed that gp91phox (a component of the NADPH oxidase complex) deficient mice produced normal amounts of IL-1β in response to various inflammasome activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Bulua1">[48]</xref>. When gp91phox deficient (Cybb<sup>−/−</sup>) neutrophils were treated with LPS in our study, IL-1β production was reduced by 50% suggesting that, at least in neutrophils, NADPH oxidase was an important, but not the sole source of ROS. Further comparison between neutrophils and macrophages are necessary to resolve these apparent differences.</p>
      <p>Syk mediates inflammasome activation in macrophages by fungi and crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Shio1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>. We found that activation of the inflammasome by LPS in neutrophils provides a direct link between activation of TLR4 and Syk. We also found that Src kinase associated with Syk, and that blocking Src kinase activity abrogated Syk activation, indicating that a Src kinase (Lyn) is responsible for phosporylation of Syk. Although ITAM containing receptors are responsible for the classical activation of Syk, Syk can also be activated through ITAM-independent signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Mocsai1">[21]</xref>. For example, LPS and other TLR ligands activate Syk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Lin1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>. TLR4 interacts with Syk constitutively in neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and upon LPS treatment, TLR4 associates with p-Syk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chaudhary1">[29]</xref>. The TLR4 cytoplasmic domain has a putative motif, which upon phosphorylation, can be recognized by the SH2 domain of Syk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Songyang1">[49]</xref>. Our data in murine neutrophils agree with previous studies in human neutrophils that show that TLR4 associates with p-Syk upon LPS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Arndt1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although elevated amounts of p-Syk induced more ROS production and lysosomal damage in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils, they did not affect pro-IL-1β or TNF-α transcription which is a distinct pathway dependent on TLR4-NFκB signaling. This result is consistent with previous studies that show Syk activation is not directly involved in TLR4-NF-κB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-ONeill1">[50]</xref> since normal amounts of TNF-α and IL-6 are induced by LPS treatment in Syk<sup>−/−</sup> models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hamerman1">[51]</xref>. However, Syk activation is critical for production of TNF-α in response to C-type lectin mediated fungal recognition in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>. Thus, there may be a receptor mediated pathway or cell-type difference in the immune response to different PAMPs in respect to the role of Syk.</p>
      <p>Similar to previous studies in T cells where CEACAM1 associates with Zap-70 after T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Chen1">[33]</xref>, we also found that CEACAM1 associated with the related kinase Syk in LPS treated neutrophils. Since CEACAM1 functions as an ITIM-SHP-1 dependent co-inhibitory receptor in various types of immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Boulton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Slevogt1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Nagaishi1">[36]</xref>, we tested whether CEACAM1 down-regulates neutrophil inflammasome activation in an ITIM-SHP-1 dependent manner in vivo by reintroducing different CEACAM1 isoforms into Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that only CEACAM1 long isoforms restored normal Syk activation, inflammasome activation and IL-1β production, while mutating the ITIMs of CEACAM1 long isoforms abrogated this restoration. Also IP analysis using SHP-1 antibody pulled down Syk in LPS treated WT and Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils, indicating that SHP-1 can directly dephosphorylate Syk. Notably, there was still an association between SHP-1 and Syk in Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils although this association was significantly reduced in the absence of CEACAM1, indicating that other ITIM containing receptors may also recruit SHP-1 and dephosphorylate Syk. The dependency on SHP-1 was also demonstrated by RNAi mediated reduction of endogenous SHP-1 in WT mice, a treatment that led to enhanced p-Syk amounts, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β in LPS treated neutrophils. These results are consistent with the previous observation that SHP-1 deficient (moth-eaten) mice produced more IL-1β in response to PAMPs compared to wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Zhao1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Zhao2">[53]</xref>. Our study is the first to identify CEACAM1 as the key co-receptor responsible for recruitment of SHP-1 to Syk followed by inhibition of the inflammasome.</p>
      <p>Due to the higher numbers of neutrophils compared to monocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow, there is a greater requirement for negative regulation of the inflammasome in response to inflammatory signals such as LPS. In agreement with this idea, we found a ten-fold higher level of expression of CEACAM1 in murine BM neutrophils compared to monocytes and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Pan1">[3]</xref>. Thus, the levels of CEACAM1, as well as its activation and recruitment to TLR4, may be major regulators of the inflammasome in both neutrophils and monocytes.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results demonstrate that LPS triggers TLR4-Syk mediated inflammasome activation in neutrophils. In addition, CEACAM1, an ITIM containing co-receptor, fine-tunes the activation of the pro-inflammatory kinase Syk and its attendant immune response in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002597-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>). We have identified a critical feedback loop provided by CEACAM1 that down-regulates the inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in neutrophils. This study suggests that manipulation of CEACAM1 inhibition may provide clinical applications for treatment of dangerous IL-1β dependent inflammatory responses and auto-inflammatory diseases. This study also reveals a mechanism by which pathogens that utilize CEACAM1 as a receptor can inhibit inflammation.</p>

Red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysis buffer, total cells labeled with biotin conjugated anti-Ly-6C, anti-B220, anti-CD3, anti-Ter119, anti-F4/80, anti-CD11c, anti-ICAM, anti-NK1.1 and anti-CD19, washed and incubated with anti-biotin microbeads followed by auto magnetic-activated cell sorting (AutoMACS). FACS analysis for measuring ROS production and lysosome destabilization was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Gross1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002597-Hornung2">[19]</xref>. For measuring ROS production, purified neutrophils were treated with LPS (Sigma, catalogue No. L2880-10MG, impurities&lt;3%) for indicated times in the presence of fluorescent probe 2′7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H2DCFDA), cells were permeabilized (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm) and MFI of FITC was measured as indicator of ROS production. For measuring neutrophil lysosomal destabilization, neutrophils were treated with LPS for 2 hours and then LysoSensor was added immediately before FACS analysis. Neutrophils were also incubated with acridine orange together with LPS for 2 hours, and cells with loss of lysosomal function were measured as loss of acridine orange staining (PE-Cy5 channel). The FACS were performed on FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences)</p>

        <p>5-FU (5 mg/mouse) was injected i.p. into Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> mice and bone marrow stem cells were collected 5 days after injection. Stem cells were expanded in 10% FBS DMEM medium plus 20 ng/ml IL-3, 50 ng/ml IL-6 and SCF for 24 hours, followed by retroviral transductions. For selecting MLCV based empty vector, CEACAM1-2L, 4L, 2S, 4S, 2 Lm and 4 Lm transduced cells, GFP positive cells were sorted 48 to 72 hours after transduction. For selecting MSCV based shRNA control vector, shSyk vector and shSHP-1 vector, puromycin (1 ug/ml) resistant cells were collected 7 days later after transduction. Collected cells were then injected i.v. into lethally irradiated Ceacam1<sup>−/−</sup> or WT recipients (1–5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mouse).
