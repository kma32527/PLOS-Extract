        <p>Core protein of <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> is regarded as essential factor for nucleocapsid formation. Yet, core protein is not encoded by all isolates (GBV- A and GBV- C). Pestiviruses are a genus within the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> that affect cloven-hoofed animals, causing economically important diseases like classical swine fever (CSF) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD). Recent findings describe the ability of NS3 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) to compensate for disabling size increase of core protein (Riedel et al., 2010). NS3 is a nonstructural protein possessing protease, helicase and NTPase activity and a key player in virus replication. A role of NS3 in particle morphogenesis has also been described for other members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (Patkar et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2008). These findings raise questions about the necessity and function of core protein and the role of NS3 in particle assembly. A reverse genetic system for CSFV was employed to generate poorly growing CSFVs by modification of the core gene. After passaging, rescued viruses had acquired single amino acid substitutions (SAAS) within NS3 helicase subdomain 3. Upon introduction of these SAAS in a nonviable CSFV with deletion of almost the entire core gene (Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>), virus could be rescued. Further characterization of this virus with regard to its physical properties, morphology and behavior in cell culture did not reveal major differences between wildtype (Vp447) and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>. Upon infection of the natural host, Vp447<sub>Δc</sub> was attenuated. Hence we conclude that core protein is not essential for particle assembly of a core-encoding member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, but important for its virulence. This raises questions about capsid structure and necessity, the role of NS3 in particle assembly and the function of core protein in general.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Virus particles of members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> consist of an inner complex of viral RNA genome and core protein that together form the nucleocapsid, and an outer lipid layer containing the viral glycoproteins. Functional analyses of core protein of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV), a pestivirus related to hepatitis C virus (HCV), led to the observation that crippling mutations or even complete deletion of the core gene were compensated by single amino acid substitutions in the helicase domain of non-structural protein 3 (NS3). NS3 is well conserved among the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and acts as protease and helicase. In addition to its essential role in RNA replication, NS3 apparently organizes the incorporation of RNA into budding virus particles. Characterization of core deficient CSFV particles (Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>) revealed that the lack of core had no effect with regard to thermostability, size, density, and morphology. Vp447<sub>Δc</sub> was fully attenuated in the natural host. Our results provide evidence that core protein is not essential for virus assembly. Hence, Vp447<sub>Δc</sub> might help to explain the enigmatic existence of GB viruses -A and -C, close relatives of HCV that do not encode an apparent core protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The genus pestivirus, together with the genera hepacivirus, flavivirus and the newly proposed genus pegivirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Stapleton1">[1]</xref>, constitutes the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. Cloven-hoofed animals are affected by pestiviruses, which cause severe diseases like classical swine fever (CSF) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD). Pestiviruses possess a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity with one open reading frame (orf) encoding approximately 4000 amino acids (aa). The resulting polyprotein is processed co- and posttranslationally into at least 12 viral proteins by three viral and two cellular proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Rmenapf1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Pestiviral particles are enveloped and contain three virus-encoded glycoproteins, E<sup>rns</sup>, E1 and E2. E<sup>rns</sup> is unique for pestiviruses and is the only known viral structural protein with an uridinylate specific RNase domain belonging to the T2 RNase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Hulst1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Schneider1">[4]</xref>. E1 and E2 or analogous proteins (prM, E) are encoded by all members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. Inside the virus particle, the viral genome is accompanied by a core protein. However, members of the proposed genus pegivirus, GBV- A and GBV- C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Stapleton1">[reviewed by 1]</xref>, do not appear to encode a core protein. Pestiviruses encode a small, basic core protein, which, in contrast to hepaci- and flaviviruses, does not possess any predicted regular secondary structure and is intrinsically disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Murray1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-IvanyiNagy1">[6]</xref>. The pestiviral core protein has RNA chaperone activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-IvanyiNagy1">[6]</xref> and its implicated functions are condensation of the viral RNA genome and subsequent packaging into virions. Its ability to bind RNA relies on the overall protein charge, which results in an unspecific affinity for nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Murray1">[5]</xref>. The pestiviral core protein is processed at its N-terminus by the autoprotease N<sup>pro</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Stark1">[7]</xref>, whereas the C-terminus is generated by signal peptide peptidase (SPP) cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Heimann1">[8]</xref>. Recent findings revealed that deletion of basic areas of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) core protein (aa 213–231 of the viral polyprotein) results in a ten-fold reduction of virus output, whereas deletion of small, less charged stretches (aa 194–198 and aa 208–212) leads to a more than 1000-fold drop in virus output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Riedel1">[9]</xref>. This implicates a more complex mechanism of core function in particle morphogenesis, which is not solely relying on overall protein charge. Duplication and triplication of the CSFV core protein gene as well as integration of up to 3 yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes between 2 core coding regions yielded replication competent viruses whose virus output was approximately 100-fold reduced in comparison to wildtype, revealing a high tolerance of core protein to size increase. We also reported the rescue of a CSFV encoding an YFP-core fusion protein by a single amino acid substitution in the NS3 helicase domain (N2256Y) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Riedel1">[9]</xref>. This finding points to an ability of NS3 to substitute core functions.</p>
      <p>For all members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, there is increasing evidence that nonstructural proteins are required for virus morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Murray2">[reviewed by 10]</xref>. Single amino acid residues in the NS3 helicase domain of yellow fever virus (YFV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been described as important for particle formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Ma1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Patkar1">[12]</xref>. Apart from NS3, p7, NS2 and NS5A have been reported as factors involved in HCV particle generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Yi1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Appel1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The pestiviral NS3 is a multifunctional molecule possessing protease, NTPase and helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Tautz1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Warrener1">[22]</xref> and shares similarity with the analogous protein of hepaci- and flaviviruses. Its uncleaved precursor, NS2–3, has been reported to be essential for particle formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Agapov1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Moulin1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we describe the ability of CSFV NS3 to compensate for functionally compromised core proteins and even the deletion of nearly 90% of the core gene by acquisition of single codon rescue mutations in its helicase subdomain 3. These findings provide strong evidence for a major role of the NS3 helicase domain in pestiviral particle assembly and implicate questions about the function of core protein. As members of the newly proposed genus pegivirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Stapleton1">[1]</xref> – namely GBV- A and GBV- C - do not encode an obvious core protein, we provide experimental evidence that loss of the core coding region is tolerated by another member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>.</p>

        <title>Single amino acid substitutions in the NS3 helicase domain rescue CSFVs encoding modified Core proteins</title>
        <p>Recently, we reported that a single amino acid substitution (SAAS) (N<sub>2256</sub>Y) in the helicase domain of NS3 rescued a poorly growing CSFV construct (Vp447<sub>Yc</sub>) that encoded a core protein of which the N-terminus was fused to YFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Riedel1">[9]</xref>. This unexpected result prompted us to investigate spontaneously occurring revertants of a CSFV mutant in detail that initially was designed to determine requirements for core processing by signal peptide peptidase (SPP). Replacement of most of the signal peptide (aa 250–261) by a stretch of 8 leucine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) led to a poorly growing virus (4.5×10<sup>3</sup> ffu/ml) (Vp447<sub>8leu</sub>) that showed a more than 200-fold rise in titer upon passaging in SK6 cells. To identify the genomic change(s) leading to virus rescue, virus progeny was repeatedly plaque-selected. Interestingly, sequence analysis of these selected viruses did not reveal changes in the genomic sequence of the mutated core. Rescue mutations were identified by reintroducing genomic fragments (nt31–1580; nt1480–3970; nt 3900–5570; nt 5500–8590; nt8330–10510; nt 10420–12290) of the rescued viruses into the parental plasmid p447<sub>8leu</sub>. Only introduction of a genomic fragment nt 5500–8590 encoding parts of NS3-NS4B (aa 1730–2656 of the polyprotein) into the parental plasmid resulted in rescue after transfection of the respective viral genomes. Upon sequencing of this fragment one SAAS was found in each clone tested in NS3 helicase subdomain 3 (namely E<sub>2160</sub>G, N<sub>2177</sub>Y, Q<sub>2189</sub>K, P<sub>2200</sub>T and N<sub>2256</sub>D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To prove that these SAAS were indeed responsible for the rescue, the respective mutations were each engineered into the full-length cDNA construct of Vp447<sub>8leu</sub> (p447<sub>8leu</sub>E<sub>2160</sub>G, p447<sub>8leu</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, p447<sub>8leu</sub>Q<sub>2189</sub>K, p447<sub>8leu</sub>P<sub>2200</sub>T, p447<sub>8leu</sub>N<sub>2256</sub>D). After transfection, the resulting viruses grew to titers exceeding 10<sup>5</sup> ffu/ml without the need for passaging (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002598-t001">Table 1</xref>). Growth characteristics are shown for the virus growing to highest titers (Vp447<sub>8leu</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The overall titer of Vp447<sub>8leu</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y was about one log<sub>10</sub> below the one of Vp447. In the background of the parental Vp447, the N<sub>2117</sub>Y substitution led to a more than 20- fold decrease of virus output (Vp447N<sub>2177</sub>Y) in comparison to Vp447 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002598-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>To assess whether acquisition of SAAS in NS3 helicase subdomain 3 might be a general mechanism of CSFV to overcome defects in the core gene, rescue experiments with a different loss of core function mutant were attempted. An initially poorly growing CSFV (7.1×10<sup>2</sup> ffu/ml 24 h after transfection) encoding an internal deletion (aa 208–212) in the core gene (Vp447<sub>Δ208–212</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) was passaged in SK6 cells until an increase in virus growth was observed. Using the same approach as described above, a SAAS at position N<sub>2177</sub>H was identified. After introducing this SAAS N<sub>2177</sub>H into parental plasmid, virus titer (Vp447<sub>Δ208–212</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>H) rose to 7.9×10<sup>5</sup> ffu/ml 24 h after transfection of the respective virus genome in SK6 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002598-t001">Table 1</xref>). Apparently single amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal subdomain of the NS3 helicase compensate for functionally compromised core mutants that are compromised by N-terminal fusion to YFP (Vp447<sub>Yc</sub>), defective C-terminal processing (Vp447<sub>8leu</sub>) or an internal deletion (Vp447<sub>Δ208–212</sub>), respectively.</p>
        <p>Core protein can be detected in lysates of cells transfected with genome of Vp447 and in pelleted virions of Vp447 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, Western blot analysis of cell lysate and pelleted virus particles revealed that neither Vp447N<sub>2177</sub>Y nor Vp447<sub>8Leu</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y contained detectable levels of core protein in concentrated virus preparations. Core protein could be detected in lysates of SK6 cells transfected with genome of Vp447N<sub>2177</sub>Y, but not after transfection of genomes of Vp447<sub>8leu</sub> and Vp447<sub>8leu</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y.</p>

        <title>Rescue of a core deletion mutant (Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>)</title>
        <p>Mutations within the NS3 helicase subdomain 3 allowed the rescue of viruses with compromised core function. To examine whether the core-coding region is dispensable altogether, almost the entire core gene (aa170–246; 77 of the 86 codons) was deleted in p447, yielding p447<sub>Δc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Nine C-terminal amino acids (247–255: LEKALLAWA) were preserved as part of the signal sequence (aa 247–269) to ensure translocation of E<sup>rns</sup> into the ER lumen. While this construct lacking the core-coding region was not viable, introduction of above described SAAS in NS3 into p447<sub>Δc</sub> (p447<sub>Δc</sub>E<sub>2160</sub>G, p447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>H, p447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, p447<sub>Δc</sub>Q<sub>2189</sub>K, p447<sub>Δc</sub>P<sub>2200</sub>T, p447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2256</sub>D) led to the release of infectious virus with titers of at least 1×10<sup>4</sup> ffu/ml 24 h after electroporation of the respective transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002598-t001">Table 1</xref>). Highest titers were observed for Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>P<sub>2200</sub>T (4.0×10<sup>5</sup> and 2.3×10<sup>5</sup> ffu/ml 24 h after transfection in SK6 cells), thus being 30–50 -fold below Vp447 titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Hence, SAAS in the helicase domain of NS3 can not only compensate for functionally compromised, but even completely absent core protein. No upstream open reading frame longer than 15 codons that might provide the virus with an alternative core protein could be identified. As expected, no core protein could be detected in either cell lysate or supernatant of RNA cells transfected with Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y or Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>P<sub>2200</sub>T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To exclude a possible function of the C-terminal core aa 247–269 in Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, they were replaced by the signal peptide of bovine CD46, a cell surface glycoprotein (Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y<sub>CD46SP</sub>). Progeny virus production of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y<sub>CD46SP</sub> was slightly reduced (1×10<sup>5</sup> ffu/ml 24 h after transfection) in comparison to Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. Analysis of cell lysate of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y 72 h after transfection of SK6 cells did not reveal differences in the relative presence and processing of NS2–3, NS5B, E<sup>rns</sup> and E2 in comparison to wildtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This suggests that cellular protein expression and polyprotein processing is neither affected by the lack of core protein nor by the presence of a SAAS in the NS3 helicase. The relative reduction of protein expression in Vp447<sub>Δc</sub> genome transfected cells results from its inability to spread. No changes in the regions surrounding the deletion of the core gene and NS3 were detected after ten passages of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y in SK6 cells (data not shown). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of combinations of the described amino acid exchanges in NS3 helicase of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub> showed no additive effect but rather resulted in a 10–100 fold drop in virus titer (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Phenotypic characterization of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y</title>
        <p>The lack of a structural component of the virus particle may result in altered phenotypic properties of the virus. We therefore assessed virus infectivity, morphology, and physical stability of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y compared to wildtype Vp447. The presence of viral genome in cells transfected with genomic RNA of Vp447 or Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y or infected with Vp447 or Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y was assessed by Northern blot analysis. Genomes could be detected for Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y (12059 nt) and Vp447 (12293 nt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), but the size difference of 234 nt could not be resolved. To verify that the infectivity of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y is due to proper virus particles, not secreted replication complexes, neutralization assays were performed. Incubation of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y with either a monoclonal antibody against E2 (A18) or sera of one vaccinated animal (S98) and one vaccinated and subsequently CSFV infected animal (S05) neutralized infectivity in the same fashion as observed for the parental Vp447 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, specific infectivity in the supernatant was assessed. To allow for strict discrimination between both viruses on the level of RNA, a modified Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, encoding for 5 alanine residues between the N<sup>pro</sup> C-terminus and core residue 247 (Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y) was generated. The resulting PCR assay specifically amplified either Vp447 or Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In cell culture, growth of Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y was slightly improved in comparison to Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. With this approach, we determined a specific infectivity (ratio of virus genomes versus infectivity in cell culture supernatant) of 23 genomes/ffu (SD±14; n = 3) for Vp447 and 131 genomes/ffu (SD±61; n = 3) for Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y.</p>

        <p>To determine density and size of Vp447 in comparison to Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, equilibrium density centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography was performed. The densities of Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y were compared by separation in individual, continuous sucrose gradients (10–60%) and equilibrium centrifugation. 30 fractions of 360 µl each were harvested by bottom puncture. In repetitive experiments, infectivity peaked at a density of 1.104–1.111 g/ml for Vp447 and of 1.099–1.112 g/ml for Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). RNA levels, determined by virus specific real-time RT-PCR, peaked at a density of 1.10 g/ml for Vp447 and at 1.09–1.11 for Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

To avoid variations between two gradients, 10<sup>6</sup> ffu of both viruses were mixed and layered on top of the same sucrose gradient.

Again, E2 was detectable over a wide range of the gradient (1.04–1.18 g/ml sucrose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and infectivity peaked at a density of 1.105–1.113 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

        <p>To address the effect of the SAAS N<sub>2177</sub>Y in Vp447<sub>Δc</sub> on particle formation, Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub> was created. 75 ml of supernatant of SK6-cells 48 h after transfection with genomes of either Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub> or Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y were subjected to equilibrium centrifugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Highest levels of infectivity were recorded at a density of 1.117 g/ml for Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y and at 1.102 g/ml for Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>. Both infectivity and RNA-levels were reduced more than 400-fold in Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub> in comparison to Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y in all fractions tested. Overall, E2 levels were comparable between both viruses and peaked at 1.12–1.14 g/ml. However, the ratio of E2 homo- to heterodimer seemed to differ between the two viruses, as did the E2 levels at a density of 1.10 g/ml.</p>
        <p>The nucleocapsid of Vp447 is likely composed of core protein and the viral genome but so far has not been characterized. To gain at least preliminary information about the nucleocapsid of Vp447 and whether an analogous structure exists in Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, either virus was treated with a nonionic detergent (0.5% NP40) to remove the envelope prior to equilibrium centrifugation as described above. The treatment completely abrogated infectivity in the fractions recovered and viral RNA levels were reduced more than 100-fold for either virus in comparison to untreated virus. RNA levels were just above background and peak levels occurred at densities of 1.05 g/ml and 1.2 g/ml for Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y whereas a broad peak of genomic RNA could be detected at densities of 1.11–1.2 g/ml for Vp447 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To increase precision of the analysis, both viruses were mixed, treated with 0.5% NP40 and analyzed in the same gradient. The E2 signal was shifted towards the top of the gradient (1.04–1.14 g/ml), whereas weak core signals could be detected at higher densities (1.13–1.18 g/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Viral genome of Vp447 was detected in highest amounts at densities of 1.14–1.2 g/ml, whereas highest levels of Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y genome were now observed at densities of 1.17–1.19 g/ml and 1.22 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These results indicate that detergent treatment of Vp447 in fact releases nucleocapsids of higher density. This assay is complicated by the RNase activity of the structural protein E<sup>rns</sup>, which might result in degradation of the viral genome after lysis of the lipid envelope. Hence, both Vp447 (Vp447_H30K) and Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y (Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y_H30K) with an exchange of E<sup>rns</sup> residue histidine 30 to arginine, destroying the active centre of its RNase, were generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Meyers1">[25]</xref>. This aa exchange did not affect the amount of progeny virus produced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Both viruses were subjected to equilibrium density centrifugation to compare them with the respective parental virus.

        <p>Size exclusion chromatography was performed to directly compare the Stokes diameter of Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. For this purpose, a mixture of 10<sup>8</sup> ffu of each Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y was subjected to gel filtration using Superose 6. Infectivity was detectable in fractions 40–78. Real-time RT-PCR (as described above) differentiating Vp447 from Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y allowed detection of viral genomes in fractions 43–78. Peak levels of genomes of either virus were observed in fractions 59–61 and coincided with peak infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>For electron microscopic inspection, virus was produced in SK6 cells in serum free medium, concentrated by ultracentrifugation and inspected by TEM. The identity of the virions was confirmed by immunogold (10 nm) staining with a monospecific rabbit serum against E<sup>rns</sup> (for specificity of this serum, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

Mean size of Vp447 particles was 51.9 nm (standard deviation 8.9 nm; n = 43) and of Vp1017 particles 50.1 nm (standard deviation 9.3 nm; n = 34). However, no exact size comparison or tomographic particle analysis was possible since required particle quantity, quality and purity was not achieved.</p>

        <p>To address whether the absence of core protein in the virus particle affects physical stability of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, the kinetics of inactivation of Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y at 37°C and 39.5°C were determined. No major differences in thermal stability were observed between the two viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Physical stability was also assessed by freezing and thawing of defined virus preparations.

        <title>Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y is avirulent</title>
        <p>CSF is a disease of pigs with strain dependent virulence. Vp447 represents a moderately virulent strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Gallei1">[26]</xref>, causing mortality rates &gt;50%. To assess virulence of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, a small-scale animal experiment was conducted. Two groups of two pigs each were injected intramuscularly with 5×10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of Vp447 or Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. Two days later, a sentinel pig was added to each group. Animals were evaluated according to a standard clinical scoring system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Mittelholzer1">[27]</xref>, rectal temperature and leukocyte counts. Vp447 infected animals exhibited febrile temperatures (&gt;40°C) on day 7–10 after infection and from day 13 after infection until the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). One Vp447 infected pig (wt2) had to be euthanized on day 21 after infection, with a clinical score of 10. The other Vp447 infected pig (wt1) had a clinical score between 2.5 and 4.5 on days 17, 18 and 21–27. Severe leukopenia (leukocyte count below 10 Giga/l), a typical symptom of CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Moennig1">[reviewed with other clinical symptoms by 28]</xref>, was present in wt1 and wt2 from day 4 after infection, with further declining leukocyte counts until the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The sentinel animal (wtS) housed together with the Vp447 infected pigs developed febrile temperatures from day 14 after infection until the end of the experiment and leukopenia was present on day 21 and 28 of the experiment. Virus could be isolated from Vp447 infected animals on days 4, 7, 10 and 14 after infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002598-t002">Table 2</xref>). Virus isolation was not possible from the sentinel animal on days 4, 7, 10 and 14 after infection of the other pigs. Neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in Vp447 infected animals and their sentinel on days 10, 14 and 21 after infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002598-t003">Table 3</xref>). No apparent signs of disease (clinical score = 0) were observed for Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y infected animals (Δc1 and Δc2) and their sentinel (ΔcS) throughout the experiment. With the exception of one day of slightly elevated body temperature (Δc2 on day 8) and mild leukopenia of animal Δc1 on day 21, no fever or leukopenia were present in Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y infected animals (Δc1 and Δc2) and their sentinel (ΔcS).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Key findings of this study are that (1) a pestivirus lacking almost the entire core coding region is viable and that (2) viability depends on single point mutations in the helicase domain of NS3. This finding questions the general assumption that a core protein is a specific and essential structural element of enveloped RNA viruses and is supported by the existence of GBV- A and GBV- C, which do not encode an obvious core protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Stapleton1">[reviewed by 1]</xref>. Further to this, the data support a central role of the multifunctional NS3 protein in virus particle assembly.</p>
      <p>During the characterization of different loss - of - function manipulations of the core gene of CSFV, we observed that some replicative but initially poorly growing viruses generated increased amounts of progeny virus after extended incubation periods of the transfected cells. The responsible gain-of-function mutations could not be mapped to the locus of the manipulated nucleotide sequence. Instead, single nucleotide exchanges clustered within a stretch of approximately 300 nucleotides of NS3 helicase subdomain 3, about 6000 nucleotides downstream of the core gene. The occurrence of second site mutations in NS3 upon loss of core protein function differs from results described for tick-borne encephalitis virus. In this model, the deletion of parts of the internal hydrophobic domain led to the acquisition of hydrophobic residues in the core gene itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Kofler1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To confirm that the observed infectivity of core deficient viruses was due to proper virus particles, Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y were compared with regard to sensitivity towards neutralizing antibodies. In both cases, infectivity was blocked by hyperimmune sera from pigs or a monoclonal antibody directed against viral E2. Differences in the stability of particles of Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y with regard to infectivity were not observed upon freezing - thawing and heat exposure. Electron micrographs of Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y were obtained from concentrated serum-free cell culture supernatants and the structures observed were immunogold labelled with a monospecific rabbit serum against E<sup>rns</sup>. This was necessary because pestivirions in general lack a characteristic morphology. No morphological differences between Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y particles were apparent. Precise determination of structure and size would require cryo EM to avoid preparation dependent artifacts and also larger numbers of particles.</p>
      <p>With regard to particle sizes no apparent differences in Stokes diameter could be detected between Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y particles in gel filtration experiments. Both viruses eluted from the column in the same fractions. Due to difficulties in comparing different gel filtration runs, it was mandatory to separate Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y side by side. To distinguish between both viruses by real time RT-PCR, a modified Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y was constructed, which encodes an additional sequence of five alanines between N<sup>pro</sup> C-terminus and signal peptide (Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y). This construct was also employed for determination of virus density in linear sucrose gradients. After it was evident from individual gradient experiments that infectivity and genomic RNA comigrated at densities from 1.10–1.11 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002598-g004">Figure 4</xref>), both viruses were mixed and analyzed in the same gradient. Again RNA, E2 and infectivity accumulated at the same densities. A surprising finding was that core protein showed highest concentration at slightly lower densities than peak RNA and infectivity levels. As E2 can be detected in the supernatant of cells transfected with the genome of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>, it was of interest to compare the suspected pseudoparticles with regard to density and genome integration to Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. Hence, equal volumes of supernatant of cells either transfected with Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub> or Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y genomes were subjected to density gradient centrifugation. The reduction of infectivity of Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub> in comparison to Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y correlated with the reduction of genome levels at the densities tested, suggesting that the SAAS N<sub>2177</sub>Y is critical for the integration of the virus genome into the particles during assembly if core protein is not present. Overall, E2 levels between the two viruses were comparable both with regard to total amount in the supernatant and distribution according to density. However, the ratio of E2 homo- to heterodimer, as well as the amounts of E2 at a density of 1.1 g/ml and the density of peak infectivity differed between the two viruses, which might indicate differences in particle composition.</p>
      <p>To determine whether core protein actually is a component of a nucleocapsid structure, the envelope of the virus particles was removed by treatment with a non-ionic detergent (Nonidet P40). NP40 treated viruses were layered on top of sucrose gradients as before and the position of infectivity, E2, core and RNA were recorded after equilibrium centrifugation. Infectivity could be abolished completely by NP40 treatment. The signal of E2 shifted towards the top of the gradient (1.04–1.14) whereas the core protein signal shifted to higher densities (1.13–1.18). Peak values of viral genomes coincided with core signal in Vp447, which might implicate the presence of a nucleocapsid like structure of higher density. For Vp447<sub>Δc+5Ala</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, signals for viral genome were low, with a slight elevation at the tube bottom if the virus was separately run on a gradient. Hence, we were unable to assign the genome to a discrete density. In contrast, a slight peak of viral RNA, comparable in density to Vp447, was observed if both viruses were separated in the same gradient. One could speculate that this effect is due to a redistribution of core protein between viral genomes after detergent treatment. Overall, the amounts of RNA determined by real time RT-PCR were 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> lower than with intact viruses, which can be taken as evidence for RNA degradation. A comparable experiment for HCV determined only a six-fold reduction of genomic RNA after NP40 treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Gastaminza1">[30]</xref>. A major difference between HCV and CSFV is the presence of the potent ribonuclease E<sup>rns</sup> in the virus envelope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Schneider2">[31]</xref>. However, after mutational disruption of the RNase active centre of E<sup>rns</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Meyers1">[25]</xref>, we did not observe changes in the levels of viral genome detectable in comparison to virus with intact RNase. This suggests that the analytic system itself, by employing sucrose, contains RNases, which together with the long centrifugation time (24 h), are sufficient to degrade most of the viral genomes present in the sample. To address this technical problem, improved separation methods have to be established to minimize RNA degradation. However, the relatively higher amount of viral genome detectable for Vp447 in comparison to Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y suggests a protective function of core protein against RNase.</p>
      <p>The absence of core protein and thus a known proteinaceous component of the nucleocapsid questions the way how a linear viral RNA molecule of approximately 3 µm is condensed in order to fit into the virus particle of less than 50 nm diameter. Further to this, the genome has a negative charge that is partially neutralized by a usually positively charged (nucleo-) protein. Strikingly, introduction of the single amino acid substitution N<sub>2177</sub>Y into the parental Vp447 (Vp447N<sub>2177</sub>Y) reduced virus growth and abrogated the detectable incorporation of core protein into the virus particles, while at the same time the core protein accumulated intracellularly. This points to an ability of modified NS3 to counteract core particle integration, probably by modulation of core-RNA-interaction. This finding also raises the question whether NS3 might replace core in the virus particle. So far, we were unable to detect any NS3 in purified virus preparations, but we cannot exclude that a small number of molecules is packaged.</p>
      <p>As we have no evidence for other virally encoded proteins for replacement of the missing core protein, it is conceivable that host cellular proteins, for example cytoplasmic RNA chaperones or nuclear RNA binding proteins, compensate for the lack of core protein. The association of cellular proteins with virus particles has been described for RNA and DNA viruses, like hepadnaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Hu1">[32]</xref>, rabies virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Sagara1">[33]</xref>, filoviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Spurgers1">[34]</xref>, respiratory syncytial virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Radhakrishnan1">[35]</xref> and HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Parent1">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, HSP70 or HSP90 were most often found associated with virus particles. An important task will therefore be a proteome analysis of highly purified virus particles of Vp447 and Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. Epitope tagged viruses - as described for HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Takahashi1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Prentoe1">[38]</xref> and BVDV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Wegelt1">[39]</xref> - may be useful for such an investigation.</p>
      <p>NS3 is functionally well conserved among members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and significant sequence conservation is apparent. It is a multifunctional protein that contains several enzymatic activities, such as serine protease, NTPase and RNA helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Tautz1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Warrener1">[22]</xref>. Its involvement in particle assembly has been suggested for HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Ma1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Yi1">[13]</xref> and YFV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Patkar1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Kmmerer1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Pijlman1">[41]</xref>. The conserved helicase motifs are located in subdomains 1 and 2 of the NS3 helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Despins1">[42]</xref>. NS3 helicase subdomain 3 is the least conserved stretch in NS3 of <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, both with regard to amino acid sequence and structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Xu2">[43]</xref>. Although it is not present in all superfamily 2 helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Frick1">[44]</xref>, it is essential for NS3 helicase activity. Analysis of all single aa substitutions in the putative CSFV NS3 helicase subdomain 3, which were able to rescue Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y, did not reveal an obvious pattern with regard to amino acid identity, charge or polarity, hence we are not able to draw conclusions about the mode of action by analysis of the sequence identities. So far, the 3D-structure of pestiviral NS3 helicase is not known and the sequence homology to HCV NS3 is too low to draw conclusions. All rescue mutations were located in regions aligning with alpha helices both in dengue virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Luo1">[45]</xref> and HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Appleby1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Gu2">[47]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002598.s008">Figure S8</xref>). All but one aa substitution identified were located in stretches reported to be important for NS3 helicase protein-protein-interaction and optimal replication of HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Mackintosh1">[48]</xref>. So far, there is no mechanistic explanation how the described mutations in NS3 helicase domain 3 allow for the rescue of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>. Structural and functional analysis of the modified NS3 proteins are needed to elucidate the gain of function in particle assembly.</p>
      <p>Finally, the virulence of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y in comparison to Vp447 was assessed in a small scale animal experiment. The parental CSFV strain used for this study causes disease in pigs with a case fatality rate of &gt;50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Gallei1">[26]</xref>. While the two pigs infected with Vp447 and the sentinel housed together with these two pigs developed typical signs of CSF, the pigs infected with Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y and the respective sentinel animal stayed completely healthy although they were injected with the same dose of virus. Neither fever nor leukopenia was observed in pigs infected with Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y. Detection of genomic RNA in leukocytes up to day 7 p.i. and the appearance of CSFV neutralizing antibodies in both Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y infected animals beginning at day 14 suggest that a limited replication took place in the animals, despite our inability to reisolate Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y from serum or blood cells. This indicates that the lack of core protein leads to a strong attenuation of the virus. The sentinel pig developed no neutralizing antibodies, which can be taken as evidence that Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y is not or inefficiently transmitted. All this points to an important role of pestiviral core protein in vivo. Further effort will be put in the characterization of Vp447<sub>Δc</sub>N<sub>2177</sub>Y in primary cells of its natural host to elucidate the mechanisms underlying its attenuation.</p>

The animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of CSFV according to a modified clinical score developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002598-Mittelholzer1">[27]</xref> and body temperature was recorded. The clinical score is calculated by scoring each parameter (liveliness/body tension/body shape/breathing/walking/skin/eyes+conjunctiva/appetite/defecation) from 0–3 (no signs of disease – severe signs of disease), followed by addition of all values obtained.
