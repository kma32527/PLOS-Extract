        <p>Tuberculosis (TB) disease in HIV co-infected patients contributes to increased mortality by activating innate and adaptive immune signaling cascades that stimulate HIV-1 replication, leading to an increase in viral load. Here, we demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTb)-stimulated HIV-1 replication in co-infected macrophages. We show that NFAT5 gene and protein expression are strongly induced by MTb, which is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, and that an intact NFAT5 binding site in the viral promoter of R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV-1 replication by MTb. Furthermore, silencing by RNAi of key components of the TLR pathway in human monocytes, including the downstream signaling molecules MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6, significantly inhibits MTb-induced NFAT5 gene expression. Thus, the innate immune response to MTb infection induces NFAT5 gene and protein expression, and NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication via a direct interaction with the viral promoter. These findings also demonstrate a general role for NFAT5 in TLR- and MTb-mediated control of gene expression.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The major cause of AIDS deaths globally has been tuberculosis (TB), which is caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTb). Co-infection with MTb exacerbates human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) replication and disease progression via both innate and adaptive host immune responses to MTb infection. In this report, we present evidence that the transcription factor NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb-induced HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood cells and monocytes. We also show that MTb infection itself stimulates NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes and that its expression involves the TLR signalling pathway and requires the downstream adaptor proteins MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6. This identification of a novel role for NFAT5 in TB/HIV-1 co-infection reveals that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR-dependent gene expression and thus provides a potential new therapeutic target for treatment of HIV-1 and possibly other diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the most common co-infection and cause of death in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-United1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-World1">[2]</xref>. Direct engagement of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) by MTb on mononuclear phagocytes activates signaling cascades that directly induce transcription from the proviral LTR (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Jo1">[3]</xref>). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by the human host in response to MTb infection activate signal transduction pathways in CD4 T cells and monocytic cells that also result in transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-IsraelBiet1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Hoshino1">[6]</xref>. Activation of HIV-1 replication via these MTb-induced pathways ultimately leads to higher viral loads and, in turn, expedited CD4 T cell loss and progression to AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Toossi1">[7]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Goldfeld1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Falvo1">[10]</xref>). Furthermore, the progressive immune compromise associated with HIV-1 infection itself is a major cause of latent MTb reactivation, as well as increased susceptibility to primary TB infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Daley1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Glynn1">[15]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Goldfeld1">[8]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The primary PRR on monocytic cells triggered by MTb infection is toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Jung1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Brightbill1">[20]</xref>. Engagement of TLR2 results in engagement of the adaptor protein MyD88 and the subsequent recruitment of several kinases, including IRAK1 and IRAK4, and the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Underhill1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Wesche1">[23]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Falvo1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Takeda1">[24]</xref>). TRAF6 activates IκB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that, in turn, ultimately induce activation of specific transcription factor families, including the NF-κB and AP-1 families, which have been shown to associate with the HIV-1 LTR and to drive its transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Cao1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Medzhitov1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Li1">[27]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Falvo1">[10]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Notably, HIV-1 comprises several subtypes, and the LTR of each subtype is unique with respect to the number and organization of activator binding sites. For example, HIV-1 subtype B, the most highly characterized viral subtype and the primary cause of infection in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Australia, has two tandem NF-κB motifs in its LTR. By contrast, HIV-1 subtypes C and E, which have spread disproportionately in TB-burdened sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, have three and one NF-κB binding sites, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-United1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Hemelaar1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-HIV1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously showed that the most primordial member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, NFAT5 (also known as TonEBP), binds to a site within the HIV-1 LTR that is highly conserved across all HIV-1 subtypes, and is also conserved in HIV-2 and SIV LTRs. This NFAT5 site overlaps the core NF-κB binding motifs in the LTR and is required for constitutive replication of representative HIV-1 subtype B, C, and E isolates in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Ranjbar1">[31]</xref>. Given that NFAT5 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally activated by the MAP kinase p38, which is downstream of MyD88 signaling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Ko1">[32]</xref>, we speculated that NFAT5 may also be involved in MTb-induced activation of HIV-1 replication via a TLR-mediated pathway in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).</p>
      <p>Here, we show that NFAT5 and its cognate binding site are of crucial importance for efficient MTb-induced stimulation of HIV-1 replication in human MDM and PBMC. Moreover, we demonstrate that MTb infection increases NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes in a MyD88-dependent manner. Thus, these results expand the known stimuli of NFAT5 expression to the PRR-mediated innate immune response, and demonstrate that NFAT5 is a critical modulator of MTb-induced enhancement of HIV-1 replication.</p>

        <p>To compare the functional impact of MTb stimulation on subtype-specific HIV-1 LTR activity, we first constructed reporter plasmids containing viral subtype B, C, and E LTRs (−208 to + 64 nt relative to the transcription start site) linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. After transfection of the monocytic THP-1 cell line with these plasmids, cells were stimulated with an irradiated whole cell lysate of MTb (H37Rv). We note that MTb lysate induces inflammatory responses in monocytes that resemble those induced in response to live MTb (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Sharma1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Ranjbar3">[37]</xref>).

            <p>(A) MTb stimulation increases activity of LTRs derived from HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and E. HIV-1 LTRs (−208 to +64 nt relative to the transcription start site) from representative subtype B, C, and E viral isolates were cloned into plasmid pGL3. THP-1 cells (0.8×10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were transfected with each reporter plasmid (0.3 µg/ml) plus the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase control plasmid pRL-TK (0.03 µg/ml) and incubated at 37°C for 16 hours. Cells were then either left untreated or treated with 10 µg/ml MTb lysate for 8 hours before termination of the cultures. In the histogram, open bars represent individual LTR activities in untreated cells. Light grey bars represent mean values of LTR activities from each subtype in untreated cells. Black bars represent individual LTR activities in MTb lysate-treated cells, and dark grey bars represent mean values of LTR activities from each subtype in cells treated with MTb lysate. LTR transcriptional activity for all of the representative LTRs tested was significantly increased in cultures treated with MTb lysate in comparison to untreated cultures. Results are from three independent experiments performed in duplicate (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01 as compared to unstimulated cultures). (B) Specific disruption of the NFAT5 binding site significantly reduces LTR-reporter gene activity in monocytic cells in response to MTb lysate treatment. THP-1 cells were transfected with luciferase expression vectors encoding nucleotides 208 to +64 of the wild-type HIV-1<sub>Lai</sub> LTR and an HIV-1<sub>Lai</sub> LTR containing the NFAT5 binding site mutations (N5-Mut). After 16 hours, the cells were left untreated or exposed to 10 µg/ml MTb lysate for 8 hours at 37°C. Disruption of NFAT5 binding to the enhancer region significantly suppressed LTR-driven reporter gene expression in comparison to the wild-type LTR when cells were treated with MTb lysate (p&lt;0.01). LTR activity was also suppressed in the untreated cells but to a lesser extent (p&lt;0.05). Results are from three independent experiments performed in duplicate and adjusted to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase control expression (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01). Nucleotide sequences representing the wild-type and NFAT5 binding site-mutated HIV-1<sub>Lai</sub> LTRs are shown at the bottom of the figure. (C) MTb lysate increases NFAT5 protein levels in monocytic cells. THP-1 cells were left untreated (control) or exposed to 10 µg/ml MTb lysate for 8 or 24 hours at 37°C. Whole cell extracts were collected and analyzed by western blot with anti-NFAT5 antibody. An antibody directed against Lamin-B1 was used as a loading control. The histogram shows densitometric analysis of the NFAT5 bands from the western blot autoradiograph displayed and values represent mean band intensities at 0, 8, and 24 hours post-stimulation with MTb lysate.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, in the absence of MTb lysate stimulation the activity of the NFAT5 binding site-mutant LTR was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) in comparison to the wild-type LTR. When the NFAT5 binding site-mutant LTR was examined in THP-1 cells stimulated with the MTb lysate, its activity was reduced to an even more significant extent (p&lt;0.01).</p>
        <p>To determine whether MTb lysate stimulation directly enhances NFAT5 expression in THP-1 cells, we stimulated cells for 8 or 24 hours or left them unstimulated and examined NFAT5 protein levels by western blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, we found that NFAT5 protein levels steadily increased in response to MTb lysate stimulation, revealing that TLR engagement by MTb results in enhanced levels of NFAT5, consistent with its playing a role in MTb-induced activation of the HIV-1 LTR.</p>

        <title>MTb increases NFAT5 mRNA levels in human MDM</title>
        <p>Given that macrophages, which are the primary target of MTb infection, are also a major reservoir of HIV-1 as infection progresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Coleman1">[40]</xref>, we next investigated whether MTb is able to directly enhance NFAT5 mRNA expression in primary human MDM. We prepared MDM from five normal donors, stimulated the cells with the MTb lysate or left them unstimulated, and measured NFAT5 gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR at 24 and 48 hours. We also investigated whether HIV-1 infection is capable of inducing NFAT5 mRNA synthesis by infecting MDM with live or heat-inactivated R5-tropic representatives of subtype B (HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub>), C (HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub>), or E (HIV-1<sub>92TH64</sub>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, stimulation with MTb lysate significantly increased NFAT5 mRNA levels at 24 (p&lt;0.05) and 48 (p&lt;0.01) hours, whereas infection with viable or heat-inactivated HIV-1 isolates did not increase NFAT5 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

            <p>(A) MTb but not HIV-1 increases NFAT5 mRNA synthesis in human macrophages. MDM were isolated from PBMC obtained from four normal donors. The cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours with heat-inactivated or live R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype B, C, or E isolates, live MTb strain CDC1551 (1∶1 MDM∶bacilli), or left untreated. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of NFAT5 mRNA expression levels revealed that the low, constitutively present level of NFAT5 mRNA expressed in untreated cells was not affected by exposure to live or inactivated HIV-1, but was significantly increased at both 24 (*, p&lt;0.05) and 48 (**, p&lt;0.01) hours following infection with MTb. (B) NFAT5-specific siRNA effectively suppresses NFAT5 expression in MDM in both the absence and presence of MTb co-infection. MDM (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 6-well plate) from four normal donors were transfected with siRNA specific for NFAT5 or, as a control, GFP, and were then infected with MTb (1∶1 MDM∶bacilli) or left uninfected. In the cells transfected with control siRNA, MTb infection significantly increased NFAT5 expression in comparison to uninfected cells (open bars). When MDM were transfected with NFAT5-specific siRNA, both constitutively expressed (p = 0.048) and MTb-induced (p = 0.021) NFAT5 mRNA were significantly suppressed (grey bars). (C) HIV-1 subtype B replication is significantly suppressed in the presence of MTb co-infection when NFAT5 expression is abrogated in human MDM. MDM from four normal donors were transfected with NFAT5-specific and control siRNAs as described in 2B. Cells were then infected with HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub> followed by co-infection with MTb CDC1551. Virus replication was measured at days 6, 9, and 12 post-infection. At day 12, virus replication was significantly reduced in cells transfected with NFAT5-specific siRNA in comparison to cells transfected with control siRNA (*, p&lt;0.05). We monitored the morphology of cells within the infected cultures and did not observe noticeable macrophage necrosis even at the final timepoint of viral harvest.</p>

To perform this experiment, we first constructed an HIV-1<sub>Lai</sub> clone bearing the CCR5-tropic envelope region of HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> (HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>) so that it would efficiently infect primary MDM. We used this approach to ensure that our analysis of the roles of NF-κB and NFAT5 in MTb-induced HIV-1 replication could be interpreted in the proper context of previous research findings that examined LTR regulation in the context of full-length viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Leonard1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Chang1">[46]</xref>.

        <p>MDM in which NFAT5 expression had been inhibited with NFAT5 siRNA or that were transfected with control GFP siRNA were then infected with 1000 TCID<sub>50</sub> of HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>. After overnight virus infection, the cells were then co-infected with the MTb clinical strain CDC1551. Free virus levels were then measured in culture supernatants from MDM transfected with NFAT5-specific siRNA or GFP control siRNA at days 6, 9 and 12 post-HIV-1 infection to measure the impact of NFAT5 inhibition on MTb-induced HIV replication.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, HIV-1 replication was suppressed at days 6 and 9 post-infection in the NFAT5 siRNA-treated cells as compared to cells treated with control siRNA, and it was significantly inhibited by day 12 post-infection (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

        <p>To demonstrate that the impact of NFAT5 silencing on MTb-induced viral replication was a direct effect due to modulation of recruitment of NFAT5 to the HIV-1 LTR and not due to secondary, NFAT5-regulated effects, we set out to disrupt NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR in the context of HIV-1/MTb co-infection. This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF-κB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication.</p>
        <p>To perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub> molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF-κB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated (named HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-N5-Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF-κB/NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF-κB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding. Specifically, we mutated two guanines (GG) in the κB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine (TA) (HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-κB I-mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF-κB site (κB II) in HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub> (HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-κB II-Mut). We also created a double NF-κB site mutant virus (HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-κB I+II-Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF-κB binding to the HIV-1 LTR on MTb regulation.</p>

Mutations were introduced into the 3′ LTR of the HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>–WT proviral sequence. (B) Specific mutation of the NFAT5 binding site abolishes NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR but does not affect NF-κB p50/p65 binding to the overlapping NF-κB binding site. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown using HIV-1 LTR fragments (-262 to +4 nt relative to the transcription start site) from HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-WT and HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-N5-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NF-κB (p50/p65) (25 ng, 100 ng, and 500 ng), or NFAT5 (10 ng, 50 ng, and 250 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of NF-κB and NFAT5 are indicated with a bars.

        <p>To determine the specificity of these substitutions upon NFAT5 and NF-κB p50/p65 binding to the LTR, we performed a quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis using the wild-type LTR or mutant LTRs in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 or NF-κB p50/p65 proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, the N5-Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 (compare lanes 12–15 and lanes 17–20), but p50/p65 binding was not impaired (compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 7–10). By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF-κB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50/p65 binding at each site (compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 7–10 and lanes 12–15 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, mutation of both NF-κB sites (κB I+II-Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50/p65 binding to the LTR. However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF-κB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced (compare lanes 2–5 to lanes 7–20 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF-κB p50/p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.</p>

Notably, although replication of the mutant virus with the single, proximal NF-κB binding site mutation in the shared NFAT5/NF-κB element (HIV-1<sub>Lai/Bal-env</sub>-κB I-Mut) was diminished, this was not significant at day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g005">Figures 5B–5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>We note that overall p24 levels were noticeably lower in the cultures co-infected with MTb compared with those infected with HIV-1 alone.

Subtype C LTRs generally have three functional NF-κB sites in their LTRs, and subtype C is the predominant viral subtype in the African and Asian HIV-1 epidemics where MTb co-infection is extremely common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-United1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-World1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Hemelaar1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-World3">[52]</xref>. We thus next extended our analysis of the role of NFAT5 in MTb/HIV-1 co-infection to a subtype C isolate. We first constructed an infectious molecular clone of the HIV-1 subtype C primary isolate HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub>, which has two NFAT5 binding sites in its LTR and three NF-κB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We disrupted the two NFAT5 binding sites by changing the TT of each site to CC to create a mutant virus that we named HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub>-N5-Mut. Bulk PBMC from four normal donors were infected overnight with 1000 TCID<sub>50</sub> of wild-type HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub> or HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub>-N5-Mut and the cultures were then co-infected with MTb CDC1551 or left infected with virus alone. At day 11 post-viral infection, wild-type HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub> replication was greater, but not significantly so, as compared to replication of HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub> NFAT5-Mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, in the context of MTb co-infection, wild-type HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub> replication was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) at day 11 over HIV-1<sub>98IN22</sub> NFAT5-Mut replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that the absence of NFAT5 binding sites was particularly detrimental to virus replication in the presence of MTb co-infection. Thus, even when three functional NF-κB binding sites are present in the LTR, as in the HIV-1 subtype C infectious clone studied here, disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR impairs virus replication in response to MTb co-infection.</p>

Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that MyD88 mRNA levels in these cells were constitutively and significantly reduced in comparison to control THP-1 cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing control GFP shRNA (data not shown).

        <p>To futher dissect the pathway mediating MTb upregulation of NFAT5 transcription, we also constructed THP-1 cells transduced with lentivirally-delivered shRNAs targeting IRAK1 or TRAF6, two signaling molecules downstream of MyD88.

Although CD86 gene expression did not depend on MyD88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), abrogation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 gene expression significantly reduced CD86 mRNA levels, indicating that CD86 expression is IRAK1- and TRAF6-dependent, but MyD88-independent in MTb-infected monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g007">Figures 7C–7D</xref>).

To date, osmotic stress, integrin activation, and T cell-stimulation have been shown to regulate NFAT5 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-LopezRodriguez1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Miyakawa1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Jauliac1">[65]</xref>. Based on our demonstration here that the host innate immune response to MTb infection induces MyD88-dependent upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression, we have expanded this list to include MTb as an additional stimulus. We have linked this observation to MTb-stimulated HIV-1 gene expression by showing that MTb enhances the replication of HIV-1 subtypes B and C via a direct interaction between NFAT5 and the viral promoter. Thus, HIV-1 has co-opted NFAT5, which is induced as part of the innate immune response to TB, for enhanced viral transcription/replication.</p>
      <p>NF-κB is activated after MTb engagement of PRRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Brightbill1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Means2">[66]</xref>. Multiple studies of HIV-1 activation have shown that initial recruitment of the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer to the HIV-1 proviral enhancer region is crucial for HIV gene transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Stroud2">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Colin1">[68]</xref>). Upon interaction with the viral LTR, NF-κB rapidly induces hyperacetylation of histones associated with nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) at the HIV-1 transcription start site, resulting in recruitment of the pTEFb complex, which is required for RNA pol II processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Lusic1">[69]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Colin1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Thierry1">[70]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this report we directly examined the relative roles of NFAT5 and NF-κB p50/p65 in HIV-1 replication under conditions of activation by MTb co-infection, when NF-κB levels in the nucleus are elevated. We found that specific disruption of the NFAT5 binding site(s) in R5-tropic subtype B or subtype C infectious molecular clones significantly reduced virus replication in PBMC or MDM co-infected with a clinical isolate of MTb. Thus, NF-κB binding to the viral LTR is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 binding to the LTR under conditions of MTb co-infection. Reciprocally, an intact NFAT5 site could not compensate for disruption of the two NF-κB sites. Thus, both factors are required for MTb-induced HIV-1 replication.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, both in the absence and presence of MTb co-infection, disruption of NF-κB site II consistently resulted in greater suppression of virus replication than disruption of NF-κB site I. Consistent with these findings, synthetic reporter assays have previously shown that these two sites have distinct roles in driving transcription. The downstream NF-κB site I binding site, which is directly upstream of three highly conserved Sp binding sites, appears to enhance Sp protein recruitment to the LTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Perkins1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Burnett1">[73]</xref>. Because NF-κB site I overlaps the NFAT5 binding site, it is possible that loss of NF-κB binding to this site is mitigated, at least in part, by increased NFAT5 binding to the mutated site. This hypothesis is consistent with our quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis that shows that specific disruption of NF-κB site I results in enhanced binding of NFAT5 to the LTR.</p>
      <p>HIV-1 subtype C now makes up greater than 50% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide, and its prevalence is especially high in regions of endemic TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-United1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-World1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Hemelaar1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-World3">[52]</xref>, Most HIV-1 subtype C isolates possess three NF-κB binding sites in the LTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-HIV1">[30]</xref>. Our analysis of MTb whole lysate-stimulated, LTR-driven reporter gene expression from representative B, C, and E LTRs showed that LTRs derived from subtype C isolates were superior in driving reporter gene expression as compared to LTRs derived from subtype B or E isolates. Other studies have found that, in response to TNF, subtype C LTRs drive reporter gene transcription more strongly than other subtype LTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Jeeninga1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Montano1">[39]</xref>. In the co-infection model utilized in this report, in which clinical isolates of both MTb and HIV-1 subtype C were used to infect freshly prepared human peripheral blood cells, we found that specific disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR significantly impaired viral replication during MTb co-infection, indicating that even the presence of three intact NF-κB binding sites, which is typical for HIV-1 subtype C isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-HIV1">[30]</xref>, cannot compensate for loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral LTR in the context of MTb co-infection.</p>
      <p>Given that the NF-κB and NFAT5 binding motifs overlap, how do NF-κB and NFAT5 function at this overlapping or shared site in the LTR to drive viral transcription in response to MTb infection? Because NFAT5 expression continues to rise for at least 48 hours post-MTb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002620-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), one possibility is that the host factors NF-κB and NFAT5 associate with the LTR at different stages after viral activation. While NF-κB presence in the nucleus declines in the hours post MTb infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Bosisio1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Zabel1">[75]</xref>, NFAT5 levels escalate. Thus, NFAT5, which is pivotal for HIV-1 transcription in unstimulated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Ranjbar1">[31]</xref>, may, after Mtb infection, perpetuate viral transcriptional initiation begun by NF-κB and, with Tat levels also elevated, promote high levels of sustained HIV-1 transcription. Indeed, in response to hypertonic stress, NFAT5 binds to the aldose reductase (AR) promoter and induces rapid hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Tong1">[76]</xref>. Furthermore, hypertonic stress of mouse renal collecting duct epithelial cells results in NFAT5 and NF-κB complex formation at NF-κB-dependent gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Roth1">[77]</xref>. Thus, there are precedents for imagining that NFAT5 could function at the HIV-1 LTR by inducing histone remodeling in a manner similar to NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Lusic1">[69]</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Colin1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002620-Thierry1">[70]</xref>) or by directly interacting with NF-κB in a cooperative manner.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that NFAT5 is required for the replication of R5-tropic subtype B and subtype C HIV-1 isolates in response to MTb-co-infection of human PBMC and MDM. Functional NF-κB interaction with the viral LTR is also required, but fully intact NF-κB binding elements are unable to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral promoter. In addition, we have demonstrated that MTb infection or stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PAM3Cys, induces NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that MTb stimulation of NFAT5 depends on TLR pathway signaling molecules, including MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6. Taken together, the findings presented here enhance the general understanding of the innate immune response to MTb infection by showing that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR-dependent gene expression; its importance for gene regulation is likely applicable to other MTb- and TLR-regulated genes. Moreover, these data provide molecular insights into MTb regulation of HIV-1 transcription, thereby elucidating several new targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling TB/HIV-1 co-infection.</p>
