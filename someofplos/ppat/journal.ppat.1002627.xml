        <p>Flavivirus envelope protein (E) mediates membrane fusion and viral entry from endosomes. A low-pH induced, dimer-to-trimer rearrangement and reconfiguration of the membrane-proximal “stem" of the E ectodomain draw together the viral and cellular membranes. We found stem-derived peptides from dengue virus (DV) bind stem-less E trimer and mimic the stem-reconfiguration step in the fusion pathway. We adapted this experiment as a high-throughput screen for small molecules that block peptide binding and thus may inhibit viral entry. A compound identified in this screen, 1662G07, and a number of its analogs reversibly inhibit DV infectivity. They do so by binding the prefusion, dimeric E on the virion surface, before adsorption to a cell. They also block viral fusion with liposomes. Structure-activity relationship studies have led to analogs with submicromolar IC<sub>90</sub>s against DV2, and certain analogs are active against DV serotypes 1,2, and 4. The compounds do not inhibit the closely related Kunjin virus. We propose that they bind in a previously identified, E-protein pocket, exposed on the virion surface and although this pocket is closed in the postfusion trimer, its mouth is fully accessible. Examination of the E-trimer coordinates (PDB 1OK8) shows that conformational fluctuations around the hinge could open the pocket without dissociating the trimer or otherwise generating molecular collisions. We propose that compounds such as 1662G07 trap the sE trimer in a “pocket-open" state, which has lost affinity for the stem peptide and cannot support the final “zipping up" of the stem.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Fusion of viral and cellular membranes is necessary to establish infection by an enveloped virus. This process is facilitated by rearrangement of protein(s) present on the virion surface in response to molecular cues from the compartment from which fusion occurs, such as low pH of an endosome. Dengue virus is an enveloped virus in the flavivirus family; its “E" (for envelope) protein is the fusion mediator. We previously showed that peptides derived from the membrane proximal “stem" of the E protein bind a form of E that represents a late-stage fusion intermediate. We used this assay to screen for small-molecule inhibitors that compete for stem-peptide association with E. We describe one such inhibitor and its analogs that block viral fusion. These inhibitors also block infectivity if added to dengue virus before infection. Withdrawing the inhibitor before fusion reverses the blockage. We propose that these small molecules bind a hydrophobic pocket on the virion surface and that the virus carries them into the endosome, where they prevent viral fusion by stabilizing an intermediate conformation of the E protein that cannot complete the fusion-promoting conformational change. Identification of these fusion inhibitors shows that viral entry is a possible target for anti-flavivirus drugs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Enveloped viruses penetrate into the cytosol of their target cell by fusion of viral and cellular membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison2">[2]</xref>. Flaviviruses, such as dengue, penetrate from endosomes, following uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-vanderSchaar1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-vanderSchaar2">[4]</xref>. At endosomal pH, proton binding by their envelope protein, E, triggers a fusion-promoting conformation change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Fritz1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Stiasny1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The flavivirus envelope fusion protein, E, forms a well-ordered lattice of 90 dimers on the surface of a mature, infectious virus particle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Ferlenghi1">[7]</xref>. Crystal structures of soluble forms of E (“sE"), which include the first ∼395 of ∼445 ectodomain residues but lack a conserved, membrane-proximal “stem" region, have contributed to molecular descriptions of flavivirus fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Bressanelli1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Rey1">[12]</xref>. The three domains (DI–III) of the E protein reorient with respect to one other during the fusion-promoting conformational transition, which includes dissociation of the prefusion dimer and reconfiguration of the subunits into trimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison2">[2]</xref>. At an intermediate stage a hydrophobic “fusion loop" at one end of the extended E subunit inserts into the outer leaflet of the target bilayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Allison1">[13]</xref>. The driving force for pinching the two membranes together appears to come from contacts made by domain III, as it folds back against domain I, and by the stem, as it “zips" up along adjacent domain II monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Harrison2">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Molecular understanding of the fusion pathway and the proteins involved has enabled discovery of small-molecule and peptide inhibitors that target intermediates in these fusion-inducing rearrangements. The best-known example of the latter type of entry inhibitor is T-20/enfuvirtide, a peptide used to treat HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Kilby1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Wild2">[17]</xref>. The T-20 peptide interferes with a late stage in the fusion-inducing conformational transition of HIV-1 gp41. Certain small molecules block HIV-1 fusion by a similar mechanism, binding in a conserved pocket on the gp41 inner core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Frey1">[18]</xref>. Inhibitors that target the fusion glycoprotein, F1, of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also prevent infection by blocking a conformational transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Bonfanti1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Roymans1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Targeting the HIV-1 and RSV glycoproteins is possible, because fusion occurs at the plasma membrane, where exposure of the relevant fusion intermediates allows straightforward access to the specific inhibitors. For viruses such as flaviviruses that fuse from endosomal compartments, however, targeting an intermediate of the rearranging fusion protein requires concentrating the inhibitor within the endosome, as its potential binding sites are not available until reduced pH has induced their exposure.</p>
      <p>Kielian and co-workers have reported reconstitution of an sE trimer for both alpha- and flavivirus envelopes, suggesting that one might use reconstitution strategies to identify inhibitors that block steps in fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Liao1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-SanchezSanMartin1">[22]</xref>. We found recently that we could target a fusion intermediate of dengue virus E with peptides derived from its ectodomain stem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Schmidt1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Schmidt2">[24]</xref>. These peptides bind the postfusion form of DV2 sE trimer, mimicking late steps in stem rearrangement. They inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> fusion and DV2 infectivity. C-terminal modification with membrane targeting sequences increases their inhibitory strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Schmidt1">[23]</xref>. A series of experiments support a two-step mechanism, in which a reversible, non-specific interaction with the viral membrane brings virion-associated peptides into the low-pH endosome, where full exposure of the peptide site on the E-protein conformational intermediate leads to tight, specific binding, which interfere with the final “zipping" of the stem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Schmidt2">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Can small molecules also inhibit this step in the fusion pathway? We have adapted the assay we used to study interaction of stem-derived peptides with stem-less sE trimer, to screen for small-molecule inhibitors that target this fusion intermediate. We have identified compounds that compete for stem peptide association, and we show that they reversibly inhibit DV infectivity. We further show, using model liposomes, that these molecules specifically block viral fusion. They appear to bind the virion before adsorption to cells, by interacting with the prefusion, dimeric E protein, possibly in a previously identified, hydrophobic pocket. This association presumably permits their virus-associated transfer into endosomes. Limited structure-activity relationship studies have yielded compounds that inhibit DV2 (NGC isolate) with IC<sub>90</sub>∼1 µM. Our competition screen has thus identified a group of potent, small-molecule inhibitors of DV entry validating experimental screens for small molecules that block viral entry from internal compartments.</p>

        <title>High-throughput screen (HTS) for DV fusion inhibitors</title>
        <p>We have described a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to identify stem-derived peptides that bind the trimeric postfusion conformer of DV2 sE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Schmidt2">[24]</xref>. We found peptides from the C-terminal stem region that bind tightly to this proposed fusion intermediate. With one such peptide, DV2<sup>419–447</sup>, tagged at its N-terminus with FITC, we adapted the FP assay to screen for small molecules that compete for binding to trimeric sE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We screened ∼30,000 compounds in a 384-well format and found several that were active, as measured by a reduction in the fluorescence polarization signal. We chose to pursue further work on one such “hit", 1662G07 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g002">Figure 2</xref>), for which several structurally similar compounds were commercially available.</p>

        <p>We tested a set of related compounds, both from the screening libraries and from commercial vendors, to obtain preliminary structure activity relationships (SAR). Several modifications to the parental scaffold affected competition with peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s010">Table S1</xref>). Modification or removal of the nitrile moiety (R1 position) impaired or abolished activity. Removal of the halogen in the <italic>m</italic>-position on the R2 (as phenyl) decreased competition; addition of strongly electron withdrawing groups (either trifluoro- or trifluoromethoxy) in the <italic>o</italic>- or <italic>m</italic>-positions increased it. A thiophene at R3 was equivalent to the furan in 1662G07, but a cyclopropane in that position eliminated competition with peptide.</p>

        <title>Directed synthesis of 1662G07 analogs</title>
        <p>From preliminary SAR analysis with commercial analogs described above, we chose to synthesize two series of compounds based on the parental scaffold. Series 3-148, 3-149 and 3-151 varied the R2 position while the 3-110 varied at the R3 positions.

Strongly electron withdrawing groups in the <italic>o-</italic>, <italic>m-</italic>, or <italic>p-</italic> positions on R2 (as phenyl) enhanced activity; substitution with methyl or methoxy-methyl groups at these positions yielded inactive compounds.

        <p>Do these small molecules, identified in a screen for binding to a late-stage fusion intermediate, inhibit DV2 viral infectivity? We used a standard plaque forming assay to test the effect of the analogs from the 3-148, 3-149, 3-151 and 3-110 series at a single concentration on growth of DV2 NGC. The virus inoculum was preincubated with compound for 15 minutes and then adsorbed to BHK-21 cells, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, for 1 hour at 37°C. Supernatants were harvested after 24 hours and titred by standard plaque assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Schmidt1">[23]</xref>.

        <p>Compounds in the 3-110 series were particularly active against DV2. We therefore tested this series at a single concentration (5 µM) against isolates from the other three dengue serotypes: DV1 WP74, DV3 THD 3 and DV4 TVP360. The compounds of series 3-110 inhibit DV1, 3 and 4 infectivity to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s012">Table S3</xref>). DV3 was particularly insensitive to inhibition, as we had also found when testing its response to stem-derived peptides. From this initial screen, we looked more closely at three analogs that appeared to have the strongest antiviral effect, 3-110-5, 3-110-14 and 3-110-22. We examined their inhibition of DV2 and DV4 viruses to determine IC<sub>90</sub>s. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g004">Figure 4</xref> these compounds had strong antiviral activity against DV2 and DV4, with IC<sub>90</sub>s in submicromolar and micromolar ranges, respectively. At the same concentration used with the DV serotypes, none of the compounds had detectable activity against Kunjin, a subtype of West Nile virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s002">Figure S2</xref>); the analogs most potent for inhibiting dengue, 3-110-5, 3-110-14 and 3-110-22, had no effect on Kunjin, even at 20 µM.</p>
        <p>The small-molecule inhibitors were selected in a screen that detects formation of an E-protein conformation adopted only after a virion has arrived in the low-pH environment of an endosome – an intracellular compartment presumably inaccessible to the free compounds. A series of order-of-addition experiments using the 3-148, 3-149 and 3-110 series show that to have a significant inhibitory effect, the compounds must be preincubated at 37°C with the viral inoculum before adsorption to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We observed the same level of inhibition using a direct plaque assay as a readout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s008">Figure S8</xref>). When compound and virus inoculum were added to cells at the same time, we detected an approximately tenfold drop in viral titre compared with the DMSO control for compounds in the 3-110 series and little or no effect for compounds in the 3-148 and 3-149 series. Postinfection treatment of cells with compound one hour after initial adsorption of virus did not reduce viral titre, nor did pretreatment of cells for one hour before virus adsorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g005">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). These results imply a direct association of compound and virion before endocytosis of the virus.</p>

Yet the inhibitory small molecules appear to bind virions at pH 7. Thus, the inhibitors can associate with both the pre- and postfusion E-protein conformers. Unless their binding site is at an interface between adjacent subunits in one of the two conformational states, we expect the compounds also to bind a monomeric form of E.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that 1662G07 and it analogs inhibit growth of DV2 and that they block low-pH triggered fusion of virus with liposomes. We identified the parent compound, 1662G07, in a high-throughput screen that detected competition by active molecules with binding to trimeric sE of a fluorescein-tagged, stem-derived peptide. We designed this assay to represent the final step(s) in the low-pH triggered, E-protein conformational change – the process that induces penetration from endosomes through fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. Nonetheless, the inhibitory activity of these small molecules depends on binding to a virion before the virus encounters a cell, indicating that the compounds can also associate with E in its dimeric, pre-fusion conformation. Indeed, they bind in solution to a monomeric, DI/DII fragment of E, and addition of this fragment to an inoculum preincubated with one of the compounds restores infectivity, presumably by sequestering the inhibitor.</p>
      <p>How can small molecules that bind the prefusion E dimer and the DI/DII fragment also block association of a stem-derived peptide with the sE trimer? From the known structures of sE dimers (prefusion) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Modis1">[9]</xref> and trimers (postfusion) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Modis3">[25]</xref> and from accurate docking of the former into subnanometer-resolution cryoEM reconstructions of virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Zhang1">[26]</xref>, we can propose both an answer to this question and a model for the mechanism of action of the small-molecule inhibitors we have studied. The activity of these molecules in an assay for infectivity correlates well with their capacity to compete with a stem-derived peptide for binding to sE trimer. The most straightforward explanation for this correlation is that the compounds bind at a site accessible on both prefusion and postfusion E conformers. The most obvious site on E for small-molecule binding is a pocket, adjacent to the hinge between domains I and II, which accepts a β-octyl-glucoside (β-OG) molecule when sE dimers are crystallized in the presence of the detergent. This pocket closes down in the trimer conformation seen in the crystal structure, and the closed pocket is incompatible with occupancy by a bulky ligand (e.g., 1662G07). A dimer-to-trimer conformational transition will then require expulsion of the ligand, imposing a barrier to completion of the fusion process. For this reason, several groups have used <italic>in silico</italic> screens to find potential pocket-binding compounds, and in at least two cases, the results of those screens have yielded active inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Kampmann1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Zhou1">[31]</xref>. It has not yet been shown, however, whether the compounds found in this way indeed bind in the pocket as predicted. One of those computational screens used the Maybridge library for its search, and one of two active inhibitors identified is related to 1662G07, including most of the scaffold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g002">Figure 2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Kampmann1">[27]</xref>. That compound was not represented, however, in the version of the Maybridge library we used in our experimental screen. We have docked several of our compounds, using the GLIDE program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002627-Friesner1">[32]</xref>. We obtain fits consistent with the crystallographically observed interactions of β-OG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although the β-OG pocket is closed in the trimer, its mouth is fully accessible. Examination of the E-trimer coordinates (PDB 1OK8) shows that conformational fluctuations around the hinge could open the pocket without dissociating the trimer or otherwise generating molecular collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We suggest that compounds such as 1662G07 inhibit peptide binding by trapping the sE trimer in a “pocket-open" state, which has lost affinity for the stem peptide and cannot support the final “zipping up" of the stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Binding of a compound in the β-OG pocket can explain how it accompanies virions into endosomes. Then, even if structural rearrangements of the E protein as it transitions at low pH from dimer to trimer expel the compound from the pocket, it would still remain at relatively high concentration in the endosomal space and be able to rebind rapidly. Effective inhibition would simply require that the rate of rebinding be higher than the rate at which the stem zips up along domain II.</p>

      <p>One potent inhibitor of infectivity for all four dengue serotypes, compound 3-110-22, failed to inhibit stem-peptide binding in the competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A likely explanation is that modification of the parental scaffold to produce 3-110-22 gave a compound with high affinity for the β-OG pocket in the E dimer, but lower affinity for the pocket-open state of the E trimer. The region that surrounds the mouth of the pocket differs in the two conformations, because of the fold-back of domain III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002627-g009">Figure 9</xref>), and 3-110-22 has a bulky substituent group. It appears that compound 3-110-22 indeed binds tightly to the E dimer, because unlike a number of others, it blocks the dimer-to trimer-transition of sE in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002627.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are less likely alternative explanations for the inhibitory action of the compounds we have studied. One postulates a binding site, other than the β-OG pocket, that is present on monomeric DI/DII, on dimeric sE and on trimeric sE and that overlaps the peptide site on the trimer; another is a multi-site and multi-step mechanism. There is no evident candidate site for the former mechanism. The latter requires correlated affinities and properties of multiple sites. We therefore suggest that our peptide-competition, high-throughput screen has identified a large set of molecules that bind the β-OG pocket and that we have devised a useful assay for pocket-binding inhibitors, potentially applicable to any flavivirus for which one can prepare a stable, trimeric sE.</p>

        <p>Dengue virus serotype 2 New Guinea Clone (NGC) was adsorbed to confluent layers of C6/36 cells for 1 hr at 25°C with rocking every 15 mins. L-15 medium (Mediatech) was added, and cells were incubated at 25°C until syncytium formation was observed. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 1600 RPM at 4°C and stored at −80°C.</p>

        <title>Plaque assay</title>
        <p>BHK-21 cells were seeded as described above. Aliquots from infections were diluted in 10 fold dilutions in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS), and 100 µl of each dilution were added to cells. Plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C and rocked every 15 mins. Unadsorbed virus was removed by washing with 1 ml PBS, after which 1 ml of α-MEM supplemented with 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), pen/strep antibiotics, HEPES and 2% FBS, was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 4 days. The CMC overlay was aspirated, and cells were washed 2× with 1 mL PBS and stained with crystal violet.</p>

        <title>Plaque reduction inhibition assays</title>
        <p>Virus supernatant was diluted in EBSS to a stock concentration that would allow for infection at MOI of 1, based on 50,000 seeded cells. Small molecules (or carrier) were added to the inoculum as indicated for each experiment. Cells were infected for 1 hr at 37°C with gentle rocking every 15 mins. Virus (or virus∶small-molecule mixtures) were washed from cells with 1 mL of PBS and overlay medium (α-MEM supplemented with HEPES, pen/strep antibiotics and 2% FBS) added. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hrs. Aliquots of the supernatant were withdrawn and stored at −80°C.</p>

        <title>Cytotoxicity assay</title>
        <p>BHK-21 cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells in a 96 well format. Compounds or vehicle were serially diluted in EBSS and 100 µl were transferred to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, media was aspirated and cells were washed 2× with 200 µl of PBS. 200 µl of α-MEM supplemented with pen/strep antibiotics, and 2% FBS was added and incubated for 24 hrs at 37°C. 20 uL of alamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added directly to each well and incubate for 2 hrs and read for absorbance at 570 nm.</p>
