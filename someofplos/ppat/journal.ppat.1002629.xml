        <p>How pathogenic bacteria infect and kill their host is currently widely investigated. In comparison, the fate of pathogens after the death of their host receives less attention. We studied <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) infection of an insect host, and show that NprR, a quorum sensor, is active after death of the insect and allows <italic>Bt</italic> to survive in the cadavers as vegetative cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NprR regulates at least 41 genes, including many encoding degradative enzymes or proteins involved in the synthesis of a nonribosomal peptide named kurstakin. These degradative enzymes are essential <italic>in vitro</italic> to degrade several substrates and are specifically expressed after host death suggesting that <italic>Bt</italic> has an active necrotrophic lifestyle in the cadaver. We show that kurstakin is essential for <italic>Bt</italic> survival during necrotrophic development. It is required for swarming mobility and biofilm formation, presumably through a pore forming activity. A <italic>nprR</italic> deficient mutant does not develop necrotrophically and does not sporulate efficiently in the cadaver. We report that necrotrophism is a highly regulated mechanism essential for the <italic>Bt</italic> infectious cycle, contributing to spore spreading.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) is a well known entomopathogenic bacterium successfully used as a biopesticide for fifty years. The insecticidal properties of <italic>Bt</italic> are mainly due to specific toxins forming a crystal inclusion associated with the spore. After ingestion by susceptible insect larvae, toxins could induce favorable conditions for spore germination. The bacteria multiply in the insect and coordinate their behavior using signaling molecules involved in quorum sensing. The activation of the quorum sensor PlcR leads to the production of virulence factors allowing the bacteria to kill the insect host. Here we show that, in the cadaver, <italic>Bt</italic> shifts from a virulent to a necrotrophic lifestyle during which a second quorum sensor (NprR) becomes functional. NprR activates genes encoding degradative enzymes (proteases, lipases and chitinases) and a lipopeptide (kurstakin) involved in swarming and biofilm formation. The kurstakin is also essential for the survival of <italic>Bt</italic> after insect death. This suggests that NprR allows the bacteria to survive and eventually to sporulate in the host cadaver, thus improving their ability to disseminate in the environment. Altogether these results show that the pathogenic and necrotrophic lifestyles of <italic>Bt</italic> are tightly controlled by two quorum-sensing systems acting sequentially during the infection process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Saprophytism, probably one of the most common lifestyle for micro-organisms, involves living in dead or decaying organic matter. For most pathogens, saprophytism is limited to necrotrophism (the use of the host cadaver). This step of the infection process is essential for the proliferation and horizontal transmission of these microorganisms (transfer of infection within a single generation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Raymond1">[1]</xref>. However, there have been very few studies addressing this major issue. The transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle implies substantial metabolic changes for microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-ToledoArana1">[2]</xref>. The death of the host is a critical event which compels the micro-organisms to cope with a new series of challenges: competition with the commensal organisms and opportunistic incomers, stress, and nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, necrotrophism is likely to be highly regulated.</p>
      <p>The insect pathogen <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) is a suitable model for studying the time course of the infection process, including necrotrophism in the insect cadaver. <italic>Bt</italic> is an ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium belonging to the <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<italic>Bc</italic>) group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Ivanova1">[3]</xref>. Its spores are found in a large variety of environments, such as soils, dead and living insects and plant phylloplane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Martin1">[4]</xref>. However, <italic>Bt</italic> probably does not grow in soil and reports of natural epizootic episodes are very rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-VilasBoas1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Jensen1">[6]</xref>. Unlike soil bacteria, such as <italic>Streptomyces spp</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>Bc</italic> group genomes contain a large number of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Ivanova1">[3]</xref>. It is therefore likely that <italic>Bt</italic> multiplies in the host cadaver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Raymond1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Jensen1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Bt</italic> carries plasmids encoding specific insecticidal toxins responsible for their insecticidal properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Schnepf1">[7]</xref>. <italic>Bt</italic> spores and toxins are ingested by larvae, and the toxins bind to specific receptors on the midgut epithelial cells, inducing cell lysis and creating favorable conditions for the development of the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Du1">[8]</xref>. The vegetative bacteria multiply in the insect hemocoel and cause septicemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Raymond1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Salamitou1">[9]</xref>. <italic>Bt</italic> also harbors genes encoding exported virulence factors including enterotoxins, hemolysins, phospholipases and proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Agaisse1">[10]</xref>. The transcription of most of these virulence genes in bacteria growing in a rich medium is activated at the onset of stationary phase by the quorum-sensing system PlcR-PapR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Slamti1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Gohar1">[12]</xref>. PlcR-regulated factors account for about 80% of the extracellular proteome of <italic>Bt</italic> during early stationary phase in rich medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Gohar2">[13]</xref>. In sharp contrast, the expression of the PlcR-regulated genes is repressed when the bacteria enter sporulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Lereclus1">[14]</xref> and the stationary phase secretome of <italic>Bt</italic> and <italic>B. anthracis</italic> (<italic>Ba</italic>) growing in a sporulation medium is mainly composed of the metalloprotease NprA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Chitlaru1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1">[16]</xref>. NprA (also designated NprB and Npr599 in <italic>Ba</italic>) cleaves tissue components such as fibronectin, laminin and collagen, thus displaying characteristics of pathogenic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Chung1">[17]</xref>. Transcription of <italic>nprA</italic> is activated during the late stationary phase by the regulator NprR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1">[16]</xref>. NprR is a quorum sensor activated by its cognate signaling peptide, NprX. NprR-NprX functions as a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system: the pro-signaling peptide NprX is exported from the cell, and after being processed to its active form is reimported, and binds to NprR allowing the recognition of its DNA target and the activation of <italic>nprA</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The first stages of <italic>Bt</italic> infection are relatively well documented, but the fate of the bacteria after death of the host remains unclear. Here, we report evidence that the necrotrophic lifestyle of <italic>Bt</italic> is a specific and highly regulated process. The quorum-sensing system NprR-NprX controls at least 41 genes some of which are required for <italic>Bt</italic> to survive in the insect cadaver and to complete its development <italic>in vivo</italic> ending with the production of spores.</p>

        <title>NprR is activated after the host death</title>
        <p>We tested whether NprR, the activator of <italic>nprA</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1">[16]</xref>, is involved in the pathogenicity of <italic>Bt</italic>. The LD<sub>50 s</sub> of the <italic>Bt</italic> 407 Cry<sup>−</sup> (wt) strain and of the <italic>nprR</italic>-deficient (ΔRX) strain in the insect model <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> were measured in two ways: by feeding larvae with spores mixed with the insecticidal toxin Cry1C and by injection of vegetative bacteria into the insect hemocoel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s005">Table S1</xref>). The LD<sub>50 s</sub> of two strains did not differ significantly in either of the two conditions indicating that NprR was not required for pathogenicity. Consistently, an <italic>nprA</italic>-deficient strain was similarly found not to be affected in pathogenicity (not shown).</p>
        <p>We investigated the involvement of NprR in the infection process by comparing, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the expression kinetics of <italic>nprA</italic> with that of the protease gene <italic>mpbE</italic>, reflecting the transcriptional activities of NprR and PlcR, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-HajaijEllouze1">[18]</xref>. The reporter strains grew similarly in insect larvae and a constitutively expressed P<italic><sub>aphA3</sub>-lacZ</italic> fusion was used as the reference standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

The total population of the two strains increased between 0 h and 24 h to reach about 1×10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL.

        <p>In sporulating microorganisms, sporulation is generally regarded as the key process ensuring survival in unfavorable conditions. We therefore investigated i) whether NprR was involved in the sporulation process of <italic>Bt</italic> in the insect cadaver, and ii) whether sporulation is responsible for the survival of the bacteria in the insect cadaver. We compared the sporulation efficiencies of the wt and ΔRX strains in both LB and sporulation-specific medium (HCT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s006">Table S2</xref>). In HCT, the sporulation efficiencies of the two strains were similar. However, in LB medium, the total number of viable spores of the ΔRX strain was half that for the wt strain (8.30×10<sup>7</sup> <italic>vs</italic> 1.58×10<sup>8</sup>), suggesting that NprR is involved in the sporulation of <italic>Bt</italic> in rich medium. Next, we monitored the counts of wt and ΔRX strain spores in insect larvae over 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s006">Table S2</xref>). For the wt strain, heat-resistant spores were detected 24 h after injection and their number increased until 48 h. From 48 h to 96 h, the number of spores remained stable and represented one third of the total bacterial population. The large number of non sporulated bacteria 96 h after the death of the insect suggests that sporulation was not the main mechanism allowing <italic>Bt</italic> to survive. For the ΔRX strain, less than one percent of the bacterial population was heat-resistant spores throughout the infection process. The decrease in the number of heat-resistant spores from 48 h to 72 h is likely due to the germination of the spores. We suspected that the low number of spores is not a cause but a consequence of the inability of the ΔRX strain to survive in the insect cadaver. To test this idea, we tested the survival of a <italic>sigK</italic>-deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g002">Figure 2C</xref>): SigK is a sigma factor involved in the transcription of late sporulation genes in the mother cell, and <italic>sigK</italic>-deficient strains are not able to form viable spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Hilbert1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Bravo1">[20]</xref>.

For 107 genes, this expression ratio was greater than 2 (p&lt;0.05) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-790" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-790</ext-link>), suggesting that NprR has a direct or indirect effect on their transcription. Thirty-nine genes, with a relative expression ratio greater than 4, and a significance value (p) smaller than 0.01, were considered for subsequent analysis. The genes matching probes for BC2622, a macrolide glycosyltransferase, and BC3725, an exochitinase, were also investigated due to their functional similarity to the genes fulfilling these criteria. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that these 41 genes were at least four times up- or downregulated. Fusions to <italic>lacZ</italic> were constructed for nine of these genes and used to confirm that they are differentially regulated in the ΔRX mutant and wt strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The expression kinetics of these genes were similar, with a sharp increase of expression after the onset of stationary phase. The final list of NprR-regulated genes is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s007">Table S3</xref>. Of the 41 genes directly or indirectly regulated by NprR, 37 were down-regulated in the ΔRX strain, suggesting that NprR primarily acts as a transcriptional activator. The subcellular localizations of the products of these genes were assessed: 46% were cytoplasmic, 20% were associated with the membrane and 34% were extracellular or associated with the cell wall. The NprR-regulated genes can be distributed into four functional groups. The first group is composed of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in stress resistance: they include the genes for cytochrome P450 (BC2613), cysteine dioxygenase (BC2617), and Transporter Drug/Metabolite exporter family members (BC1063). The second group is a four-gene locus encoding the oligopeptide permease system Opp required for the import of small peptides into the cell. The third group is a five-gene locus encoding a <underline>n</underline>on<underline>r</underline>ibosomal <underline>p</underline>eptide <underline>s</underline>ynthesis (NRPS) system showing similarities with the systems involved in the synthesis of secreted factors like toxins and antibiotics. The last group codes for degradative enzymes (metalloproteases, esterases and chitinases) and for proteins which can bind organic material (chitin-binding protein and collagen adhesion protein). The role of NprR in the degradation of lipids, proteins and chitin was analyzed by growing the ΔRX and wt strains on specific culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The lipolytic, proteolytic and chitinolytic activities of the ΔRX strain were significantly lower than those of the wt strain. We monitored the expression kinetics in infected insect larvae of two NprR-regulated genes encoding degradative enzymes (BC0429 and BC2167) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

        <title>A secreted factor regulated by NprR allows <italic>Bt</italic> to survive in insect cadavers</title>
        <p>To identify the NprR-dependent survival factor we first tested whether this putative factor was secreted. Insect larvae were co-infected with two different ratios of wt and ΔRX strains: 90% of wt bacteria with 10% of ΔRX bacteria (90∶10), and 10% of wt bacteria with 90% of ΔRX bacteria (10∶90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In insects infected with the ratio 10∶90, the total population of the wt and the ΔRX strains decreased after 24 h. This may result from the ΔRX strain capturing NprX without being able to express NprR-regulated genes, but nevertheless removing the peptide from the environment. Consequently, the amount of signaling peptide was insufficient to activate NprR-regulated genes in the wt, resulting in clearance of both populations. Co-infection with the ratio 90∶10 led to the survival of the two subpopulations during the 96 h of the experiment. In this condition, the concentration of NprX in the host was presumably sufficient to maintain the expression of the NprR-regulated genes in the wt subpopulation, and this expression allowed the survival of the ΔRX population. Therefore, the wt strain may produce a secreted factor that enables the ΔRX strain to survive in the insect cadaver.</p>

Lipopeptides have biosurfactant activity, and we show that kurstakin is necessary for swarming mobility and biofilm formation. Thus, the kurstakin may possibly allow <italic>Bt</italic> to spread across the cadaver, facilitating access to new substrates.</p>

          <p>Lopez and coll. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Lopez1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Lopez2">[35]</xref> demonstrated that surfactin is a pore-forming molecule causing a potassium leakage across the membrane of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. This molecule acts as a signal triggering multicellularity: one subpopulation of bacterial cells produces surfactin and another responds to it by producing extracellular matrix. Here, we show that kurstakin may similarly induce potassium leakage across the cytoplasmic membrane of <italic>Bt</italic>. In addition, bioassays in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> indicate that at least two bacterial subpopulations coexist after host death: one subpopulation enters into sporulation, while the other remains in a vegetative form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and expresses the NprR-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). By analogy, kurstakin may also be a signaling molecule allowing <italic>Bt</italic> cells to differentiate into subpopulations. Bacterial heterogeneity could provide an advantage to the bacteria for the survival to sudden changes in the insect cadaver environment.</p>

      <p>Some NprR-regulated genes encoding cytoplasmic or membrane-associated proteins may participate in the necrotrophic development of <italic>Bt</italic>. A putative efflux system (BC1063), two macrolide glycosyl transferases (BC2066 and BC2622) and a N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase could be involved in resistance to antimicrobial molecules, and cytochrome P450 (BC2613) may be involved in resistance to reactive oxygen species. The membrane-associated proteins are mainly components of an oligopeptide permease system (Opp) involved in the uptake of PapR, the signaling peptide required for PlcR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Gominet1">[36]</xref>. The operon encoding this Opp system is downregulated by NprR suggesting that NprR controls PlcR expression negatively through the Opp system. Interestingly, <italic>nprA</italic> expression was only slightly reduced in a <italic>oppB</italic> mutant strain suggesting that another oligopeptide permease system is involved for the uptake of NprX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Consequently, a down-regulation of the <italic>opp</italic> genes could not have a significant effect on the expression of the NprR-regulated genes. Possibly, the extracellular concentration of NprX is a signal triggering the transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle. During the early stage of infection, the PlcR regulon is expressed and the extracellular concentration of NprX might be low. Indeed, recent results indicate that <italic>nprX</italic> transcription starts in late stationary phase (TD, SP, DL, unpublished data). In view of these data, we hypothesize that after the host death, the extracellular concentration of NprX increases, leading to the expression of NprR-regulated genes and repression of the PlcR regulon <italic>via</italic> the Opp transporter. These various observations indicate that the necrotrophic lifestyle of <italic>Bt</italic> is a complex developmental stage, not limited to simple feeding on the host contents. They also imply that the transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle is associated with significant metabolic changes.</p>
      <p>It is becoming clear that the infectious cycle of <italic>Bt</italic> can be divided into four distinct and sequential phases starting with toxemia caused by the Cry proteins, followed by the action of PlcR in virulence, necrotrophism and the completion of the sporulation process involving NprR, and finally the dissemination of spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We describe a <italic>nprR</italic>-<italic>nprX</italic> mutant that does not develop necrotrophically and is unable to sporulate efficiently, demonstrating that the necrotrophic properties of <italic>Bt</italic> are essential for horizontal transmission. It is remarkable that the developmental process through the complete infection cycle in the insect host is coordinated by three regulator-signaling peptide cell-cell communication systems: PlcR-PapR, NprR-NprX and the Rap-Phr complexes which control the phosphorylation of Spo0A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Perego1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Lazazzera1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Bongiorni1">[39]</xref>.</p>

          <p>(1) Toxins and spores reach the intestinal epithelium. The toxins induce cell lysis and create favorable conditions for spore germination. The resulting vegetative bacteria adhere to cells weakened by toxins and can grow. (2) The bacteria produce PlcR-regulated virulence factors which attack the intestinal barrier. This event allows the bacteria to penetrate into deeper tissues, such that they can multiply in body fluids and cause host death. (3) The bacteria shift from a virulent lifestyle to a necrotrophic lifestyle and change their gene expression pattern. The pleiotropic regulator NprR activates the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in food supply, stress resistance, protection against competitors and kurstakin synthesis. These factors increase bacterial fitness in the host cadaver, allowing the bacteria to produce Cry toxins (orange diamonds) and to pursue their developmental program until sporulation and production of resistant spores. (4) Spores and toxins disseminate in the environment through various abiotic (wind, rain) and biotic (parasites, predators) mechanisms.</p>

      <p>Members of the <italic>Bc</italic> group may be able to follow two different life cycles: an infectious cycle (described above) and an endosymbiotic cycle in which the bacteria live in a symbiotic relation with their invertebrate hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Jensen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Margulis1">[40]</xref>. Here, we report that <italic>Bt</italic> multiplies efficiently in the insect cadaver and has a genetic developmental program to live in this biotope. Consequently, we propose the existence of a strictly necrotrophic life cycle in which <italic>Bt</italic> colonizes a wide variety of dead insects, and uses the cadaver as a bioreactor to multiply and to produce spores and toxins.</p>
      <p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis reveals that <italic>nprR</italic> is found in all strains of the <italic>Bc</italic> group, except that in <italic>Bc</italic> ATCC14579 <italic>nprR</italic> is disrupted by a transposon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002629-Ivanova1">[3]</xref>.

Therefore, the function of NprR is probably conserved in the <italic>Bc</italic> group, and it would be interesting to determine whether the necrotrophic development of <italic>Bc</italic> and <italic>Ba</italic> in their mammalian hosts requires the same quorum-sensing regulated network. It is also important to characterize kurstakin to determine how it promotes survival in insect cadavers. Moreover, the properties of this molecule may indicate possibilities for the development of phytosanitary products or adjuvants to improve both the ecological fitness and the efficacy of biopesticides.</p>
