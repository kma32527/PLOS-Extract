        <p>Most DNA viruses replicate in the cell nucleus, although the specific sites of virion assembly are as yet poorly defined. Electron microscopy on freeze-substituted, plastic-embedded sections of murine polyomavirus (PyV)-infected 3T3 mouse fibroblasts or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed tubular structures in the nucleus adjacent to clusters of assembled virions, with virions apparently “shed” or “budding” from their ends. Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) have been suggested as possible sites for viral replication of polyomaviruses (BKV and SV40), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and adenovirus (Ad). Immunohistochemistry and FISH demonstrated co-localization of the viral T-antigen (Tag), PyV DNA, and the host DNA repair protein MRE11, adjacent to the PML-NBs. In PML<bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> MEFs the co-localization of MRE11, Tag, and PyV DNA remained unchanged, suggesting that the PML protein itself was not responsible for their association. Furthermore, PyV-infected PML<bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> MEFs and PML<bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> mice replicated wild-type levels of infectious virus. Therefore, although the PML protein may identify sites of PyV replication, neither the observed “virus factories” nor virus assembly were dependent on PML. The ultrastructure of the tubes suggests a new model for the encapsidation of small DNA viruses.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Polyomaviruses are infectious pathogens of mammals and birds that have been linked to the development of cancers in their hosts. Members of the polyomavirus family are associated with human disease, such as JCV and BKV, and over the past few years, several more human polyomaviruses (WUV, KIV and MCV) have been discovered in immune-suppressed individuals. We are studying the way in which these viruses assemble in cells in order to identify critical points where anti-viral therapies could target these viruses. Using a structural, biochemical and cell biological approach, we set out to define sites of virus assembly and virus intermediates. We identified virus-specific structures that we termed “virus factories”. We believe that these sites serve as an assembly line for the production of new viruses. Our study provides new evidence for the presence and composition of virus assembly factories, and identifies a host protein that may be important for infection by polyomaviruses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Increasing evidence suggests that the assembly of many viruses occurs at specific intracellular sites, which have been termed “virus factories” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Wileman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Novoa1">[2]</xref>. These subcellular domains are gathering points for coordinating genome replication and capsid protein assembly into virions. The ultrastructure of the factories has been determined for a number of RNA viruses that assemble in the cytoplasm. For example, specific membrane compartments such as the ER appear to be co-opted and re-configured such that the surface of the membrane is used as a scaffold, where viral replication is spatially juxtaposed with capsid proteins specifically delivered to these locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-denBoon1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Gillespie1">[5]</xref>. Such scaffolds likely have a significant kinetic impact on virion assembly. Structural information concerning assembly sites for DNA viruses that replicate and assemble in the nucleus is less clear, perhaps due to the intrinsic complexity and dynamic nature of the nuclear architecture.</p>
      <p>Polyomaviruses are small non-enveloped dsDNA viruses that replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus. The viral capsid is comprised of 72 pentamers of the major capsid protein VP1, each associated with a single copy of a minor capsid protein, either VP2 or VP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Belnap1">[6]</xref>. A complex of VP1 pentamer, with VP2/3, is nuclear imported as a capsid “subunit” late in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Lin1">[7]</xref>. Replication of the viral genome is accomplished through the interaction of the viral large T-antigen (Tag) and its recruitment of cellular DNA replication proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Cheng1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Fanning1">[9]</xref>. How the capsid protein subunits specifically identify the viral genome is unknown, but sequences near the viral origin of replication along with the J-domain of large Tag both appear to have important functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Francke1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Whalen1">[13]</xref>. In contrast to the larger DNA viruses, such as herpes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Brown1">[14]</xref> and Ad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Ostapchuk1">[15]</xref>, assembly of polyomavirus has been hypothesized to involve “polymerization” of the capsid protein subunits onto the viral minichromosomes rather than injection of the viral genome into a preformed capsid structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Garber1">[16]</xref>. However, intermediates in the assembly process are not well defined.</p>
      <p>Candidate sites for nuclear virus assembly factories are promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies or PML-NBs (previously termed ND10s, PML oncogenic domains, or PODs). Maul <italic>et al</italic> first associated PML-NBs with DNA virus replication, specifically studying infection by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), and SV40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Ishov1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Maul2">[20]</xref>. PML-NBs are functionally heterogeneous intra-nuclear structures, operationally identified by immuno-staining with anti-PML protein antibodies (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a subset of nuclear “dots”). They have been associated with such diverse functions as interferon antiviral responses, DNA damage repair, and the p53 response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Bernardi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Everett1">[22]</xref>. Although a large number of proteins have been found associated with PML-NBs, constitutive proteins include PML, which appears essential for PML-NB component protein co-localization, along with Sp100 and Daxx. PML-NB formation requires PML modification by sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Seeler1">[23]</xref>. Using 4Pi fluorescence laser-scanning microscopy, PML-NBs have been modeled in three dimensions as spheres of varying diameters with a 50–100 nm thick shell comprised of PML and Sp100 proteins stabilized by sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Lang1">[24]</xref>. PML-NBs in uninfected cells may serve as scaffolds for assembling a variety of DNA repair and checkpoint signaling proteins in response to DNA damage, such as that caused by UV-irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Boe1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Everett2">[26]</xref>. Many DNA viruses appear to usurp the cellular DNA repair proteins for their replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Lilley1">[27]</xref>, and if replication and virion assembly are spatially coupled, then perhaps these viruses also utilize PML-NBs for capsid assembly.</p>
      <p>Polyomavirus (SV40, BKV, JCV) DNA replication has been localized adjacent to PML-NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Ishov1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-JulLarsen1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Jiang1">[30]</xref>, and associated with recruitment of cellular DNA damage-related proteins, such as ATM kinase and the MRN complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Dahl1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Zhao1">[32]</xref>. In contrast to the large DNA viruses, infection with polyomaviruses does not grossly disrupt the morphology of PML-NBs, although their number and size may increase and alterations in their function may be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Jiang1">[30]</xref>. Tag and VP1 have been co-localized with PML-NBs during BKV, SV40 and JCV infection supporting a spatial coupling of replication with assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-JulLarsen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ShishidoHara1">[29]</xref>. PML-NBs also are associated with papillomavirus (PV) replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Day1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Day2">[38]</xref>. Day <italic>et al</italic> have suggested a model in which the L2 protein first localizes to PML-NBs, associates with the viral E2 protein, which specifically labels the PV viral genome, and subsequently recruits the major capsid protein L1 to the genome for virion assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Day1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Day2">[38]</xref>. However, neither E2-dependent transcription nor PV DNA replication have been found to be dependent on PML-NBs, and the PV L2 capsid protein does not require the PML protein itself for localization into specific foci or to form virus-like particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Becker1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Nakahara1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The convergence of Tag, DNA repair proteins, replicating viral DNA, and capsid proteins at PML-NBs during polyomavirus infection suggests that these sites may function as virus factories where all components in the assembly process interact. We have used electron microscopy and tomography of cryo-preserved samples to identify ultrastructural elements that might represent these factories in mouse polyomavirus (PyV)-infected mouse cells. Adjacent to growing virion clusters we identified tubular structures that appear to give rise to new virions. These structures were independent of the presence of the PML protein, and PML<sup>−/−</sup> cells and knockout mice were unaffected in virus replication. Moreover, the ultrastructure of the tubules suggests a new model for small DNA virus encapsidation.</p>

        <title>Temporal Progression of Nuclear Virus Assembly</title>
        <p>We used electron microscopy and tomographic three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of freeze-substituted, plastic-embedded specimens to identify possible sites and structural features of PyV virion assembly. PyV-infected mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were preserved by high-pressure freezing followed by low temperature freeze-substitution and resin embedding. PyV infection proceeds asynchronously and rapidly, consequently progressive stages of infection stages are observed in a single sample. Thus, the time course of infection was operationally-defined based upon the presence, size and number of virus clusters observed in the nucleus of an individual cell. Early in infection full virions were somewhat dispersed throughout the volume of the nucleus and not yet arranged in clusters, although they were closely associated with tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and inset). The tubular structures were often located near the periphery of cellular condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with previous observations for JCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ShishidoHara1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ShishidoHara2">[40]</xref>. As infection proceeded, the number of virions increased, forming virus clusters or arrays, remaining associated with the tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, data not shown). The tubular structures were absent, or could not be detected, late in infection when arrays of progeny virions filled the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The temporal appearance of the tubes is consistent with their function as an assembly intermediate.</p>

When the tubular structures were imaged in thin-sections (70 nm) of plastic-embedded PyV-infected 3T3 cells, their average diameter was 35–40 nm, and two types could be distinguished based upon the presence or absence of an electron dense core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This distinction is similar to the differences in electron densities seen for empty <italic>versus</italic> full virus capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), where full capsids display a dark, electron dense core due to the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ultrastructure of a Virus Factory</title>
        <p>At high resolution, the virions appeared to have a dense core, representing the viral genome, surrounded by a lower density region. This outer density was consistent with the thickness of the capsid shell. The tubular structures had a remarkable substructure. In cryo-substituted, Epon-embedded preparations the tubes appeared to have a dense core surrounded by a lighter, uniform density similar to that seen for virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Along the tubes “bubble-like” structures were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g003">Figure 3A</xref> inset) similar to that observed in the tomogram of the single virus factory (see Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002630.s003">Video S2</xref>).

        <title>Association of PyV Proteins with Nuclear Structures During Infection</title>

PML-NBs were identified using antibodies directed against the PML protein. Viral proteins were visualized by staining PyV-infected C57 mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) for Tag at 22–28 hpi. Similar results were obtained when PyV-infected 3T3 fibroblasts were used (data not shown). Using a fluorescently-labeled (FISH) probe specific for viral DNA, we found PyV DNA localized adjacent to PML-NBs in C57 MEFs at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, top panel). Tag was localized diffusely throughout the nucleus, with a subset of staining in more intense puncta co-localizing with PyV DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom panel). At later times (28 hpi), the intensity of Tag staining in the nucleus increased while its localization pattern remained similar to that seen earlier during infection (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g005">Figure 5A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

At 28 hpi, PML-NBs appeared larger in size when compared to uninfected cells, consistent with previous observations for BKV and SV40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Jiang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Zhao1">[32]</xref>.

        <p>PML-NBs have been associated with host proteins responsible for transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. The DNA repair complex, MRN, is comprised of three interacting proteins, MRE11, Rad50 and Nbs1. MRN is recruited to sites of double-strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks, including those organized at or near PML-NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Bischof1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Boisvert1">[42]</xref> and MRE11 is recruited to SV40 sites of replication but later degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Zhao1">[32]</xref>. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and FISH, we determined whether MRE11 localized with PyV DNA during infection. In uninfected cells, the MRE11 staining was faint, presumably due to its diffuse localization throughout the nucleus (data not shown). Upon infection, MRE11 staining was increased and became localized in discrete nuclear foci around the viral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, top panel). When co-stained for Tag and MRE11, the MRE11 foci co-localized with the bright Tag puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom panel).

        <p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> progression of PyV infection was compared between PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Wang1">[44]</xref> and the syngeneic mouse strain (Sv129) using qPCR for viral DNA in isolated tissues. Sv129 or PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected intraperitoneally with mouse polyomavirus strain A2 and mice were sacrificed 6 or 14 days later. Total DNA was isolated from homogenized tissue and PyV genomes were quantitated by qPCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002630-t002">Table 2</xref>). The level of viral genome replication was similar between wild-type and PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice on days 4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002630-t002">Table 2</xref>; data not shown). On day 14, however, although the kidneys had very similar PyV load in PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice and the wild type controls, the liver and lung tissues of PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice had lower viral genome levels than wild type mice. By day 14, the adaptive immune response starts to control the infection, therefore data from mice infected for 6 days provided a more reliable readout of the ability of the virus to replicate <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Many viruses appear to assemble progeny virions at specific intracellular locations, often termed “virus factories.” These sites may represent subcellular scaffolds where replicated genomes and capsid proteins spatially intersect in an efficient and coordinated manner to assemble virions. We used electron microscopy and tomographic 3-D reconstructions to identify possible sites and structural features for PyV virus assembly. We identified tubular structures in close physical association with progeny virions in the nucleus of PyV-infected mouse fibroblasts. The chronology of tube appearance suggests that these structures form at the initiation of virion assembly. Tubular structures were not observed in the cytoplasm of either infected or uninfected cells. We have termed the tubular structures, together with the associated virion clusters, virus factories.</p>
      <p>The tubular structures appear similar to “filamentous” structures previously observed in samples prepared by conventional, chemical fixation techniques and visualized by electron microscopy in PyV-infected baby hamster kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Howatson1">[46]</xref> and secondary mouse embryo cell cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Mattern1">[47]</xref>, COS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding JCV viral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ShishidoHara1">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ShishidoHara3">48</xref>, JCV-infected brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ShishidoHara2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Nagashima1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Nagashima2">[50]</xref>, and tissue samples from PML patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Silverman1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-ZuRhein1">[52]</xref>. Consistent with the findings in these previous reports, we observed the accumulation of tubular structures early after infection and their relative absence late in infection when the nucleus was filled with virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Mattern1">[47]</xref>. In these early studies the tubular structures were also suggested to be assembly intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Howatson1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Mattern1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Mattern2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Mattern3">[54]</xref>. Tubular structures also have been reported in studies of papillomavirus isolated from human and rabbit warts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Kiselev1">[55]</xref>, and of PyV isolated from infected tissue culture cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Baker1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Baker2">[57]</xref>. Although we have not yet identified similar structures in BKV or SV40-infected cultured cells (preliminary findings), the observation of tubular structures in histologic sections from PyV-infected mouse or hamster kidneys, PML patients, and human papillomavirus specimens supports their physiologic relevance to infection.</p>
      <p>Previous reports modeled two types of tubes from negatively-stained and low dose electron microscopic images. The tube types, termed hexamer or pentamer, are distinguished by the arrangement of VP1 pentamers within the tubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Baker1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Baker2">[57]</xref>. The hexamer tubes have an average diameter of 45–55 nm whereas the pentamer tubes have a diameter of ≈30 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Kiselev1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Baker1">[56]</xref>. Thus, the tubular structures we observed during infection may represent the hexamer or pentamer tubes. We observed tubes with varying diameters (30–45 nm), which is consistent with the different diameters of the isolated tubes. The variation in diameter may be due to fixation and preservation of the samples isolated under various conditions. In contrast, however, the tubes we observed often had an electron dense core. In addition surrounding the electron-dense core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g004">Figure 4</xref>) we could identify a less dense rim associated with periodic densities (“dots”) spaced ≈8–12 nm apart. This distance is consistent with the distance between the centers of each pentamer in a hexamer tube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Kiselev1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Baker2">[57]</xref>. Furthermore, the helical twist of pentameric subunits in pentamer/hexamer tubes is consistent with the apparent twisting of the filamentous structure around the tube core. Although the filamentous structures surrounding the tubes likely are comprised primarily of VP1 pentamers, it is possible that host proteins are also associated with the structures.</p>
      <p>The defining step in encapsidating large DNA viruses has been envisioned as the injection of the viral genome into a preformed capsid structure, similar to phage assembly. The current view of small DNA virus encapsidation is vague, hypothesizing that coat proteins are polymerized around the viral minichromosome in some manner. Our images suggest an alternative view. In comparison with virions in the same sections, the density surrounding the tubes corresponded to the density of the outer capsid of the virions, while the dense core was similar to the virion interior. Along with the occasional appearance of “budding” virions from the ends of the tubes, it might be envisioned that virion encapsidation proceeds in a manner akin to making sausage. The VP1 pentamers would first polymerize into tubes, and the viral chromatin then traverses the interior of the tubes until a terminal sealing event buds off the icosahedral particle. This model has an obvious relation to the assembly of large DNA viruses in that a preformed structure is subsequently filled with the viral genome. We present a model of icosahedral virus budding from the tubes in supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002630.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although PML-NBs have been previously speculated to be sites of viral DNA replication and possibly virion assembly, we found that the loss of the PML protein itself did not affect the punctate localization of PyV Tag or DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g007">Figure 7</xref>), or the presence of tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, while the nuclear bodies as defined by PML immunohistochemistry are not required for virus assembly, it is possible that other components of the PML-NBs may remain in a focal distribution to facilitate viral DNA replication, packaging and virion assembly. In particular the continued localization of MRE11 in puncta in the absence of PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002630-g007">Figure 7</xref>) suggests that important functions continue in discrete foci. As yet we have not been able to directly associate the virus factories we observe in the EM sections with replicating viral DNA, Tag, or PML seen by immunohistochemistry. Although the virion clusters appear in discrete patches and could represent the foci of viral DNA seen by FISH, the currently available antibodies for PML, MRE11 and Tag, have not performed well in the freeze-substituted sections for immunoEM, presumably because the epitopes were destroyed during sample preparation. However, the immunohistochemistry consistently localizes PyV DNA and Tag around the PML staining, suggesting that replication may be occurring adjacent to but not directly at the site of the factories.</p>
      <p>PML-NBs have been suggested to be part of an intrinsic cell defense against the replication of a variety of viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Everett1">[22]</xref>. Both PML and Sp100 are interferon-inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Lavau1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Grotzinger1">[59]</xref>, and their protein levels correlate with the increased size and number of PML-NBs after IFN induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Bonilla1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Regad1">[63]</xref>. Large DNA viruses such as HSV-1 and Ad5 specifically target PML-NB structures during their replication cycle. PML-NBs are modified by the HSV-1 ICP0 protein, which induces proteasome degradation of the PML protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Everett3">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Burkham1">[66]</xref> whereas the Ad E4 ORF3 protein disrupts PML-NBs by reorganizing PML into fibrous strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Doucas1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Carvalho1">[67]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Ullman2">[69]</xref>. Without these viral proteins, viral replication is reduced for both HSV-1 and Ad. Likewise, certain RNA viruses obtain a replication advantage when PML expression is disrupted. For example, when PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), an increase in virus production was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Bonilla1">[60]</xref>. However, PML-NBs do not serve as a site of assembly for these RNA viruses, and the anti-viral effects may be a consequence of a separate function of PML-NBs. Our findings represent the first study which demonstrates both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, that loss of PML expression does not affect virus replication. These results are consistent with data from other polyomaviruses (BKV, JCV) using cells with shRNA knockdown for PML or arsenite-treatment to disrupt PML protein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Jiang1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Gasparovic1">[70]</xref>. Unlike JCV, however, we did not see an enhancement of virus production when PML was absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Gasparovic1">[70]</xref>. Furthermore, we did not see a rearrangement of PML-NBs such as observed during BKV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Jiang1">[30]</xref>, although a slight increase in the size of PML-NBs during infection was noted.</p>
      <p>The structural features of virion assembly factories are beginning to be defined for many viruses. Viruses frequently yield important insights for cell biology, and the structures facilitating virus assembly may also inform hypotheses concerning the organization of important nuclear functions such as for DNA repair. The multiple functions assigned to PML-NBs are undergoing continued revision with respect to host-virus interactions. The role of PML-NBs in PyV replication is complex, and PML-NB associated proteins other than PML itself may provide the necessary architectural foundation for the tubular structures that appear to be the PyV factories.</p>

Cell culture infections were carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Cripe1">[73]</xref>. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20 pfu/cell for 32–34 hours for electron microscopy and replication studies, and 30–40 pfu/cell for 22–24 hours for immunofluorescence analysis. A higher MOI was used for immunofluorescence studies to compensate for cell loss during the staining process. Similar results were observed when an MOI of 10–20 pfu/cell was used although it was more difficult to identify infected cells due to loss during staining. Similar results were observed at 32–34 hours post-infection (hpi) when cells were stained for immunofluorescence analysis. However, cell loss was significantly increased at later times and the fluorescence signal was saturated. Thus, to define protein localization, we chose to show earlier times after infection for the immunofluorescence studies.</p>

        <p>Viral DNA was isolated from viral supernatants using the method described for Ad supernatants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Thomas1">[77]</xref> with some modifications. Briefly, 50 µl viral supernatant was digested with DNase (RQ1, Promega) at 37°C for 1 hr. DNase-treated samples were incubated with Proteinase K (Fermentas) for 37°C for 1 hr. The viral DNA was purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-up System (Promega) according to the manufacturer protocol except 80% ethanol was used in place of isopropanol during the wash.

        <p>Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) was used to design probes and primers for amplification of a 67-bp region of the mouse polyomavirus genome (NCBI accession # NC_001515). PCR primers were synthesized by IDT and the TaqMan probe was synthesized by Applied Biosystems. The following primers were used: PyV VP1 forward primer, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′TGGGAGGCAGTCTCAGTGAAA3′</named-content>; PyV VP1 reverse primer, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′TGAACCCATGCACATCTAACAGT3′</named-content>; PyV VP1 probe, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′CCGAGGTGGTGGGCTCTGGC3′</named-content>. The TaqMan probe was labeled with FAM (6-carboxy-fluorescein) at the 5′ end and a quencher, TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetramethylrodamine) at the 3′ end. Optimal concentrations of probe and primer were determined using a concentration matrix, as described in Applied Biosystems protocols.</p>
        <p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were prepared in 96-well optical plates (Applied Biosystems) in a volume of 25 µl. Each reaction contained 200 nM TaqMan probe, 900 nM of each forward and reverse primer, 12.5 µl TaqMan Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 5 µl purified viral DNA or DNA standards. The intensity of fluorescence of the reporter label was normalized to the ROX Passive Reference, supplied in the master mix solution. DNA amplification was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Sequence Detection System using cycling conditions of 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1 min. For each run, duplicates of seven dilutions of the viral standard DNA (from 0.1 ng to 5×10<sup>−5</sup> ng; pGEX-VP1 plasmid DNA), viral DNA samples and no template controls were simultaneously subjected to analysis. The number of genomes was determined as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-Thomas1">[77]</xref> and is reported as “nuclease-resistant genomes (NRG) per ml.”</p>

        <p>PML<sup>−/−</sup> mice were obtained from the NCI and 129S1/Svlmj wild-type control mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were infected intraperitoneally at 2 months of age with 5×10<sup>5</sup> pfu per mouse with PyV strain A2. Mice were sacrificed 6 and 14 days post-infection and their organs (spleen, kidney, liver, lung) were isolated to measure viral load by qPCR.</p>
        <p>To determine the viral load in infected mouse tissues by qPCR, DNA was prepared from organ homogenates by proteinase K (Sigma) digestion at 55°C overnight, followed by phenol extraction and RNase-A treatment (10 units/µl, Promega). The PCR amplification was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002630-SzomolanyiTsuda1">[78]</xref>. Briefly, a 50 µl reaction mixture with 2X SYBR green master mix (4309155, Applied Biosystems) and 0.1 mM each of forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen) was prepared. The following primers were used: β actin forward, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′CGA GGC CCA GAG CAA GAG AG3′</named-content>; β actin reverse, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′CGG TTG GCC TTA GGG TTC AG3′</named-content>; PyV VP1 forward, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′CCC CCG GTA CAG GTT CAG TCC CAT CAT3′</named-content>; VP1 reverse, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′GGC ACA ACA GCT CCA CCC GTC CTG CAG3′</named-content>. The amplification for VP1 started with one cycle at 95°C for 10 min, 37 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 20 sec, 72°C for 45 sec. PCR amplification with the β actin primers started with one cycle at 95°C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 25 sec, and 72°C for 25 sec. Negative controls included a sample with no DNA template and DNA from uninfected mouse organs. Three-fold serial dilutions of DNA prepared from uninfected mouse organs (spanning 1 µg–31 ng) were used to generate a standard curve for β actin PCR. For PyV we used a recombinant plasmid containing the VP1 coding sequences and made dilution series from 2×10<sup>8</sup> copies to 20 copies. All the reactions were run in duplicates. The obtained PyV copy numbers were normalized for β actin which reflected the amount of mouse genomic DNA present, and the results were expressed as PyV genome copies per µg organ DNA.</p>
