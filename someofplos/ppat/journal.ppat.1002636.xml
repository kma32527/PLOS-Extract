        <p>Although treatment with interleukin-7 (IL-7) was shown to transiently expand the naïve and memory T-cell pools in patients with chronic HIV-1 infection receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), it is uncertain whether a full immunologic reconstitution can be achieved. Moreover, the effects of IL-7 have never been evaluated during acute HIV-1 (or SIV) infection, a critical phase of the disease in which the most dramatic depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is believed to occur. In the present study, recombinant, fully glycosylated simian IL-7 (50 µg/kg, s.c., once weekly for 7 weeks) was administered to 6 rhesus macaques throughout the acute phase of infection with a pathogenic SIV strain (mac251); 6 animals were infected at the same time and served as untreated controls. Treatment with IL-7 did not cause clinically detectable side effects and, despite the absence of concomitant ART, did not induce significant increases in the levels of SIV replication except at the earliest time point tested (day 4 post-infection). Strikingly, animals treated with IL-7 were protected from the dramatic decline of circulating naïve and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that occurred in untreated animals. Treatment with IL-7 induced only transient T-cell proliferation, but it was associated with sustained increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, persistent expansion of all circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets, and development of earlier and stronger SIV Tat-specific T-cell responses. However, the beneficial effects of IL-7 were not sustained after treatment interruption. These data demonstrate that IL-7 administration is effective in protecting the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell pool during the acute phase of SIV infection in macaques, providing a rationale for the clinical evaluation of this cytokine in patients with acute HIV-1 infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The development of highly effective cocktails of antiretroviral drugs has had a major impact on the survival and quality of life of individuals with HIV-1 infection. Yet, current protocols often fail to fully restore the immunologic function, a limitation that has prompted the clinical evaluation of immune-reconstitution agents, such as IL-7, as adjuvant therapies. To date, however, IL-7 has been tested exclusively in patients with chronic HIV-1 infection, while it appears that the immune system is irreparably damaged during acute primary infection, within the first few weeks after encountering the virus. We used a macaque model to show that treatment with IL-7 has beneficial effects if implemented during the acute phase of infection with SIV, the simian AIDS virus. Early administration of IL-7 was safe and effectively protected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the primary target cells for the virus, from the marked decline that typically occurs during acute SIV infection. Furthermore, IL-7 boosted the development of antiviral immune responses. Thus, IL-7 might be an effective adjuvant therapy in acute HIV-1 infection, which can protect the pool of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before it is irreversibly compromised by the action of the virus.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Although HIV-1 establishes a chronic active infection that evolves toward clinical immunodeficiency over a span of several years, accumulating evidence indicates that critical pathogenic events take place during the acute phase of infection, leading to a massive and seemingly irreversible depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, predominantly of the memory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Li1">[2]</xref>. A large fraction of the T-cell pool in the body is harbored in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Veazey1">[3]</xref>, which has been identified as a primary anatomical site for CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion in both HIV-1-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Guadalupe1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mehandru1">[6]</xref> and SIV-infected nonhuman primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Li1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Veazey2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-SmitMcBride1">[8]</xref>; yet, the loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the early phase of infection appears to be a systemic phenomenon that involves all secondary lymphoid organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-ZengMing1">[10]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that interventions aimed at preventing or reducing the immunologic damage caused by HIV-1 would be most effective if implemented during the earliest stages of infection, before the pool of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells becomes irreversibly compromised.</p>
      <p>In spite of extensive research over the past three decades, the mechanism of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion during the course of HIV-1 infection is still debated. Studies in SIV-infected macaques have highlighted the role of direct cytopathic effects of the virus during the course of acute primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-ZengMing1">[10]</xref>. However, indirect mechanisms, including bystander apoptosis, may also be important, as suggested by the increased levels of apoptosis detected in blood and lymphoid organs of macaques acutely infected with pathogenic SIV strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Li1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Wykrzykowska1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Cumont1">[15]</xref>, as well as in <italic>ex vivo</italic>-cultured T cells from individuals with acute HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Roos1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Cossarizza1">[18]</xref>. Thus, the use of anti-apoptotic agents during primary HIV-1 infection may have beneficial effects for preserving the integrity of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell pool. We previously demonstrated that interleukin-7 (IL-7), a nonredundant cytokine that plays a critical role in the development and homeostasis of the T-lymphoid compartment of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Bradley1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Jiang1">[21]</xref>, effectively reduces the levels of spontaneous apoptosis in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Vassena1">[22]</xref>. In lymphopenic hosts, the levels of endogenous IL-7 increase, causing transient proliferation of naïve and central memory (CM) CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which eventually leads to the reconstitution of the physiological T-lymphocyte pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Fry1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Vassena1">[22]</xref>. Owing to these unique biological properties, IL-7 is currently under clinical investigation as an immune-reconstitution agent in various forms of natural and iatrogenic immunodeficiencies, including those associated with AIDS and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Alpdogan1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Capitini1">[24]</xref>. Pre-clinical studies in macaques chronically infected with SIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Fry2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Beq1">[28]</xref>, as well as clinical studies in patients with HIV-1 infection or receiving treatment with immunosuppressive antineoplastic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Rosenberg1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Sportes1">[32]</xref>, have documented beneficial effects of short-term courses of IL-7 therapy, resulting in the proliferation and numerical expansion of naïve and CM CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Whether adjuvant therapy with IL-7 may effectively lead to the long-term reconstitution of the immunologic function remains unclear. Moreover, IL-7 treatment has never been evaluated in acute HIV-1/SIV infection, a phase in which it may still be possible to avert the seemingly irreversible immunologic damage caused by massive viral replication prior to the appearance of virus-specific adaptive immune responses.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we administered fully glycosylated simian IL-7 to rhesus macaques during the acute phase of infection with a pathogenic SIV strain (mac251). The concomitant use of ART was deliberately avoided in order to exclude its confounding effects on pathogenesis since ART would have suppressed SIV replication, thereby preventing the pathologic depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and making it impossible to evaluate the CD4-protective effects of IL-7. Another important goal of our study was to examine the effects of IL-7 on SIV replication since IL-15, a related common-γ-chain cytokine, was recently shown to dramatically increase SIV replication and accelerate disease progression when administered to acutely-infected macaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mueller1">[33]</xref>. Our results demonstrate that treatment with IL-7 during the acute phase of SIV infection is safe and effective in preventing the decline of circulating naïve and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells without causing major increases in the levels of SIV replication.</p>

        <p>None of the 6 rhesus macaques treated with IL-7 exhibited adverse clinical side effects throughout the treatment period. After the first IL-7 injection (day −7 relative to SIV infection), plasma IL-7 levels peaked on day −5 to return to baseline on day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002636-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The two subsequent injections (day 0 and day 7) induced higher peak levels of plasma IL-7 and a greater area under the curve (AUC), resulting in markedly elevated trough levels before each of the following injections. This pattern likely reflects the initial distribution of the cytokine to a high-affinity compartment that was saturated upon subsequent injections. Increased plasma levels of IL-7, albeit considerably lower than in IL-7-treated animals, were also observed in untreated animals starting on day 28 post-infection in parallel with the most pronounced reductions in circulating lymphocyte counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002636-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). No significant correlations were found between plasma levels of IL-7 and various immunological parameters, including circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts and expression of the specific chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7Rα or CD127) (data not shown). In agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Fry2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Sportes1">[32]</xref>, IL-7 treatment initially caused a significant downmodulation of the IL-7 receptor (CD127) in both naïve and memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002636-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

The RP course has been suggested to represent a unique form of SIV disease, distinct from that of conventional progressors (CP) and associated with an unusual pathogenesis characterized by higher levels of SIV viremia, massive SIV replication in mononuclear phagocytic cells rather than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (with consequent lack of depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), and severe SIV-related enteropathy in the absence of opportunistic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Brown1">[34]</xref>.

However, the ability of such treatments to regenerate fully competent naïve and memory T-cell pools remains questionable as multiple lines of evidence indicate that the initial damage caused by HIV-1 during acute primary infection is irreversible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Li1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-ZengMing1">[10]</xref>, marking a critical event in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease and precluding the success of any restoration attempts enacted during the chronic phase. These considerations underscore the need to aim adjuvant treatment strategies toward immunologic preservation rather than reconstitution and, therefore, to implement such strategies at the earliest possible time after the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. In this study, we used a macaque model to demonstrate that treatment with IL-7, the principal T-cell homeostatic cytokine, can prevent the dramatic decline of circulating naïve and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that occurs during acute primary SIV infection. Although in the clinical setting IL-7 would presumably be associated with ART, as it was done in phase-1 studies in patients with chronic HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Rosenberg1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Sereti1">[30]</xref>, we deliberately avoided the use of virus-suppressive drugs in order to allow for an unbiased evaluation of the effects of IL-7 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion, which is the hallmark of HIV-1/SIV-induced pathogenesis during primary infection. In fact, ART by itself would have prevented the loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, limiting the scope of our study. The fact that in acutely-infected macaques treatment with IL-7 was able to protect naïve and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells even in the absence of ART suggests that the combination of IL-7 with virus-suppressive drugs would be even more effective in maintaining the integrity of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell pool during one of the most critical phases in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease.</p>
      <p>To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the CD4-protective effects of IL-7, we examined the kinetics of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the induction of SIV-specific cellular immune responses during the course of IL-7 treatment. Some levels of proliferation, albeit low, were documented following the first injection of IL-7, presumably leading to the observed initial expansion of the memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subset. However, in agreement with data of IL-7 treatment in chronically SIV-infected macaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Beq1">[28]</xref>, no further proliferation was seen after any subsequent IL-7 injection, suggesting that repeated administrations of fully glycosylated IL-7 at weekly intervals may in fact induce tachyphylaxis, at least concerning the proliferative effects of the cytokine. Conversely and in agreement with our previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Vassena1">[22]</xref>, several observations pointed to a reduction of apoptosis as one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell preservation in our IL-7-treated macaques. First, while the levels of apoptosis in peripheral blood T cells did not change significantly during primary SIV infection in either treated or untreated animals, preventing the evaluation of the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-7 in this compartment, there was a sustained increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, a marker of increased resistance to apoptosis, in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-7-treated animals. Second, analysis of secondary lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes and GALT) demonstrated a reduction of apoptosis in selected CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations in IL-7-treated macaques, even though these tissues were only sampled at a single time point during the acute phase due to the inherent difficulties in obtaining multiple tissues from the same animal within a short period of time. This limitation reduced our chances to document the full spectrum of anti-apoptotic effects of IL-7. Of note, analysis of the GALT at the time of peak SIV replication demonstrated that IL-7 reduced the proportion of Annexin-V-binding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, particularly of the memory phenotype, but not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. An important caveat that must be considered in this setting is the inconsistent quality of ileum specimens obtained by retrograde ileoscopy, which have a high probability of sampling error due to a markedly variable yield of lymphoid cells. Regardless, the fact that we did not observe even a trend toward reduced apoptosis among GALT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may reflect the fact that IL-7 is inactive against the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, which has been identified as the principal mechanism responsible for CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion in the gut during the acute phase of the infection, whereas the role of apoptosis in this context remains controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mattapallil1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Li1">[2]</xref>. Although a more extensive investigation is warranted to confirm this hypothesis, our data suggest that IL-7 treatment prevented the decline of circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during the acute phase of SIV infection by inducing an initial expansion of these cells combined with their subsequent preservation via sustained pro-survival effects.</p>
      <p>Since IL-7 seemed to effectively preserve the pool of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are the main cellular targets for SIV, one could have anticipated considerable increases in the levels of virus replication in acutely infected macaques treated with IL-7. However, despite the absence of concomitant ART, we did not observe dramatic increases in the levels of SIV replication during both the treatment phase and the follow up period, with the only exception of the earliest time point analyzed (day 4 post-infection) in which the levels of SIV plasma viremia were significantly higher in IL-7-treated than in untreated macaques. A trend toward higher levels of SIV plasma viremia was seen at certain time points, particularly day 35 and day 41 post-infection, but it did not reach statistical significance even after exclusion from the analysis of the 4 animals with rapid disease progression. We cannot rule out that this lack of statistical significance was due to the low number of animals included in the study (n = 6 per group), even though the p values remained far below the threshold for significance. Nevertheless, it is undisputable that, if an enhancing effect of IL-7 on SIV replication did occur, this effect was far less dramatic than that documented for a related common-γ-chain cytokine, IL-15, in a similar experimental setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mueller1">[33]</xref>. Indeed, IL-15 treatment of macaques during the acute phase of SIV infection was shown to induce a ∼3 log increase in viral load, most likely due to increased CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation and activation, and to accelerate the disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mueller1">[33]</xref>. Various hypotheses can be formulated to explain these striking differences between the outcomes of IL-7 and IL-15 treatment. First, the lack of strong induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation by IL-7, unlike IL-15, which was detectable only transiently and only after the first IL-7 injection; of note, this transient proliferative effect of IL-7 could have been responsible for the significant increase in SIV plasma viremia at the earliest time point tested (day 4 post-infection). Second, the induction of early and vigorous SIV Tat-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in IL-7-treated animals, as compared to untreated animals, associated with the proliferation, expansion and activation of all CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subpopulations. Since Tat is a regulatory protein expressed during the early phase of the viral life cycle, Tat-specific T-cell responses presumably were able to halt the infection before completion of a full replicative cycle, thereby preventing the spread of infectious virus to other target cells. Of note, a pronounced numerical increase was detected in EM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, a functionally competent subset that was recently associated with effective vaccine-elicited protection in macaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Hansen1">[37]</xref>. Thus, it is plausible that the increased availability of target CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in IL-7-treated animals was counterbalanced by the effectiveness of virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses resulting in the observed minimal increases in SIV replication levels. An interesting correlate of our findings was provided by a recent study in mice acutely infected with LCMV, in which early treatment with IL-7 augmented the number and functionality of specific antiviral effector T cells, thereby reducing organ pathology and promoting viral clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Pellegrini1">[38]</xref>. Conversely, it is also possible that the earlier and stronger Tat-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses observed in IL-7-treated animals resulted from a more robust antigenic stimulation due to the higher amount of virus detected in these animals at day 4 post-infection; indeed, strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were also detected in IL-15-treated animals, although they were incapable of controlling viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mueller1">[33]</xref>. Thus, the different mechanisms of action of IL-7 and IL-15 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, with IL-15 inducing high levels of activation and proliferation mainly in memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the preferential target of the virus, and IL-7 stimulating the proliferation and renewal of naïve T cells too, thereby contributing to the preservation and replenishment of the peripheral T-cell pool, may account for the divergent effects of treatment with these two cytokines. Although a more extensive investigation is warranted in the perspective of a potential clinical use of IL-7 in acute HIV-1 infection, it is important to emphasize that in a therapeutic regimen IL-7 would always be administered in combination with ART, thereby minimizing its possible enhancing effects on viral replication.</p>
      <p>Our results may have implications for devising new treatment strategies for acute HIV-1 infection, whose clinical management remains a challenge. A critical hurdle is the inherent difficulty in identifying and treating patients at the earliest possible stage in order to reduce the massive HIV-1 replication that occurs before the development of virus-specific adaptive immune responses and its deleterious effects on the immune system. The extent of viral replication during the acute phase of SIV infection in macaques has indeed been identified as a critical determinant of the natural history of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Rosenberg2">[39]</xref>. Although early ART treatment was reported to be beneficial on the induction and maintenance of HIV-specific cellular immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Rosenberg2">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-AlHarthi1">[41]</xref>, additional studies in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-ZengMing1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Mehandru2">[42]</xref> and macaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002636-Verhoeven1">[43]</xref> have shown limited effects of ART alone on T-cell preservation in the intestinal lamina propria, underscoring the importance of devising effective adjuvant therapies. Indeed, even if ART is promptly initiated during primary infection, its effects may not be sufficient for fully preventing the immunologic damage caused by HIV-1, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, due to dishomogeneous drug biodistribution or inactivation by P-glycoproteins within the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, complete suppression of viral replication could take several weeks, and indirect mechanisms of cell destruction, such as bystander apoptosis, may remain active for some time after the virus has ceased to replicate. Our data provide a scientific basis for the clinical evaluation of IL-7, in combination with ART, for the treatment of acute primary HIV-1 infection.</p>
