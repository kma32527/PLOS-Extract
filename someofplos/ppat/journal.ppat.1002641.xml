        <p>The early inflammatory response to influenza virus infection contributes to severe lung disease and continues to pose a serious threat to human health. The mechanisms by which neutrophils gain entry to the respiratory tract and their role during pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we report that neutrophils significantly contributed to morbidity in a pathological mouse model of influenza virus infection. Using extensive immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transfers, and depletion studies, we identified neutrophils as the predominant pulmonary cellular source of the gelatinase matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9, which is capable of digesting the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, infection of MMP9-deficient mice showed that MMP9 was functionally required for neutrophil migration and control of viral replication in the respiratory tract. Although MMP9 release was toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling-dependent, MyD88-mediated signals in non-hematopoietic cells, rather than neutrophil TLRs themselves, were important for neutrophil migration. These results were extended using multiplex analyses of inflammatory mediators to show that neutrophil chemotactic factor, CCL3, and TNFα were reduced in the <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> airways. Furthermore, TNFα induced MMP9 secretion by neutrophils and blocking TNFα <italic>in vivo</italic> reduced neutrophil recruitment after infection. Innate recognition of influenza virus therefore provides the mechanisms to induce recruitment of neutrophils through chemokines and to enable their motility within the tissue via MMP9-mediated cleavage of the basement membrane. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown contribution of MMP9 to influenza virus pathogenesis by mediating excessive neutrophil migration into the respiratory tract in response to viral replication that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Influenza-associated morbidity and mortality due to yearly epidemics and sporadic, devastating pandemics are a significant health and economic burden. Severe complications arising from highly virulent viruses are associated with rapid, massive inflammatory cell infiltration. Although neutrophils are the predominant cell population recruited to the lung in response to pandemic influenza viruses, the mechanisms by which they gain entry to the respiratory tract remain unclear. In this study, we show a previously unknown contribution of MMP9 to influenza pathogenesis by mediating excessive neutrophil migration into the lung, which not only controls viral replication, but also contributes to morbidity. The <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of MMP9-derived enzymatic activity in neutrophils is controversial and understudied, but our data provide new evidence that innate recognition of influenza virus attracts neutrophils that secrete MMP9, which enables them to traverse the basement membrane of the lung by digesting the extracellular matrix. The dichotomy of MMP9 function in immunity versus pathology provides real challenges for targeting MMP9 for therapeutic purposes. Nevertheless, finding the balance to modulate neutrophil numbers following influenza virus infection will allow for innate immunity to be boosted whilst preventing pathology associated with pandemic strains.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Influenza viruses are highly contagious and cause an average of 226,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths in yearly epidemics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Thompson1">[1]</xref>. The emergence of immunologically distinct influenza viruses to which a whole population is susceptible has resulted in sporadic, devastating pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of ‘swine flu’ that infected an estimated 61 million people and killed 12,470 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Centers1">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, there is growing concern that avian influenza viruses, which have a significant mortality rate, could mutate to allow easy human-to-human transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Kuiken1">[3]</xref>. Severe complications arising from pandemic influenza or highly pathogenic avian viruses are often associated with rapid, massive inflammatory cell infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-LaGruta1">[4]</xref>. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been associated as their dysregulation correlates strongly with high viral load and pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-deJong1">[5]</xref>. Following infection, influenza virus replication occurs in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract where innate immune responses are initiated by recognition of the virus through the inflammasome, which consists of toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, and NOD-like receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Ichinohe1">[6]</xref>. For example, viral double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA are recognized by TLR3 and TLR7, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Diebold1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Guillot1">[8]</xref>. TLR3/7 signaling induces an inflammatory response that promotes a cascade of immune processes that regulate cellular recruitment and function, including the induction of cytokines and chemokines. Whereas this process results in full maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), activation and recruitment of antigen-specific T cells, and adequate anti-influenza humoral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Koyama1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Lore1">[10]</xref>, aberrant signaling has been suggested to play a key role in mediating lung pathology that is characterized by excess inflammation and pulmonary destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-LaGruta1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>MMPs are a family of proteolytic enzymes that are involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) under both physiological and pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Elkington1">[11]</xref>. They can be produced by a range of cells in the respiratory tract, where they mediate wound healing, airway remodeling, and cell trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Parks1">[12]</xref>. As such, MMPs play an important role in immunity, and their proteolytic activity can also directly dampen the inflammatory potential by downregulating cytokine and chemokine function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Chakrabarti1">[13]</xref>. However, excessive responses may contribute to pathology and MMP activity has been implicated in a variety of pulmonary diseases. Since MMPs have the potential to cause significant host damage, their production and function are tightly regulated. For example, MMPs are rarely stored inside cells and require gene transcription before secretion, the exceptions being neutrophil MMP-8 and -9, which are constitutively expressed in granules. Active MMPs can degrade all components of the ECM and are divided into subclasses based on their substrate specificity. Collectively known as the gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9 cleave denatured collagens (gelatins) and type IV collagen present in basement membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Chakrabarti1">[13]</xref>. Although implicated in a range of pulmonary diseases, a detailed understanding of the involvement of gelatinases in disease pathology after viral infection is lacking. MMP9 is not expressed in healthy lungs, but may be released under inflammatory conditions (such as infections and neoplastic diseases) by macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Although neutrophils are the predominant leukocyte population to be recruited to the lung and appear early in the immune response to pandemic influenza viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Perrone1">[14]</xref>, the mechanisms by which they gain entry to the respiratory tract and their role during pathogenesis remain unclear.</p>
      <p>In this study, we sought to identify the role of MMP9 in the recruitment of neutrophils into the respiratory tract after influenza virus infection. By increasing the infective dose, we were able to mimic many of the hallmarks of more virulent “pandemic” infections by virtue of inducing increased morbidity, inflammation, and lung pathology. High dose infection led to increased neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and airways, which contributed significantly to morbidity. We identified neutrophils as the predominant source of pulmonary MMP9. Importantly, MMP9 was functionally required for neutrophil migration into the lung in response to infection and for control of viral replication. Although MMP9 release from neutrophils was TLR-dependent, MyD88-mediated signals in non-hematopoietic cells, rather than intrinsic induction, were important for neutrophil recruitment by inducing the neutrophil chemoattractant CCL3. In addition, MyD88 signaling-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α contributed to MMP9 release from neutrophils. Our data demonstrate a previously unknown role of MMP9 to influenza virus pathogenesis by contributing to excessive neutrophil migration into the respiratory tract in response to TLR-induced chemotactic factors.</p>

        <title>Morbidity, inflammation, and neutrophil number are increased after infection with high dose influenza virus</title>
        <p>Infection of humans with virulent viruses is associated with high viral titers and increased inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-deJong1">[5]</xref>. To determine the effect of infective dose on cytokine/chemokine levels and cellular recruitment, mice were infected with different doses of Influenza virus A PR/8/34 (PR8): 125, 1250, or 12500 50% egg infectious doses (EID<sub>50</sub>). Morbidity, measured by weight loss, correlated with the infective dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice began losing weight as early as 3 days after infection with 12500 EID<sub>50</sub> and progressively lost more until they had to be sacrificed in accordance with animal welfare guidelines. Although delayed, mice receiving the intermediate dose (1250 EID<sub>50</sub>) lost weight, but recovered with the appearance of adaptive immunity. Depending on the infective dose, mice had increased cytokine/chemokine levels in the airways 6 days after infection as measured by multiplex analysis of the broncheo-alveolar lavage (BAL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ, interleukin (IL)-6 and TNFα, and the chemokines, CCL2 and CCL5, were highly upregulated in the respiratory tract after infection with 12500 EID<sub>50</sub>. The increased secretion of inflammatory mediators was associated with increased cellular infiltrates in the lung 6 days after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Whereas uninfected lungs had clear airspaces, cellular infiltrates and bronchoconstriction were observed after infection with 125 EID<sub>50</sub>. Increasing the dose tenfold resulted in complete obliteration of the normal lung architecture in many foci of infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>far right</italic>). The increased cellularity of the lung was in part made up by a substantial number of infiltrating neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Analysis of lung and BAL by flow cytometry demonstrated a significant increase in the number of Ly6G+ cells in both sites after infection with 12500 EID<sub>50</sub>. Other cell populations that increased after infection included macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells (data not shown). To address further neutrophil recruitment, we utilized LysM-GFP mice, which express enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the lysozyme M gene locus, as a reporter for neutrophil numbers in the blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Faust1">[15]</xref>. An increased percentage of circulating neutrophils (GFP<sup>hi</sup> side-scatter<sup>hi</sup>) could be detected as early as two days after infection, but only with the higher dose of virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Their percentage kept increasing until mice had to be sacrificed 6 days after infection. In contrast, neutrophil numbers in LysM-GFP mice infected with 125 EID<sub>50</sub> did not increase and were similar to uninfected control mice or those given allantoic fluid. Thus, by using a high dose of infectious virus, we established a model to induce severe inflammation and increased neutrophil accumulation in the respiratory tract.</p>

        <p>MMP9 can be produced in many cell types and to identify a potential candidate cell population, we transferred C57BL/6 or <italic>Mmp9</italic><sup>−/−</sup> bone marrow into wild-type recipients and allowed the mice to reconstitute for at least four weeks (tested by flow cytometry, data not shown). Mice were infected with 12500 EID<sub>50</sub> virus and MMP9 secretion was assessed in the airways (BAL) and lung parenchyma by ELISPOT 6 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Mice reconstituted with C57BL/6 bone marrow had significantly more MMP9-secreting cells in both the airways and lung.

        <p>To identify the cells that produce MMP9, we did extensive dual immunofluorescence analysis of lung tissues and found Ly6G+ colocalization with MMP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

        <title>Depletion of neutrophils during influenza virus infection abrogates MMP9 secretion</title>
        <p>Since neutrophil numbers were significantly increased following high dose infection and this population appeared to be the predominant source of MMP9 in the lung after infection, we sought to identify the direct function of MMP9 in this cell population. Ly6G is exclusively expressed on neutrophils and antibody treatment has been shown before to specifically deplete neutrophils only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Daley1">[17]</xref>. Treating C57BL/6 mice one day before infection and every two days thereafter with an antibody to Ly6G completely depleted Ly6G+ neutrophils as compared to the isotype control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002641-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

In order to distinguish the contribution of MyD88 signaling by immune cells versus non-hematopoietic cells, two bone marrow transfer approaches were used.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although implicated in a variety of pulmonary diseases, most notably asthma and tuberculosis, a detailed understanding of the involvement of gelatinases in lung disease pathology is lacking. In this study, we addressed the contribution of MMP9 during influenza virus pathogenesis, which had been implicated recently by virtue of increased concentrations in the serum of patients with influenza and elevated enzymatic activity in mouse lung homogenates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Ichiyama1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Wang2">[23]</xref>. However, the cellular origin and direct role of MMPs in the pathogenesis of influenza virus have not been previously examined. Thus, we focused on elucidating the effects of MMP9 in a pathological mouse model and identified neutrophils as the predominant pulmonary source of MMP9. We demonstrated that MMP9 mediated neutrophil migration into the infected respiratory tract and that it was required for viral clearance. Although MMP9 release was TLR signaling-dependent, MyD88-mediated signals in non-hematopoietic cells, rather than neutrophil TLRs themselves, were important for neutrophil recruitment. This is most likely due to MyD88-controlled induction of the known neutrophil chemoattractant, CCL3, as well as TNFα, which we found induced MMP9 secretion in neutrophils. Our data demonstrate a previously unknown role of MMP9 to influenza virus pathogenesis by contribution to excessive neutrophil migration into the respiratory tract.</p>
      <p>Using a model wherein a lethal dose of virus mimics many of the characteristics observed after pandemic infections, with greater cytokine/chemokine levels, lung pathology, and inflammatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-deJong1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Perrone1">[14]</xref>, we showed that MMP9 activity was upregulated in infected lungs, confirming data published recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Wang2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Narasaraju1">[24]</xref>. We extended these studies by demonstrating that MMP9 was exclusively produced by hematopoietic cells. It is surprising that non-hematopoietic cells did not contribute to MMP9 secretion, as it can be induced under inflammatory conditions in lung epithelial and endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Atkinson1">[25]</xref>. Nevertheless, our data further indicated that MMP9 was predominantly secreted in the lung by neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion caused a significant reduction in the number of cells being able to produce MMP9, but did not abrogate all MMP9 production, suggesting that other immune cells can also contribute. In a recent study, neutrophil depletion did not affect MMP9 levels in the BAL 5 days after sublethal influenza virus infection, which is at odds with our results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Narasaraju1">[24]</xref>. However, contributing factors to this discrepancy most likely involve the timing, which was later, and the infective dose, which was lower. Nevertheless, excessive neutrophil infiltration into the lung correlated with increased MMP9 production and viral replication when macrophages were depleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Narasaraju1">[24]</xref>, which supports our findings. However, the source of MMP9 was not identified. We are currently investigating the potential role of other cell populations that are capable of producing MMP9 under inflammatory conditions, such as lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Chakrabarti1">[13]</xref>. However, unlike these cells, neutrophils do not require <italic>de novo</italic> generation of MMP9 and instead are preloaded in the bone marrow and exocytose their granules following stimulation. In addition, they can synthesize and secrete cytokines and chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Borregaard1">[18]</xref>, although we were unable to demonstrate a significant contribution of this mechanism to airway inflammation, as depletion of neutrophils did not cause a significant difference in an extensive panel of potential candidates.</p>
      <p>While neutrophils are a major cell population recruited to the lung early in the immune response to pandemic influenza viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Perrone1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Tumpey1">[26]</xref>, their role during pathogenesis remains unclear. Depletion studies demonstrated enhanced susceptibility of mice to infection, exacerbated inflammation, and increased viral titers and mortality rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Narasaraju1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Tumpey1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Fujisawa1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Tate2">[28]</xref>, which suggested a critical contribution of neutrophils to innate immunity. In contrast, other studies parallel ours and show that neutrophils contribute to disease during severe influenza virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Crowe1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Sakai1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Seki1">[31]</xref>. The disparate results may be a consequence of differential infective doses and genetic background. Nevertheless, we show for the first time that MMP9 may contribute to pathogenesis by mediating excessive neutrophil migration into the respiratory tract in response to viral infection. While depletion of neutrophils reduced morbidity, MMP9 was still required for viral clearance. It is likely that the same mechanism(s) that contribute to immunity cause pathology in a more virulent setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-LaGruta1">[4]</xref>. Neutrophils are able to inhibit virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and the release of anti-viral molecules by neutrophils could contribute to viral clearance from the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Narasaraju1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Fujisawa1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Fujisawa2">[32]</xref>. However, the mechanisms that allow for neutrophil influx in response to uncontrolled or high viral load, such as MMP9 proteolytic activity, may exacerbate pathology due to collateral destruction of the lung ECM. This could explain the apparent contradicting reports on the role of neutrophils in viral infections and suggests that, while they contribute to viral clearance, excessive numbers contribute to pathology.</p>
      <p>We showed that MMP9 functions by regulating neutrophil localization to the respiratory tract. Cellular influx into the airways is a complex process whereby cells cross the endothelial cell layer, the basement membrane, and the epithelial cell layer. Although rolling and tethering on the endothelium has been described in detail, the means by which cells further progress through the basement membrane to reach the airways remain unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Borregaard2">[33]</xref>.

Chemokine-induced migration of neutrophils in an induced lung inflammation model was demonstrated to be independent of MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Betsuyaku1">[34]</xref>, whereas that in a dermal model did require MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-DHaese1">[35]</xref>. In part, this discrepancy may be due to the artificial nature of the experiments: while chemokines may be able to mimic inflammation and attract cells, crucial factors necessary for the release of MMP9 may not be available as they are not induced by the chemokine itself (see below). The presence of these required accessory molecules is assured in the influenza model, but at the same time can be difficult to define. Nevertheless, we were able to identify at least one, TNFα, which was able to induce MMP9. It is still of great interest to identify other factors during influenza virus infection as they have obvious clinical relevance. Thus, our data not only demonstrate a role for MMP9 in influenza pathogenesis, but also provide further <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for MMP9 activity as a mechanism by which neutrophils digest the extracellular matrix to traverse the basement membrane in order to gain access to the infected lung epithelium. The colocalization of MMP9 and viral antigen and its expression between the endothelium and areas of viral replication support this hypothesis. In addition to its role in mediating proteolytic cleavage of the basement membrane to allow for motility within the lung, MMP9 may also modulate chemokine expression itself by digesting CXCL-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Chakrabarti1">[13]</xref>. Our finding that CXCL-1, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, is significantly upregulated in the <italic>Mmp9</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice following infection hints at a negative feedback loop in which MMP9 release by neutrophils disrupts the CXCL-1 gradient and dampens further neutrophil recruitment in the absence of influenza virus.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that TLRs are important to induce MMP9 secretion from neutrophils. These innate pattern recognition receptors are expressed by neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Borregaard1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, viral RNA has been detected in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Zhao1">[36]</xref>, which could facilitate access to TLRs inside endosomes, such as TLR3 and TLR7, which have both been shown to be able to recognize influenza virus. Indeed, TLR7 signaling was demonstrated to be able to activate neutrophils in response to influenza virus, although this was dependent on GM-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Wang1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we examined the role of TLR signaling in neutrophil activation in <italic>Tlr3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. MyD88 is the adapter molecule for all known TLRs with the exception of TLR3, and the inclusion of both strains therefore encompassed all potential TLR-mediated effects. Although both neutrophil accumulation and MMP9 secretion were reduced following high dose influenza virus infection, our bone marrow chimera approach demonstrated that this was not a direct effect as <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils still migrated into the respiratory tract. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with influenza virus of neutrophils enriched from <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice did not affect MMP9 secretion (data not shown). Rather, <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> signaling in non-hematopoietic cells was important for neutrophil accumulation. When we examined chemokine levels in the airways of <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, CCL3, a known neutrophil chemoattractant, was downregulated. Thus, it appears that rather than a direct effect on MMP9 activation, ablation of MyD88 signaling may have affected the chemokine gradient that would normally attract the neutrophils to the sites of viral replication. In addition, TNFα induced the release of MMP9 from neutrophils and antibody blocking of TNFα prevented their recruitment into the lungs in response to influenza virus infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. TNFα has been demonstrated previously to induce MMP9 exocytosis in a protein kinase C-dependent fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002641-Chakrabarti2">[37]</xref> and we hypothesize that the reduced levels in the <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>−/−</sup> airways prevented MMP9 release and resulted in reduced neutrophil numbers.</p>
      <p>The role of neutrophils in viral infections has often been overlooked, on the pretext that they are mostly involved in the clearance of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Their contribution to influenza virus-induced pathology is unclear, but we showed in our pathological model that they contributed to morbidity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mechanism for neutrophil-mediated migration to the respiratory tract in response to influenza required MMP9 and depended on extrinsic TLR-signaling. Collectively, our results suggest that innate sensing of viral infection results in a MyD88-dependent induction of chemotactic factors that induce the recruitment of neutrophils. Following diapedesis into the lung parenchyma, MyD88-induced TNFα in non-hematopoietic cells induces MMP9 release in neutrophils and MMP9 enzymatic activity is utilized by these cells to degrade the basement membrane and facilitate their motility within the lung. These novel findings are probably not restricted to influenza pathogenesis, but may also have implications for other viral infections. The dichotomy of the necessity for MMP9-mediated immune cell migration and its role in immunopathology provides real challenges for targeting MMP9 for therapeutic purposes after influenza virus infection. Nevertheless, finding the balance to modulate neutrophils allows for innate immunity to pandemic strains to be boosted whilst preventing potential pathology.</p>
