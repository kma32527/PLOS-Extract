        <p>CLEC5A/MDL-1, a member of the myeloid C-type lectin family expressed on macrophages and neutrophils, is critical for dengue virus (DV)-induced hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome in <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and ConA-treated wild type mice. However, whether CLEC5A is involved in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis has not yet been investigated. To investigate the role of CLEC5A to regulate JEV-induced neuroinflammation, antagonistic anti-CLEC5A mAb and CLEC5A-deficient mice were generated. We find that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) directly interacts with CLEC5A and induces DAP12 phosphorylation in macrophages. In addition, JEV activates macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are dramatically reduced in JEV-infected <italic>Clec5a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages. Although blockade of CLEC5A cannot inhibit JEV infection of neurons and astrocytes, anti-CLEC5A mAb inhibits JEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine release from microglia and prevents bystander damage to neuronal cells. Moreover, JEV causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) disintegrity and lethality in STAT1-deficient (<italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) mice, whereas peripheral administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb reduces infiltration of virus-harboring leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS), restores BBB integrity, attenuates neuroinflammation, and protects mice from JEV-induced lethality. Moreover, all surviving mice develop protective humoral and cellular immunity against JEV infection. These observations demonstrate the critical role of CLEC5A in the pathogenesis of Japanese encephalitis, and identify CLEC5A as a target for the development of new treatments to reduce virus-induced brain damage.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the most common forms of viral encephalitis worldwide, and the common complication post viral encephalitis is permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae resulting from severe neuroinflammation. However, specific treatment to inhibit JEV-induced neuroinflammation is not available. We found that JEV interacts directly with CLEC5A, a C-type lectin expressed on the myeloid cell surface. This observation led to two major findings; first, we demonstrate that JEV activates macrophages and microglia via CLEC5A, and blockade of CLEC5A reduces bystander neuronal damage and JEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion from macrophages and microglia. Second, peripheral administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb does not only inhibit JEV-induced BBB permeability, but also reduces the numbers of activated microglia and cell infiltration into the CNS. The attenuation of neuronal damage and reduced viral load correlate with the suppression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, and MCP-1 in the CNS. Our studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of neuroinflammation, and reveal a possible strategy to control neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus includes the mosquito-borne dengue, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Mukhopadhyay1">[1]</xref>, infections of which can result in clinical syndromes such as hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. There are four serotypes of dengue virus (DV), which can give rise to severe hemorrhagic syndrome (dengue hemorrhagic fever/DHF) and capillary leakage induced-hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome/DSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-WilderSmith1">[2]</xref>. On the other hand, the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serological group, which includes West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus, is a major contributor to the occurrence of viral encephalitis worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Weaver1">[3]</xref>, with 50,000 new cases and 15,000 deaths per annum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Hollidge1">[4]</xref>. JEV is the most prevalent cause of encephalitis and although both inactivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Hoke1">[5]</xref> and live-attenuated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Xin1">[6]</xref> JEV vaccines have been used in Asia for decades, these are not completely effective against all the clinical isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Ku1">[7]</xref>, and there are still ∼35,000 reported cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) resulting in 10,000 deaths each year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Olsen1">[8]</xref>. Unlike DHF and DSS, JE victims experience permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae, including persistent motor defects and severe cognitive and language impairments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Mackenzie1">[9]</xref>. However, the molecular pathogenesis of JEV infection is still unclear.</p>
      <p>JEV-specific infiltrating T lymphocytes and JEV-neutralizing IgM and IgG are believed to play major roles in the recovery and clearance of the virus, while microglia were shown to secret massive amounts of cytokines following JEV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Ghosh1">[10]</xref>. While JEV infects and kills neuron directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen1">[11]</xref>, viral replication within microglia/glia leads indirect neuronal killing via secretion of cytokines (such as TNF-α) and soluble mediators to cause neuronal death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen1">[11]</xref>. One of the key factors in indirect neuronal cell death during JE is the uncontrolled overactivation of microglia cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Ghoshal1">[12]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism of JEV-induced microglia activation is unclear, thus we are interested to identify the key molecule to regulate JEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine release from microglia. This information may help in the development of specific treatments for JEV-induced neuroinflammation.</p>
      <p>CLEC5A (also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Bakker1">[13]</xref>) contains a C-type lectin-like fold similar to the natural-killer T-cell C-type lectin domains, and associates with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Lanier1">[14]</xref> on myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, but not monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Moreover, we have shown dengue virus (DV) can bind and activate CLEC5A and induce the phosphorylation of DAP12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref>, which is responsible for CLEC5A/MDL-1-mediated signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Bakker1">[13]</xref>. Unlike conventional C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), such as DC-SIGN/CLEC4L, DC-SIGNR/CLEC4M, and mannose receptor/CLEC13D/CD206 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Miller1">[16]</xref>, which are all involved in dengue virus (DV) entry into target cells, CLEC5A regulates virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine release from macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref>. In addition, blockade of CLEC5A can prevent autoimmune inflammation in collagen-induced arthritis via downregulating osteoclast activation, suppressing cell infiltration of joints, and attenuating proinflammatory cytokine release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-JoyceShaikh1">[17]</xref>. These observations indicate that CLEC5A is a critical molecule to regulate inflammatory reactions triggered by pathogens and autoantigens. We thereby went on to determine whether CLEC5A is involved in JEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine release from microglia and bystander neuronal damage. Here, we demonstrate that JEV infects and replicates in peripheral macrophages and microglia. Moreover, blockade of CLEC5A dramatically reduces bystander neuronal damage and JEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion from macrophages and microglia. Furthermore, peripheral administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb attenuates neuronal cell death, inhibits JEV-bearing infiltrating cells into CNS, and restores the expression of tight junction proteins and BBB integrity. These results suggest that CLEC5A is a promising therapeutic target to control neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis.</p>

        <title>JEV activates macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines via CLEC5A</title>
        <p>Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using cDNA templates from the human microglial cell line CHME3, macrophage-like cell line U937, and CD14<sup>+</sup>-derived macrophages (MoM) revealed the presence of a dominant transcript (CLEC5A) and an alternatively spliced variant (CLEC5A_S) lacking 23 amino acid (aa) residues within the stalk region of CLEC5A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s001">Figure S1A &amp; S1B</xref>). Similarly, murine CLEC5A_S (mCLEC5A_S) lacks 25 aa from the corresponding region of murine CLEC5A (mCLEC5A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Aoki1">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>ELISA showed that human CLEC5A and mCLEC5A, but not the alternatively spliced variants or structurally related members of the CLEC family, are able to interact with JEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The differential abilities of CLEC5A and CLEC5A_S to bind JEV were further confirmed by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This observation demonstrates that the stalk region of CLEC5A plays a critical role in binding to JEV. Incubation of macrophages with JEV was shown to induce the phosphorylation of DAP12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s001">Figure S1D</xref>), a CLEC5A-associated adaptor protein with an ITAM motif contributing to signal transduction. While UV-inactivated JEV-induced DAP12 phosphorylation lasted for only 2 h, DAP12 phosphorylation was detectable for at least 24 h following infection with live JEV, indicating DAP12 phosphorylation is enhanced by JEV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to live JEV, UV-inactivated JEV only induced transient DAP12 phosphorylation and low amounts (less than 50 pg/ml) of TNF-α and IL-6 secretion (data not shown). This indicates that virus particles released from JEV-infected macrophages can continually activate DAP12 and induce cytokine release. Furthermore, knockdown of CLEC5A using the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) pLL3.7/CLEC5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref> abolished DAP12 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s001">Figure S1E</xref>), suggesting that JEV-triggered DAP12 phosphorylation is mediated via CLEC5A.</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Interaction of JEV with human and murine CLEC5A.Fc fusion proteins was determined by ELISA. Anti-E Ab is a positive control to confirm the capture of JEV particles; HuIgG1: human IgG1. Data are expressed as means ± s.e.m. for three independent experiments; two-tailed Student's t-tests were performed. (<bold>B</bold>) The kinetics of DAP12 phosphorylation induced by JEV (m.o.i. = 2) and ultraviolet-inactivated JEV (UV-JEV) in human macrophages were determined by western blotting (h.p.i., hours post infection). The intensities of pDAP12 bands were quantified with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) and its relative intensity to that of the band of respective corresponding DAP12 and are shown under each picture.

        <p>We further investigated whether JEV could also infect and activate human CD14<sup>+</sup>-monocyte derived macrophages (MoM).

Moreover, JEV activates MoM to secret proinflammatory cytokines, and anti-CLEC5A mAb blocked the release of TNF-α and MCP-1 but not IFN-α, from JEV-infected MoM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s002">Figure S2B&amp;S2C</xref>).

        <p>Due to the resistance of wild type mice to JEV infection, previous studies in relation to JEV-induced brain damage have utilized intracranial (i.c.) injection of JEV to deliver virus directly to the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-German1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Liang1">[22]</xref>. However, this approach causes mechanical damage to the BBB and thus cannot be used to address the mechanisms of JEV-induced changes in BBB permeability and the associated entry of virus into the CNS. Since <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are sensitive to JEV infection even without i.c. puncture, and are able to develop protective immunity after JEV challenge, these animals provide a useful model to test the protective effects of vaccines against JEV and other pathogens which are unable to infect wild type mice. We set up microglia (95% purity) and mixed glial cell (approximately 85% astrocytes and 10% microglia) cultures from <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice to assess the potential involvement of CLEC5A in regulating cerebral inflammation and neuronal death after JEV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Immuno-staining with a mAb to JEV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) showed that ∼30% of mixed glial cells and ∼10% of microglia were infected with JEV. However, anti-CLEC5A mAb was unable to inhibit either NS3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) or virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that CLEC5A was not involved in JEV entry into these cells.</p>
        <p>It has been reported that both JEV-infected astrocytes and microglia release multiple bio-active factors, thereby giving rise to secondary glial activation and neuronal injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Ghoshal1">[12]</xref>. We therefore investigated the release of proinflammatory cytokines from JEV-infected neurons, mixed glia and microglia cultures. Cells were preincubated with anti-CLEC5A mAb for 1 h, followed by incubation with JEV at 37°C for 1 h, and supernatants were harvested to determine cytokine release at 24 h post-infection. We found that TNF-α and MCP-1 were produced primarily by microglia, and abundant IL-6 was released by JEV-infected mixed glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), while JEV-infected neurons only released trace amount of these cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This observation is in accord with a previous report that JEV-infected astrocytes produce IL-6, but not TNF-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen1">[11]</xref>. In our study, pre-incubation with the anti-CLEC5A mAb mediated significant reductions in cytokine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2E</xref>); we therefore investigated whether anti-CLEC5A mAb could prevent neuronal death during JEV infection. Direct incubation of neurons with JEV caused 40% cell damage (live cell count reduced from 171±23 to 93±27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), while UV-irradiated conditioned media (in the absence of anti-CLEC5A mAb) from JEV-infected mixed glia (UV-JEVCM; from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) caused 80% cell damage (from 162±19 to 27±7 live cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). This indicated that soluble mediators released from JEV-infected mixed glia are more toxic than JEV per se to neurons. In addition, anti-CLEC5A mAb protected approximately 50% of neurons from UV-JEVCM-induced cell damage (from 162±19 to 76±12 live cells), but was ineffective in protecting neurons from direct JEV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that TNF-α released by microglia plays a critical role in JEV-associated neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen1">[11]</xref>, while MCP-1 secreted by microglia can recruit inflammatory cells to cause neuronal damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Ghoshal1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the anti-CLEC5A mAb-mediated protective effect may occur via blocking the release of TNF-α, MCP-1, and other yet-defined bio-active factors from JEV-infected mixed glial cells and microglia.</p>

Thus <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were used as an <italic>in vivo</italic> model system to test whether anti-CLEC5A mAb could maintain BBB integrity, which is known to be damaged by virus-induced neuroinflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Andersson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Mishra1">[24]</xref>. Changes in BBB integrity over time following JEV challenge, as revealed by <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA brain SPECT/CT imaging, showed that JEV infection gave rise to increased BBB permeability from day 3 to day 7 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3A&amp;B</xref>). This effect was reduced (during day 3 to day 5) and normal BBB permeability was restored on day 7 in response to treatment with anti-CLEC5A mAb. The integrity of the BBB after anti-CLEC5A mAb treatment on day 7 was further confirmed by the Evans blue assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Since tight junctions are critical in the regulation of BBB permeability, and their disruption is a hallmark of CNS abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Huber1">[25]</xref>, we measured the expression of tight junction proteins (such as ZO-1, Occludin and Claudins) and of adhesion molecules (such as JAM-1 and ICAM-1) known to be important for recruitment of inflammatory cells. In JEV-infected mice (treated with isotype mAb), the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1, and Claudin-5 was downregulated, while the expression of ICAM-1 was upregulated. However, the expression of junctional adhesion molecule (JAM-1) was not changed after JEV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, anti-CLEC5A mAb restored the expression of tight junction proteins and suppressed JEV-induced upregulation ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, the increased BBB permeability in JEV-infected mice was accompanied by perivascular cuffing, while anti-CLEC5A mAb reduced the numbers of infiltrating foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This demonstrates that peripheral administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb is able to restore BBB integrity to prevent cell infiltration.</p>

While JEV infection increased the numbers of MNCs in brain (from 0.8–1×10<sup>4</sup> to 1–2×10<sup>5</sup>/brain), anti-CLEC5A mAb reduced the numbers of MNCs (2–3×10<sup>4</sup>/brain) and NS3-bearing infiltrating myeloid cells (R1) and microglia (R2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). To further confirm the replication of JEV in R1 and R2 populations, reverse-transcription PCR was used to quantitate the JEV copy numbers in each population after sorting by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, inflammatory myeloid cells (R1) bear higher copies of viral RNA than resident microglia (R2). This result suggests that anti-CLEC5A mAb is able to reduce neuroinflammation by suppressing the infiltration of JEV-positive myeloid inflammatory cells into CNS.</p>

        <title>Blockade of CLEC5A prevents JEV-induced lethality and allows development of adaptive immunity against JEV</title>
        <p>Investigation of the ability of anti-CLEC5A mAb to protect <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice from JEV-induced lethality revealed that 50% of <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice that succumbed to JEV infection died in the early stages (6 days post infection), and all the mice died within 9 days post infection. In contrast, administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb from day 0 (150 µg/mouse on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8) protected mice from early lethality (80% survival), and ∼50% mice survived for at least 16 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We went on to determine whether administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb inhibited adaptive immunity against JEV. All the mice that survived JEV-induced lethality were found to have sero-conversion from day 12 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that suppression of JEV-induced inflammation by anti-CLEC5A mAb did not prevent development of humoral immunity against the virus. This was further confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT), where serum from surviving mice efficiently neutralized JEV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, the proinflammatory cytokine levels at day 7–9 post infection were much lower in the sera of asymptomatic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). These mice also exhibited JEV-specific T-cell responses; high levels of IFN-<bold>γ</bold> were released from JEV-challenged splenocytes, while IFN-<bold>γ</bold> was almost undetectable in cells from uninfected mice under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). It is interesting to note that virus was cleared from the spleen and CNS at day 21 post infection in surviving mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), suggesting that the host can eradicate JEV after anti-CLEC5A mAb treatment. Thus, blockade of CLEC5A can suppress proinflammatory reactions without interfering with the development of anti-JEV immunity, making CLEC5A a promising target for the treatment of flaviviral infections in the future.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There is growing evidence that microglial cell activation contributes to neuronal damage and neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Block1">[32]</xref>. Following pathogen invasion, these cells play a role in the clearance of cell debris from damaged tissue, but also secret inflammatory cytokines, which are key mediators of the neurodegeneration associated with both acute and chronic CNS pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Allan1">[33]</xref>. Our observation that blockade of CLEC5A on microglia attenuates the neuronal damage caused by the supernatants from mixed glia culture in vitro further demonstrates the contribution of microglia to JEV-induced neuronal death. Moreover, peripheral administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb was found to preserve BBB integrity, inhibit cellular infiltration into the brain, and reduce neuronal death <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may be attributed the fact that the anti-CLEC5A mAb can enter the CNS when the permeability of BBB is increased during the acute stage of infection, where intracranial anti-CLEC5A mAb can inhibit microglia activation and attenuate neuroinflammation.</p>
      <p>Although JEV can directly infect neurons and cause cell damage, the soluble mediators from CLEC5A<sup>+</sup>-activated microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells seem to be the major cause of neuron damage (bystander neuronal damage), since the inhibition of JEV-induced neuroinflammation by anti-CLEC5A mAb does not arise from interactions with cells, such as astrocytes and gangliocytes in the CNS, or from prevention of neuron damage caused by direct JEV infection. Even though anti-CLEC5A mAb has relatively mild inhibitory effects on cytokine release in JEV-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g002">Figure 2</xref>), it can inhibit the permeability change of BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3</xref>), reduce cell infiltration into the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g003">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g004">4</xref>) and protect mice from JEV-induced lethality. This may due to the blocking effect of anti-CLEC5A mAb to inhibit the release of yet-discovered soluble mediators which are critical to control BBB permeability and neuronal death. The alternative is that anti-CLEC5A mAb can inhibit the infiltration of CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> MNCs which are pathogenic to CNS, thus suppressing neuronal inflammation and reducing lethality. The possibility of a direct effect on MNCs is supported by the observation that DV can activate CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> immature myeloid cells to induce shock in ConA-treated mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Cheung1">[28]</xref>. Finally, anti-CLEC5A mAb may block the interaction of CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> cells with endogenous ligands to reduce neuroinflammation. It has been shown that CLEC5A is critical for collagen-induced autoimmune arthritis (CIA), and CLEC5A-deficient mice are resistant to CIA. This observation suggests that the yet-characterized CLEC5A endogenous ligand(s) is (are) able to activate CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> cells to induce inflammatory reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-JoyceShaikh1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, the peripheral administration of anti-CLEC5A mAb may inhibit JEV-induced inflammation via blocking multiple pathways.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that anti-CLEC5A mAb is able to inhibit the secretion of IL-18, which is one of the key factors responsible for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-FelderhoffMueser1">[29]</xref>. IL-18 enhances caspase-1 expression and induces the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Abraham1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Wheeler1">[35]</xref>. Upregulation of IL-18 was detected in the sera and CNS of JEV-infected mice, thus the potent protective effects of anti-CLEC5A mAb in JEV-induced neuroinflammation can be attributed, at least in part, to inhibition of IL-18 secretion in the periphery and in the CNS; i.e., CLEC5A is a critical to regulator of neuroinflammation during JEV infection.</p>
      <p>After anti-CLEC5A mAb treatment, approximately 50% of JEV-infected <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice became asymptomatic and survived for at least 21 days post infection, while the others remained weak and died gradually within 12 days. While the titers of the neutralizing antibody were similar in the weak and asymptomatic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), the proinflammatory cytokine levels at 7–9 days post infection were much lower in the sera of asymptomatic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). This indicates that JEV-induced neuroinflammation is the key parameter in predicting the outcome of JEV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Winter1">[19]</xref>, and that effective suppression of neuroinflammation in the acute stage is critical to increasing survival and preventing neurological sequelae. This observation also suggests that administration of anti-JEV antiserum to patients during the acute stage of infection may be futile, and this argument is supported by the observation that injection of a neutralizing cross-reactive mAb against JEV E protein causes early death in JEV-infected mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Gupta1">[36]</xref>. Even though the direct relevance of this <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse model in relation to human infection with JEV needs to be further confirmed, data for in vivo protection of CLEC5A mAbs still shed light on its therapeutic potential for blocking neuroinflammation.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that CLEC5A can interact with all the four serotypes of DV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Watson1">[37]</xref>, and here we have demonstrated that CLEC5A also interacts with JEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002655-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), but not with other viruses such as influenza virus and EV-71 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In addition, anti-CLEC5A mAb can inhibit inflammatory reactions in human macrophages in response to the structurally related West Nile virus (WNV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Thus, CLEC5A may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of all the flaviviral infections.</p>
      <p>This study has clearly demonstrated that infiltration of inflammatory cells into CNS correlates with increased BBB permeability, suggesting that BBB integrity has a critical role in limiting JEV-induced CNS inflammation. CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells appear to be essential for JEV-induced inflammation of the CNS and neurological sequelae, and anti-CLEC5A mAb efficiently suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines from microglia and macrophages, restored BBB integrity and increased survival after JEV infection in mice. The critical role of CLEC5A in JEV infection was further confirmed by using <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>Clec5a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which are resistant to JEV challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Together with our previous observations that anti-CLEC5A mAb is able to prevent DV-induced systemic vascular permeability and protect mice against DV-induced lethal diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref>_ENREF_5, the data presented here indicate that CLEC5A plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of flaviviral infections via regulating vascular permeability and suppressing myeloid cell activation.</p>
      <p>Like most members of C-type lectin, their exogenous and endogenous ligands are not identified yet. Since crystal structure of CLEC5A reveals that CLEC5A forms homodimer on cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Watson1">[37]</xref>, thus the binding of JEV to CLEC5A.Fc may similar to JEV to CLEC5A on cell surface, though cells may also expressed other C-type lectin to increase binding affinity. Recently, we have developed an innate immunity receptor-based ELISA (IIR-EIA) to determine the polysaccharide profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Hsu1">[38]</xref> and dengue receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref> based on C-type lectin.Fc fusion proteins, thus the identification of CLEC5A as a JEV recognition receptor further suggests that IIR-EIA is an useful tool to identify lectin ligands in the future.</p>

After centrifugation the buffy coat, containing leukocytes (PBMC) and platelets, was further washed with PBS, and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells were purified using the VarioMACS technique with anti-CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). Cells were then cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml human M-CSF (R&amp;D Systems) for 6 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002655-Chen2">[15]</xref>. For preparation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs and tibias and cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10 ng /ml of recombinant mouse M-CSF (R&amp;D Systems) for 6–8 days. At day 7, the expression of F4/80 (murine macrophage marker) was examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting; &gt;90% of cells were F4/80<sup>+</sup> under these culture conditions.</p>

After centrifugation at 200×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, cells were plated on poly-L-lysine coated (20 µg/ml) dishes. For cortical neuron cultures, cells were plated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 10% (v/v) horse serum. One day after seeding, the culture medium was replaced with neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, followed by addition of cytosine arabinoside (10 µM) on the third and fourth days to inhibit non-neuronal cell division <italic>in vitro</italic>. The neuron cultures were used for subsequent experiments after 10–12 days. For mixed glia culture, cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS; medium was replenished 4 days after plating and changed every 3 days. Cells usually reached confluence within 12–14 days after plating. For microglia cultures, the confluent mixed glial cells were incubated with mild trypsin solution (0.25% (w/v) trypsin, 1 mM EDTA) diluted 1∶4 in DMEM/F12 for 30 min at 37°C to detach the upper layer of astrocytes; 10% (v/v) FCS-containing DMEM/F12 medium was then added to inactivate trypsin and the detached astrocytes were aspirated from the mixed glia cultures. The remaining cells (i.e., microglia) were harvested by incubation with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin solution with vigorous pipetting for 5 min and then were resuspended in DMEM-F12 with 10% (v/v) FCS for at least 2 weeks. Cell identity was determined by immunocytochemical staining using antibodies against tubulin β III isoform, (TU20; Millipore) for neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Cell Signaling) for astrocytes, and F4/80 for microglia (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mixed glial cultures contained ∼85% astrocytes and ∼10% microglia. Neurons and microglia were &gt;95% pure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002655.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

        <p>Breeder mice (BALB/c strain) were maintained in the standard animal facility of the National Yang-Ming University. For the production of mAbs, mice were immunized with purified recombinant CLEC5A.Fc fusion protein (five doses of 50 µg per mouse). Lymphocytes from the spleens of immunized mice were fused with mouse myeloma NS-1 cells in the presence of 50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG1450; Sigma). Fused cells were cultured in HAT selection medium and the medium was refreshed after one week. About 2 weeks after fusion, culture supernatants were screened by ELISA to identify the candidate clones for further analysis by limiting dilution. Anti-CLEC5A mAbs were selected by ELISA-based differential screening, and only those recognizing recombinant CLEC5A.Fc, but not human IgG1, were regarded as positive clones. A similar strategy was used to generate anti-murine (m) CLEC5A mAbs. To select antagonistic mAbs against human CLEC5A and murine CLEC5A, mAbs were incubated with human macrophages and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (<italic>Stat1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>), respectively, in 96-well plates (6×10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) for 30 min at 37°C, before the addition of JEV (m.o.i. = 5) and incubation at 37°C for 2 h.
