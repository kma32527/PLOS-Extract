        <p>Nlrp1b is a NOD-like receptor that detects the catalytic activity of anthrax lethal toxin and subsequently co-oligomerizes into a pro-caspase-1 activation platform known as an inflammasome. Nlrp1b has two domains that promote oligomerization: a NACHT domain, which is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, and a poorly characterized Function to Find Domain (FIIND). Here we demonstrate that proteolytic processing within the FIIND generates N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage products of Nlrp1b that remain associated in both the auto-inhibited state and in the activated state after cells have been treated with lethal toxin. Functional significance of cleavage was suggested by the finding that mutations that block processing of Nlrp1b also prevent the ability of Nlrp1b to activate pro-caspase-1. By using an uncleaved mutant of Nlrp1b, we established the importance of cleavage by inserting a heterologous TEV protease site into the FIIND and demonstrating that TEV protease processed this site and induced inflammasome activity. Proteolysis of Nlrp1b was shown to be required for the assembly of a functional inflammasome: a mutation within the FIIND that abolished cleavage had no effect on self-association of a FIIND-CARD fragment, but did reduce the recruitment of pro-caspase-1. Our work indicates that a post-translational modification enables Nlrp1b to function.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that respond to signals derived from microbial pathogens or damaged tissue. The function of an inflammasome is to activate pro-caspase-1, a protease that contributes to the inflammatory response by generating the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. A common feature of inflammasomes is their ability to cluster multiple copies of pro-caspase-1 in a manner that allows inter-molecular auto-proteolysis. The Nlrp1b inflammasome assembles in response to anthrax lethal toxin by using two oligomerization regions: the NACHT domain and the FIIND-CARD region. Here, we demonstrate that the FIIND is proteolytically cleaved, but that the two fragments of Nlrp1b generated from the cleavage remain associated with one another. Cleavage within the FIIND is functionally important, however, because mutants of Nlrp1b that are not cleaved are not able to activate pro-caspase-1. Furthermore, we were able to control cleavage by inserting a heterologous protease site into Nlrp1b, which allowed us to establish that processing of Nlrp1b is required for its activity. Finally, we provide evidence that processing of Nlrp1b facilitates the recruitment of pro-caspase-1. Our work identifies a novel mechanism by which the Nlrp1b inflammasome may be regulated.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that facilitate the activation of pro-caspase-1 in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) or endogenous danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPS). A common feature of inflammasomes is that they recruit multiple copies of pro-caspase-1, which allows auto-proteolytic processing to generate active caspase-1 that cleaves downstream targets including pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. There are distinct mechanisms by which inflammasomes are thought to cluster molecules of pro-caspase-1. AIM2 has a HIN domain that binds cytosolic DNA derived from viruses or intracellular bacterial pathogens; it is the binding of several molecules of AIM2 to the same fragment of cytosolic DNA that leads to the grouping of pro-caspase-1 via the ASC adaptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-FernandesAlnemri1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Roberts1">[3]</xref>. In contrast, NLRP3 and NLRC4 each have a NACHT domain that self-associates to assemble a pro-caspase-1 activation platform after their respective triggers release auto-inhibitory intra-molecular interactions. Formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been proposed to occur in response to lysosomal permeabilization or reactive oxygen species generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Halle1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Tschopp1">[6]</xref>, although recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species may serve only to induce the expression of NLRP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Bauernfeind1">[7]</xref>. The NLRC4 inflammasome detects bacterial flagellin and secretion system components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Kofoed1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Zhao1">[9]</xref>. Human NLRP1 and the murine homolog, Nlrp1b, have NACHT domains as well as a Function to Find Domain (FIIND) that facilitate self-association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Martinon1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Liao1">[11]</xref>. Nlrp1b indirectly senses the proteolytic activity of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) and there is some evidence that NLRP1 may detect peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Faustin1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Averette1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>LeTx is comprised of a protease, lethal factor (LF), and a second component, protective antigen (PA), which binds mammalian cells and translocates LF to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Young1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Thoren1">[18]</xref>. The proteolysis of multiple members of the MAPKK family by LF results in downregulation of the ERK, p38 and JNK signaling pathways. Interference of these pathways explains many of the pathogenic effects of LeTx, such as the inhibition of cytokine expression and chemotaxis, but there is no clear link between inactivation of these targets and activation of the Nlrp1b inflammasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Moayeri1">[19]</xref>. Activation of Nlrp1b by LeTx causes macrophages to undergo a form of caspase-1 dependent cell death known as pyroptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Fink1">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, induction of pyroptosis in macrophages promotes the survival of mice infected with <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> by initiating IL-1β signaling and neutrophil recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Terra1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Moayeri2">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There are five alleles of Nlrp1b. Murine macrophages that express either allele 1 or 5 are susceptible to LeTx-mediated pyroptosis, but those that express allele 2, 3, or 4 are resistant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Boyden1">[13]</xref>. The alleles are highly polymorphic: amino acid differences are found within the NACHT domain, the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain, the FIIND, the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), as well as inter-domain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although there has been little work done to examine the differences between the alleles, we previously developed a reconstituted cell-based system and confirmed that LeTx activated Nlrp1b allele 1 (Nlrp1b1, AAZ40509.1), but not Nlrp1b allele 3 (Nlrp1b3, AAZ40520.1) – there is a functional difference(s) between these proteins because they were expressed at similar levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Liao1">[11]</xref>. We also noted in immunoblots that expression of Nlrp1b1 yielded two products, which could be interpreted as a cleavage event occurring within the protein, whereas Nlrp1b3 yielded only one product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Liao1">[11]</xref>. Recently, the human FIIND has been demonstrated to undergo autoproteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-DOsualdo1">[23]</xref>. D'Osualdo and colleagues detected sequence similarity between the FIIND and the ZU5-UPA domain found in the autoproteolytic protein PIDD, which is activated by DNA damage. In both NLRP1 and PIDD, it is thought that a catalytic serine attacks a strained segment of the polypeptide backbone to generate two protein fragments that remain associated. Autoproteolysis of PIDD affects downstream signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Tinel1">[24]</xref>, but the consequence of NLRP1 autoproteolysis is not known.</p>

      <p>Here, we have studied the FIIND of Nlrp1b. We made a series of truncation mutants to identify the minimal region of the FIIND that can drive oligomerization of the CARD domain and activation of pro-caspase-1. A multiple alanine substitution mutant of this Nlrp1b1 fragment impaired self-association and pro-caspase-1 activation. The same mutation abolished function of full-length Nlrp1b1 and prevented cleavage within the FIIND, so we hypothesized that cleavage of Nlrp1b is required for its function. Comparison of the Nrlp1b1 and Nlrp1b3 sequences allowed us to identify a single amino acid that determines the difference in their susceptibilities to cleavage. We demonstrated that cleavage is required for activity by introducing a heterologous TEV protease site into a cleavage-deficient mutant of Nlrp1b1 and showing that activation required co-expression of TEV protease. Finally, we provide evidence that cleavage of Nlrp1b1 does not facilitate its self-association, but does enhance the recruitment of pro-caspase-1.</p>

        <title>Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> self-associates and activates pro-caspase-1</title>
        <p>Previous work demonstrated that Nlrp1b1<sub>1086–1233</sub> activates pro-caspase-1 in the absence of LeTx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Liao1">[11]</xref>. To identify the smallest constitutively active fragment of Nlrp1b1, we tested various Nlrp1b1 truncation mutants for their potential to activate pro-caspase-1 by reconstituting the Nlrp1b1 inflammasome in HT1080 fibroblasts. Various Nlrp1b1 truncation mutants were transfected into HT1080 cells along with pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β and then the supernatants were probed for HA-tagged IL-1β by immunoblotting. In agreement with previous findings, IL-1β was detected in supernatants of cells expressing Nlrp1b1<sub>1086–1233</sub>, which contains part of the FIIND plus the CARD domain, but not the CARD domain alone, Nlrp1b1<sub>1142–1233</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> induced IL-1β secretion, whereas Nlrp1b1<sub>1102–1233</sub> exhibited little activity. These results indicate, therefore, that Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> is the smallest fragment of Nlrp1b1 that can optimally activate pro-caspase-1.</p>

        <p>We next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to test self-association of the Nlrp1b1 truncation mutants. HT1080 cells were transfected with His<sub>6</sub>-Nlrp1b1-HA and His<sub>6</sub>-Nlrp1b1-T7 vectors containing the truncation mutants Nlrp1b1<sub>1086–1233</sub>, Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub>, Nlrp1b1<sub>1102–1233</sub> and Nlrp1b1<sub>1142–1233</sub>. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and associated T7-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Nlrp1b1<sub>1086–1233</sub> and Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> self-associated, but Nlrp1b1<sub>1102–1233</sub> and Nlrp1b1<sub>1142–1233</sub> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

        <title>A multiple substitution mutation impairs Nlrp1b1 cleavage and activity</title>
        <p>We next substituted residues <sub>1100</sub>EIKLQIK<sub>1106</sub> to alanine in Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> and found that this mutant, Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub>-7A, was impaired in its ability to self-associate and activate pro-caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). The mutation did not, however, affect binding of catalytically inactive pro-caspase-1-C284A, which demonstrates that Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub>-7A was not grossly misfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> and Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub>-7A bound pro-caspase-1-C284A, whereas the CARD domain alone (Nlrp1b1<sub>1142-123</sub>) did not, indicating that a region N-terminal to the CARD domain facilitates the recruitment of pro-caspase-1. The multiple alanine substitution mutation was also introduced into full-length Nlrp1b1; Nlrp1b1-7A was not able to active pro-caspase-1 in response to LeTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, Nlrp1b1-7A appeared as a single band in an immunoblot in contrast to the two bands that are observed upon expression of wild-type Nlrp1b1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest a relationship between self-association of the FIIND, cleavage of the FIIND, and activation of pro-caspase-1.</p>

        <title>Endogenous Nlrp1b1 is cleaved in murine macrophages</title>
        <p>We sought to determine if endogenous Nlrp1b1 is proteolytically processed. First, we knocked down Nlrp1b1 in the murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 and assayed for cell death in response to LeTx. J774A.1 cells that were stably expressing Nlrp1b1 shRNA showed considerable protection from LeTx-induced cell death compared to cells expressing control shRNA, indicating that the knockdown was functionally effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We next probed these lysates with an antibody raised against the N-terminus of Nlrp1b1. Although the Nlrp1b1 antibody detects several proteins non-specifically, comparing lysates made from J774A.1 cells stably expressing either control shRNA or Nlrp1b shRNA demonstrated that the knockdown of Nlrp1b1 led to the disappearance of two bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These bands had slightly lower molecular weights than the bands corresponding to transfected TAP-tagged Nlrp1b1, which is predicted to be 8 kDa larger than endogenous Nlrp1b1. That the difference in molecular weight is similar between the two endogenous bands and the two TAP-tagged bands suggests that endogenous Nlrp1b1 is cleaved at the same location as transfected Nlrp1b1.</p>

        <title>Cleavage of Nlrp1b1 occurs in the FIIND</title>
        <p>Because the TAP tag antibody and the Nlrp1b antibody both detect epitopes at the N-terminus of Nlrp1b, the two bands observed on the immunoblots likely correspond to full-length Nlrp1b1 and the N-terminal fragment of cleaved Nlrp1b1. To detect the C-terminal fragment, we generated an Nlrp1b1 construct with an additional TAP tag at the C-terminus. As predicted, expression of this doubly tagged protein yielded three bands: full-length Nlrp1b1, the N-terminal fragment, and the C-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Judging by the molecular weight of the C-terminal fragment (estimated to be ∼30 kDa without the TAP tag), cleavage of Nlrp1b1 occurs in the FIIND.</p>

        <title>Nlrp1b1-V988D is not cleaved and is not responsive to LeTx</title>
        <p>Based on the size of the C-terminal fragment and on the observation that Nlrp1b1 is cleaved whereas Nlrp1b3 is not cleaved, we speculated that an amino acid difference(s) between Nlrp1b1 and Nlrp1b3 in the region near amino acids 970–1120 accounts for the lack of cleavage of Nlrp1b3. Six amino acid differences were found near this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), so we generated 6 single swap mutants of Nlrp1b1. Of the 6 mutations, only the V988D mutation resulted in a loss of cleavage of Nlrp1b1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that this difference between the two proteins is responsible for the lack of cleavage of Nlrp1b3. Notably, this mutation also resulted in a complete loss of inflammasome activity in response to LeTx, as assessed by the loss of mature IL-1β in the cell supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Several other mutants (most markedly A996D and N1026S) resulted in decreased inflammasome activity without affecting cleavage of Nlrp1b1. These data suggest that the non-responsiveness of Nlrp1b3 to LeTx is not only a consequence of it not being cleaved.</p>

Nlrp1b3-D927V was cleaved, but it was not able to activate pro-caspase-1 in response to LeTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g005">Figure 5D, E</xref>). In an attempt to generate a functional version of Nlrp1b3, we introduced swap mutations based on the mutations that impaired function of Nrlp1b1 (A996D and N1026S). Nlrpb3-D935A/S965N did not exhibit any activity, but Nlrp1b3-D927V/D935A/S965N was cleaved and displayed activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g005">Figure 5F, G</xref>).

        <title>Cleavage of Nlrp1b1 affects its activity</title>
        <p>We next sought to determine whether proteolytic processing of Nlrp1b1 is important for its activity by introducing a heterologous protease site whose cleavage could be controlled. A cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) NIa protease was inserted between amino acids 981 and 982 of Nlrp1b1-V988D. Importantly, TEV protease has high sequence specificity and is well tolerated by mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Wehr1">[25]</xref>. Nlrp1b1, Nlrp1b1-V988D, and Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEV were each co-expressed with pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β. As expected, LeTx caused the release of IL-1β by cells that expressed Nlrp1b1 regardless of whether TEV protease was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). TEV protease did not cause the release of IL-1β in the absence of LeTx. Nlrp1b1-V988D was not functional in any of the conditions tested, whereas Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEV activated pro-caspase-1, but only in the presence of TEV protease. That TEV protease was able to promote pro-caspase-1 activation by Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEV in the absence of LeTx indicated that TEV cleavage overrides auto-inhibition of Nlrp1b1.</p>

        <p>Cleavage of Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEV was not observed under conditions similar to those used to test activity (with the exception that the catalytically inactive mutant pro-caspase-1-C284A was used in order to prevent release of inflammasome components from the cell), indicating that only a small fraction of Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEV may have been cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To confirm that direct cleavage of Nlrp1b-V988D-TEV by TEV protease was responsible for the observed activity, rather than an indirect effect of the protease, a TEV-site mutant was generated. Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEVmut has a Q to H mutation in the consensus sequence ENLYFQS, which has been shown to prevent cleavage by TEV protease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Dougherty1">[26]</xref>. Because cleavage by TEV protease could not be visualized under the conditions used to test inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), 5 times as much plasmid encoding TEV protease was transfected with the Nlrp1b1 constructs.

Treatment of cells with LeTx for 1–2 h did not reduce the amount of C-terminal fragment precipitated. Treatment of cells with LeTx for 3 h slightly reduced the amount of the C-terminal fragment precipitated, although this was because less was present in the lysate possibly as a result of inflammasome secretion.

        <p>We next sought to determine how cleavage within the FIIND promotes inflammasome assembly.

Nlrp1b1<sub>720–1233</sub> self-associated in the presence or absence of pro-caspase-1-C284A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>NLRP1 and Nlrp1b appear to be unique among the NOD-like receptors in that they possess two regions that facilitate oligomerization: a NACHT domain and a FIIND-CARD region. The NACHT domain is a member of the well-characterized AAA+ ATPase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Danot1">[27]</xref>, while there is only limited information available on the FIIND. In this study, we discovered that cleavage of the Nlrp1b FIIND is functionally important for inflammasome activity and that this processing of the FIIND facilitates the recruitment of pro-caspase-1.</p>
      <p>Previously, we noted that immunblotting for Nlrp1b1 using an antibody against the N-terminal TAP tag detected two bands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Liao1">[11]</xref>. We speculated that the upper band represented the full-length protein and that the lower band resulted from a proteolytic event. By generating a construct with tags at both termini of Nlrp1b1, we were able to detect the C-terminal fragment and determine that it remained associated with the N-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002659-g007">Figure 7</xref>). That the processing of Nlrp1b1 might be important for function was hinted at by the finding that the LeTx-non-responsive Nrlp1b3 was not cleaved. Furthermore, a substitution mutation that we designed to impair self-association of the FIIND unexpectedly prevented Nlrp1b1 cleavage. The functional importance of FIIND cleavage was established by an experiment in which the TEV protease site was introduced at a position within Nlrp1b1 that we estimated to be near the natural cleavage site – TEV protease cleaved this site and activated the inflammasome.</p>
      <p>During the preparation of this manuscript, D'Osualdo and colleagues published that the FIINDs of human NLRP1 and CARD8 undergo autoproteolytic processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-DOsualdo1">[23]</xref>. These researchers used computational approaches to detect similarity between the FIIND and the ZU5-UPA domains found in the PIDD autoprotease. PIDD forms a complex called the PIDDosome that either activates pro-casapase-2 or NF-κb in response to DNA damage. PIDD that is autoproteolytically cleaved at a single site initiates activation of NF-κb; an additional autoproteolytic event facilitates activation of pro-caspase-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-Tinel1">[24]</xref>. Autoproteolysis at each site occurs before a serine residue – the hydroxyl group of the serine is believed to attack a strained backbone to initiate the breakage of the peptide bond.</p>
      <p>Cleavage of the CARD8 FIIND was demonstrated to occur after a phenylalanine residue in a conserved SFS motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002659-DOsualdo1">[23]</xref>, which corresponds to <sub>982</sub>SFS<sub>984</sub> in Nlrp1b1. Notably, we found that the nearby V988D mutation in Nlrp1b1 abolished cleavage and the corresponding swap mutation in Nlrp1b3 caused this protein to be cleaved. Furthermore, the TEV site that allowed activation of Nlrp1b1-V988D-TEV by TEV protease was inserted between amino acids 981 and 982. Collectively, these findings suggest that the V988D mutation disrupts the protein conformation required for autoproteolysis between amino acids 983 and 984, but that activity can be rescued by cleavage at a nearby location. We believe that Nlrp1b1 undergoes autoproteolysis by the same mechanism as CARD8 because Nlrp1b1-S984A, in which the predicted catalytic serine is mutated, is not cleaved and is not functionally active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002659.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We further note that although lethal factor is itself a protease, the toxin does not affect Nlrp1b1 cleavage and, therefore, we do not believe that Nlrp1b1 is a direct target.</p>
      <p>Only approximately half of overexpressed Nlrp1b1 and endogenous Nlrp1b1 is cleaved. We did not observe an increased amount of cleavage over time (data not shown), which suggests that only a fraction of Nlrp1b1 is capable of undergoing autoproteolysis. We speculate, therefore, that auto-inhibited Nlrp1b1 exists as a dimer in which one of the monomers is cleaved and the other is not cleaved. Dimerization might induce autoproteolysis in one of the monomers and not in the other, which could explain why mutation of amino acids 1100–1106 not only prevents self-association of Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub>, but also prevents cleavage of Nlrp1b1.</p>
      <p>To address the mechanistic consequence of FIIND processing, we compared Nlrp1b1<sub>720–1233</sub> to Nlrp1b1<sub>720–1233</sub>-V988D, which contain the complete FIIND and CARD domains. Nlrp1b1<sub>720–1233</sub> is cleaved and is constitutively active; the V988D mutation abolishes both cleavage and activity. We found that the V988D mutation does not impair self-association – and in fact seems to increase self-association to a small extent – but the mutation does impair the recruitment of pro-caspase-1. We interpret these data to mean that cleavage of the FIIND is required for the proper assembly of a platform that is capable of recruiting molecules of pro-caspase-1 in orientations that allow cross-proteolysis. Incorrect assembly of uncleaved FIIND-CARD may partially occlude the pro-caspase-1 binding site because self-association of FIIND-CARD does not appear to be required for binding pro-caspase-1, as demonstrated by binding of pro-caspase-1 to oligomerization-defective Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub>-7A. Because Nlrp1b1<sub>1100–1233</sub> is active even though it lacks the region that undergoes proteolysis, it is presumably the uncleaved region N-terminal to amino acids 1100–1233 that exerts a negative restraint that prevents correct assembly.</p>
