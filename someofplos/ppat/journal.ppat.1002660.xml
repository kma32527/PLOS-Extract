        <p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen responsible for a spectrum of diseases including pneumonia. Immunological and pro-inflammatory processes induced in the lung during pneumococcal infection are well documented, but little is known about the role played by immunoregulatory cells and cytokines in the control of such responses. We demonstrate considerable differences in the immunomodulatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β between the pneumococcal pneumonia resistant BALB/c and susceptible CBA/Ca mouse strains. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry reveal higher levels of TGF-β protein in BALB/c lungs during pneumococcal pneumonia that correlates with a rapid rise in lung Foxp3<sup>+</sup>Helios<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells. These cells have protective functions during pneumococcal pneumonia, because blocking their induction with an inhibitor of TGF-β impairs BALB/c resistance to infection and aids bacterial dissemination from lungs. Conversely, adoptive transfer of T regulatory cells to CBA/Ca mice, prior to infection, prolongs survival and decreases bacterial dissemination from lungs to blood. Importantly, strong T regulatory cell responses also correlate with disease-resistance in outbred MF1 mice, confirming the importance of immunoregulatory cells in controlling protective responses to the pneumococcus. This study provides exciting new evidence for the importance of immunomodulation during pulmonary pneumococcal infection and suggests that TGF-β signalling is a potential target for immunotherapy or drug design.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a major human bacterial pathogen that causes a wide range of diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and ear infections. The bacterium is responsible for around 1.2 million deaths per year, mostly in high-risk groups such as children, the elderly and those with a weakened immune system. Infection with the pneumococcus can induce a wide-variety of immune responses and disease symptoms and it is not known why some people are more resistant to infection than others. Here, we identify an important role in natural resistance against pneumococcal pneumonia for a group of cells – known as T regulatory cells – that control the immune response to pneumococcal infection. In mice, strong T regulatory cell responses correlate with resistance to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Disease-resistance can be boosted by administering T regulatory cells to highly susceptible mice or inhibited by blocking the activity of these cells in resistant mice. These results advance our understanding of the host immunity differences that underpin resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia and offer hope that in the future we might boost resistance in susceptible individuals through modulation of their immune system.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) is an important human pathogen that accounts for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk groups such as children, the elderly and the immunocompromised. Determination of host protective immune responses to pneumococcal infection is highly desirable, not least because an improved understanding of the cellular and molecular interactions of host and pathogen might enable the design of specific, targeted therapies that are able to overcome the limitations of current treatment and prevention strategies.</p>
      <p>It has long been thought that neutrophils are the primary mediators of early defence against pulmonary pneumococcal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Paterson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kaplanski1">[3]</xref> but more recently a key role for T cells in the earliest stages of immunity against the pneumococcus has emerged. It has been noted that T cells infiltrate the lungs of intranasally-infected mice at an early time post-infection and that the peak of infiltration coincides with a cessation in pneumococcal growth in the lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kadioglu1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to protective immunity to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, as MHC-II-deficient mice, which have severely reduced numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, are highly susceptible to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kadioglu2">[5]</xref>. However, whilst there is an expanding body of work outlining the roles of inflammatory T cell subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Haraguchi1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-McNeela1">[9]</xref>, little has been made of regulatory and anti-inflammatory T cells and their influence on the outcome of pneumococcal pneumonia. This is an important gap in our understanding of the immunology of pneumococcal disease.</p>
      <p>Several immune cell types, including tolerogenic DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Fu1">[10]</xref>, myeloid suppressor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Nagaraj1">[11]</xref>, IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Fujio1">[12]</xref>, B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Noh1">[13]</xref> and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Sakaguchi1">[14]</xref>, have confirmed roles in the modulation and inhibition of inflammation in the context of infection. Of these immunomodulatory cells, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells are probably the best characterized. These cells have emerged as essential components of the mammalian immune system and play crucial roles in immune homeostasis as well as limiting infection-associated inflammation and facilitating resolution of tissue damage post-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Barnes1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Mills1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, for West Nile Virus, a link has been made between T regulatory cell activity and symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Lanteri1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Little is known about the actions of immunomodulatory cytokines and T regulatory cells during infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, but recent data suggest an importance of immunomodulation in anti-pneumococcal responses. Intraperitoneal administration of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> serotype 1 capsular polysaccharide induces CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>−</sup> T-cells with a regulatory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Mertens1">[18]</xref> that synthesize both IL-10 and TGF-β and are immunosuppressive for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, whether regulatory cells play protective roles during infection with invasive <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains remained to be elucidated. Although it has previously been observed that CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells are induced during pneumococcal pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kadioglu2">[5]</xref> and that the administration of heat-killed <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to mice can suppress allergic airway disease by the induction of T regulatory cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Preston1">[19]</xref>, the studies reported in this paper now provide new evidence for the important protective role performed by T regulatory cells in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia.</p>
      <p>The need to address the role of immunomodulatory cells and cytokines in pneumococcal infection is pressing, not least because it is unclear at present whether their actions are protective or detrimental to the outcome of infection. For example, IL-10 is a cytokine produced by T regulatory cells that plays key protective roles in limiting inflammation in a number of diseases through its pleiotropic inhibitory effects on immune cells, but it has also been shown to impair defense mechanisms in pneumococcal pneumonia (albeit post influenza infection) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-vanderSluijs1">[20]</xref>. In a recent study, adenoidal cells from children testing positive for pneumococcal carriage were found to contain higher numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells than those taken from children without pneumococcal carriage suggesting an immunosuppressive role for these cells. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic>, pneumococcal whole cell antigen induced T regulatory cell proliferation and production of IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Zhang1">[21]</xref>. In this paper, we have now addressed the role of T regulatory cells <italic>in vivo</italic> during invasive pneumococcal pneumonia.</p>
      <p>To determine the involvement of T regulatory cells and immunomodulatory cytokines in resistance to pneumococcal infection, we utilized two mouse strains that have strikingly different susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Gingles1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Denny1">[23]</xref>. BALB/c mice are highly resistant to respiratory challenge against a wide range of invasive pneumococci and confine their infection to the lung (without developing sepsis) and then eliminate it within 7 days. By contrast, CBA/Ca mice succumb quickly to respiratory infection, developing septicaemia and dying within 24 hours of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Gingles1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Linkage mapping of the offspring of BALB/c and CBA/Ca intercrosses revealed a major locus on mouse chromosome 7, the <italic>Spir1</italic> (<italic><underline>S</underline>treptococcus <underline>p</underline>neumoniae</italic> <underline>i</underline>nfection <underline>r</underline>esistance 1) locus, that influences survival after infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Denny1">[23]</xref>. The <italic>Tgfb1</italic> gene is located within this region of chromosome 7 and this prompted us to investigate the contribution of TGF-β and its downstream targets – including T regulatory cells - to the differing susceptibilities of BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. These studies have unearthed an important but hitherto unappreciated role for T regulatory cells in limiting immune-mediated damage in the lungs during pneumococcal pneumonia. This is, to our knowledge, the first study identifying a protective role for T regulatory cells during invasive pneumonia and it is to be hoped that the findings herein may facilitate the design of pneumococcal therapies aiming to improve T regulatory cell responses in susceptible or infected individuals.</p>

        <title>BALB/c mice display a greater expansion and recruitment of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells to the lungs than do CBA/Ca mice during pneumococcal pneumonia</title>
        <p>T regulatory cells are both a source and a target of TGF-β, so the numbers and function of these cells were investigated in the lungs of BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice before and during pneumococcal infection.

        <p>To further characterize the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells identified in the lungs during pneumococcal infection, flow cytometry was performed on lung cells from infected mice. Intracellular staining for Foxp3 confirmed the immunohistochemistry finding that whilst there was no apparent difference in the number of T regulatory cells in the lungs of uninfected BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g003">Figure 3 B</xref>), by 24 hours p.i., T regulatory cell numbers had risen approximately 2.5-fold in the lungs of BALB/c mice (p&lt;0.01) but remained unchanged in CBA/Ca mice (p&gt;0.05), as compared to uninfected levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g003">Figure 3 B</xref>). This increase in T regulatory cell numbers also correlate with significantly reduced CFUs in lungs of BALB/c mice compared to CBA/Ca mice at equivalent time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002660.s001">Figure S1</xref> A).</p>
        <p>Regulatory T cells can develop in the thymus or from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery. The thymus-derived cells are commonly referred to as natural T regulatory cells (nTregs) and it has been suggested that they can be distinguished from the cells developing in the periphery (induced T regulatory cells; iTregs) by their expression of the Ikaros family transcription factor, Helios <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Thornton1">[24]</xref>. However, more recently it has been observed that Helios is expressed on activated T cells of all subsets and so is perhaps not suitable as an nTreg marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Akimova1">[25]</xref>. Thus, in this study we have used Helios as a marker for activated T regulatory cells. Analysis of Helios expression in lung cells during our experiments revealed that the increase in T regulatory cells in BALB/c lungs during pneumococcal pneumonia was due to increased Helios<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g003">Figure 3 B and C</xref>). Foxp3<sup>+</sup>Helios<sup>+</sup> cells increased approximately 3-fold over the first 24 hours p.i. in BALB/c mice, but not in CBA/Ca mice (p&lt;0.001), indicating that BALB/c T regulatory cells are activated rapidly following infection. By contrast, there was no significant increase in Foxp3<sup>+</sup>Helios<sup>negative</sup> cells in the lungs of either BALB/c or CBA/Ca mice over the course of the infection (data not shown). The increase in T regulatory cells in BALB/c lungs following infection is rapid, supporting a greater role for nTregs than for iTregs, which can take several days to differentiate in the periphery in response to TGF-β and low doses of antigen.</p>
        <p>To assess whether lung T regulatory cells actively secrete immunomodulatory cytokines during pneumococcal infection, the number of IL-10<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g003">Figure 3 D</xref>). T regulatory cell-derived IL-10 has an important role in determining resistance or susceptibility to infection against a range of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Belkaid1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Rowe1">[27]</xref> and has been shown to influence susceptibility to disease in pneumococcal pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Jeong1">[28]</xref>. In our study, a significant increase in IL-10<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells was readily apparent in both BALB/c (p&lt;0.01) and CBA/Ca (p&lt;0.05) mice compared to PBS controls at 24 hours p.i. However, the number of IL-10<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells in BALB/c mice was significantly higher than in infected CBA/Ca mice (p&lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>In addition to IL-10, several other markers – including PD-L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Lohr1">[29]</xref> and CTLA-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Wing1">[30]</xref> - have been suggested to play a role in T regulatory cell immunosuppressive functions. We assessed expression of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 by T regulatory cells in the lungs of BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice. We observed barely detectable expression of PD-L1 on T regulatory cells from either BALB/c or CBA/Ca mice (data not shown) and low-level expression of CTLA-4 on the majority of T regulatory cells from both strains (data not shown). However, we also observed a population of CTLA-4<sup>high</sup> T regulatory cells in both strains of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g003">Figure 3 E</xref>). There was a significant difference in CTLA-4<sup>high</sup> T regulatory cell numbers between BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice at 24 hours p.i. (p&lt;0.001), with BALB/c lungs containing substantially more CTLA4<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g003">Figure 3 E</xref>). This increase in CTLA-4<sup>high</sup> T regulatory cells in BALB/c mice could also be observed in the spleen at 24 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002660.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting the presence of a circulating population of highly suppressive T cells. This result further highlights the strong regulatory environment generated in BALB/c mice following infection.</p>
        <p>To rule out the possibility that the differences in TGF-β signaling between BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice were affecting disease-resistance through modulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 responses, the production of IL-17 was assessed in the lungs of BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice at 24 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002660.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We observed only a small population of IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells in either mouse strain and no significant difference in CD4<sup>+</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells was observed.</p>

        <title>CBA/Ca mice show increased interferon gamma and increased cellular apoptosis during pneumococcal pneumonia</title>
        <p>The strong immunomodulatory environment generated in BALB/c lungs during pneumococcal pneumonia accounts for the lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine seen in these mice p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Production of interferon (IFN)-γ in CBA/Ca lungs at 24 hours p.i. was significantly higher than in BALB/c lungs (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g004">Figure 4 A</xref>), and over 90% of NKp46<sup>+</sup> NK cells were found to be IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>, as compared to 30–50% in BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g004">Figure 4 B</xref>). NK cells accounted for over 80% of IFN-γ-producing cells in both BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice, with the remaining 20% coming from an unidentified CD45<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>NKp46<sup>−</sup> cell type (data not shown). The higher levels of IFN-γ production in CBA/Ca mice suggests that mechanisms limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production are more effective in BALB/c than in CBA/Ca lungs during pneumococcal pneumonia. IFN-γ is known to induce apoptosis in a range of cell types including lung epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Coulter1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Wen1">[32]</xref> and so it is possible that modulation of IFN-γ production is one mechanism by which T regulatory cells may help maintain epithelial barrier integrity and confine the bacterial infection to the lung.</p>

        <p>Intriguingly, the immunomodulation occurring in BALB/c lungs at early time-points following infection appears to be a specific process rather than a general dampening of immune responses as BALB/c mice generate strong neutrophil responses in the lung following intra-nasal infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002660.s004">Figure S4</xref> A) that are thought to be critical in bacterial clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Gingles1">[22]</xref>.

        <title>Inhibition of TGF-β1 impairs BALB/c resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia</title>
        <p>Having demonstrated differences in TGF-β production and T regulatory cell activity over the course of infection in BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice, we next investigated the potential of TGF-β1-inhibition in BALB/c mice to influence their resistant phenotype to pneumococcal pneumonia. If TGF-β had a significant role to play in host defence against pneumonia, then inhibition of it would render the BALB/c host more susceptible. A short synthetic peptide (P17) was utilized to inhibit TGF-β activity in BALB/c animals. The ability of P17 to effectively inhibit TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 activity is well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-GilGuerrero1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Dotor1">[34]</xref>. P17, or PBS as a control, was administered to BALB/c mice 1 hour prior to intranasal challenge with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and then again at 6 hours p.i. Strikingly, mice treated with the P17 peptide developed visible signs of disease earlier than PBS-treated control animals and by 48 hours p.i. all ten P17-treated animals, but only one mouse from the control group, displayed visible signs of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g005">Figure 5 A</xref>). Furthermore, 50% of P17-treated mice had to be culled due to illness, while 100% of the control group survived (data not shown). Although mice from both treatment groups showed similar lung CFUs by 24 and 48 hours p.i., (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g005">Figure 5 B</xref>), P17-treated BALB/c mice had significantly higher CFUs in their blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g005">Figure 5 C</xref>). Whilst none of the PBS-treated BALB/c mice developed bacteraemia over the 48-hour experiment, 50% of the P17-treated animals had substantial levels of bacteria in their blood by 48 hours p.i., indicating that inhibition of TGF-β promotes bacterial seeding from lungs to blood. This is a key finding as BALB/c mice intranasally infected with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> do not develop septicaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Gingles1">[22]</xref>.

By contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>negative</sup> T cells generated in the same culture conditions, but without TGF-β, and transferred into a separate group of mice to control for contaminating T cells in the T regulatory cell population, failed to increase survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g006">Figure 6 B</xref>). At 24 hours p.i., a significant increase (p&lt;0.01) in total T regulatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g006">Figure 6 C</xref>) and IL-10<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g006">Figure 6 D</xref>) was observable in the lungs of mice that had received i.v. administration of T regulatory cells, in contrast to mice that had received PBS or CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>negative</sup> T cells i.v. This finding clearly demonstrated an ability of the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated T regulatory cells to influence immune responses, leading to increased host survival, following transfer into the tail vein. Crucially, the bacterial load in blood at 24 hours p.i. was significantly lower in mice that had received T regulatory cells than either of the other two treatment groups (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g006">Figure 6 E</xref>). This suggests reduced translocation of pneumococci from lungs to blood during pneumonia as a result of T regulatory cell activity. This is a significant result as the CBA/Ca strain is highly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, and yet transfer of T regulatory cells alone was sufficient to double survival time. Furthermore, the increased survival and decreased seeding of bacteria to blood in CBA/Ca mice that had received T regulatory cells correlated with a decrease in the number of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells in the lungs, suggesting an improved generation of an immunomodulatory environment in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g006">Figure 6 F</xref>).

        <title>Resistance to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in outbred mice correlates with strong T regulatory cell responses</title>
        <p>To test the hypothesis that strong T regulatory cell responses correlate with resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia in other mouse strains as well, we infected outbred MF1 mice and assessed the progression of disease in relation to T regulatory cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g007">Figure 7</xref>). At 48 hours p.i., mice showing visible signs of disease were considered to have invasive pneumonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g007">Figure 7 A</xref>). The remaining mice, which showed no disease signs, were deemed to have “controlled infection" or non-invasive pneumonia. This was confirmed by analysis of bacteraemia at 48 hours p.i., as all mice which showed visible signs of disease had bacteria in their blood compared with no bacteraemia in mice in the non-invasive pneumonia group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g007">Figure 7 B</xref>). Strikingly, the resistant phenotype correlated with significantly higher numbers of T regulatory cells in the lungs of mice from the non-invasive pneumonia group as compared to the invasive pneumonia group at 48 hours p.i. (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002660-g007">Figure 7 C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Collectively, these data demonstrate an important role for T regulatory cell activity in mediating resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia. Thus, the differing susceptibilities of BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice can be attributed in large part to differences in the co-ordination and regulation of TGF-β signaling pathways in these mice.</p>
      <p>Evidence from other diseases suggests that CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells play prominent roles in immune suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Morampudi1">[36]</xref>. Indeed, in some infectious diseases, down-regulation of T regulatory cells by pathogens is a feature of infection that correlates with poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Shen1">[37]</xref>. It is well known that infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> results in a rapid and vigorous immune response in the lungs characterized by early infiltration of neutrophils and increased macrophage numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Haslett1">[38]</xref> followed by an influx of lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kadioglu3">[39]</xref>, but an uncontrolled and sustained influx of pro-inflammatory leukocytes to the lung would be highly detrimental to the host. Excessive inflammatory infiltrate can lead to substantial tissue damage through the actions of degradative enzymes and other soluble mediators released from the infiltrating cells and such tissue damage could compromise the integrity of the epithelial cell barrier of the lung and aid bacterial dissemination to the bloodstream. Therefore, appropriately regulated immune responses in the lung during pneumococcal infection are essential, and T regulatory cells and their products clearly play an important role in this.</p>
      <p>It appears that, in the absence of rapid T regulatory cell induction in CBA/Ca mice, bacteria disseminate into the blood stream before a regulated inflammatory environment of infiltrating leukocytes has been established. By contrast, such an environment is generated as early as 12 hours p.i. in BALB/c mice which likely helps to contain the bacteria within the lungs and eventually clear them. T regulatory cells in such an environment might limit the inflammatory reaction in order to prevent tissue damage and preserve epithelial barrier integrity. In CBA/Ca mice, with fewer T regulatory cells, less TGF-β and no immunosuppression, this process is inefficient and may lead to compromise of the lung architecture. This is supported by the substantially increased levels of apoptosis within the lungs of CBA/Ca mice, and increased levels of bacterial seeding into blood.</p>
      <p>The correlation between strong T regulatory cell responses and decreased IFN-γ production has been made previously. A recent study outlined a correlation between increased Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells in Malawian adults (with asymptomatic HIV infection) and an associated skewing of T cell cytokine production away from IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Glennie1">[40]</xref>. In our study, the T cell contribution to IFN-γ production was minimal but we did observe reduced NK cell-derived IFN-γ in BALB/c mice, which have strong T regulatory cell responses.</p>
      <p>The finding that pneumococcal pneumonia induces IL-10 production in the lung is a significant one. T regulatory cell-derived IL-10 has a well-documented role in immune homeostasis in the lung during allergy. For example, mice in which IL-10 was specifically ablated in T regulatory cells displayed perivasculitis and mononuclear cell infiltration around the large airways of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Rubtsov1">[41]</xref>. The same mice also displayed exacerbated disease signs in an ovalbumin-driven model of allergic airways inflammation. Thus, it appears that T regulatory cell-derived IL-10 plays an important role in the suppression of immunological reactivity in the lung in the context of both allergic inflammation and infection, where it may help limit infection-related tissue damage. In addition to IL-10 production, the T regulatory cells induced in response to pneumococcal infection might mediate immune regulation and the suppression of pathological inflammatory responses through a direct cell-cell contact mechanism. The finding that CTLA-4 is highly expressed on a subset of T regulatory cells in resistant BALB/c, but not susceptible CBA/Ca mice following pneumococcal infection supports this assertion.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, our studies in outbred MF1 mice provided complementary evidence for a link between resistance to invasive disease and high lung regulatory T cell numbers but also suggested that uncontrolled lung neutrophil influx in susceptible mice might contribute to lung tissue damage that promotes bacterial dissemination. A similar destructive role for neutrophils has been suggested previously after it was demonstrated that depletion of neutrophils with monoclonal antibodies could prolong survival in mice given a lethal intranasal dose of serotype 8 pneumococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Marks1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of excessive neutrophil recruitment have been documented recently in a study investigating sex-based differences in susceptibility to pneumococcal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kadioglu4">[43]</xref>. The greater susceptibility of male mice to invasive pneumococcal disease was attributed in part to the uncontrolled presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and greater neutrophil infiltration into lungs following respiratory pneumococcal infection as compared to reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower neutrophil infiltration in lungs of female mice. However, these data must be balanced against the proven role for neutrophils in bacterial clearance. It is likely that it is the timing of the neutrophil influx that is crucial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Paterson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Kaplanski1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002660-Gingles1">[22]</xref>. If recruitment can occur whilst the bacteria are still confined to the lung then disease resolution may occur, but if the influx occurs later, the neutrophils may fail to clear the infection and may aid bacterial dissemination via contribution to lung damage. The earlier influx of neutrophils to the lungs in BALB/c versus CBA/Ca mice certainly correlates with bacterial clearance.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these findings dramatically alter our perception of host immune responses to pneumococcal infection, emphasizing the importance of balancing pro-inflammatory responses in the lung with controlled anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity. Furthermore, it is clear that achieving this balance is fundamental to containment and clearance of pneumococcal infection in lungs. The finding that the correlation between strong regulatory cell responses and invasive disease resistance is not restricted to BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice but can also be observed in outbred MF1 mice is an important one, as these genetically variable populations mimic more closely the spectrum of disease resistance phenotypes seen in human populations. In this paper we show how differences in the regulation and balance of host immune responses can dramatically alter the development and outcome of infection by either leading to containment and clearance of the pathogen from lungs or the development of severe invasive pneumonia and lethal septicaemia. It follows that genetic differences in components of immunomodulatory pathways may predispose individuals to the development of septicaemia following acute pneumonia. An improved understanding of the mechanisms operating in the lungs and the role that regulatory cells and cytokines play in these processes may allow us to predict outcomes of infection and tailor treatments accordingly. It will also certainly be of interest to develop novel pneumococcal vaccines that can induce protective T regulatory cell responses.</p>
