        <p>Viral replication efficiency is in large part governed by the ability of viruses to counteract pro-apoptotic signals induced by infection of host cells. For HHV-8, viral interferon regulatory factor-1 (vIRF-1) contributes to this process in part via inhibitory interactions with BH3-only protein (BOP) Bim, recently identified as an interaction partner of vIRF-1. Here we recognize that the Bim-binding domain (BBD) of vIRF-1 resembles a region (BH3-B) of Bid, another BOP, which interacts intramolecularly with the functional BH3 domain of Bid to inhibit it pro-apoptotic activity. Indeed, vIRF-1 was found to target Bid in addition to Bim and to interact, via its BBD region, with the BH3 domain of each. In functional assays, BBD could substitute for BH3-B in the context of Bid, to suppress Bid-induced apoptosis in a BH3-binding-dependent manner, and vIRF-1 was able to protect transfected cells from apoptosis induced by Bid. While vIRF-1 can mediate nuclear sequestration of Bim, this was not the case for Bid, and inhibition of Bid and Bim by vIRF-1 could occur independently of nuclear localization of the viral protein. Consistent with this finding, direct BBD-dependent inactivation by vIRF-1 of Bid-induced mitochondrial permeabilization was demonstrable <italic>in vitro</italic> and isolated BBD sequences were also active in this assay. In addition to Bim and Bid BH3 domains, BH3s of BOPs Bik, Bmf, Hrk, and Noxa also were found to bind BBD, while those of both pro- and anti-apoptotic multi-BH domain Bcl-2 proteins were not. Finally, the significance of Bid to virus replication was demonstrated via Bid-depletion in HHV-8 infected cells, which enhanced virus production. Together, our data demonstrate and characterize BH3 targeting and associated inhibition of BOP pro-apoptotic activity by vIRF-1 via Bid BH3-B mimicry, identifying a novel mechanism of viral evasion from host cell defenses.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Viruses possess mechanisms of subverting host cell defenses against infection and virus replication; these mechanisms are essential to the virus life cycle. Here, we identify and characterize a novel mechanism of HHV-8 mediated inhibition of virus-induced programmed cell death (apoptosis). This function is specified by viral interferon regulator factor homologue vIRF-1, which binds to and directly inhibits pro-death activities of so-called BH3-only proteins (BOPs), induced and activated by stress signals such as those occurring in infected cells. The BH3 domains of BOPs mediate their pro-apoptotic functions, and it is these domains that are targeted by vIRF-1, via a region resembling a BH3-interacting and -inhibitory domain, termed BH3-B, present in one of the vIRF-1 targeted BOPs, Bid. The targeted BOP BH3 domains share characteristic and conserved features. As shown previously for Bim, depletion of Bid leads to enhanced HHV-8 productive replication, demonstrating that Bid, also, is a biologically significant negative regulator of virus replication and suggesting that its control by vIRF-1 is of functional importance. To our knowledge, this is the first report of viral targeting and inhibition of BOP activity via Bid BH3-B mimicry; our studies therefore expand the known mechanisms of viral evasion from antiviral defenses of the host.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) specifies a number of proteins expressed during the lytic cycle that have demonstrated or potential abilities to promote virus productive replication via inhibition of apoptotic pathways induced by infection- or replication-induced stress. These proteins include membrane signaling receptors K1 and K15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tomlinson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Brinkmann1">[3]</xref>, Bcl-2 and survivin homologues encoded by open reading frames 16 and K7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Cheng1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Feng1">[7]</xref>, viral chemokines vCCL-1 and vCCL-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi1">[8]</xref>, and viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Montaner1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Sandford1">[10]</xref>. The viral interferon regulatory factor homologues, vIRFs 1–4, also are believed to play important roles in blocking interferon and other stress responses to virus infection and replication. Their functions include inhibitory interactions with cellular IRFs, IRF-activating pathways, and/or IRF-recruited p300/CBP transcriptional co-activators to IRF-stimulated promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Offermann1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Wies1">[15]</xref>. Additionally, the vIRFs inhibit apoptosis via targeting of other cellular proteins; these include p53 (vIRFs 1 and 3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Rivas1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Nakamura1">[18]</xref>, p53-activating ATM kinase (vIRF-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Shin1">[19]</xref>, p53-destabilizing MDM2 (vIRF-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Lee2">[20]</xref>, retinoic acid/interferon-inducible protein GRIM19 (vIRF-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Seo2">[21]</xref>, and TGFβ receptor-activated transcription factors Smad3 and Smad 4 (vIRF-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Seo3">[22]</xref>. To date, the v-chemokines, vGPCR and vIRF-1 are the only HHV-8 proteins that have been demonstrated both to inhibit apoptosis in lytically infected cells and to promote HHV-8 productive replication, in the context of lytic reactivation in endothelial cells in the case of the vCCLs and vIRF-1 and additionally in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells for vGPCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Sandford1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to its other cellular binding partners, vIRF-1 also interacts with the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein (BOP) Bim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>, a protein also targeted for suppression by v-chemokine signaling and demonstrated to be both induced during lytic replication and a very powerful negative regulator of viral replication efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi1">[8]</xref>. Bim, like other BOPs, functions by virtue of its BH3 domain to target anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family and to disrupt their interactions with apoptotic executioner proteins Bax and Bak, liberating them for oligomerization and mitochondrial permeabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Adams1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Ewings1">[25]</xref>. However, Bim can also interact with and activate Bax and Bak directly, via induced conformational changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Kim1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Harada1">[28]</xref>. This property of direct activation of Bax and/or Bak is shared by BOPs Bid and Puma, although other BOPs appear to act indirectly via BH3-mediated interactions with Bcl-2-family proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Kim1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Kuwana1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Cartron1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Willis1">[30]</xref>. Activities of several BOPs, such as Bim, Bmf and Bad, are regulated via phosphorylation, to effect activation, inactivation, or alteration of protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Puthalakath1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Shibue1">[33]</xref>. For example, Bim is activated by JNK-mediated phosphorylation of residue T56, causing release of Bim from microtubules, inactivated by Akt phosphorylation of S87, which allows 14-3-3 association and cytosolic sequestration, and ERK phosphorylation of S69 to effect proteasomal degradation of Bim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Qi1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Lei1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Luciano1">[35]</xref>. Bid is unique among BOPs in its activation via protease cleavage, typically by death receptor-activated caspases but also by other proteases, such as granzyme B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Billen1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Luo1">[38]</xref>. Cleavage removes N-terminal sequences (p7) containing a motif, termed BH3-B, which interacts intramolecularly with the BH3 domain to inhibit Bid pro-apoptotic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tait1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tan1">[40]</xref>. Mitochondrial membrane targeting of cleaved, truncated Bid (tBid) is promoted via surface exposure of hydrophobic residues and N-terminal glycine myristoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-McDonnell1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Zha1">[42]</xref>. While the nature of BH3 interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins, involving BH3 α-helix association with Bcl-2 BH1–3-comprised hydrophobic grooves, is well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Petros1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Hinds1">[44]</xref>, the basis of Bid BH3∶BH3-B interaction is at present poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tan1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our previous studies of vIRF-1 interaction with Bim identified a unique mechanism of Bim regulation, via nuclear sequestration of the BOP away from mitochondria, and documented the first example of interaction between a Bcl-2 family member and an IRF homologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>. While the Bim-binding domain (BBD) of vIRF-1 was mapped, to residues 170–187 comprising a putative amphipathic α-helix, the region of Bim interacting with vIRF-1 was not determined. Subsequent comparisons of the BBD primary and predicted secondary structures with those of Bid BH3-B revealed similarities, in terms of conserved residues, α-helical structure and amphipathicity, indicating, by analogy, that BBD may target for binding and direct functional inhibition the BH3 domain of Bim (in addition to enabling vIRF-1-mediated inactivation of Bim via nuclear sequestration), and indeed may be able to bind Bid BH3 also. The data presented here demonstrate that this is indeed the case, that vIRF-1 can inhibit Bid as well as Bim pro-apoptotic activity, and that BBD can also recognize the BH3 domains of certain other BOPs, dependent on residues that are common and particular to these domains. Thus, vIRF-1 BBD mediates BH3-B mimicry, to our knowledge the first example of viral usurpation of this mode of inhibition of BOP function and pro-apoptotic signaling.</p>

Indeed, the sequences of BBD and BH3-B are similar to each other and to BH3 domains of other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Particularly noteworthy are the BH3-conserved hydrophobic and BH3-B-conserved basic residues of the BBD core sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The structural similarities of BBD and BH3-B suggested the possibility that BBD might interact with Bim via its BH3 domain and that vIRF-1 might target Bid (and possibly other BOPs) in addition to Bim.</p>

        <title>Bim and Bid BH3 targeting by vIRF-1</title>
        <p>To test whether the BBD of vIRF-1 interacted with the BH3 domain of Bim, recombinant fusion proteins were made for co-precipitation binding assays. The proteins comprised T7/DsRed-fused wild-type and Bim-binding-refractory GK<sub>179</sub>AA versions of BBD (vIRF-1 residues 170–187), and also Bid BH3-B (Bid<sub>L</sub> residues 34–51), and chitin-binding domain (CBD)-tagged GFP-Bim BH3 (Bim<sub>EL</sub> residues 148–161) and GFP (control). Paired T7/DsRed and GFP/CBD fusion proteins were mixed, CBD-tagged proteins precipitated with chitin beads, and precipitated material analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. This experiment revealed binding of BBD, but not BBD(GK<sub>179</sub>AA) or BH3-B, to Bim BH3, with no detectable background binding to negative control GFP-CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). An analogous experiment using GFP/CBD-fused Bid BH3 (residues 86–99) as the “bait” identified interaction with Bid BH3-B (positive control) and also with vIRF-1 BBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), thereby identifying Bid BH3, as well as Bim BH3, as a target of vIRF-1 BBD interaction.</p>

Transfection of Bid<sub>L</sub> and GFP expression vectors into HEK293T cells led to substantially reduced GFP fluorescence (∼39%) relative to empty vector plus GFP control, set at 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), consistent with previously reported apoptotic activity of uncleaved Bid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Wang3">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tan1">[40]</xref>. However, this activity was increased substantially by introduction of Bid-BH3 binding-abrogating mutations (GHE<sub>41</sub>VLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tan1">[40]</xref>) into BH3-B, suppressing GFP fluorescence to ∼20% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Bid(mBH3-B)]. Importantly, BBD could substitute fully for BH3-B in this assay, inhibiting BH3-mediated Bid apoptotic activity more effectively than native BH3-B (75% GFP fluorescence relative to 39%). Increased inhibition by BBD indicates that it may bind with higher affinity than BH3-B to Bid BH3. Although it is more likely that BBD and BH3-B mediated inhibition of Bid<sub>L</sub> activity occur via intramolecular interactions with Bid BH3, it is also possible that trans-inhibition may occur. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> of mutation GK<sub>179</sub>AA (previously shown to abrogate Bim interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>) into BBD (mBBD) abolished its inhibition of Bid<sub>L</sub> activity, leading to GFP fluorescence (cell viability) levels similar to those obtained upon mutation of BH3-B.</p>

(B) These plasmids were individually cotransfected with GFP expression vector into HEK293T cells and after 24 h GFP fluorescence was quantified by fluorometry, providing a readout of cell viability. Relative fluorescence unit (RFU) values indicate the percentage of fluorescence relative to empty vector transfected cells (-Bid), with background, non-specific signal from untransfected cells (-GFP) subtracted. Error bars represent standard deviations from the average values derived from triplicate samples. (C) The functional equivalence of BH3-B and BBD in respect of apoptotic inhibition, specifically, was tested by using annexin V-Cy3 staining to detect HEK293T cells undergoing apoptosis at 7 h post-transfection. The inclusion of tBid expression plasmid and untransfected cultures in this experiment provided, respectively, a positive (BH3-B-deleted) control for induced apoptosis and a control for effects of transfection (by comparison to empty vector-transfected cultures). Cy3<sup>+</sup> cells were counted from three random fields for each condition to generate the presented data; error bars show standard deviations from mean values obtained from individual fields. (D) Apoptotic inhibitory activity of vIRF-1 BBD in the context of Bid<sub>L</sub> was further confirmed using a cytochrome c release assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and harvested after 18 h. Dounce-derived extracts were either untreated or processed by centrifugation to derive total or S100 (soluble, sol.) samples for SDS-PAGE and immoblotting. Soluble sample blots were probed with antibodies specific for cytochrome c (cytC) or β-actin (loading control), and total cell extracts were probed with Flag antibody to detect and confirm expression of Flag-tagged Bid proteins.</p>

        <title>vIRF-1 effects on nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Bid</title>
        <p>In HHV-8 lytically reactivated endothelial cells, Bim is found predominantly in the nucleus, and nuclear location of Bim can be induced by vIRF-1 in transfected HEK293T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>. As nuclear-localized Bim is inactive in respect of apoptotic induction, its nuclear sequestration represents a mechanism of BOP inactivation. To determine the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Bid during HHV-8 lytic reactivation, dual-label immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were undertaken to identify Bid induction and distribution in reactivated cells expressing lytic antigen (vIRF-1). Like Bim, Bid was induced during lytic reactivation in telomerase-immortalized endothelial (TIME) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Venetsanakos1">[46]</xref>, here engineered to express HHV-8 immediate-early protein RTA in response to doxycycline (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002748.s001">Fig.S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, little or no nuclear localization of Bid was apparent, in sharp contrast to the predominant nuclear localization of Bim in lytically reactivated cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In cells transfected with Bid<sub>L</sub> or tBid expression vectors together with an empty or vIRF-1 expression plasmid, the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of each Bid protein was refractory to vIRF-1 influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). It is notable that some nuclear localization of Bid<sub>L</sub> was apparent, consistent with previous reports of nuclear localization and associated activities of Bid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Zinkel1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Oberkovitz1">[49]</xref>, but no nuclear staining was evident for tBid. In contrast to Bid, and consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>, Bim distribution was altered in the presence of vIRF-1, with strong nuclear staining apparent exclusively with vIRF-1 co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). That vIRF-1 indeed did not influence nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Bid was verified by using immunoblotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of transfected cells. Again, while nuclear localization of a proportion of Bid<sub>L</sub> was detected, this was not detectably influenced by vIRF-1 co-expression, and tBid localization was restricted to the cytoplasm in the absence and presence of vIRF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Furthermore, a nuclear localization-defective vIRF-1 variant (see below) also did not influence the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Bid<sub>L</sub>, although induction of Bim nuclear localization was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

Cells were then reactivated by addition of 1 µg/ml doxycycline (Dox) to culture media and after 48 h cells were fixed and dually immunostained for detection of Bid and lytic antigen (vIRF-1). HHV-8<sup>+</sup> TIME-TRE/RTA cells were also stained for detection of Bid or Bim in the absence and presence of Dox. Both BOPs were induced by Dox treatment (right panels), with general coincidence of Bid and lytic antigen immunofluorescence (left panels).

        <title>Nuclear translocation-independent inactivation of Bid and Bim</title>
        <p>Targeting of BH3 domains of Bim and Bid by vIRF-1, coupled with the inability of vIRF-1 to induce significant Bid nuclear localization, suggested the possibility of direct inactivation of BOP apoptotic activity by vIRF-1 binding. To address this issue, we generated a nuclear localization-defective version of vIRF-1 for use in functional assays. Each of four potential nuclear localization signals (NLS) was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and the respective vIRF-1 proteins were tested for nuclear localization in expression vector-transfected cells. vIRF-1(RGRRR<sub>163</sub>AGAAA) was found to be defective for nuclear localization, as determined by IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This was verified using a functional assay based on p53-inhibitory activity of vIRF-1; while wild-type vIRF-1 was able to suppress reporter-detected transactivation by nuclear p53, NLS-mutated vIRF-1 was completely inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). As mentioned above, the vIRF-1 variant was also confirmed to be unable to induce nuclear localization of Bim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The wild-type and NLS-mutated versions of vIRF-1 were used in GFP-based viability assays to compare their abilities to inhibit Bim and Bid activities. Both vIRF-1 proteins were able to protect cells from Bim- and Bid-induced apoptosis, with very similar dose-activity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Therefore, vIRF-1 inhibition of both Bim and Bid can be mediated independently of nuclear-localization and nuclear-localized functions of vIRF-1.</p>

        <title>Mitochondrial localization of vIRF-1</title>
        <p>To address the hypothesis that vIRF-1 may act directly at the mitochondrion to suppress BOP-induced apoptosis, we isolated mitochondria from vIRF-1 vector-transfected HEK293T cells and undertook SDS-PAGE and Western analysis for detection of vIRF-1 in the mitochondrial fraction. Both wild-type and Bim-refractory (GK<sub>179</sub>AA) vIRF-1 proteins were present in mitochondrial fractions, representing approximately 2% of total vIRF-1 present in the transfected cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). To assess whether this vIRF-1 was likely to be membrane inserted/associated or mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) protein associated, <italic>in vitro</italic> mitochondrial binding assays were used. These assays employed purified recombinant vIRF-1 (T7 epitope-tagged) added to isolated mitochondria prior to and after proteinase K treatment. Binding of vIRF-1 to mitochondria, apparent absent treatment, was completely abrogated by proteinase K pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), indicating mitochondrial association of vIRF-1 via interaction with a cytoplasmic-exposed mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, endogenously-expressed vIRF-1 was present in mitochondrial fractions prepared from HHV-8<sup>+</sup> primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells, BCBL1-TRE/RTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Nakamura2">[50]</xref>, with or without lytic induction (+Dox), and this vIRF-1 was susceptible to proteinase K digestion, demonstrating peripheral association of vIRF-1 with mitochondria in HHV-8 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). vIRF-1 has been reported previously to be expressed during latency in PEL cells but to be induced during lytic reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Pozharskaya1">[51]</xref>, consistent with our detected patterns of vIRF-1 expression in BCBL1-TRE/RTA cells. Mitochondrial localization of vIRF-1 was verified by IFA in TIME-TRE/vIRF-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref> in which vIRF-1 expression is inducible upon addition of doxycycline to culture medium. These results demonstrated localization of detectable levels of vIRF-1 to a subset of loci staining positively for mitochondrial marker TOM20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). In both Dox-inducible BCBL1-TRE/RTA PEL cells and HHV-8-infected TIME-TRE/RTA endothelial cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002748.s001">Fig.S1</xref>), vIRF-1 was found by immunoblotting of mitochondrial fractions to localize in part to mitochondria during productive replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). The proportion of vIRF-1 localizing to mitochondria in the BCBL-1 cells was comparable with that measured in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>); the level in the TIME cells (+Dox) was &gt;4 times higher at 9%. For the PEL cells, which express vIRF-1 also during latency but at reduced levels, the proportion of mitochondrial-localized vIRF-1 was increased from 0.9% to 2% in Dox-treated, lytically-induced cultures, possibly reflecting biological significance of vIRF-1 activity at this site during productive replication. It should be noted that as only a subset of these cells support lytic reactivation, the proportion of vIRF-1 localized to mitochondria in lytically infected cells is likely to be substantially greater than the 2% level observed for the culture as a whole. Similar fractionation experiments in HHV-8<sup>+</sup> TIME-TRE/RTA cells treated with Dox verified Bid, as well as vIRF-1, localization to mitochondria during lytic reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy detected at least some colocalization of vIRF-1 and Bid in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002748.s002">Fig.S2</xref>).

Inclusion of vIRF-1 (8 µg/ml, 100 nM) blocked all detectable cytochrome c release, but vIRF-1ΔBBD was inactive in respect of tBid inhibition.

        <p>Further experiments were undertaken to determine if BH3-B could substitute functionally for BBD in the context of vIRF-1 to block tBid-induced mitochondrial permeabilization and also to confirm direct inhibitory activities of the BBD and BH3-B domains, expressed as fusions with GST. The recombinant proteins were isolated and purified from bacterial extracts and their purities and concentrations checked prior to experimental use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>).

        <title>Determinants of BH3 recognition by vIRF-1 BBD</title>
        <p>Comparisons of the BH3 domains of vIRF-1/BBD-interacting BOPs identified a single unique and conserved residue among the BBD-binding BH3 sequences, namely an alanine at position <italic>φ</italic>1+1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>, left). Mutagenesis of this position within the context of Bim BH3 was undertaken to determine its significance with respect to BBD binding; it was changed to each of the collinear residues of the non-binding BH3 domains. Additionally, residues <italic>φ</italic>1+1 to <italic>φ</italic>1+3 (SEC) of BBD-refractory Bax BH3 were changed to the equivalents (AQE) in closely related Bim BH3 and the reciprocal changes were made in Bim BH3 to determine if these “diverged” residues in combination could, respectively, confer and abrogate BBD binding. The various changes made are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g009">Fig. 9A</xref> (right). As before, these sequences were expressed as GFP fusions for use in GST-BBD-based coprecipitation assays. Other than wild-type Bim BH3, glutathione bead-precipitated GST-BBD was able to efficiently co-precipitate only cysteine- and serine-substituted alanine <italic>φ</italic>1+1, with weak binding apparent for the leucine-substituted BH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). The AQE substitution of Bax SEC residues was able to confer at least some BBD-binding capacity to Bax, demonstrating the contribution of these residues, either directly or via structural influence, to binding; the converse substitution in Bim abrogated binding. Interestingly, a sequence isolated from a phage-display dodecamer-peptide library using GST-BBD as bait had some resemblance to BH3 sequences in respect of conserved basic residues and, importantly, possessed an alanine residue at the equivalent of position <italic>φ</italic>1+1. This sequence also showed some binding in the <italic>in vitro</italic> coprecipitation assay. Taken together, these data indicate the likely central importance of alanine at position <italic>φ</italic>1+1 for BBD interaction, although the residue's contribution is likely indirect and evidently context dependent, as particular collinear small side-chain residues (serine and cysteine) from non-binding BH3 domains can substitute for alanine in Bim BH3 and the AQE motif from Bim can confer only weak binding to the closely related BH3 domain of Bax.</p>

        <title>Biological relevance of Bid to HHV-8 productive replication</title>
        <p>Previous studies from this laboratory identified Bim as a potent inhibitor of virus productive replication and the importance of vIRF-1 BBD-mediated interactions in countering lytic cycle-induced apoptosis and promoting HHV-8 production in TIME cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi1">[8]</xref>. In view of the present findings that vIRF-1 inhibits Bid activity in a BBD-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) and that Bid is induced in lytically reactivated TIME cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), we wanted to test the significance of Bid in HHV-8 replication. To do this, we utilized lentiviral vector-delivered shRNAs directed to Bid mRNA sequences to deplete Bid in HHV-8<sup>+</sup> (latently infected) TIME cells and compared levels of cell-released encapsidated viral genomes produced following TPA induction to those obtained from non-silencing (NS) shRNA-transduced control cultures. Bim shRNA-transduced TIME cells were also included to provide a positive control for the experiment. The data from this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>) revealed that each of the two Bid shRNAs led to small but significant increases in virus production from TPA-treated TIME cells; as before, Bim depletion led to substantial amplification of virus titers. Similar experiments were undertaken in TIME-TRE/RTA cells to confirm the effect on replication of Bid depletion; here, lytic replication was induced by addition of doxycycline to the cultures. Again, Bid depletion led to increased virus production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>), measured in this experiment by titration of released infectious virus in culture media via inoculation of naïve TIME cells and detection of virus infection by immunofluorescence assay for latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). These data demonstrate that Bid, in addition to Bim, is a contributor to negative regulation of HHV-8 infection and suggest that its control by vIRF-1 is likely to be important for optimal virus productive replication. It is important to note, however, that the positive effects on virus replication of Bid and Bim depletion by shRNA transduction demonstrate also that vIRF-1 is not completely effective at suppressing the activities of these BOPs. This situation is not unexpected and is probably universal amongst such viral regulators of cellular activities.</p>

After 48 h, these TIME cultures were treated with TPA to induce lytic reactivation, and media and cells were harvested at 0, 3 and 6 days post-induction for determinations of encapsidated genome copy numbers and Bid and Bim expression, respectively. Quantitative PCR was used to determine genome copies following pre-treatment with DNase I to remove any unencapsidated, contaminating viral DNA released from disrupted cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Viruses have numerous and diverse mechanisms of apoptotic inhibition, necessitated by the pro-apoptotic signals induced upon <italic>de novo</italic> infection of a cell and by the processes associated with virus replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Barry1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Postigo1">[55]</xref>). These mechanisms include inhibition by various means of interferon induction and signaling and inactivation and suppression of p53, pro-apoptotic proteins such as BOPs, and caspase mediators of apoptotic signaling. Examples are p53-inhibitory activities of simian virus 40 T-antigen and adenovirus E1B-55K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Burgert1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Pipas1">[57]</xref>, caspase inhibition by HHV-8 specified K7/vIAP and gammaherpesvirus viral FLICE inhibitory (vFLIP) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Wang2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Feng1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Matta1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Thome1">[59]</xref>, and the Bcl-2 homologues specified by herpesviruses (gammaherpesvirus vBcl-2s and human cytomegalovirus UL37x1/vMIA), poxviruses (e.g., fowlpox virus 039), African swine fever virus (A179L), adenovirus (E1B-19K), and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Polster1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Cuconati1">[61]</xref>. These viral Bcl-2 homologues, while not necessarily readily identifiable at the amino acid sequence level, have been demonstrated or are believed to preserve the essential BH-like helical domains and overall three-dimensional hydrophobic groove structure of cellular Bcl-2 proteins to allow their interactions with and inhibition of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and/or apoptotic executioners Bax and Bak. Thus, Bcl-2 “mimicry” is a commonly used mechanism of viral evasion from innate host cell defenses via apoptotic induction. However, alternative mechanisms of direct BOP inhibition by viral proteins have not previously been reported, to our knowledge.</p>
      <p>HHV-8 specifies a number of proteins that have predicted abilities to inhibit apoptosis induced by virus <italic>de novo</italic> infection and lytic replication and therefore have the potential to promote virus infection and establishment of latency and/or productive replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Liang1">[62]</xref>. However, demonstration of such activities in the context of virus infection is largely lacking, although vIRF-1, in part via BBD-dependent interactions, has been found to promote cell survival under lytic-induced stress and to enhance HHV-8 productive replication in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>. Our previous studies identified Bim as a potent negative regulator of HHV-8 productive replication, mapped the binding domain (BBD, residues 170–187) involved in its inhibition, and noted induced nuclear localization of Bim as a means of its inactivation by vIRF-1 to promote HHV-8 replication and cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi1">[8]</xref>. However, the region of Bim interacting with vIRF-1 was not mapped and the possibility of direct inhibition of Bim activity, in addition to inhibition via vIRF-1-induced nuclear sequestration, was not considered.</p>
      <p>The present identification of BH3 as the target of BBD binding to Bim, as well as Bid and other BOPs, and finding of direct inactivation by vIRF-1 of Bid-induced mitochondrial permeabilization <italic>in vitro</italic>, Bim and Bid inhibition by nuclear localization-defective vIRF-1, and inability of vIRF-1 to induce significant Bid (Bid<sub>L</sub>, tBid) nuclear localization, demonstrate that vIRF-1 can inhibit BOPs independently of nuclear translocation. Indeed, in contrast to Bim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>, nuclear localization of Bid was not apparent in lytically infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The mechanism of induced nuclear translocation of Bim could comprise cytoplasmic-to-nuclear chaperoning by vIRF-1 and/or nuclear capture of Bim translocating independently or by other means. The latter would be analogous to HHV-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)-induced nuclear localization of predominantly cytoplasmic GSK3β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Fujimuro1">[63]</xref>, for example. The fact that Bid has been reported to localize in part to the nucleus, and indeed to function here as a component of the DNA repair machinery and as an apoptotic mediator in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Zinkel1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Oberkovitz1">[49]</xref>, indicates that simple “nuclear capture” by vIRF-1 is unlikely to be a mechanism of vIRF-1-induced nuclear sequestration of Bim, as this would be expected to operate for Bid also. Specificity of Bim nuclear chaperoning by vIRF-1 is, similarly, difficult to explain, as Bim and Bid interactions with vIRF-1 occur by the same means (BH3∶BBD binding) and these BOPs, able to move between cellular compartments, appear to be equally susceptible to translocation. It is possible that while both BOPs can enter the nucleus, independently or promoted by vIRF-1, only Bim can, via its association with vIRF-1, form stable interactions with other nuclear proteins to effect its sequestration in this compartment. In trying to resolve this issue, it would be informative to determine whether vIRF-1 can induce nuclear translocation of any of the other BBD-targeted BOPs or if this activity is restricted to Bim. Regardless of mechanism, however, it is apparent that vIRF-1-induced nuclear sequestration of Bim represents a mechanism of inactivation of its pro-apoptotic activity, in addition to its direct inactivation via BH3 binding. It is possible that this is necessary for biologically sufficient inhibition of this powerful negative regulator of HHV-8 productive replication. It is also conceivable that there are as-yet unrecognized nuclear functions of Bim that contribute to HHV-8 lytic replication.</p>
      <p>An important finding of the present study is that vIRF-1 can interact, via its Bid BH3-B-like BBD region, with the BH3 domains of BOPs Bid, Bik, Bmf, Hrk and Noxa in addition to Bim BH3, while refractory to interaction with other tested Bcl-2 family members (other BOPs and multi-BH-domain proteins). Thus, the “Bim-binding domain” of vIRF-1 should more appropriately be referred to as the “BOP-binding domain”. These additional interactions of BBD not only identify multiple new BOP interaction partners of vIRF-1 that could be targeted for inhibition, of likely relevance in the context of HHV-8 biology, but also provide the tools to better understand the molecular basis and specificity of BBD and BH3-B interactions with BH3 domains. Previous studies of the latter identified, via mutagenesis of murine Bid BH3-B sequences and analysis of BH3-B∶BH3 interaction and Bid activity, residues L<sub>35</sub> (first hydrophobic, BH3/BBD-conserved) and G<sub>39</sub>, R<sub>40</sub> and/or E<sub>41</sub> (GHE in human Bid) as important for BH3-B∶BH3 binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and for both physical and functional interactions, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Tan1">[40]</xref>. Our own <italic>in silico</italic>, mutagenesis, and binding studies indicate that for BBD∶BH3 interactions, an alanine residue corresponding to BH3 position “<italic>φ</italic>1+1” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>) is both conserved and specific to all BBD-interacting BOP BH3 domains and important for BBD∶BH3 interaction. An alanine at this position was also identified in BH3-like sequences [R<italic>V</italic><underline>A</underline>DS<italic>L</italic>AT<italic>L</italic>MMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>), S<italic>I</italic><underline>A</underline>NT<italic>I</italic>AS<italic>V</italic>QFM, and I<italic>F</italic><underline>A</underline>ALDYN<italic>L</italic>GRH; <italic>φ</italic>1+1 underlined, collinear hydrophobic residues italicized) isolated from a phage-display screen using BBD as bait. However, because of its simple methyl side chain, it is likely that this alanine residue permits adoption of the required local structure and “space” for binding via other BBD/BH3-residue interactions rather than being involved directly in binding. Thus, while binding was abrogated by mutation of this alanine to most other collinear residues of non-binding BH3s, mutation to cysteine or serine (present in BH3s of Bok and Bax, respectively) was compatible with binding to BBD. Also, introduction of this alanine along with adjacent glutamine and glutamate residues (as present in Bim) into BBD-refractory Bax BH3 was sufficient to confer BBD interaction, although the binding was weaker than that of Bid BH3. Taken together, our data indicate that the <italic>φ</italic>1+1 alanine appears to be preferred and important for BH3 interaction, but that it is unlikely to contribute directly to binding and that other residues, in appropriate context, are directly involved in BH3 association and specificity. In regard to specificity of BH3 binding, we have established definitively that while BBD can recognize Bim and Bid BH3 domains, the former is not targeted by Bid BH3-B. Alignments of BBD and BH3-B, although revealing significant similarities, with three identical and three highly-related residues within the BH3-binding core regions, also show considerable divergence within and outside these central sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002748-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). It is noteworthy that previous di-alanine scanning mutagenesis of the 174–183 region of BBD identified residues within 174–181 as essential for interaction with Bim-BH3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002748-Choi2">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, however, combined mutation of the first two conserved hydrophobic residues, L<sub>174</sub>(qe)I<sub>177</sub>, did not abrogate binding (unpublished data), although identical or related hydrophobic residues are conserved in BH3 domains and are key contributors to the amphipathicity of the predicted α-helix. Single-residue mutagenesis across BBD, to alanine or to collinear BH3-B residues would be warranted to further delineate those amino acids and associated properties contributing to interaction with BH3 domains and to Bim- and Bid-BH3 selectivity.</p>
      <p>In summary, data presented here identify similarity between vIRF-1 BBD and Bid BH3-B, corresponding inhibitory interactions of vIRF-1 BBD with the BH3-domains of Bim and Bid (both induced during and inhibitory to HHV-8 productive replication), and additional BBD binding of the BH3 domains of BOPs Bik, Bmf, Hrk and Noxa. To our knowledge, this is the first example of BOP targeting and inhibition via Bid BH3-B domain mimicry and thereby our data reveal a novel mechanism of viral evasion from host cell, apoptosis-mediated defense against viral infection and replication.</p>

After centrifugation at 1,000×g for 10 min, the supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet was subjected to 25–35% iodixanol discontinuous gradient centrifugation. Nuclei were collected from the interface between 30 and 35% iodixanol and resuspended in buffer C (20 mM HEPES [pH 8.0], 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail). For <italic>in vitro</italic> cytochrome c release assays, mitochondria were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, HEK293T cells grown to subconfluence in a 10 cm dish were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer (MIB: 210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5]) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. Next, cells were homogenized with 40 strokes of Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000×g at 4°C for 10 min. After resuspending in MIB, the resulting pellet was layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 1.2 M sucrose in buffer H (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% BSA) on top of 1.6 M sucrose in buffer H. Following centrifugation at 131,000×g for 2 h at 4°C, mitochondria were recovered at the 1.6–1.2 M sucrose interface, washed in MIB, centrifuged at 13,000×g at 4°C for 10 min, and resuspended in 100 µl of MIB. For other studies, mitochondria were purified using Axis-Shield OptiPrep (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For proteinase K treatment, mitochondria in MIB (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated on ice for 30 min with 20 µg/ml proteinase K; the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mM PMSF, and mitochondria were then washed twice in 1 ml of MIB and resuspended in MIB or MRM buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM ATP, 5 mM sodium succinate, 80 µM ADP, 2 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>). For mitochondrial binding assays, 1 µg of recombinant T7-EGFP or T7-vIRF-1 protein was added to the proteinase K-pretreated or untreated mitochondria in MRM buffer (50 µg protein/50 µl) supplemented with PMSF and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30°C and then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min. The mitochondrial pellets were washed twice in MRM buffer, and the final washed pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 10% final concentration) was added to the supernatants to precipitate proteins prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. For <italic>in vivo</italic> cytochrome c release assay, transfected HEK293T cells were subjected to Dounce homogenization (30 strokes) in MIB buffer.

        <title>HHV-8 replication</title>
        <p>For HHV-8 infection, TIME cells were centrifuged at 1,000×g for 1 h in the presence of HHV-8 virions and then cultured in fresh complete medium for 7 days to allow establishment of latency in the absence of ongoing lytic replication. After lentiviral transduction of control (NS), Bid, or Bim shRNAs for 2 days into HHV-8<sup>+</sup> TIME cells, lytic replication of HHV-8 was induced by treatment with TPA (20 ng/ml) or 1 µg/ml doxycycline (TIME-TRE/RTA cells). For determination of encapsidated HHV-8 genome copy number, viral DNA was isolated using standard phenol extraction and glycogen/ethanol precipitation methods following pre-treatment of virus suspensions with DNaseI for 20 min at 37°C to remove any unencapsidated DNA. For the determination of the viral genome copy number, all qPCRs were performed in a 96-well microplate using an ABI Prism 7500 detection system (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) with SYBR green/ROX master mix (SuperArray Bioscience Corp.; Frederick, MD).

An example of analysis of one cell line, which was used in subsequent studies, is shown. (B) RTA expression in response to different concentrations of Dox (applied for 15 h) was analyzed by immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE fractionated cell extracts using RTA-specific antiserum. Antibody to β-actin was used for immunoblotting to confirm equivalent protein loading. (C) TIME-TRE/RTA cells were infected with HHV-8 r219 (Vieira &amp; O'Hearn; Virology 325:225–240), which expresses GFP constitutively and RFP under the control of a lytic cycle promoter, the latter providing a marker of lytic induction. The cells were allowed to rest for 5 days to ensure establishment of latency and absence of residual lytic replication. These cells expressed GFP in ∼100% of cells, and very few (&lt;1%) expressed RFP. Parallel cultures of these latently infected TIME-TRE/RTA cells were either left untreated or were treated with Dox (1 µg/ml) for the indicated times and then visualized under UV microscopy for detection of RFP<sup>+</sup> cells. (D) An analogous experiment was undertaken using BCBL-1 culture-derived HHV-8, but here immunofluorescence staining for K8.1-encoded late lytic antigen was used to detect cells supporting productive replication. In this experiment, application of Dox was either sustained for 1 or 5 days prior to fixation and immunofluorescence staining or applied for 2 days and then removed prior to IFA analysis 5 days post-induction. For comparison, a parallel culture was treated with TPA (20 ng/ml) for five days prior to K8.1 immunostaining.</p>
