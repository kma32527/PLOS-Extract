        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Herpes simplex</italic> encephalitis (HSE) is a rare, but severe infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1. We have previously characterized a model for HSE in the inbred DA rat which resembles human HSE. Interestingly the inbred PVG rat is completely resistant to the disease and displays reduced or no uptake of viral particles into the peripheral and central nerve compartments respectively. To identify the gene(s) regulating HSE pathogenesis, we crossed the susceptible DA and the resistant PVG.A rats for two generations and infected 239 rats of the F2 (DAxPVG.A) cohort with HSV-1. A genome-wide linkage scan demonstrated one strong quantitative trait locus (QTL), <italic>Hse1</italic>, on rat chromosome 4 regulating disease susceptibility. Fine mapping, haplotype mapping, sequencing and expression analysis of the genes in the <italic>Hse1</italic> interval collectively support the underlying genetic variation to be located in, or adjacent to the calcitonin receptor gene (<italic>Calcr</italic>). Further support for a role of CalcR in regulating HSV-1 replication and propagation is provided by strain-dependent differences in the calcitonin receptor protein tissue localization and in functional studies. Using an unbiased genetic mapping approach this study identifies <italic>Calcr</italic> as a candidate for regulating susceptibility to HSE.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Herpes simplex</italic> type 1 virus (HSV-1) is a member of the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family (<italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic> subfamily) that infects a large fraction of humans resulting in transient cold sores or non-symptomatic infection that persists lifelong in the sensory ganglia. Recurrent herpetic disease results from reactivation of HSV-1 in the sensory ganglia subsequently leading to axonal transport of the virus to the periphery where it causes skin lesions, cold sores, often located around the mouth. However, HSV-1 can also cause a much more severe condition, <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> encephalitis (HSE), an acute inflammatory condition of the brain. Even though <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> is a neurotropic virus, HSE occurs in only 2–3 previously healthy individuals/million/year in all age groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Hjalmarsson1">[1]</xref>. In more than ninety percent of the cases, HSE is caused by HSV type 1 and in the remaining by HSV type 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Aurelius1">[2]</xref>. HSE is characterized by acute onset of focal infection, inflammation and necrosis, mostly starting unilaterally in the fronto-medio-basal temporal lobe. The disease has a tendency to relapse or to have a progressive course <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Skldenberg1">[3]</xref>. The mortality is high and there is significant morbidity among the survivors.</p>
      <p>Host factors contributing to susceptibility or resistance to HSE are still largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Genetic analysis is one approach to identify these factors. Polymorphisms in the UNC-93B and TLR3 genes were shown to regulate susceptibility to HSE in small human pedigrees, in which the production of IFN-α/β and -λ dependent on UNC-93B protein expression controls HSV-1 by TLR3-dependent and/or TLR-independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Casrouge1">[4]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Zhang1">[5]</xref>. In addition, recently, autosomal dominant and recessive deficiencies in TRIF, an adaptor molecule involved in downstream signaling of TLRs, have been reported in a few children with HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-SanchoShimizu1">[6]</xref>. However, in an experimental mouse model for HSE, a natural killer (NK) complex-linked locus, <italic>Rhs1</italic> (resistance to Herpes simplex virus 1), on chromosome 6 has been identified to control resistance to acute and latent HSV-1 infections resulting in HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Pereira1">[7]</xref>. In 2003 Lundberg and colleagues identified in another mouse model of corneal HSV-1 infection an additional locus on chromosome 6, <italic>Hrl</italic> (Herpes resistance locus) influencing survival after HSV-1 infection in C57BL/6J mice and the HSE development in 129S6SvEv/Tac mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Lundberg1">[8]</xref>. Up to date, no HSE susceptibility genes have been identified by positional cloning in mice. Several mouse knock-out studies have shown the complex immune control of HSE, with excessive infiltration of leukocytes leading to the release of cytokines into the CNS suggested to be a major determinant of brain damage after infection, in turn regulating outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Lundberg2">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The aim of the present study was to identify additional host factors determining HSE receptiveness by genetic dissection of the previously characterized discordant HSE susceptibility pattern in the inbred Dark Agouti (DA) and Piebald Virol Glaxo (PVG) rat strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress1">[10]</xref>. This <italic>in vivo</italic> model for HSE in DA rats resembles in some aspects the viral spread seen in human HSE, where the virus starts spreading from the whiskers area of the rats (the labio-facial area in humans), through the trigeminal nerve to the ipsilateral side of the brain stem dispersing both to the contralateral side and towards the thalamus, causing immune activation and lethal encephalitis 5 days post-infection (dpi) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress1">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, in our previous study, PVG rats were found to be completely resistant to development of clinical symptoms and did not show evidence of penetration of virus into the brain. Although both strains showed similar virus presence in the whiskers area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress1">[10]</xref>, as well as in the immediate proximity of nerve endings and small nerve fascicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress2">[11]</xref>, spread of HSV-1 to the brain was only seen in DA rats. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of DA or PVG did not regulate the resistance to HSE, since also MHC congenic PVG.A (RT1.AV1) rats carrying the same MHC haplotype as the DA were protected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress2">[11]</xref>. Similar results have been shown previously in studies with inbred and congenic mice where genes within the H-2 (major histocompatibility complex) did not influence resistance or susceptibility to HSV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Lopez1">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Kastrukoff1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To identify gene loci critical for the strain dependent difference in HSE susceptibility, we performed a genome-wide linkage study in a large F2 (DAxPVG.A) cohort in which all HSV-1 infected F2 rats were phenotyped for disease symptoms. The study identified <italic>Hse1</italic> on chromosome 4 as the single strong quantitative trait locus (QTL). To find the critical gene variant within <italic>Hse1</italic> we performed further analyses using recombinants, haplotype mapping and gene sequencing, as well as expression analysis, visualization of the tissue localization and receptor modulation experiments.</p>

        <title>DAxPVG.A F2 intercross population</title>
        <p>HSV-1 was inoculated into the right whiskers' pad of 45 days old DA rats. However, while DA rats developed a severe, lethal HSE with nearly 100% incidence at 5 days post infection (dpi), both PVG and the PVG.A rats remained completely asymptomatic even after several weeks post infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress1">[10]</xref>. To identify gene regions causing differences in HSE susceptibility, we crossed DA with PVG.A rats for two generations to produce an F2 population. All rats of the F1 generation were resistant to the disease. In a cohort of 239 F2 (DAxPVG.A) rats infected with HSV-1 the total incidence of HSE was 15%. The remaining rats did not show signs/symptoms of disease or were only affected by minimal weight loss around 5 dpi. Stratification for gender showed 20% HSE incidence in F2 males, with mean onset of disease at 6 dpi and 10% HSE incidence in F2 females, with a slightly delayed onset of disease at 8 dpi.

        <title>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regulating HSE incidence</title>
        <p>A genome-wide linkage scan was performed using 127 microsatellite markers on 180 F2 (DAxPVG.A) rats to determine the genomic region(s) influencing susceptibility to HSE. We found a very strong linkage to a region on chromosome 4, designated <italic>Hse1</italic> which regulated the incidence of encephalitis with a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 29.5 at the D4Kini3 marker located at 27.8 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002753-t002">Table 2</xref>). The confidence interval (CI) of <italic>Hse1</italic> is between D4Kini1 and D4Arb25 (24.3–31.1 Mb) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002753-t002">Table 2</xref>). The linkage strength was reduced when analyzing females only, with a LOD score of 12.1. In males the LOD score was 26.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In the entire cohort, 46 rats out of 55 being homozygous for DA alleles at the peak marker developed HSE (84% incidence). In contrast, only 4 rats out of 91 homozygous for PVG alleles in <italic>Hse1</italic> developed HSE (4% incidence), while none of the 34 heterozygous rats developed HSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Another QTL on chromosome 3 (<italic>Hse2</italic>) was found to be significant for HSE incidence in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002753-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Linkage analysis revealed a main QTL on chromosome 4 and additional significant QTLs on chromosome 3 and 10 (black curve); linkage in males (blue curve) and in females (red curve). The horizontal line: significant LOD score genome-wide threshold at <italic>P</italic>≤0.05. Lower dotted horizontal line: suggestive LOD score genome-wide threshold at <italic>P</italic>≤0.63. (B) A genetic map showing the distribution of the 127 microsatellite markers used for linkage analysis of the F2 cohort. (C) HSE main regulating QTL on rat chromosome 4, (<italic>Hse1</italic>) (black curve); linkage in males (blue curve) and in females (red curve). The horizontal line: significant LOD score genome-wide threshold at <italic>P</italic>≤0.05. The 20 microsatellite markers used for chromosome 4 linkage analysis are shown in the <italic>x</italic> axis and the distance between them reflects the recombination fraction in our experimental population rather than physical location. The D4Kini microsatellite makers were designed by our group. The peak marker is D4Kini3 (27.8 Mb). Thick blue horizontal bar above the <italic>x</italic> axis indicate the confidence interval (CI) of <italic>Hse1</italic> in males, whereas the thick red horizontal bar above the <italic>x</italic> axis indicate the CI in females. (D) The effect plots indicate that HSE incidence was driven by DA alleles in both males and females. DD = DA homozygous; DP = DA/PVG.A heterozygous; PP = PVG.A homozygous.</p>

        <title>QTLs regulating other HSE phenotypes</title>
        <p>In addition to HSE incidence, the onset of disease and the body weight change were recorded as phenotypes. Body weight change was determined as the difference between the weight at the day of infection and weight at 5 dpi (d0–d5) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002753-t001">Table 1</xref>). The locus <italic>Hse1</italic> was the main regulator of the onset of disease, which also correlated to body weight change between d0–d5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). <italic>Hse4</italic> and <italic>Hse5</italic> located on chromosomes 6 and 10, showed suggestive linkage to disease onset and weight change between d0–d5 in females, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Notably, for all these QTLs linkage was stronger in males and the effect plots showed disease susceptibility associated with DA alleles. These QTLs are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002753-t002">Table 2</xref>.</p>
        <p>A major host genetic contribution to HSE susceptibility was provided by the <italic>Hse1</italic> locus, contributing with 51% in females and 50% in males to the variance of incidence and further contributing with 54% in females and 64% in males to the variance of onset. Additional interactive QTLs specific for each sex were identified in a number of chromosomes collectively contributing to more than 90% of the variance in most phenotypes in females and less in males, indicating a more complex regulation of HSE in females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002753.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>Hse1</italic> regulated HSE incidence in congenic lines</title>
        <p>To obtain direct experimental proof that gene(s) in the region indeed regulate HSE susceptibility, and for further genetic dissection we bred a set of congenic lines.

Notably, the non-overlapping fragment between on the one hand DA.PVGc4-<italic>Hse1</italic> and on the other hand the R2, R11 and R21 congenic lines delineates the disease regulatory effect of <italic>Hse1</italic> to a region between D4Kini3 – D4Mgh14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>To fine map the regulatory effect within the large CI of <italic>Hse1</italic> obtained from the initial F2 linkage analysis (24.3–31.1 Mb∼6.8 Mb region), the entire initial F2 population together with additional F2 rats recombinant in the CI from a parallel intercross were genotyped with more microsatellite markers within the CI (D4Kini2, D4Kini4–D4Kini16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002753.s002">Table S2</xref>).

        <p>To further define the CI and the exact region governing the disease susceptibility, we determined the development of HSE symptoms in a panel of other inbred rat strains and correlated their susceptibility to the allelic variation in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that the Lewis (LEW), Fisher 344 (F344) and Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) were susceptible to HSE and developed a similar disease phenotype as DA, while the Bio Breeding type 1 diabetic rat (BB) and Brown Norway (BN) in similar to PVG were resistant. Other inbred strains developed a different disease pattern from DA, where some rats developed HSE symptoms while others displayed only mild or no symptoms of disease. These strains were considered to develop an intermediate phenotype, and included the August Copenhagen Irish (ACI), Wistar Furth (WF) and Fawn-Hooded (E3) strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Based on the haplotype map in this larger set of inbred strains, the disease regulatory effect was suggested to be located within a smaller, 0.17 Mb region (CI D4Kini5–D4Kini7; 28.37–28.54 Mb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002753.s002">Table S2</xref>). However, the haplotype map was based on the susceptibility to HSE and the development of clinical symptoms in each strain after infection and not the viral presence in the CNS. The haplotype map also suggests a more complex genetic regulation of susceptibility <italic>vs.</italic> resistance to HSE, since the resistant BN strain carries the same genotype in this region as the susceptible strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This supports the notion that different genes might be involved in regulating the clinical phenotype of HSE as well as pattern of virus spread across different strains.</p>

        <p>In order to study if these polymorphisms might affect translational stability, splicing or transcriptional control, we determined the mRNA expression pattern for <italic>Ccdc132</italic>, <italic>Calcr</italic> and <italic>Tfpi2</italic> in the whiskers area, the trigeminal ganglia and the brain stem using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g006">Figure 6A–D</xref>). The most conspicuous finding was that PVG.A rats displayed higher <italic>Calcr</italic> expression in the whiskers area both in all controls as well as after HSV-1 infection compared to DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g006">Figure 6B and 6D</xref>). Little or no expression of <italic>Calcr</italic> was detected in the trigeminal ganglia in both strains, indicating that the influence of <italic>Calcr</italic> is located in the periphery. <italic>Calcr</italic> has three splice variants; the primer used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g006">Figure 6</xref> covered exons common for all the variants. No differences in expression between the strains were detected when measuring the splice form of <italic>Calcr.1b</italic>, however it was expressed more in the brain, with no or low expression in the trigeminal ganglia and the whiskers area, respectively (data not shown). The expression of <italic>Tfpi2</italic> was significantly higher only after infection in the trigeminal ganglia (2 dpi) and the brain stem (4 dpi) in DA rats compared to PVG rats. This could partly be explained by the presence of the virus in these compartments, since no difference was detected in the periphery.

        <p>In a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress2">[11]</xref>, we have shown that HSV-1 staining was similarly distributed in the whiskers area after infection in PVG and DA rats, but subsequently it became strongly increased, mostly in the perineurium, in DA rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> the layer of connective tissue surrounding the nerve fascicles/bundles of peripheral nerves.

Interestingly, the tissue distribution of CalcR staining differed between the infected DA and PVG.A rats. In DA rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g007">Figure 7C, 7E, 7I and 7K</xref>), CalcR staining was present mainly in perineurial cells and in the endoneurium, while in PVG.A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g007">Figure 7F, 7H, 7L and 7N</xref>) rats it was expressed more in the outer part of the epineurium.

        <p>To investigate the influence of <italic>Calcr</italic> on HSV-1 entry and spread to the CNS <italic>in vivo</italic> in DA rats, we modulated the calcitonin receptor by injecting rat Amylin, an agonist for calcitonin receptor, or Calcitonin (8–32) (Salmon I), a potent and selective antagonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Hilton1">[16]</xref>, into the whiskers area prior to the infection. A scrambled peptide (similar to the amino acid composition of rat Amylin, but in reverse order) was used as control to the rat Amylin. Treatment was performed in 44 days old DA rats, 18 hours before the infection with HSV-1. The rats were examined and weighed every day from the day of the injection with the modifying substances until 11 dpi, to check for signs and symptoms of disease development.</p>
        <p>Treatment with rat Amylin significantly improved the survival of the DA rats from 0 to 75% after infection compared to the control group, which was only HSV-1 infected. The survival rate in rats treated with Calcitonin (8–32) (Salmon I) group was 62%. In contrast, only 20% of rats injected with the scrambled control peptide survived until day 11 after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and all the control rats died.

        <title>Modulation of HSV-1 infection <italic>in vitro</italic> by CalcR transfection</title>
        <p>To study susceptibility mechanisms at the molecular level, we performed infections of primary neuronal cell cultures from DA and PVG rats' dorsal root ganglia. No differences in susceptibility to infection were detected in these cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown), indicating that <italic>in vivo</italic>, other features of the natural environment of the neurons contribute to the susceptibility or tolerance to infection.</p>
        <p>In addition to assess whether CalcR expression could modulate infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic>, HEK293T cells, which are semi-permissive to HSV-1 infection, were transfected with a plasmid encoding for a myc-tagged version of RAMP1, a receptor activity-modifying intracellular protein which is transported to the cell surface by CalcR and is necessary for the responsiveness of CalcR to amylin, alone or in combination with plasmids encoding for the human or the rat CalcR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Staining for myc-tag and CalcR showed that in co-transfection experiments only RAMP1 expressing cells also co-expressed the CalcR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), even though detection of the human CalcR was weaker, possibly due to lower reactivity of the antibody with the receptor form found in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Transfected cells were then infected with HSV-1 for 24 hours and HSV-1 infection and replication were assessed by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. RAMP1 or RAMP1/Human CalcR transfected cells were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9A–9C</xref>) for the percentage of HSV-1infected cells, which indicates how permissive the cells were to the virus, as well as for the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HSV-1 staining in the infected population, which reflects the level of virus replication in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9E–9H</xref>), no change in the proportion of HSV-1 infected cells could be seen between RAMP1 only or RAMP1/human CalcR transfected cells, indicating that in these semi-permissive cells the expression of CalcR did not alter virus uptake and internalization. However, the addition of rat Amylin (calcitonin agonist) reduced both the number of cells infected by HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9E</xref>) as well as the MFI of staining for structural viral components in the infected cells population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9F</xref>). The experiment was repeated with transfection of the rat CalcR yielding similar results (data not shown). To assess whether the kinetics of CalcR triggering could affect virus replication, transfected cell cultures were incubated with rat Amylin at different time points (before, during and after infection, or only after infection) and the same analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002753-g009">Figure 9G and 9H</xref>). As expected from the previous experiment, rat Amylin significantly decreased the infectivity as well as the intensity of staining for virus structural components in cells that were co-transfected with RAMP1 and CalcR, but not in those transfected with the receptor modifier RAMP1 alone. In addition, the effect was slightly more pronounced in the cultures that were pretreated with rat Amylin prior to infection. Experiments involving the CalcR antagonist Calcitonin (8–32) (Salmon I) were performed in transfected HEK293T cells as described for rat Amylin but showed no modulator effect <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that the antagonist has an alternative mode of action <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown). Finally, to assess whether the CalcR could serve as a receptor or co-receptor for virus entry in a non-permissive <italic>in vitro</italic> system, we utilized a rat adeno-carcinoma cell line (CRL-1666) that cannot be readily infected with HSV1 and transfected and infected it in the same way as described above for HEK293T cells. Regardless of CalcR expression, these cells remained non-permissive, ruling out a role of CalcR as a receptor for virus infection <italic>per se</italic> (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We here demonstrate a potent genetically regulated host factor critical for <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type-1 neuro-invasion mapping to a small genome fragment on rat chromosome 4. Though very strong circumstantial evidence suggest genetic variants of the <italic>Calcr</italic> gene to be responsible, ultimate proof will require further experiments.</p>
      <p>HSV-1 infects the majority of the population inducing cold sores in affected individuals. Human necropsy studies suggest that viral DNA can be isolated from nearly all post-mortem brains, implying that with time most individuals are infected. However, in younger people (between 20 to 49 years of age) HSV-1 serology suggests that only 50–60% have been infected, as reported by independent studies in different populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Malvy1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Karjala1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Tunback1">[19]</xref>. These studies also demonstrate an increasing prevalence of HSV-1 infection with age. Thus, different susceptibility patterns to establish HSV-1 infection are possible in the human population. Therefore, our findings in the rat are not necessarily in contradiction to the situation in humans. Alternatively, the differences in susceptibility through peripheral nervous system (PNS) uptake and transport of the virus, as here documented in the rat, species are not relevant for human herpes infection. A third possibility is that the molecule is not subject to genetic variation in humans, but still being important mechanistically for viral-host interactions.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, in two to three individuals per million per year, the virus infection leads to a much more devastating condition with invasion and replication of virus in the CNS, causing focal necrotizing plaques affecting primarily the temporal and inferior frontal lobes of the brain. Although rare, HSE remains the most common cause of acute, sporadic viral encephalitis in the Western world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-SanchoShimizu2">[20]</xref>. The underlying host determinants regulating HSE susceptibility are largely unknown.</p>
      <p>The entry of HSV-1 into the host cells is known to depend on the interaction of several glycoproteins on the surface of the enveloped virus with receptors on the surface of the host cell. These entry receptors include Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), nectin-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Subramanian1">[21]</xref>. Through these known entry receptors the virus remains latent in sensory neurons. However, still little is known about the host factors that influence reactivation and the different entry ports of HSV-1 into the CNS.</p>
      <p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> model used in this study in 45 days old rats simulates the human infection in a number of aspects. It starts from the whiskers area corresponding to the labio-facial area in humans. Interestingly, DA rats at an age of over 60 days at infection were resistant to HSE disease phenotype development, while PVG rats below an age of 30 days were susceptible (unpublished observation). Age dependent effects on susceptibility to HSE have been described previously and it has been recognized in many viral infections of man and experimental animal species. Metabolic and hormonal changes, antibody responses, inhibitory substances, anatomical characteristics, and interferon production have all been suggested to explain this development of resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Johnson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Abel1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The virus in the DA susceptibility model penetrated the trigeminal nerve and the ipsilateral side of the brain stem after infection, subsequently spreading in contralateral and cranial direction within the CNS. While high virus titers were observed in the DA rats, no traces of HSV-1 could be detected in the resistant PVG, nor live virus was retrieved from the trigeminal ganglia or the brain stem using qRT-PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress1">[10]</xref> or immunohistochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-BereczkyVeress2">[11]</xref>. These findings support the notion of an underlying genetic difference affecting the ability of HSV-1 to enter the nervous system of PVG rats.</p>
      <p>Given the dichotomous difference in HSE susceptibility between the DA and PVG strains, HSV-1 infection of an F2 (DAxPVG.A) intercross was performed in order to identify the underlying genetic determinants in an unbiased fashion. The main finding of the linkage analysis was the identification of a new QTL on rat chromosome 4, <italic>Hse1</italic>.This QTL was the main regulator of disease both in males and females. In female rats the regulation of HSE seems to be more complicated as linkage analysis identified three additional smaller QTLs regulating different disease phenotypes suggesting the influence of other genes in disease development. The observed sex difference is in concordance with previous findings in the mouse, where sex dependent differences have been shown for the <italic>Hrl</italic> (Herpes resistance locus) locus and the <italic>Sml</italic> (sex modifier locus) locus which enhance resistance in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Lundberg1">[8]</xref>. These two QTLs identified on mouse chromosome 6 correspond to a region towards the end of rat chromosome 4, outside the identified QTLs found in this study. However, <italic>Hse1</italic> was confirmed as the main disease regulating region by infecting congenic lines. The antigen-presenting lectin-like receptor gene complex (APLEC) located towards the end of chromosome 4 was previously reported to have a disease regulatory effect in a different model of HSV-1-induced encephalitis in the DA strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Guo1">[15]</xref>. However, in this present study by infecting R17 congenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Lorentzen1">[24]</xref> rats with HSV-1, we could not confirm any HSE regulation by the APLEC genes region. The use of additional microsatellite markers, inclusion of more F2 rats with allelic recombinations and haplotype mapping in a set of inbred strains within the <italic>Hse1</italic> region made it possible to narrow down the confidence interval to a region of 3 genes. However, the finding that HSE resistant BN rats carry the same genotype as the DA rats in this region, suggests the existence of additional gene regions regulating HSE resistance in the BN rat. This demonstrates the significance of studying the genetic regulation in several inbred strains to enable the identification of all genes influencing the complexity of disease susceptibility.</p>
      <p>Sequencing of the genes in the <italic>Hse1</italic> region identified a number of SNP variants mainly in the <italic>Ccdc132</italic>, <italic>Calcr</italic> and <italic>Tfpi2</italic> genes of the PVG.A strain, all of which were silent SNP variations. These silent variants do not change the amino acid sequence of the proteins; nevertheless these variants could possibly affect the translational stability, splicing or transcriptional control of these genes in PVG rats. Interestingly, we found that the mRNA expression of <italic>Calcr</italic> was significantly higher in the whiskers area both in the naïve and the infected PVG.A rats.</p>
      <p>Two microRNAs (miRNAs) are present within the <italic>Calcr</italic>, rno-mir-489 and rno-mir-653. MiRNAs are short (22±3 nucleotides) RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to 3′-untranslated regions (3′UTR) of target mRNAs, thereby inducing translational silencing and/or transcript degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Ambros1">[25]</xref>. Both rno-miR-489 and rno-miR-653 are predicted to regulate a vast numbers of genes, making speculation on miRNA function difficult (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do" xlink:type="simple">http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.targetscan.org/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirdb.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mirdb.org/</ext-link>). Notably, there were no SNP variations in the sequence of mir-489 and mir-653 in DA and PVG. The levels of expression of the mature miR-489 and miR-653 were significantly higher at 5 dpi in PVG rats, resembling <italic>Calcr</italic> expression pattern in the whiskers area. However, both mature and mature* miR-489 and miR-653 were less abundant in the whiskers tissue, arguing against an influence on HSE susceptibility.</p>
      <p>Calcitonin receptor (<italic>Calcr</italic>) is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor which binds the peptide hormone calcitonin (32 amino acid residue), secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland and is involved in the maintenance of the calcium homeostasis, particularly with respect to bone formation and metabolism. The ‘calcitonin family’ is a group of peptide hormones that share structural similarities with calcitonin and includes calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), amylin, adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2 (intermedin). Heterodimerization of CalcR with any of the three receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) forms the multimeric amylin receptors AMY1 (CT+RAMP1), AMY2 (CT+RAMP2), and AMY3 (CT+RAMP3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Naot1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Morfis1">[27]</xref>. The CalcR is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types including the CNS, which also differs according to the developmental stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Pondel1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Mori1">[29]</xref>. In bone, it is restricted to osteoclasts, where it regulates their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Shen1">[30]</xref>. Little is known about the role of the CalcR in other tissues and it has not been previously implicated in infectious conditions.</p>
      <p>Of great interest is the amylin hormone (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP); 37 amino acid residues), which is similar in structure to calcitonin hormone and signals through <italic>Calcr</italic>. It is secreted by pancreatic β-cells parallel to insulin and is associated with type 2 diabetes development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002753-Marzban1">[31]</xref>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> use of CalcR agonist rat Amylin to modulate CalcR significantly enhanced the survival of DA rats after HSV-1 infection compared to controls. However, modulating an <italic>in vitro</italic> system using CalcR transfection of cell lines suggested that the presence of CalcR does not directly influence the infectivity of cells. Nevertheless, amylin signaling through CalcR could decrease the viral infection and/or replication inside cells through a more complex mode of action. In the same way the differences in expression levels together with the tissue localization of CalcR in DA and PVG rats could play a role in the degree of signaling through the receptor and thereby affect further viral spread. In addition, the high CalcR protein expression in the peri- and endoneurium layers in DA rats, together with the low <italic>Calcr</italic> expression in the trigeminal ganglia suggest a possible alternative route of axonal transport to the CNS causing encephalitis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we here demonstrate that <italic>Hse1</italic> is the main genetic determinant for the susceptibility of DA rats to HSE and that it co-regulates differences in expression and tissue localization of <italic>Calcr</italic>. In addition, a direct clinical effect is evident by <italic>in vivo</italic> modulation of CalcR signaling. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments, however, do not support a role of CalcR simply as a regulator of viral entry into cells, but rather to modulate infectivity and replication in a more complex fashion. Further studies are needed to define the contribution of the <italic>Calcr</italic> gene to HSE susceptibility, which may define novel mechanistic pathways involved in HSV-1 pathogenesis.</p>

Susceptible inbred strains debut with severe clinical HSE symptoms including coordination/balance disturbance, paralysis and/or die at 5 dpi. All rats were monitored for clinical HSE symptoms and weighed daily for 11 days, the set end time-point of the experiment. This was done considering that F2 animals possess different genetic composition compared to parental inbred strains and could present a different disease course. The HSE phenotypes followed in this study include; 1) Incidence: diseased rats were defined by the detection of clinical symptoms of HSE such as difficulties with coordination and balance, paralysis, weight loss &gt;20% and death before day 10; whereas not diseased rats were defined as rats not showing any HSE symptoms. 2) Onset: defined by the first day of two consecutive days of weight loss or death. 3) Body weight change: measured by the differences in body weight at day 0, the start of the experiment and weight at 5 dpi. If animals showed body weight loss &gt;20%, ataxia or paralysis the rats were euthanized and considered diseased.</p>
