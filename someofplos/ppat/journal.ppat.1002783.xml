        <p>Ubiquitin (Ub) is a vital regulatory component in various cellular processes, including cellular responses to viral infection. As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses have the capacity to manipulate the ubiquitin (Ub) cycle to their advantage by encoding Ub-modifying proteins including deubiquitinases (DUBs). However, how cellular DUBs modulate specific viral infections, such as norovirus, is poorly understood. To examine the role of DUBs during norovirus infection, we used WP1130, a small molecule inhibitor of a subset of cellular DUBs. Replication of murine norovirus in murine macrophages and the human norovirus Norwalk virus in a replicon system were significantly inhibited by WP1130. Chemical proteomics identified the cellular DUB USP14 as a target of WP1130 in murine macrophages, and pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP14 inhibited murine norovirus infection. USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB that also binds to inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a critical mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR). WP1130 treatment of murine macrophages did not alter proteasome activity but activated the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) through an IRE1-dependent mechanism. In addition, WP1130 treatment or induction of the UPR also reduced infection of other RNA viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus, Sindbis virus, and La Crosse virus but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Pharmacologic inhibition of the IRE1 endonuclease activity partially rescued the antiviral effect of WP1130. Taken together, our studies support a model whereby induction of the UPR through cellular DUB inhibition blocks specific viral infections, and suggest that cellular DUBs and the UPR represent novel targets for future development of broad spectrum antiviral therapies.</p>

        <p>Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are enzymes, which are implicated in many cellular processes but their functions during virus infection are not well understood. We used WP1130, a small molecule inhibitor of a subset of DUBs, as a probe to unravel the functions of DUBs during norovirus infections. We identified USP14 as a cellular DUB target of WP1130 that is required for optimal norovirus infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chemical induction of the unfolded protein response can significantly inhibit viral progeny production of several RNA viruses, including noroviruses. These results suggest that chemical inhibition of cellular DUBs and/or modulation of the unfolded protein response could represent novel targets for therapy against a variety of viral pathogens.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Noroviruses are small non-enveloped viruses with positive-strand RNA genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Green1">[1]</xref>. Human Norovirus (HuNoV) is the major cause of sporadic and epidemic non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide in people of all ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Atmar1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Koopmans1">[3]</xref>. Typically these infections result in high morbidity and economic costs but occasionally cause mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-vanAsten1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-vandenBrandhof1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lee1">[6]</xref>. However, no directed antiviral treatments or vaccination strategies are currently available to prevent or control norovirus outbreaks. This is in part due to the inability to reproducibly culture HuNoV in the laboratory, which has seriously hampered studies of this pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Duizer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Guix1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lay1">[9]</xref>. Recently, a replicon system was developed by stably expressing a plasmid containing the prototypic norovirus strain, Norwalk virus, and an antibiotic resistant cassette enabling limited studies on the replication requirements of HuNoV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang3">[12]</xref>. In addition, the discovery of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) and identification of murine macrophages and dendritic cells as permissive cell types led to the development of the first norovirus cell culture system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Karst1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Wobus1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Wobus2">[15]</xref>. MNV shares many biological and molecular properties with HuNoV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Wobus2">[15]</xref>. Like its human counterparts, MNV is an enteric virus that is infectious after oral inoculation, replicates in the intestine and is shed in the stool, resulting in fecal-oral transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Wobus2">[15]</xref>. MNV also shares the typical genomic organization, biophysical properties of the viral capsid, and molecular mechanisms of translation initiation with HuNoV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Wobus2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Daughenbaugh1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Daughenbaugh2">[17]</xref>. Therefore, research using MNV is increasingly uncovering principles of norovirus biology.</p>
      <p>The ubiquitin (Ub) cycle is required for many cellular processes, including proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Glickman1">[18]</xref> and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Rong1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Gao1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kaneko1">[21]</xref>), a cellular process whereby cells respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Diehl1">[22]</xref>. Ub-conjugating and Ub-deconjugating processes are precisely and tightly regulated, and dysregulation can lead to disease (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lehman1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Hussain1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Shackelford1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Rytkonen1">[26]</xref>). Ub is a small 76 amino acid protein that can be covalently linked to cellular proteins in a post-translational manner through a series of Ub-modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Finley1">[27]</xref>. Removal of Ub by deubiquitinases (DUBs) is a critical step to counterbalance Ub conjugation. DUBs are a group of cysteine proteases that process poly-Ub during protein translation, recycle partially catalyzed Ub intermediates, remove Ub from target proteins, and process free polymeric Ub chains cleaved from target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Isaacson1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Petroski1">[29]</xref>. Based on common structural features, DUBs are divided into five families, including the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH) and the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-ReyesTurcu1">[30]</xref>. USPs are the largest and most diverse DUB family and target proteins with Ub modifications. In addition to the well-characterized roles of DUBs in proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lee2">[31]</xref>, DUBs have been implicated in regulating other universal cellular processes such as the UPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Nagai1">[32]</xref>. The sensors inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR (double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase)-like ER Kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) initiate the three arms of the UPR, which collectively upregulate ER chaperone expression, increase ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and attenuate protein translation to reduce the amount of misfolded proteins in the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Diehl1">[22]</xref>. A recent study demonstrated that USP14 interacts with the cytoplasmic region of IRE1 to inhibit ERAD under non-stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Nagai1">[32]</xref>. While details of the USP14-IRE1 regulation remain to be determined, these studies suggest a critical role for ubiquitin and DUBs in the UPR.</p>
      <p>As obligate intracellular pathogens, many viruses manipulate the Ub cycle to their advantage by hijacking cellular Ub-modifying enzymes, including DUBs, or by encoding proteases and isopeptidases that recognize Ub-modified proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Isaacson1">[28]</xref>. However, how cellular DUBs function in modifying viral infections is poorly understood. One recent study showed that the cellular DUB USP11 restricts influenza A virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Liao1">[33]</xref>. The monoubiquitinated nucleoprotein associates with the ribonucleoprotein complex during viral replication. USP11 can cleave monoubiquitin from the nucleoprotein, inhibiting colocalization of the nucleoprotein in ribonucleoprotein complexes and significantly inhibiting viral replication. This suggests that DUBs may function as cell-intrinsic restriction factors during virus infections, but whether DUBs also promote virus infections is unknown. Furthermore, the role of DUBs during norovirus infection has not previously been addressed.</p>
      <p>To examine the role of DUBs during norovirus infection, we used a small molecule, WP1130, which inhibits a subset of cellular DUBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>. WP1130 is a cell permeable inhibitor of DUBs that induces the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in multiple cell lines including the MNV-permissive murine macrophage line RAW 264.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Burkholder1">[35]</xref>. In Z138 mantle cell lymphoma cells, WP1130 inhibits USP9x, USP5, USP14, UCH37, UCH-L1, and potentially other DUBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>. In addition to its anti-cancer activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Bartholomeusz1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Sun1">[37]</xref>, WP1130 has anti-bacterial effects since treatment enhances killing of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in murine macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Burkholder1">[35]</xref>. Herein, we show that WP1130 also significantly inhibited MNV-1 infection in murine macrophages and genomic replication of Norwalk virus in the replicon system. USP14, a proteasome-associated DUB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Borodovsky1">[38]</xref>, was subsequently identified as a target of WP1130 in murine macrophages. Inhibition of USP14 activity reduced MNV-1 infection but WP1130 did not inhibit proteasome activity. Instead, WP1130 treatment activated the UPR. Pharmacologic activation of the UPR with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Thastrup1">[39]</xref>, also significantly inhibited MNV-1 infection. This effect was not limited to noroviruses or murine macrophages. A similar inhibition of viral infection by WP1130 was demonstrated in African green monkey kidney (Vero) and human neuroblastoma (Be2-c) cells with several RNA viruses including, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Sindbis virus, and La Crosse virus but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In all cases, the antiviral activity of WP1130 was partially reversed by inhibition of IRE1 endonuclease activity. In addition, WP1130 also significantly decreased MNV-1 infection near the injection site in the jejunum/duodenum of mice. Taken together, our results suggest that WP1130 restricts viral replication in part through the IRE1-dependent UPR, which is activated upon inhibition of DUBs. Thus, DUB inhibitors and UPR activators could provide a novel approach in antiviral therapy.</p>

        <title>The small molecule DUB inhibitor WP1130 inhibits MNV-1 replication</title>
        <p>The role of cellular DUBs during norovirus infection has not been investigated. Towards that end, we used WP1130, a small molecule that inhibits a subset of DUBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Murine macrophages were treated with 5 µM WP1130 for 30 minutes prior to MNV-1 infection (strain MNV-1.CW3), and viral titers were determined by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Pre-treatment with WP1130 significantly reduced viral titers in both RAW 264.7 (RAW) cells, a murine macrophage cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the antiviral effect of WP1130 was only observed during the early stages of infection. Addition of the compound post-infection (1 hour after infection for RAW cells or 4 hours after infection for BMDMs) ablated WP1130 antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Under the same conditions, the compound's effect on mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, an indicator for cell viability, was not significantly different from the DMSO control as measured by WST-1 reagent (Roche) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002783.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Overall, these results suggested that WP1130 inhibits MNV-1 infection of murine macrophages, but only when added to cells before or early during infection.</p>

            <p>(A, B) WP1130 treatment inhibits MNV-1 infection in (A) RAW 264.7 (RAW) cells or (B) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Cells were infected with MNV-1 (MOI 5) in the presence of 5 µM WP1130 or DMSO (−). Cells were incubated with WP1130 30 min prior to infection (pre) or at the indicated times post-infection. Virus titers were determined by plague assay 8 hours (RAW) or 12 hours (BMDMs) post-infection. (C) MNV-1 attachment to murine macrophages is not significantly altered by WP1130 treatment. MNV-1 (MOI 5) was incubated for 1 hour on ice with RAW cells treated with 5 µM WP1130 or DMSO. Virus attachment was quantified by qRT-PCR. (D) WP1130 does not inhibit MNV-1 entry. RAW cells were infected with neutral red-containing MNV-1 (MOI 0.001) for 60 min at room temperature and then illuminated with white light. Cells were either treated prior to infection (pre-treatment) or treated for 90 minutes after infection (post-treatment) with 5 µM WP1130 or DMSO. To show the dynamic range of the assay, cells treated with DMSO were also illuminated with white light at the same time as infection was initiated (0 min). (E) WP1130 treatment inhibits MNV-1 replication. MNV-1 genomic RNA was transfected into RAW cells and quantified either 12 hours (Input) or 24 hours later using qRT-PCR.

        <p>These results raised the possibility that WP1130 was effective at an early step in the MNV-1 life cycle. To determine the effect of WP1130 treatment on viral attachment, the amount of viral particles bound to cells was measured using a qRT-PCR attachment assay previously described by our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Taube1">[40]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). RAW cells were incubated with vehicle control (DMSO) or 5 µM WP1130 prior to infection, infected with MNV-1 on ice, washed, and cell-attached viral genomes were quantitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). While the genome levels on WP1130-treated cells were slightly decreased compared to DMSO-treated cells, this difference was not statistically significant, suggesting that MNV-1 attachment was not affected by WP1130 treatment.</p>
        <p>We next examined the effect of WP1130 treatment on viral entry (<italic>i.e.</italic> attachment, internalization, and uncoating) using the neutral red assay previously adapted for use with MNV in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Perry1">[41]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Neutral red, a photo-activated chemical, is passively incorporated into viral particles, which when exposed to white light cross-links the viral genome to the protein coat and renders the virus non-infectious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Brandenburg1">[42]</xref>. This assay enables examination of MNV entry in the presence of inhibitor without impacting later stages of the viral life cycle. RAW cells were treated with WP1130 or DMSO prior to or after infection with neutral red-containing MNV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). To show the dynamic range of the assay, RAW cells treated with DMSO were illuminated at the same time as viral infection was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, DMSO 0 min) or after 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, DMSO 60 min) when MNV-1 was previously shown to become insensitive to light inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Perry1">[41]</xref>. The number of infectious events was normalized to the DMSO control at 60 minutes prior to illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, DMSO 60 min). WP1130 treatment did not alter viral infectivity when RAW cells were treated with WP1130 either prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, WP1130 pre-treatment) or after 60 minutes of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, WP1130 post-treatment). Interestingly, a reduction in plaque size was observed for WP1130-treated samples, although this was not statistically different from the DMSO control samples. This suggested that WP1130 may have inhibited viral infection in the early stages of plaque development, but not for the entire length of the experiment. Taken together, these findings suggested that WP1130 does not inhibit attachment, internalization, or uncoating of MNV-1 in RAW cells.</p>
        <p>A critical next step in the viral life cycle following entry is replication. Thus, to determine whether WP1130 treatment inhibited viral replication, MNV-1 genomes were isolated from infected cell lysates and transfected into RAW cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). MNV-1 genomes were quantified by qRT-PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Taube1">[40]</xref> either after transfection for 12 hours but prior to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, input), or after an additional 12 hour treatment with WP1130 or DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). WP1130 treatment significantly reduced the number of MNV-1 genomes compared to DMSO-treated cells, demonstrating that WP1130 inhibited viral replication.</p>
        <p>It is currently not possible to follow the full infectious cycle of HuNoV in a laboratory setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Duizer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Guix1">[8]</xref>. However, the Norwalk virus replicon system measures Norwalk virus genomic replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang1">[10]</xref>. Thus, we next determined whether WP1130 treatment also inhibited replication of Norwalk virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). Replicon-bearing hepatoma HG23 cells were grown in the presence of WP1130 or DMSO for 24 hours, and Norwalk virus genomes quantitated using qRT-PCR as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang1">[10]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). The number of Norwalk virus genomes was reduced approximately 50% upon treatment with WP1130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). As a positive control, HG23 cells were treated with ribavirin, a nucleoside analog that inhibits Norwalk virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang2">[11]</xref>. Similar to previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chang2">[11]</xref>, ribavirin reduced replication to approximately 20% of the DMSO-treated cells. These results demonstrated that WP1130 significantly inhibits Norwalk virus replication.</p>
        <p>Taken together, our findings demonstrated that WP1130 is an effective inhibitor of MNV-1 and Norwalk virus replication but did not block the earlier stages of MNV-1 infection, namely attachment and entry. Since WP1130 is a known inhibitor of a subset of DUBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>, these results suggested that all or some of the WP1130-responsive cellular DUBs are important for optimal norovirus replication.</p>

        <title>WP1130 treatment inhibits the cellular deubiquitinase USP14</title>
        <p>We next sought to identify DUBs that may mediate the antiviral activity in macrophages observed during WP1130 treatment. Towards that end, we employed two independent labeling strategies; first, an activity-based DUB labeling assay, and second, a biotinylated WP1130 to facilitate pull-down of macrophage-expressed DUBs with affinity for WP1130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Activity-based DUB profiling utilizes an HA-tagged Ub (HA-Ub-vinyl sulfone; HA-UbVS), which irreversibly binds to the active site of DUBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>. RAW cells were treated with 5 µM WP1130 or DMSO prior to infection with MNV-1 or mock lysate, washed, and media containing WP1130 or DMSO added back for one hour. RAW cells were then lysed by sonication, and HA-tagged soluble proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. Multiple DUBs reproducibly showed greater HA labeling upon infection with MNV-1 in DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, some of these active DUBs were inhibited by WP1130 treatment following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Of particular interest was a band with the approximate molecular weight for USP14, a cellular DUB previously identified as a target of WP1130 in lymphoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrow head). To specifically address whether USP14 activity was inhibited by WP1130 treatment, we labeled DUBs in mock- and MNV-1-infected RAW cells that were treated with DMSO or WP1130. Active DUBs were labeled with HA-UbVS, immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and USP14 was detected by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> top). Four independent experiments demonstrated that WP1130 treatment significantly reduced USP14 activity in both mock- and virally-infected samples compared to DMSO, but not compared to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, quantitation). As a control, total USP14 levels were examined by immunoblots in parallel experiments. No change in total USP14 protein levels were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, middle), suggesting WP1130 did not cause USP14 degradation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that USP14 activity is inhibited by WP1130 in RAW cells without affecting total protein levels, and that USP14 activity and WP1130 inhibition of this activity is independent of viral infection.</p>

            <p>(A) WP1130 treatment inhibits the activity of multiple DUBs in murine macrophages. RAW cells were treated with DMSO (D, V+D) or 5 µM WP1130 (V+WP) for 30 minutes prior to infection. Cells were then infected with MNV-1 (V+D, V+WP) or mock lysate (D), washed, and incubated for an additional hour. Cell lysates were incubated with a non-hydrolysable ubiquitin conjugated to an HA tag (HA-UbVS) before separation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. The experiment was performed three times and a representative blot is shown. A band of the anticipated molecular weight for USP14 is indicated by the arrow head. (B) WP1130 treatment inhibits USP14 activity. RAW cells were treated with DMSO (D) or 5 µM WP1130 (WP) and then infected with MNV-1 (MOI 5) or mock lysate, washed, and incubated for an additional hour. Cell lysates were labeled with HA-UbVS and immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots performed using an anti-USP14 antibody. A representative blot is shown (top, Active USP14). Densitometry was performed on four independent experiments, quantitated, and normalized to the mock- and DMSO-treated sample (bottom, Quantitation of Active USP14). As a control, immunoblots were performed for total USP14 levels in cell lysates prior to DUB labeling (middle, Total USP14). (C) Biotinylated WP1130 inhibits MNV-1 infection in RAW cells. Cells were treated with DMSO or 5 µM of WP1130 (WP1130), biotinylated WP1130 (Biotin), inactive biotinylated WP1130 analog (Null Biotin) prior to MNV-1 infection (MOI 5). Viral titers were determined by plaque assay 8 hours post-infection.

Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Ruby Red protein stain. Peptides corresponding to USP14 were recovered from the band indicated by the asterisk (*) by mass spectrometry.</p>

        <p>To identify proteins that interacted with WP1130, we used a biotinylated version of WP1130 and its inactive analog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) for pull-down experiments. No significant difference between the biotinylated and non-biotinylated WP1130 was detected in their ability to inhibit MNV-1 infection, while a chemically inactive, biotinylated version of WP1130 (Null-Biotin) did not reduce MNV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This demonstrated that biotinylation of WP1130 did not affect its antiviral activity. Hence, uninfected RAW cells were incubated with either the biotinylated WP1130 (WP) or the inactive biotinylated analog (Null), lysed, and biotinylated proteins precipitated with streptavidin agarose beads (Invitrogen). Proteins were resolved by SDS-Page and stained with Sypro Ruby Red (Invitrogen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Biotinylated WP1130, but not the inactive analog, pulled down a band of similar molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, asterisk) as identified by the activity-based DUB profiling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Trypsin-derived peptides from both lanes of this region in the gel were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis, which identified USP14 only in samples treated with biotinylated WP1130 but not the inactive analog. A total of five unique peptides were recovered from two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002783.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002783.s006">Table S1</xref>).

        <p>In summary, these results demonstrated that WP1130 binds and inhibits USP14 in murine macrophages independent of virus infection.</p>

        <p>To elucidate the role of USP14 during MNV-1 infection, we used both protein knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of USP14.

        <p>To verify these results, we used an inhibitor of USP14, called IU1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lee3">[43]</xref>, and tested its effects on MNV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). RAW cells or BMDMs were treated with 5 µM IU1 or IU1C, an inactive analog of IU1, prior to infection with MNV-1. The number of virally infected cells was determined as described above.

However, no statistically significant differences were observed when viral titers were measured by plaque assay (data not shown).

WP1130 treatment induced XBP-1 activation as early as 1 hour after infection with MNV-1 or mock lysate and reached statistical significance at 8 hours post-infection, although not as robustly as the positive control thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). No difference in XBP-1 activation was observed between mock-infected and MNV-1-infected RAW cells at 1 hour post-infection. However, at 8 hours post-infection there was a faint and reproducible XBP-1 signal in MNV-1 infected cells, albeit not significantly different from DMSO controls. This suggested that MNV-1 infection may activate the UPR at later stages of the infectious cycle. Together our findings demonstrated that WP1130 treatment results in XBP-1 activation irrespective of MNV-1 infection.</p>

            <title>Activation of the UPR inhibits MNV-1 infection.</title>
            <p>(A) WP1130 treatment activates XBP-1. RAW cells were treated with 5 µM WP1130 (WP), 3 µM thapsigargin (T), or DMSO (D) and then mock- or MNV-1 infected (MOI 10). At 1 and 8 hours post-infection, RNA was isolated and XBP-1 message amplified. Activation of XBP-1 results in a faster migrating spliced form (s) of the unspliced XBP-1 (u). As previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Samali1">[47]</xref>, a hybrid PCR product was also detected (*). Densitometry was performed on three independent experiments, quantitated, and normalized to the 1 hr thapsigargin-treated sample. (B) UPR induction by thapsigargin inhibits MNV-1 infection in RAW cells, while the antiviral activity of WP1130 is partially rescued by Irestatin, an inhibitor of the IRE1 endonuclease activity. RAW cells were treated with DMSO, 3 µM thapsigargin (Thapsi), 5 µM WP1130, 2.5 µM Irestatin (Ires.), or both 2.5 µM Irestatin and 5 µM WP1130 (WP1130 &amp; Ires.) for 30 min prior to MNV-1 infection (MOI 5). Viral titers were determined by plaque assay at 8 hours after infection. (C) UPR induction by thapsigargin inhibits MNV-1 infection in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), while the antiviral activity of WP1130 is partially rescued by Irestatin. The experiment was carried out as described under (B), except MNV-1 titers were determined at 12 hours postinfection. In all cases, data from three independent experiments are presented as means +/− S.E.M. **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, and *** <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001.</p>

        <p>To determine whether activation of the other two arms of the UPR, specifically PERK and ATF6, also occurred under the same conditions, immunoblots were performed using a phospho-specific PERK antibody and an antibody against ATF6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002783.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Phosphorylation of PERK was not observed after MNV-1 infection or WP1130 treatment at 1 or 8 hours post-infection, but was seen following thapsigargin treatment. Total PERK levels remained relatively stable across all conditions. No cleavage of inactivate ATF6 (ATF6 p90) into the active subunit (ATF6 p50) was observed during WP1130 treatment or MNV-1 infection, while WP1130 treatment followed by an 8 hour MNV-1 infection caused slight activation of ATF6. Robust activation of ATF6 was seen after thapsigargin treatment. While these results due not rule out the possibility of transient activation of PERK or ATF6, they suggest WP1130 activates the IRE1- but not PERK- or ATF6-dependent arms of the UPR.</p>
        <p>Since UPR activation can inhibit viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-He1">[49]</xref>, we investigated the effect of UPR activation on MNV-1 infection. RAW cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) or BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) were treated with thapsigargin prior to infection and viral titers determined by plaque assay. MNV-1 titers were significantly reduced in murine macrophages treated with thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g006">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). This reduction was not significantly different to the antiviral effect observed with WP1130 treatment in RAW cells, while in BMDMs WP1130 treatment further inhibited MNV-1 infection. Since the IRE1-dependent arm of the UPR was induced upon WP1130 treatment, we tested whether inhibition of IRE1 with Irestatin, a specific inhibitor of the IRE1 endonuclease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Li1">[50]</xref>, could rescue the WP1130-induced block in MNV-1 infection. As a control, we first determined XBP-1 activation in RAW cells treated with 3 µM thapsigargin, 2.5 µM irestatin, and a combination of both inhibitors, or 2.5 µM irestatin, 5 µM WP1130, and irestatin and WP1130 combined. Irestatin inhibited most or all of the XBP-1 activation induced by thapsigargin or WP1130, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002783.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Next, murine macrophages were pre-treated with WP1130 or Irestatin alone or in combination and MNV-1 titers measured by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g006">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). RAW cells and BMDMs treated with both compounds produced significantly (∼50%) more viral progeny than WP1130 alone, while Irestatin treatment alone had no significant effect on MNV-1 titers. These results demonstrated that Irestatin can partly inhibit the antiviral effect of WP1130 to allow limited rescue of MNV-1 infection, suggesting that the anti-MNV-1 activity of WP1130 is in part mediated by IRE1. Interestingly, the anti-MNV-1 activity of thapsigargin was completely reversed by irestatin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002783.s005">Fig. S5</xref>), suggesting that thapsigargin's antiviral effects are dependent on IRE1 endonuclease activity.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data showed that WP1130 treatment activated XBP-1 and that the IRE1 endonuclease activity was partly responsible for the anti-MNV-1 activity of WP1130, while the full antiviral effect of WP1130 is augmented by other non-IRE1-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, pharmacologic activation of the UPR significantly inhibited MNV-1 infection in primary and cultured murine macrophages, identifying new targets for the development of anti-norovirus therapies.</p>

        <title>Activation of the UPR has broad antiviral effects</title>
        <p>Targeting host-specific functions and pathways such as the UPR may have broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. Thus, we tested the antiviral effect of WP1130 and induction of the UPR on additional viruses with positive- and negative-sense RNA genomes and enveloped or non-enveloped virus particles. Be2-c cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) or Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7B–D</xref>) were treated with thapsigargin, WP1130, Irestatin, WP1130 and Irestatin, or DMSO prior to infection. Cells were then infected with La Crosse virus, an enveloped negative-strand RNA virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), EMCV, a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), VSV, an enveloped negative-strand RNA virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), or Sindbis virus, an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Both WP1130 and thapsigargin treatment significantly reduced La Crosse virus, EMCV, and Sindbis virus but not VSV progeny production, suggesting that activation of the UPR through thapsigargin can inhibit certain virus infections. Similar to findings with MNV-1, cells treated with Irestatin and WP1130, but not Irestatin alone, showed a small (∼50%) but significant rescue of La Crosse virus, EMCV, and Sindbis virus infections compared to WP1130 treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7A, B, D</xref>). We did not observe a significant inhibition of infection with any of the treatments during VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that UPR activation is inhibitory to many but not all RNA viruses, and that the antiviral activity of WP1130 is mediated in part by the IRE1-dependent arm of the UPR.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The functions of DUBs required during virus replication are poorly understood, and there are currently no DUBs reported to regulate norovirus replication. Using a small molecule inhibitor of a subset of cellular DUBs, WP1130, we demonstrated that MNV requires some DUBs during viral replication in macrophages. Specifically, USP14 was identified as a direct target of WP1130 in murine macrophages. Of the two known functions of USP14, <italic>i.e.</italic> regulation of proteasomal degradation or modulation of the UPR, changes in proteasome activity were not detected during WP1130 treatment. Instead, activation of the UPR as indicated by XBP-1 splicing was induced by WP1130. The antiviral activity of WP1130 was in part mediated by the UPR sensor IRE1 as treatment with Irestatin, a specific inhibitor of the IRE-1 endonuclease activity, partially rescued MNV-1 infection in the presence of WP1130. Similar findings were made with the other RNA viruses La Crosse virus, EMCV, and Sindbis virus. In addition, activation of the UPR with thapsigargin, a widely used UPR activator, also exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activity. These data are consistent with a model whereby induction of the UPR through inhibition of cellular DUBs blocks viral infection.</p>
      <p>The activity of cellular DUBs during norovirus infection has not been addressed previously. Our work demonstrates for the first time that a cellular DUB, the proteasome-associated USP14, is required for optimal MNV-1 infection of murine macrophages. The mechanism by which USP14 inhibits MNV-1 infection remains to be defined. We hypothesize that one mechanism involves its interaction with IRE1 and activation of downstream UPR targets. Alternatively, USP14 interactions with viral or host proteins essential during norovirus infection may also play a role. Additional DUBs remain to be identified as antiviral effectors since specific inhibition or knockdown of USP14 was unable to recapitulate the entire antiviral activity of WP1130 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g004">4</xref>). To date, we have tested two previously identified targets of WP1130, USP5 and USP9x <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Kapuria1">[34]</xref>, using siRNA knockdown. However, no changes in MNV-1 titers were observed (data not shown). This suggested only some of the DUBs targeted by WP1130 exhibit antiviral activity, enabling the development of more specific small molecule DUB inhibitors with anti-norovirus activity.</p>
      <p>Our work also demonstrates that induction of the UPR with thapsigargin or WP1130 inhibits MNV-1 infection in murine macrophages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The antiviral effect of WP1130 was partially reversed by inhibition of the IRE1 endonuclease activity through Irestatin. Interestingly though, the other two arms of the UPR response, PERK and ATF6, were not activated by WP1130 treatment or MNV-1 infection (see S3). This suggests that the IRE1/XBP-1 arm of the UPR is sufficient to limit MNV-1 infection. The downstream effectors of the UPR that mediate viral inhibition remain to be defined. One attractive hypothesis is the link between the UPR and lipid metabolism, whereby ER stress results in the XBP-1-dependent activation of phospholipid biosynthesis pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lee4">[51]</xref>. The recruitment of host membranes to viral replication sites or virus factories is a common requirement for positive-strand RNA viruses, such as MNV-1 and EMCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Hyde1">[52]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that activation of the UPR prior to MNV-1 infection might limit the amount of membrane available for the virus to recruit to its replication sites. Interestingly, a slight activation of XBP-1 splicing is observed later during MNV-1 infection. This suggests that timing of UPR induction may be critical during infection, whereby UPR induction prior to or early during MNV-1 infection inhibits infection, while UPR induction late in the viral life cycle has no effect or promotes infection. Indeed, WP1130 post-treatment of murine macrophages does not inhibit MNV-1 infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This is similar to findings with West Nile virus, strain Kunjun, which is also sensitive to thapsigargin treatment early but not late in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Ambrose1">[53]</xref>. Interestingly, inhibition of Norwalk virus replication by WP1130 was not as strong as MNV-1 replication (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This may suggest differences in the ability of both viruses to directly modulate the UPR. Another explanation may be that in the replicon system the virus has already established replication factories and may need less membrane synthesis. It is further conceivable that inhibition of membrane synthesis may not be the only mechanism by which WP1130 inhibits norovirus infections and that transient signaling from other branches of the UPR, or signaling through other IRE1 adaptors, such as JNK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Urano1">[54]</xref> play a role. Further characterizing the role of the UPR during norovirus infection could lead to novel insights into norovirus biology and identification of new antiviral drug targets.</p>
      <p>In addition to MNV-1, induction of the UPR also had antiviral effects against the RNA viruses ECMV, La Crosse virus, and Sindbis virus, but not VSV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002783-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Protein synthesis during viral infection in general is thought to induce the UPR, and experimental evidence demonstrates Sindbis virus and VSV infections induce ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Nivitchanyong1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Liu1">[56]</xref>. However, the consequences of UPR induction for individual virus infections are less well understood. For other RNA viruses such as HCV or rotavirus, induction of the UPR can lead to inhibition of viral infection, while modulation of the UPR by viral proteins can facilitate infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Tardif1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chan1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Ke1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Li2">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Zambrano1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-TrujilloAlonso1">[62]</xref>. For HCV, the IRE1/XBP-1 arm of the UPR is suppressed in replicon-containing cells resulting in decreased ER-associated protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Tardif1">[57]</xref>. Since WP1130 inhibits viral infection in part in an IRE1-dependent manner, active suppression of this pathway by HCV would make HCV insensitive to WP1130. Consistent with that hypothesis is our observation that WP1130 did not inhibit HCV replication in HCV replicon-containing cells (data not shown). We speculate that viruses would only be sensitive to WP1130 treatment if activation of the IRE1/XBP-1 arm of the UPR inhibits viral replication.</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which UPR activation or DUB inhibition could inhibit enveloped virus infection remains unclear. Induction of the degradative capacity of the UPR could reduce the stability of viral glycoproteins that are required for virion formation, since these proteins traffic through the ER. Degradation of HCV glycoproteins via the UPR has been observed in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Chan1">[58]</xref>. Other mechanisms of inhibition may be mediated through modulation of membrane synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002783-Lee4">[51]</xref>, since virus budding and viral replication factories rely on cellular membranes. Investigations into the role of the UPR and DUBs during Sindbis and La Crosse virus infections will help elucidate these cell-intrinsic antiviral mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, our work also demonstrated that WP1130 treatment inhibits MNV-1 infection in a mouse model. While this inhibition was limited to the closest site of administration, the jejunum/duodenum, we hypothesize that the solubility and/or bioavailability of WP1130 are the main reason behind this spatially restricted antiviral effect. Thus, these findings support the notion that the WP1130 chemical scaffold provides a good starting point for future drug development efforts.</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrate that blocking DUB activities and induction of UPR inhibits infection of the non-enveloped viruses MNV-1 and EMCV, and the enveloped viruses Sindbis virus and La Crosse virus. Therefore, targeting DUBs and/or the UPR with small molecules may provide a unique pathway for broad spectrum antiviral therapies.</p>
