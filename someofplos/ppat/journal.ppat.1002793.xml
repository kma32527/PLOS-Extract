        <p>The complement system plays a key role in host defense against pneumococcal infection. Three different pathways, the classical, alternative and lectin pathways, mediate complement activation. While there is limited information available on the roles of the classical and the alternative activation pathways of complement in fighting streptococcal infection, little is known about the role of the lectin pathway, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental models of lectin pathway deficiency. We have recently established a mouse strain deficient of the lectin pathway effector enzyme mannan-binding lectin associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) and shown that this mouse strain is unable to form the lectin pathway specific C3 and C5 convertases. Here we report that MASP-2 deficient mice (which can still activate complement via the classical pathway and the alternative pathway) are highly susceptible to pneumococcal infection and fail to opsonize <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> in the none-immune host. This defect in complement opsonisation severely compromises pathogen clearance in the lectin pathway deficient host. Using sera from mice and humans with defined complement deficiencies, we demonstrate that mouse ficolin A, human L-ficolin, and collectin 11 in both species, but not mannan-binding lectin (MBL), are the pattern recognition molecules that drive lectin pathway activation on the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. We further show that pneumococcal opsonisation via the lectin pathway can proceed in the absence of C4. This study corroborates the essential function of MASP-2 in the lectin pathway and highlights the importance of MBL-independent lectin pathway activation in the host defense against pneumococci.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a major human pathogen that causes pneumonia, septicemia and meningitis. The host defense against pneumococci is largely dependent on complement, a system of blood proteins which, when activated, attach to bacteria, targeting them for clearance by phagocytes. There are three routes of complement activation: The classical, lectin and alternative pathways. Limited information is available on the roles of the classical and alternative pathways in fighting pneumococci; the role of the lectin pathway has escaped the attention of previous research. This work demonstrates that the lectin pathway is critical in fighting pneumococcal infection. Of the five different lectin pathway recognition molecules in human serum, only L-ficolin and collectin 11 activate complement on pneumococci. Human mannose-binding lectin (MBL), the best-known lectin pathway pattern recognition molecule, has no role whatsoever in fighting pneumococci. Similarly, in mouse serum, only ficolin A and collectin 11 drive complement activation on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Hence, MBL deficient mice are not compromised in pneumococcal infection, while ficolin A deficient mice and mice deficient of the key lectin pathway enzyme MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) are exquisitely susceptible to infection. This work explains why MBL deficiency, the most frequent hereditary immune deficiency, does not predispose to pneumococcal disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection is a major cause of pneumonia, otitis media, septicemia and meningitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Miller1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Kyaw1">[2]</xref>. Complementâdriven opsonophagocytosis is a prominent feature of the host response to pneumococcal infections, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Bruyn1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Complement provides protection against invading microorganisms through both antibody-dependent and -independent mechanisms. It mediates many cellular and humoral interactions within the immune response, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and B-cell differentiation. Three different pathways initiate the complement cascade, which are known as the classical, alternative and lectin pathways.</p>
      <p>In the classical pathway, the recognition subcomponent C1q binds to a variety of targets - most prominently immune complexes - to initiate the step-wise activation of associated serine proteases, C1r and C1s. Activated C1s cleaves C4 into C4a and C4b and then cleaves C4b-bound C2 to generate the C3 convertase, C4b2a, which converts the abundant plasma protein C3 into C3a and C3b; C3b is the major opsonin of the complement system. Accumulation of C3b in close proximity to the C4b2a complex leads to the formation of the C5 convertase, C4b2a(C3b)<sub>n</sub>, which initiates the terminal pathway of complement activation.</p>
      <p>In the alternative pathway, spontaneous low-level hydrolysis of C3 leads to deposition of C3b on cell surfaces, triggering complement activation on foreign cells. Host cells are protected by surface regulatory proteins that suppress complement activation.</p>
      <p>Like the alternative pathway, the lectin pathway may be activated in the absence of immune complexes. Activation is initiated by the binding of a multimolecular lectin pathway activation complex to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), mainly carbohydrate structures present on microorganisms or aberrant glycocalyx patterns on apoptotic, necrotic, malignant or oxygen-deprived cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Fujita1">[5]</xref>. Rodents have at least four circulating lectin pathway recognition molecules, with differing, but overlapping, carbohydrate specificities; two mannan-binding lectins (MBL-A and MBL-C), collectin-11 (CL-11) and ficolin A (Fcna) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>. A second murine ficolin, Fcnb, associated with monocyte and macrophage cell surfaces does not activate complement in mice, but may act as a lectin pathway recognition molecule in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Girija1">[7]</xref>. Humans have a single MBL (the product of <italic>MBL2</italic>; <italic>MBL1</italic> is a pseudogene), CL-11 (collectin kidney 1, CL-K1) and three ficolins, FCN1 (M-ficolin), FCN2 (L-ficolin) and FCN3 (H-ficolin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Fujita1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Liu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Hansen1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These recognition molecules form complexes with three serine proteases, MASP-1, -2 and -3 (MBL-associated serine proteases 1, 2 and 3).

Both truncated gene products lack the serine protease domain and may regulate lectin pathway activation by competing for the binding of MASPs to the carbohydrate recognition molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Thiel1">[10]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Skjoedt1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Of the three MASPs, only MASP-2 is required and essential to form the lectin pathway C3 and C5 convertases (C4b2a and C4b2a(C3b)<sub>n</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Thiel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-VorupJensen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Rossi1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Like C1s, activated MASP-2 cleaves C4 and C4b-bound C2, generating C4b2a, the classical and lectin pathway C3 convertase. Neither MASP-1 nor MASP-3 can cleave C4 and therefore cannot compensate for the absence of MASP-2. Thus, formation of the lectin pathway C3 and C5 convertase complexes is impossible in absence of MASP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>. MASP-1 appears to facilitate lectin pathway activation by either direct cleavage of complex-bound MASP-2 or cleavage of C4b-bound C2, but MASP-1 cannot drive lectin pathway activation in the absence of MASP-2, as MASP-2 is required to initiate the formation of the lectin pathway convertases by the cleavage of C4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Takahashi2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Kocsis1">[19]</xref>.

      <p>Infection studies using mice with targeted deficiencies in one or more complement components have provided evidence for the roles of the classical and alternative pathways in protection against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. C1q deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> than WT mice, indicating that the classical pathway has a protective role. The alternative pathway was also found to have a protective role against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, but to a lesser extent than the classical pathway.

      <p>The contribution of the lectin activation pathway towards the defense against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection had not been assessed so far, mainly due to the lack of appropriate mouse models of total lectin pathway deficiency.</p>
      <p>Using MASP-2 deficient mice, completely devoid of the ability to form lectin pathway C3 and C5 convertases, this report demonstrates that lectin pathway activation provides a critical degree of protection against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. We identified mouse ficolin A and CL-11, but not MBL-A or MBL-C, to be the critical pattern recognition molecules that initiate complementactivation via the lectin pathway on the surface of this pathogen.</p>

        <p>Complement deficient sera were used to determine which components contribute to C3b opsonisation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. C3b deposition was assayed by ELISA using formalin-fixed bacteria and by FACS analysis using live bacteria. MASP-2 deficiency leads to a total loss of C3b deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1aâe</xref>). Using a simple end-point ELISA, C3b deposition appears to be unaffected by factor B deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1b</xref>). However, the conversion of C3 is slower in factor B deficient serum (t<sub>1/2</sub>â28 min) than in WT serum (t<sub>1/2</sub>â8 min), indicating that the alternative pathway amplification loop contributes to the C3 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1c</xref>). Serum from MBL-null mice (deficient in both MBL-A and MBL-C) opsonised the bacteria as efficiently as WT serum, whereas ficolin A deficiency resulted in impaired C3b deposition. Ficolin B was not detectable in sera of WT and ficolin A deficient C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). Serum deficient in MBL-A, MBL-C and ficolin A produced similar results to those seen using ficolin A deficient serum, suggesting that the remaining lectin pathway recognition component CL-11 may drive residual lectin pathway activation on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1b</xref>).

        <p>Using C4 deficient mouse serum, the absolute amount of C3b deposited on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was approximately half that observed using WT serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1b, c, e &amp; f</xref>) and the rate of conversion was lower (T<sub>1/2</sub>â30 min in C4 deficient serum; 8 min in WT serum; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1c</xref>). C4 is an integral part of the classical and lectin pathway C3 convertase, C4b2a, suggesting that the residual C3b deposition seen in C4 deficient serum is a result of either alternative pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Atkinson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Selander1">[24]</xref> or the recently reported lectin pathway-specific C4-bypass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>. Since (i) all experiments reported here were carried out at low serum concentrations (1.25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1b</xref>; 2.5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1c</xref> and; 5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1e &amp; f</xref>) where the alternative activation pathway is dysfunctional, and (ii) the activation of C3 on the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is absent in MASP-2 deficient mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1</xref>), we conclude that the C3 deposition on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in C4 deficient serum is mediated by the MASP-2 dependent C4-bypass activation route. Likewise, inhibition of MASP-2 activity with the anti-MASP-2 mAb AbD04211 abolished C3b deposition on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> incubated with C4 deficient serum, supporting the hypothesis that the MASP-2 dependent C4-bypass plays a significant role in the opsonisation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
        <p>Similar results were obtained using human serum from a donor with a complete deficiency of both C4 genes, <italic>C4A</italic> and <italic>C4B</italic>: C4 deficiency halved C3b deposition, although the EC<sub>50</sub> value was unaffected (â0.05% for all sera assayed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1g</xref>).

In MASP-2 deficient mice, the IL6 response was also elevated. The INFÎ³ response was significantly greater in the ficolin A deficient mice. In the ficolin A and MASP-2 deficient mice, MIP-2 (CLCX2) expression persists at 48 hr, indicating on-going macrophage activation at a time when the response is abating in the WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002793.s003">fig.

        <p>MASP-2 deficiency can be simulated in WT mice using a mAb that specifically inhibits MASP-2. A single <italic>i.p.</italic> dose of 0.6â1.0 mg/kg body weight leads to a loss of â¥90% of lectin pathway activity for up to 7 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>. WT mice treated with this mAb prior to infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> had significantly greater mortality and higher bacteraemia than untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g006">fig. 6</xref>). Antibiotic treatment (Ceftriaxone, 20 mg per kg body weight <italic>i.p.</italic> 12 h before infection and every 12 h thereafter) resulted in complete protection against mortality in both Ab-treated and non-treated groups. These results suggest that increased susceptibility to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in MASP-2 deficient mice is a direct result of the loss of MASP-2 driven lectin pathway activity, rather than an indirect result of MASP-2 deficiency on the development of the animal's immune response.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Complement-dependent opsonophagocytosis is a key feature of the host defense against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Thirty years ago, using a guinea pig model of pneumococcal bacteraemia, it was shown that the clearance of IgG and IgM opsonized pneumococci from the circulation is entirely dependent upon complement; animals deficient of C4, or depleted of complement using cobra venom factor (CVF), fail to clear the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Brown2">[31]</xref>. More recently, Brown and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Brown1">[22]</xref> used mice with engineered genetic deficiencies to demonstrate the importance of C1q, C4 and C3 in the defense against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Based on the observation that C1q deficient mice are as susceptible to infection as C4 deficient mice, the authors concluded that activation of the classical pathway is the predominant mechanism for complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and that the lectin pathway (which according to the present text book view requires C4 to work) plays a negligible role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Brown1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we analyzed experimental <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection in the first available model of lectin pathway deficiency and reached the conclusion that the lectin pathway promotes innate resistance against pneumococcal infection in the non-immunized host. The results presented here show that MASP-2 deficient mice (which can still activate complement via the classical and alternative pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>) are severely compromised in their ability to survive <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g005">fig. 5</xref>). Survival times and mortality rates were similar to those reported for C1q and C4 deficient mice, using the same strains of bacteria and mice, and the same dose and route of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Brown1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Neither the classical, nor the alternative activation pathway could compensate for the loss of lectin pathway mediated C3 opsonization of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. In contrast, the absence of C1q had no effect on C3 opsonization of these bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1</xref>) implying that C1q may contribute to bacterial clearance in a process independent of direct C3b or iC3b deposition on the bacterial surface.</p>
      <p>Deficiency of factor B, a component of the alternative pathway C3 convertase led to a significantly slower C3 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1C</xref>), This is probably due to the loss of the alternative pathway amplification loop, a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies C3 activation via of all three pathways, which may account for the reported susceptibility of factor B deficient mice to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection (Brown et al., 2002).</p>
      <p>As previously reported by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Li1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Li2">[32]</xref>, we were unable to detect any C4b or C4c on the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> opsonized with normal human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g002">fig. 2</xref>). However, the bacterial surface was abundantly decorated with C4dg, the final product of C4 decay. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> avoids the accumulation of active C4b by sequestrating complement regulatory proteins from host serum to accelerate the breakdown of C4b, thus preventing the formation of the C3 convertase C4b2a on the pathogen, rather than by preventing C4 binding. Recent work suggests that the pneumococcal virulence factors PspA and PspC are responsible for recruiting factor H and C4-binding protein from host plasma, both of which accelerate the factor I-mediated breakdown of C4b to C4dg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Li1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-DieudonneVatran1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>C3 deposition on pneumococci was impaired, but not completely blocked, by C4 deficiency in both mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1bâf</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1g</xref>). In the mouse, C4 deficiency led to a significantly slower C3 turnover and in both species the absolute amount of C3 deposited on the bacteria was approximately half of that observed using WT serum. The residual C3 deposition in C4 deficient murine serum could be inhibited using a monoclonal antibody directed against MASP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1f</xref>), indicating that the MASP-2-dependent C4-bypass is active on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>. Nevertheless, C4 deficient mice have an increased susceptibility to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Brown1">[22]</xref>; our unpublished data), indicating that the MASP-2-dependent C4-bypass only partially compensates for C4-dependent lectin pathway activation in this setting. The C4-bypass activation of the lectin pathway was shown to play a significant physiological role in ischemia-reperfusion injury; MASP-2 deficient mice are protected from reperfusion injury following myocardial ischemia, whereas C4 deficient mice are not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Lin1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We hypothesize that the rapid degradation of C4b on the bacterial surface seriously compromises the ability of the classical pathway to form a C3 convertase and thus opsonize <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> with C3b, while the lectin pathway is still able to opsonize pneumococci with C3b via the C4-bypass, which provides a physiologically relevant degree of compensation for the impaired C4-dependent activation of C3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>. The loss of lectin pathway activity caused by MASP-2 deficiency or MASP-2 inhibition would remove a critical degree of C3 opsonization of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in naive mice and hence explain the phenotype of compromised pneumococcal clearance in MASP-2 deficient or MASP-2 depleted mice. The rapid conversion of C4b to C4dg on the pathogen surface appears to be a feature of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This would explain why the absence of lectin pathway activity renders the host more susceptible to infections with this particular pathogen, whilst no increased predisposition to, or severity of, infection with other major pathogens, e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> were observed in MASP-2 deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Kenawy1">[34]</xref>; our unpublished data).</p>
      <p>In murine serum, it is predominantly ficolin A and CL-11 that bind to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g003">fig. 3</xref> and table S1). The binding of both lectin pathway recognition molecules to the bacterial surface was confirmed using recombinant human CL-11 and recombinant murine ficolin A. Murine MBL-A does not bind to any of the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains studied here (covering 4 serotypes), and MBL-C bound weakly or not at all (table S1). It was therefore not surprising that the presence or absence of both MBL-A and MBL-C in C57BL/6 mice had no impact on overall survival in our model of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39 infection. In contrast, following pneumococcal infection, C57BL/6<italic><sup>Fcna</sup></italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice were severely compromised with a significantly higher degree of mortality and higher bacterial loads in blood and lung tissue than WT controls. This phenotype underlines our <italic>in vitro</italic> results and indicates that ficolin A (but not MBL-A or MBL-C) is a key recognition component of the lectin activation pathway in the innate host defense against pneumococcal infection. Interestingly, serum from mice deficient in all lectin pathway recognition components except CL-11 still deposits C3b on the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1b</xref>). Since mouse CL-11 binds strongly to the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g003">fig. 3c</xref>) and since we show that CL-11 also forms complexes with the lectin pathway effector enzyme MASP-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002793.s001">fig. S1</xref>), we conclude that CL-11 acts synergistically with ficolin A as an initiator of lectin pathway activation following binding of specific PAMPs on the pneumococcal surface.</p>
      <p>The situation is similar in humans; only L-ficolin and CL-11 recognize <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g003">fig. 3e &amp; f</xref>). As previously reported by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Krarup1">[28]</xref>, we found no binding of MBL to any of the pneumococcal strains (table S1), and there was no indication that MBL deficiency leads to defective C3b deposition on the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002793-g001">fig. 1g&amp;h</xref>). As MBL deficiency is the most common hereditary complement deficiency in humans, affecting as many as 1 in 10 of the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Wallis1">[35]</xref>, there has been much interest in the possibility of an association between MBL deficiency and infectious disease. In the case of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the results of association studies have been largely negative or inconclusive, with two of the largest studies finding no association between the risk of community-acquired pneumonia and MBL deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Endeman1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-GarciaLaorden1">[37]</xref>. Genetic variations of the L-ficolin gene are more subtle, with no complete functional deficiency in adults reported to date. Furthermore, there is no apparent association between polymorphisms in <italic>FCN2</italic> that lead to low levels of L-ficolin and pneumococcal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Chapman1">[38]</xref>, indicating that even low levels of L-ficolin and/or the presence of CL-11 are sufficient to mount a robust immune response against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that antibodies to MASP-2 can block lectin pathway driven inflammation and limit tissue loss in ischaemic pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Schwaeble2">[6]</xref>, suggesting therapeutic utility for anti MASP-2 antibody therapy. Our experiments show that such treatment may increase susceptibility to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection in naive mice. Pneumococcal vaccination history or immune status may need to be considered prior to initiating anti MASP-2 treatment in patients. Alternatively, since the increased susceptibility was completely reversed by concurrent treatment with ceftriaxone, MASP-2 antagonists should be safe to use with appropriate prophylactic antibiotic treatment.</p>
      <p>The results of this study call for a revision of the previously published conclusion by Brown et al. (2002) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Brown1">[22]</xref> that the lectin pathway of complement activation is not a major player in the host response to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection. This conclusion led the same research team to exclude any involvement of the lectin pathway in the clearance of pneumococci in subsequent publications. When studying the impact of human C2 deficiency on C3b opsonization and phagocytosis of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002793-Yuste1">[39]</xref>, no consideration was given to the fact that C2 deficient individuals are not only deficient of the classical activation pathway, but also of C3 and C5 convertases formed by the lectin pathway. The results presented here, however, strongly suggest that in none-immune sera, it is the loss of lectin pathway functional activity that accounts for the loss of C3b/iC3b opsonization of pneumococci.</p>
      <p>Finally, we describe clear evidence of lectin pathway activation in a physiological context in the absence of a discernable contribution by MBL. Thus, the prevailing view that MBL is the predominant initiator of lectin pathway activation may need to be revisited.</p>
