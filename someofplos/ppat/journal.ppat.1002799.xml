        <p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the protozoan parasite responsible for Chagas' disease, causes severe myocarditis often resulting in death. Here, we report that <italic>Slamf1</italic>−/− mice, which lack the hematopoietic cell surface receptor Slamf1, are completely protected from an acute lethal parasite challenge. Cardiac damage was reduced in Slamf1−/− mice compared to wild type mice, infected with the same doses of parasites, as a result of a decrease of the number of parasites in the heart even the parasitemia was only marginally less. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments reveal that Slamf1-defIcient myeloid cells are impaired in their ability to replicate the parasite and show altered production of cytokines. Importantly, IFN-γ production in the heart of Slamf1 deficient mice was much lower than in the heart of wt mice even though the number of infiltrating dendritic cells, macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were comparable. Administration of an anti-Slamf1 monoclonal antibody also reduced the number of parasites and IFN-γ in the heart. These observations not only explain the reduced susceptibility to <italic>in vivo</italic> infection by the parasite, but they also suggest human Slamf1 as a potential target for therapeutic target against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Chagas' disease caused by the intracellular protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the most important parasitic infection in Latin America affecting several million persons. Nonetheless, there is no therapy or vaccine available. Thus, more efforts are needed to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we report that Slamf1, which controls phagosomal/lysosomal fusion and phagosomal NADPH-oxidase activity, is required for <italic>T.cruzi</italic> replication in macrophages and dendritic cells, but not in other cells, which do not express the receptor. In the absence of Slamf1 we detect reduced number of parasites in the heart compared to infected wt mice. This explains why <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-infected <italic>Slamf1</italic> deficient mice do not succumb to myocarditis induced by a lethal challenge with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in contrast to BALB/c mice. Perhaps more importantly, we demonstrate that parasite replication in phagocytes is of far greater importance for the pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathy than replication in other cells. Moreover, we found much lower IFN-γ production in the heart of Slamf1 deficient mice than in the heart of BALB/c mice. We corroborated those results using an alternative approach, blocking Slamf1 function in vivo by treating mice with anti-Slamf1 antibodies. Consequently, Slamf1 is an attractive novel therapeutic target for modulating <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease) is caused by the intracellular protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> that is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by insect vectors belonging to the <italic>Reduviidae</italic> family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Chagas1">[1]</xref>. It is one of the most important parasitic infection in Latin America affecting several million persons in South and Central America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Rassi1">[2]</xref> Due to the immigration Chagas' disease is now considered an emergent one in Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-PerezdeAyala1">[3]</xref>. The disease is a complex zoonosis, with mammals as natural reservoir hosts. Transmission is primarily by contact with the contaminated faeces of domiciliated blood sucking triatomine bugs. The life cycle of this parasite alternates between three morphologically distinct forms: infective (metacyclic or blood trypomastigotes), insect borne (epimastigotes) which replicate in the vector and intracellular replicative (amastigotes) which grow and replicate intracellularly in a variety of mammalian cells, including macrophages, cardiomyocytes and muscle fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Burleigh1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Brener1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Myocarditis is the most serious and frequent manifestation of acute and chronic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Rassi1">[2]</xref>. The pathogenesis is thought to be triggered by parasites in the lesions and dependent on an immune-inflammatory response to them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Reed1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Girones1">[9]</xref>. Activation of a T helper type (Th<sub>1</sub>) response, that release IFN-γ and TNF, is required to activate the microbicidal activity of macrophages important in the control of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-MunozFernandez1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Fresno1">[11]</xref>. Nonetheless, the development of severe cardiomyopathy in Chagas' disease is also thought to be due to a Th<sub>1</sub>-specific immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Gomes1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>T. cruzi</italic> infects a variety of host cells, including macrophages and cardiomyocytes. Several <italic>T. cruzi</italic> molecules, glycoproteins, trans-sialidase and mucins among others, play a role in cell invasion mainly interacting with TLRs or mannose receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-deDiego1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-MagantoGarcia1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule family (Slamf) receptors are adhesion molecules that are involved in signaling between immune cells regulating for instance T cell proliferation, antibody production, cytotoxic responses and cytokine production, <italic>e.g.</italic> IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Howie1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Cannons1">[25]</xref>. The self-ligand adhesion molecule Slamf1 (CD150) is not only a co-stimulatory molecule at the interface between antigen presenting cells and T cells, but also functions as a microbial sensor. For instance, Slamf1 also binds to the hemaglutinin of Measles virus and to an outer membrane protein of <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Tatsuo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Berger1">[27]</xref>. The latter interaction drives Slamf1 into the <italic>E.coli</italic> phagosome where the receptor positively controls the microbicidal activity of macrophages by a signaling mechanism that is distinct from its signaling as an adhesion molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Berger1">[27]</xref>. Because Slamf1 partakes in bactericidal responses as the receptor and plays a role in protecting against infection with <italic>Leishmania major</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Wang1">[23]</xref> we set out to evaluate how <italic>Slamf1</italic>-deficient mice would respond to an infection by the intracellular parasite <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Surprisingly, we find that <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice are resistant to a lethal dose of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, because the number of parasites in the heart is greatly reduced as compared to infected <italic>wt</italic> mice. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments revealed that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> has impaired ability to replicate into Slamf1-deficient myeloid cells. Administration of an anti-Slamf1 monoclonal antibody also reduced the number of amastigotes in the heart.</p>

        <p><italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Slamf1+/</italic>+ <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice were infected with the highly virulent <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Y strain.

This complete resistance was observed also with a very high parasite inoculum (10<sup>4</sup> parasites/mouse) (data not shown). In the acute phase of the infection <italic>T. cruzi</italic> induces myocarditis, which is thought to be the ultimate cause of mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Rassi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Girones1">[9]</xref>. Indeed the creatinine kinase (CK) levels, a marker of cardiac damage, were significantly lower in the serum of infected <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Slamf1</italic>-sufficient BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that reduced heart damage was the cause of the survival of the <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice.</p>

        <p>To assess the numbers of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> present in the heart of infected <italic>wt</italic> and mutant mice, quantitative QC-PCR with parasite specific probes was used. In <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice an increase in parasite load, which follows parasitemia, peaked at 21 days postinfection (dpi). By contrast, <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice had a much smaller <italic>T. cruzi</italic> load in their hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we performed histological analysis of the infected hearts and compared the numbers of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigotes present in the cardiomyocytes of infected <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Slamf1<sup>+/+</sup> BALB/c</italic> mice.

        <p>As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-deMeis1">[28]</xref>, infection of <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> abrogates thymocyte development with kinetics closely following the increased numbers of circulating parasites, as judged by the loss of thymocyte numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A reduction of the CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive compartment was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), in agreement with the findings by Perez et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Perez1">[29]</xref>, which could be caused by TNF, corticosteroids, parasite trans-sialidase, extracellular ATP, androgens or galectin-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-deMeis1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Perez1">[29]</xref>. However, in spite of the complete survival of the <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, the kinetics of depletion of thymocyte subpopulations was identical as that in <italic>wt BALB/c</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). During infection of <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> splenic cellularity increased approximately 8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) By contrast, this expansion was only 3-fold in the spleens from <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice indicative of a much lesser activation state at early times although at day 21 d.p.i. cellularity increases were similar.

        <p>One of the key contributors to the cardiomyopathy during infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is thought to be the infiltration by CD8 T lymphocytes, which as a consequence of a immune reactivity to the parasite produce an inflammatory milieu that is detrimental for heart function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Teixeira1">[8]</xref>. We therefore determined CD8 infiltration into the heart of infected mice by mRNA levels of subpopulation-specific cell surface markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Cuervo1">[30]</xref>. CD8 infiltration increases constantly into the hearts of <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice until their death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, no significant differences were observed in the kinetic of CD8 infiltration (7 to 21 dpi) between <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> and <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice except for a small decrease in CD8 T cell infiltration at 28 dpi, likely reflecting the resolution of infection in this strain of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

        <title>Reduced replication of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> macrophages</title>
        <p>An additional, and perhaps more relevant, explanation for the reduced amastigote content in the hearts of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice, could be that intracellular <italic>T. cruzi</italic> replication was impaired in the mutant mice. To address this hypothesis, we analyzed macrophages isolated from the peritoneum of mice that were infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Adherent peritoneal cells from 7 dpi to 28 dpi of infected <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice contain intracellular amastigotes, with a number that peaked at 21 dpi when approximately 50% of the peritoneal macrophages from <italic>BALB/c</italic> mice are infected by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g005">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Those infected cells at 21 dpi contained 30 amastigotes.

Combining those 2 parameters, the reduction in amastigote content in peritoneal cells isolated from <italic>Slamf1−</italic>/− mice was greater than 75% as compared with wt mice. Thus, peritoneal macrophages isolated from <italic>T.cruzi</italic> infected <italic>Slamf1−</italic>/− mice appeared to replicate the parasite less efficiently.</p>

        <p>To corroborate this observation, we tested whether <italic>in vitro T. cruzi</italic> infection was impaired in isolated <italic>Slamf1−</italic>/− macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) or cardiomyocytes. Forty-eight hours after infection replication of the parasite and the generation of amastigotes was detected in <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, <italic>Slamf1−</italic>/− macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) were far less effective in supporting <italic>T. cruzi</italic> replication then <italic>wt</italic> cells.

        <p>Next, we analyzed whether Slamf1 deficiency alters myeloid cell response to the parasite. As expected, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of <italic>wt</italic> macrophages triggered the production of inflammatory mediators inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS <italic>Nos2</italic>) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, <italic>Ptgs2</italic>) at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Also arginase 1, <italic>Arg1</italic>, mRNA was induced upon infection. In contrast, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> macrophages and show reduced levels of <italic>Ptgs2, Nos2 and Arg1</italic> mRNAs. Moreover, infected <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> macrophages release less IFNγ into the supernatant than infected BALB/c macrophages but similar levels of TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

Not surprisingly, because cardiomyocytes do not express Slamf1, upon infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> these cells, whether isolated from <italic>wt</italic> or <italic>Slamf1−/− BALB/c</italic> mice, produced equal amounts of IFNγ and nitric oxide (NO) upon in vitro infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002799-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current studies led the concept that Slamf1 is required for replication of <italic>T.cruzi</italic> in macrophages and DCs, but not in other cells, which do not normally express the receptor, <italic>e.g.</italic> cardiomyocytes. Besides, in the absence of Slamf1, macrophages and DCs produce less myeloid cell specific factors that are key in influencing the host response to parasite and eventually the outcome of the infection. This explains why <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infected <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice do not succumb to myocarditis induced by a lethal challenge with the highly virulent <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Y strain quite the opposite to BALB/c mice even with similar parasitemia levels. The later also indicates that parasitemia does not necessarily need to be related to cardiomyopathy, which is the leading cause of death upon <italic>T.cruzi</italic> infection in most instances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Rassi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Girones1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results also show that the systemic alterations previously reported associated to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and suggested to play a role in pathology as impairment of thymocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-deMeis1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Savino1">[32]</xref> or altered systemic cytokine production, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Girones1">[9]</xref>, were not different in both infected <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice and control <italic>Slamf1+/+</italic> mice, indicating that those major changes in systemic immune responses are not responsible for the reduced susceptibility of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. Rather, the altered local heart response to infection, with much lower <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigotes and altered immune mediators in infected <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, are the most likely cause for the survival of <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice upon an acute infection by the parasite.</p>
      <p>We favor an interpretation of our observations that in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice less <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites enter the heart. However, as circulating parasite levels are similar in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice and the <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to infection is not altered by Slamf1 deficiency, is likely that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> blood trypomastigotes are unable to penetrate the heart directly to infect the cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> replicate much less well in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> DC and macrophages than in the equivalent <italic>wt</italic> cells. Although Slamf1 is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells, a careful analysis of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> on two genetic backgrounds has not revealed any abnormalities in hematopoiesis included myeloid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Wang1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Berger1">[27]</xref>. It is therefore unlikely that a major defect in myeloid development and differentiation in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice has an effect on <italic>T.cruzi</italic> infection.</p>
      <p>Thus, despite comparable infiltration of macrophages and DCs between infected <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic>, the number of infective amastigotes that are carried into the heart by infected migrating <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> monocytes, DCs or macrophages will be greatly reduced and might be one of the contributing factors to the survival of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice to infection with the parasite. In addition, it is also possible that homing of infected monocytes or macrophages into the heart is affected by the absence of Slamf1. Together, our results suggest that DC and myeloid cells can act as a “Trojan horse” for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection into the heart.</p>
      <p>An alternative interpretation is that the reduced amastigote number in the heart of Slamf1−/− mice is a result of a stronger response to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> that limits its replication. Collectively, our results argue against this, since immune cells infiltrate the heart of a <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mouse in a similar fashion as in a <italic>BALB/c</italic> mouse and the amounts of key cytokines produced in the heart are equal or lower than in the <italic>wt</italic> mouse. Thus, although IFNγ-producing CD8 T cells may enter the heart from the circulation to eliminate <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Padilla1">[33]</xref>, in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice similar numbers of CD8 cells infiltrate the heart, but produce less IFNγ due to lower antigenic stimulus. Moreover, arginase I levels are lower in the heart of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice, and we have found that the levels of this enzyme presents in infiltrating myeloid suppressor cells correlate with higher susceptibility to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Cuervo2">[31]</xref>. This reduction may also contribute to explain the lower susceptibility of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice.</p>
      <p>Parasitemia levels are similar in both mice strains. This fact suggests that circulating parasite levels are mostly due to replication of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in other organs and cells others than myeloid cells. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> are known to replicate in many cell types, including muscle, epithelial and endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Girones1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Hall1">[34]</xref>. Since Slamf1 is only expressed in myeloid cells, the replication of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in non-hematopoietic cells is not likely to be impaired in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice and hence the blood-borne parasitemia is only slightly less in the mutant mice.</p>
      <p>Previously, Slamf1 was found to be a requisite for the elimination of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-related intracellular protozoa (<italic>Leishmania major</italic>) by <italic>B6</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Wang1">[23]</xref>. However, <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> BALB/c mice respond to a <italic>L. major</italic> infection in an identical fashion as <italic>wt</italic> BALB/c animals. The role of Slamf1 in the response to the two related parasites is therefore different, as Slamf1 plays a detrimental role in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection of BALB/c mice. Consequently the mechanisms involved are likely to be different. In <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection the susceptibility of <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice has been linked to a depressed NO production by macrophages, with a consequent inability to eliminate the parasite. NO is also required for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-MunozFernandez1">[10]</xref> and we also found that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> macrophages does not trigger iNOS, but this has no apparent impact for “in vitro” or “in vivo” replication. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy may lie in the fact that Slamf1 affects a different and earlier process in the infection of macrophages by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> than <italic>L. major</italic>, as the two parasites invade the cells by different mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Besides, <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice are also more susceptible to an attenuated strain of <italic>S. tyhimurium</italic> Sseb-e <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Berger1">[27]</xref> contrary to <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Although it might at face value appear paradoxical those contrasting effects one should keep in mind that in humans Slamf1 is one of the two receptors (probably the original receptor) for Measles virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Tatsuo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Berger1">[27]</xref>. Therefore the virus and the parasite utilize an important receptor system to their advantage.</p>
      <p>The diminished replication of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> myeloid cells may explain, at least partially, the lower susceptibility of <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice. Although, the mechanism by which Slamf1 reduce <italic>T. cruzi</italic> replication has not been addressed in this manuscript, previous experiments demonstrated that Slamf1 is involved in entering <italic>E.coli</italic> into phagosome, where it governs phago-lysosomal maturation and NADPH-oxidase (Nox2) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Berger1">[27]</xref>. This is caused by a reduction in of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-phosphate production, which is synthesized by the intracellular Class II PI3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34. As <italic>T. cruzi</italic> requires phagosome formation and PI3K (Vps34) activation to invade macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-MagantoGarcia1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Caradonna1">[35]</xref>, it is therefore likely that Slamf1 participates with other molecules/receptors in the entry of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> into the phagosome.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a recent study shows that Nox2 inhibition ameliorates <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-induced myocarditis independently of parasitemia levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002799-Dhiman1">[36]</xref> as in <italic>Slamf1−/−</italic> mice. Thus, a reduced Nox-2 production together with a reduced replication in myeloid cells are the underlying mechanisms, which may explain the survival of <italic>Slamf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice to <italic>T.cruzi</italic> infection.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, anti-Slamf1 treatment might affect the same processes. Consequently, Slamf1 is a key molecule in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infectivity and represents an attractive novel therapeutic target for modulating <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and Chagas' disease.</p>
