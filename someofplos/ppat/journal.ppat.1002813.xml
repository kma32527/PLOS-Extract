        <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 is an opportunistic human pathogen capable of infecting a wide range of organisms including the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We used a non-redundant transposon mutant library consisting of 5,850 clones corresponding to 75% of the total and approximately 80% of the non-essential PA14 ORFs to carry out a genome-wide screen for attenuation of PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We defined a functionally diverse 180 mutant set (representing 170 unique genes) necessary for normal levels of virulence that included both known and novel virulence factors. Seven previously uncharacterized virulence genes (ABC transporters PchH and PchI, aminopeptidase PepP, ATPase/molecular chaperone ClpA, cold shock domain protein PA0456, putative enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase PA0745, and putative transcriptional regulator PA14_27700) were characterized with respect to pigment production and motility and all but one of these mutants exhibited pleiotropic defects in addition to their avirulent phenotype. We examined the collection of genes required for normal levels of PA14 virulence with respect to occurrence in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain-specific genomic regions, location on putative and known genomic islands, and phylogenetic distribution across prokaryotes. Genes predominantly contributing to virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed neither a bias for strain-specific regions of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome nor for putatively horizontally transferred genomic islands. Instead, within the collection of virulence-related PA14 genes, there was an overrepresentation of genes with a broad phylogenetic distribution that also occur with high frequency in many prokaryotic clades, suggesting that in aggregate the genes required for PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are biased towards evolutionarily conserved genes.</p>

        <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic human pathogen that can also infect a wide range of model organisms, including the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. To identify <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes that play key roles in the pathogenic process, we performed a screen for mutants that exhibited reduced ability to kill <italic>C. elegans</italic> using a previously constructed non-redundant library representing approximately 80% of the non-essential <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 genes. We defined a functionally diverse set of 180 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants (representing 170 unique genes) necessary for normal levels of virulence that included both known and novel virulence factors. The major contributors to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> infection model were not secretion systems or their corresponding effectors, but rather regulators (particularly ones that are involved in quorum sensing) and genes likely to play key roles in survival of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> within the host intestine. Moreover, these putative <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence genes are neither overrepresented in strain-specific regions nor in horizontally acquired genomic islands and furthermore tend to have orthologs that are widely distributed across sequenced prokaryotic species. These data underscore the diversity of pathways involved in virulence, and especially the importance of highly conserved genes for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> host model.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, an opportunistic Gram-negative human pathogen, is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections. In the context of a breakdown in host defenses, it is capable of infecting a plethora of tissue types, causing both acute and chronic infections. Burn victims as well as immunocompromised, mechanically ventilated, and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are particularly susceptible to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Sadikot1">[1]</xref>. Over the last few decades, a steady increase in drug resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains has made antibiotic treatment more difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Moore1">[2]</xref>. In part because no new antibiotics effective against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are imminently available as treatment options, the pressing need for drugs to fight this pathogen has focused study on its virulence factors as potential drug targets, and more generally energized a search for novel anti-infectives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lesic1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Sintim1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One likely reason that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a common nosocomial pathogen is because it is capable of thriving in a wide variety of environmental niches, including surfaces in hospital rooms, water, soil and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Romling1">[6]</xref>. Consistent with its ecological ubiquity, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a relatively large genome that presumably promotes survival in diverse habitats. In addition to inhabiting a wide variety of ecological niches, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is also a multi-host pathogen, capable of infecting hosts as divergent as amoebae, plants, insects, flies, nematodes, and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Pukatzki1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan2">[13]</xref>. Progress in fighting <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections will be aided by a fundamental understanding of the myriad ways that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can survive in different environments and cause disease in diverse hosts.</p>
      <p>Our laboratory has developed a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> - <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> infection-based model for studying host-pathogen interactions that is genetically tractable from both the perspectives of the host and the pathogen. This model (referred to as “slow-killing” or SK), which primarily utilizes <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Rahme1">[8]</xref>, requires live bacteria and a set of bacterial virulence factors that distinguish it from rapid toxin-mediated PA14 killing of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (“fast killing” or FK) that occurs on high osmolarity media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-MahajanMiklos1">[14]</xref>. Under standard laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Brenner1">[15]</xref>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> animals have a normal lifespan of approximately two weeks when feeding on non-pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain OP50, and OP50 does not accumulate in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine during the first few days of life. In contrast, when <italic>C. elegans</italic> are transferred at the L4 larval stage from <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 to a lawn of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14, the animals die in two-three days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan1">[12]</xref>. A few PA14 cells initially accumulate in the anterior and posterior portions of the nematode intestine, then over the course of one to two days bacteria spread throughout the intestine and the intestinal lumen becomes severely distended with a corresponding reduction in volume of the intestinal epithelial cells. Ultimately, PA14 cells move across the intestinal epithelial barrier destroying tissue, but it is not known whether tissue invasion is required for killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Irazoqui1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>C. elegans</italic> rapidly responds to the presence of pathogenic PA14 by enhancing the transcription of hundreds of genes including a number of predicted secreted proteins (C-type lectins, CUB-domain containing proteins, ShK toxins) that may have antimicrobial or detoxifying activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-PukkilaWorley1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Troemel1">[18]</xref>. Two of the major classes of PA14 response genes, C-type lectins and CUB-like domain containing proteins, also play a role in mammalian innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Cash1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Bork1">[21]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, many immune response genes are regulated by the PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the terminal MAPK in an evolutionary conserved signaling cassette required for defense against pathogens in both nematodes and mammals. Approximately 25% of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes regulated by PMK-1 are also induced in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Troemel1">[18]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> p38 MAPK pathway mutants exhibit enhanced sensitivity to PA14 as well as a variety of other bacterial and fungal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Kim1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Sifri1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several hundred genes have been implicated in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence based on data obtained from a wide variety of host infection models (Pseudomonas.com). Many of the well-studied <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence-related factors participate directly or indirectly in physical interactions with the host cell and/or host proteins, including secretion systems (type II, type III, type VI) and associated effectors (including ExoT, ExoU, ExoS, ToxA, phospholipase C, and alkaline protease), flagella, and structures involved in attachment to host cells such as type IV pili. Other recognized virulence factors include those involved in quorum sensing (AHL and PQS systems), iron acquisition (pyochelin, pyoverdine), small molecule/toxin synthesis (phenazines, hydrogen cyanide), alginate, LPS, and biofilm. Not all of these classes of virulence-related factors play a significant role in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; for example, the Type III secretion system and its associated virulence effectors have been shown to play no detectable role in nematode killing, in contrast to playing key roles in pathogenesis in mammals and insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Miyata1">[25]</xref>. However, a variety of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 virulence factors required for killing <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the SK infection model are also required for full pathogenesis in mammalian models, including the quorum sensing regulators LasR and RhlR, the two component regulator GacA, the alternate sigma factor RpoN, the periplasmic protease MucD, and the phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase and transcriptional regulator PtsP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Hendrickson1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Willcox1">[29]</xref>. Additionally <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence-related factors involved in LPS biogenesis and type IV pilus assembly and function also play a role in both mammalian and <italic>C. elegans</italic> hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Craig1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Pier1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A common theme that has emerged from the study of bacterial virulence in a wide variety of pathogens and hosts is an association linking virulence-related genes with regions of genomic plasticity, including genomic pathogenicity islands (PAIs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Groisman1">[34]</xref>, so-called “replacement islands” harboring the pyoverdine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Smith1">[35]</xref> and O-antigen biosynthetic loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Raymond1">[36]</xref>, and plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Jackson1">[37]</xref>. These findings indicate that horizontal gene transfer has played an important role in the evolution of virulence. For example, phylogenetic analysis of three sub-families of the type III effector HopZ in the plant pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, suggested that at least two were acquired by <italic>P. syringae</italic> from disparate donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Ma1">[38]</xref>. Analysis of the occurrence of virulence factors across many pathogen genomes has suggested that there is an overrepresentation of virulence factors on genomic islands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-HoSui1">[39]</xref>, and two virulence factor- containing pathogenicity islands, PAPI-I and PAPI-II, have been identified in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-He1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although there are many published examples linking virulence-related factors to putative pathogenicity islands, a preliminary study from our laboratory showed that the presence of genes occurring in the highly virulent strain PA14, but not in the less virulent strain PAO1, could not be correlated with increased virulence across a wider sampling of strains, suggesting that virulence is a combinatorial and multifactorial product of the interactions of many potential virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lee1">[32]</xref>. These data were seemingly at odds with the expected over-representation of virulence factors in strain-specific regions such as genomic islands, but were not definitive because only a limited set of virulence factors were available for analysis. Further, comparison of the sequences of five pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains suggested that virulence was primarily encoded by a core <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Mathee1">[41]</xref>, a set of genes shared by all strains, and not the auxiliary genome defined by regions of genomic plasticity that are strain-specific. An unbiased comprehensive list of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors required to cause disease in <italic>C. elegans</italic> would allow us to better understand what genes are the major contributors to virulence and whether these genes are primarily located in regions of genome plasticity or not. We considered this question worthy of investigation because it seemed likely to us that the virulence factors of an opportunistic multi-host pathogen might as a group be distinct from the virulence factors of host-specific pathogens.</p>
      <p>We report here the results of a genome-wide screen using a previously constructed non-redundant PA14 transposon library consisting of 5850 members that represents insertions in approximately 80% of the non-essential ORFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Liberati1">[42]</xref>. Previous studies to identify <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors <italic>in vivo</italic> using a number of different technologies and infection models have been limited by the complexity and redundancy of mutant collections or screening procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Hendrickson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Yorgey1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Wiehlmann1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Mulcahy1">[51]</xref>. We examined the genes identified in this genome-wide screen for their functions, presence on putative and characterized genomic islands, and their phylogenetic distribution across prokaryotes. We demonstrate that the major genes contributing to PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are not enriched on genomic islands, are not PA14 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> specific genes, and may in fact be biased for ancient genes common to many other prokaryotic species.</p>

          <title>Primary screen</title>
          <p>A non-redundant (NR) library of <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> transposon insertion mutants representing approximately 75% of the total and 80% of the non-essential ORFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 was screened for attenuation of virulence in an infection-based model of <italic>C. elegans</italic> killing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s014">Table S1</xref> for an overall scheme of the screen). In this infection assay, called “slow killing” (SK), nematode death requires live bacteria and correlates with accumulation of bacteria in the nematode intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Irazoqui1">[16]</xref>. Ideally, we would have screened the entire non-redundant transposon library using the SK assay, but the relatively large number of mutants (5850) in the library made direct quantitation of killing kinetics impractical for a primary screen. In previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan2">[13]</xref> and in new experiments with known virulence-attenuated mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s002">Figure S2</xref>), we observed that the quantity and maturity of the brood size of an infected hermaphroditic worm is generally inversely correlated with the virulence of the infecting PA14 strain. Under our standard assay conditions, wild-type PA14 kills <italic>C. elegans</italic> rapidly enough to dramatically diminish the number of progeny produced, and the few larvae that hatch do not reach maturity. However, PA14 mutants with reduced virulence (such as <italic>gacA, lasR, mucD</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s002">Figure S2</xref>) allow the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites to produce a significant brood that is able to reach adulthood and in turn become gravid, often consuming the entire bacterial lawn. Based on these data, we concluded that we could use PA14-mediated nematode brood size reduction, a much less time consuming assay than monitoring death of a population of worms, as a proxy for PA14-mediated killing.</p>

          <p>A total of 5,754 mutants (the complete 5,850 PA14 NR library minus one 96-well plate consisting of previously characterized slow-growing mutants) was screened twice on SK agar in standard 6-well assay plates for mutants that permitted an increase in <italic>C. elegans</italic> progeny number or allowed the brood to mature to adulthood when compared to wild-type PA14. In this primary screen, 399 mutants (corresponding to 368 genes and three mutants in intergenic regions) were identified as potentially attenuated in virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s014">Table S1</xref>). From the set of 399 putative virulence-attenuated mutants, 86 auxotrophic or growth-defective mutants corresponding to 74 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s015">Table S2</xref>) were identified by replica plating on minimal medium. Some but not all of the 86 auxotrophic mutants formed noticeably thin lawns on the SK agar plates. We reasoned that the 86 mutants with fundamental growth defects were not relevant to our study of virulence and we eliminated them from future studies. This left 313 putative virulence-related mutants corresponding to 294 distinct genes and three mutants in intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s016">Table S3</xref>).</p>

          <p>The 313 putative PA14 virulence-related mutants that did not appear to be dependent on the addition of amino acids or nucleotides for growth on minimal media were re-tested using <italic>C. elegans</italic> slow killing assays. Specifically, the survival of 60–80 wild-type N2 Bristol worms was quantified at two or three different time points following manual transfer of individual worms from <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 to a lawn of each PA14 mutant. In addition, the number of progeny produced was scored after four days. Each batch of mutants tested in the secondary screen included two known attenuated mutants, the strongly avirulent quorum sensing regulatory mutant <italic>lasR</italic> and the moderately attenuated type IV pilus protein mutant <italic>pilA</italic>. The mutants from the secondary screen were ranked with respect to these controls. About 63% (198) of the 313 non-auxotrophic mutants from the primary screen exhibited an attenuated killing phenotype or increased brood size in the secondary screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s014">Table S1</xref>). The insertion sites of <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> in the attenuated mutants from the secondary screen were re-sequenced to verify their identity and the mutants were rescored for readily apparent growth defects in overnight cultures or on plates. As a result, 18 mutants that had either incorrectly annotated sequence or were slow growing were removed from the list. Of the 180 remaining virulence-attenuated mutants from the secondary screen (representing 170 genes and one mutant in an intergenic region), 34 were strongly attenuated (similar to <italic>lasR</italic>), 76 were moderately attenuated (greater than or equal to <italic>pilA</italic>), and 70 were weakly attenuated (less than <italic>pilA</italic> but allowing greater parental or progeny survival than wild-type PA14) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s017">Table S4</xref>).</p>
          <p>Previously in our laboratory, 17 PA14 mutants were shown to exhibit an attenuated phenotype in a standard <italic>C. elegans</italic> SK assay. Of these 17, 15 were identified in relatively small-scale forward genetic screens (<italic>aefA, lasR, mtrR, ptsP, gacA, gacS</italic>, PA14_03370, ORF_10 (PA14_23420), ORF_11 (PA14_23430), PA14_27680 (GID6172), PA14_27700 (GID6170), <italic>pilC</italic>, PA14_59010, PA14_59070 and <italic>pilW</italic>) and two by a candidate gene approach testing predicted virulence factors (<italic>rpoN, mucD</italic>). Of these 17 genes, 16 are represented by mutants in the PA14 non-redundant library (<italic>lasR</italic> is absent). One of these 16, <italic>rpoN</italic>, grows very slowly under our conditions and was not assayed. Thus 15 previously identified mutants could potentially have been recovered in the screen of the non-redundant library. In fact, nine of these 15 previously identified mutants were identified in the primary screen and eight of these nine also scored as positives in the secondary screen (strongly attenuated <italic>ptsP, gacA, gacS</italic>, and PA14_27700 (GID6170), moderately attenuated i.e. close to the attenuation of <italic>pilA</italic>, ORF_11, <italic>mucD</italic>, and PA14_27680 (GID6172), and very weakly attenuated PA14_03370). At least four of the remaining seven previously identified virulence-related genes (ORF_10, <italic>pilC</italic>, PA14_59010, PA14_59070) that we did not isolate in the secondary screen exhibited virulence-related phenotypes approximately equal to <italic>pilA</italic>, which has a phenotype at the lower limit of sensitivity for recovery in the progeny-based screen (note an ORF-10 mutant was recovered in the primary screen but not the secondary). Although <italic>pilC</italic> and ORF_10 were not recovered in the secondary screen, other type IV pilus and O-antigen synthesis mutants (<italic>pilF, pilW, pilU</italic> and ORF_11) were identified. Based on these data, we conclude that the genome-wide screen that we carried out to identify PA14 virulence-related factors was successful in identifying the majority of the virulence-related mutants in the non-redundant library with strong killing-attenuated phenotypes, but that many potential mutants with relatively weak attenuated phenotypes were probably overlooked.</p>
          <p>We compared the genes identified in our screen to a set of 241 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 virulence-related genes downloaded from the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). VFDB is, a compilation of virulence factors from a wide variety of pathogens in numerous host systems that includes virulence factor sets for PA14 and for three other <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Yang1">[52]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/</ext-link>). The VFDB set for PA14 incorporates well-studied virulence factor classes, most abundantly those involved in adherence/motility (flagella, type IV pilus, LPS), alginate, rhamnolipids, iron uptake (pyochelin and pyoverdine), quorum sensing, global regulators (GacA/GacS), proteases (alkaline protease, LasA, LasB), lipases (PlcH, PlcN), secretion systems and associated effectors (type III, type VI), pyocyanin pigment and toxins (ToxA, hydrogen cyanide). The degree of overlap between the VFDB genes and those identified in our screen increased between the primary and secondary round of screening, with VFDB genes constituting 10.2% (30 of 294) of the genes identified in the primary screen and 11.8% (20 of 170) of the genes identified in the secondary screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

Only one functional class, LPS and capsule biosynthesis, was marginally statistically overrepresented (p-value = 0.013) after FDR correction. In addition, the 170 genes were mapped onto the KEGG pathway database to determine whether particular biochemical pathways were enriched and were categorized by GO term with DAVID. Neither the KEGG pathway nor the GO term analysis revealed any significant overrepresentation of pathways or GO terms.</p>

          <title>The PA14 secondary virulence screen did not enrich for known secretion systems or secreted effectors</title>
          <p>Canonical virulence factors such as those present in VFDB are enriched in extracellular proteins (10% in VFDB vs. a little over 1% in the PA14 genome and NR mutant set) and in various secretion systems (22% in VFDB vs. approximately 2% in the PA14 genome). In contrast, mutations with consistent or strong phenotypes in any of the known secretion systems or effectors were significantly underrepresented in our genome-wide screen. Among 62 documented PA14 secreted proteins and their chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Bleves1">[53]</xref> (PA14 database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/pa14/annotation/start.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/pa14/annotation/start.cgi</ext-link>), 55 of which correspond to mutants in the PA14 NR Set, only one was also found in the 180 virulence-attenuated mutant set from the secondary screen. Similarly, although our primary screen identified 15 of 97 NR set mutants annotated to be secretion apparatus proteins or their chaperones (type II, III, V and VI), only six of these were retained after the secondary screen. Three of the secretion apparatus loci mutants isolated in the secondary screen (type II secretion loci <italic>xcpT</italic>, <italic>xcpZ</italic> and <italic>secB</italic>) exhibited only slight attenuation of virulence and three had moderate attenuation of virulence roughly equivalent to the <italic>pilA</italic> mutant control (typeII <italic>tatC</italic> and type VI HSI-I locus clpVI and type VI HIS-II <italic>fha2</italic>). Although we isolated two type VI mutants in our screen it is unclear what this means as many of the type VI structural loci were not identified, and two large deletions of type VI HSI-II and HIS-III had little effect on virulence (data not shown). These data do not strongly implicate a particular secretion system as predominant in PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and are consistent with previous work from our lab, which showed that the type III secretion system mutants had no detectable attenuation of virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Miyata1">[25]</xref>. On the other hand, the failure to observe a phenotype with the secretion defective mutants may be a consequence of built-in redundancy.</p>

          <title>Comparison of the 170 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> putative virulence genes identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with genes required for virulence in a rat chronic infection model</title>
          <p>In order to evaluate the degree to which virulence genes from our screen represent putative conserved virulence determinants, we compared the 170 genes identified in our secondary screen with the largest available set of genes identified in another unbiased screen, a negative signature tagged mutagenesis (STM) selection for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants defective in virulence in a rat chronic respiratory infection model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Potvin1">[46]</xref>. It is notable that like the 170 genes identified in our screen, and in contrast with the VFDB set, the 148 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes identified by Potvin et al (2003) by STM also appear as a group to possess a broad distribution across all functional classes. The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutant set identified in the rat chronic infection model exhibits an underrepresentation of secreted proteins and secretion systems and includes a number of auxotrophic mutants and many mutants in genes with enzymatic functions not previously linked to pathogenesis, reminiscent of the mutants identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Only five genes identified in the rat infection model were also found in the 170 gene set from our secondary screen and only one of these was also found in the VFDB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s004">Figure S4</xref>). A number of well-studied <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors, required for slow killing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in some mammalian infection models, including <italic>gacA</italic>, <italic>lasR</italic>, <italic>rhlR</italic>, <italic>ptsP</italic>, <italic>mucD</italic>, and <italic>rpoN</italic>, are absent from the rat chronic infection set. We do not know if this reflects a difference between chronic and acute infections, nor whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model is more analogous to acute or chronic infection in mammals. These data suggest that genes required for virulence under a particular set of circumstances are highly dependent on host model, infection site, and most likely phase of infection.</p>

          <title>Tertiary screen</title>
          <p>The relatively large number of positive mutants (180 corresponding to 170 genes) from the secondary screen made it necessary to prioritize mutants for further characterization. A subset of 58 mutants/genes was selected based on strength of attenuation, annotation (biased toward regulators and mutants with functions previously implicated in virulence), whether they were in putative operons or functionally grouped with other attenuated mutants, and whether they exhibited normal doubling times (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s018">Table S5</xref>) included 31 mutants with strongly attenuated virulence similar to that of the <italic>lasR</italic> quorum sensing mutant (34 such mutants were isolated but <italic>gacA</italic>, <italic>ptsP</italic> and <italic>pepP</italic> were represented by two mutants each and a single allele of these three genes was carried through the tertiary screen), 22 mutants with moderately attenuated virulence (less attenuated than <italic>lasR</italic> but equal to or more attenuated than <italic>pilA</italic>), and five weakly attenuated mutants (less attenuated than <italic>pilA</italic>).</p>
          <p>In the tertiary screen, each of the 58 selected mutants was subjected to SK assays using 100–150 <italic>fer-15(b26)II;fem-1(hc17)IV</italic> worms and the time to 50% survival was determined. Sterile <italic>fer-15;fem-1</italic> worms were used in these assays to avoid production of a brood that would complicate the scoring of death of the parental worms. <italic>fer-15;fem-1</italic> animals, while slightly more resistant to PA14 than N2 worms, have previously been used to study the transcriptional response of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to PA14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Troemel1">[18]</xref>. Importantly, wild-type N2 worms and <italic>fer-15;fem-1</italic> worms exhibit comparable relative susceptibilities to a <italic>gacA</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Troemel1">[18]</xref>. Four mutants (PA4296, <italic>rcsC</italic>, <italic>bkdA1</italic>, and <italic>norB</italic>) did not re-test as avirulent in the tertiary assay, three (in ORFs PA2658, PA14_4560 and PA4745) exhibited impaired growth in LB overnight cultures that had been previously overlooked and two mutants were removed based on ambiguity as to which ORF they were inactivating (mutants #38436 and #5691) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s018">Table S5</xref>).

          <title>Multiple transposon alleles confirm avirulent phenotypes</title>
          <p>One of the bottlenecks in a large-scale screen such as the one described in this paper is verification of the mutant phenotypes. In general, the gold standard to correlate phenotype with genotype is to generate an in-frame deletion mutant and then complement the mutant in trans to establish that the phenotype observed is due to the defect in the identified gene. Because the goal of our screen was to obtain an overview of the major factors utilized by PA14 to infect and kill <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we were interested in characterizing a large collection of mutants. Generation of in-frame deletions for all the genes of interest was prohibitively time-consuming. As an alternative, we reasoned that by examining multiple independent <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> insertion mutations in candidate virulence-related genes, as well as insertions in adjacent genes within putative operons, we could: a) verify the avirulent phenotype of the original mutation, b) reduce the likelihood that the avirulent phenotype was due to polar effects of the original transposon insertion on downstream ORFs, and c) eliminate the possibility that second-site mutations were responsible for the less virulent phenotype. The NR PA14 library of 5,850 mutants was selected from more that 24,000 sequenced <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> transposon insertion mutations and on average each gene in the NR library is represented by 4.3 transposon insertions in this “master” library of 24,000 mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Liberati1">[42]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Among the mutations in the 49 genes that re-tested as avirulent in the tertiary screen, there were 44 genes for which there was more than one corresponding transposon insertion. (However, three genes for which multiple insertion alleles existed, <italic>gacS</italic>, <italic>pilF</italic> and <italic>aruD</italic>, were only tested with single alleles. <italic>gacS</italic> and <italic>pilF</italic> had been previously implicated in virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in the case of <italic>aruD</italic>, the entire <italic>aru</italic> operon was shown to be virulence-attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A total of 72 additional insertion mutants corresponding to 41 of the 49 genes were tested in SK assays. These assays resulted in the elimination of eight genes (PA2089, PA0902, PA1032, PA0533, PA4016, <italic>clpS</italic>, <italic>sltB1</italic> and <italic>pvdD</italic>) from further consideration because the additional transposon insertions in these genes did not cause an attenuated killing phenotype (representative data are shown for <italic>clpS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and PA4016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

          <p>We noticed that in 4/8 cases where the phenotype of the mutant identified in the screen was not recapitulated by additional alleles (putative transcriptional regulator PA0533 mutant #22525, probable penicillin amidase PA1032 mutant #6114, hypothetical protein PA4016 mutant #22683, and <italic>pvdD</italic> PA2399 mutant #5205), the original allele was in a <italic>ΔexoU</italic> background, which carries an in-frame deletion of the type III effector ExoU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Liberati1">[42]</xref>.

The observation that 50% of the mutants in which the original phenotype did not recapitulate with multiple alleles also contained a <italic>ΔexoU</italic> mutation despite the fact that less than 4% of the transposon insertions in the NR library are in the <italic>ΔexoU</italic> background suggests that the mutation in <italic>exoU</italic> might create a sensitized genetic background to identify other putative virulence factors. In support of this conclusion, two alleles of <italic>gshB</italic> (#42799 identified in our screen and #28669 from the master library) exhibited modest virulence attenuation (LT<sub>50</sub> mutant/LT<sub>50</sub> WT PA14 = 1.25 and 1.30 respectively), whereas a third <italic>gshB</italic> insertion allele in the <italic>ΔexoU</italic> background (#6613) showed a considerably stronger attenuated phenotype (LT<sub>50</sub> mutant/LT<sub>50</sub> WT PA14 = 1.68) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).

          <title>Additional transposon mutants used to examine the role of identified operons</title>
          <p>In bacteria, genes that function in common processes are frequently co-regulated in operons or clustered in the genome. We utilized the public PA14 database constructed in our laboratory [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/pa14" xlink:type="simple">http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/pa14</ext-link>] and BIOCYC [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biocyc.org/PAER208963/NEW-IMAGE?object=Transcription-Units" xlink:type="simple">http://biocyc.org/PAER208963/NEW-IMAGE?object=Transcription-Units</ext-link>] to predict whether the genes corresponding to the avirulent mutants identified were in operons, based on annotation and the proximity and direction of transcription of adjacent genes. Of the 41 genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g002">Figure 2</xref>, our analysis suggested that 27 are located in 22 putative operons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Multiple insertion mutations in three operons were identified in our screen, four in the <italic>aru</italic> operon (<italic>aruC, aruG, aruD, aruB</italic>), two in a pyochelin biosynthetic operon (<italic>pchH, pchI</italic>), and two (PA1766, PA1767) in an operon of unknown function. Utilizing the master insertion library of 24,000 mutants, we tested an additional 38 mutants (corresponding to 24 genes) in 11/22 of the putative operons and thereby identified six more genes in five operons that resulted in virulence attenuation when mutated: <italic>aruF</italic>, which is part of the <italic>aru</italic> operon; ORF_10, which had been isolated in a previous screen and together with ORF_11 forms a predicted transcription unit involved in O-antigen biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lee1">[32]</xref>; <italic>pqsA</italic>, which is required for synthesis of the quinolone quorum sensing molecule located upstream in the <italic>pqsE</italic> operon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Deziel1">[55]</xref>; PA1218 and PA1221, which are upstream of PA1216 in an operon of unknown function; and PA4000 at the end of the operon containing PA4005. Note that mutations in <italic>proA</italic> and <italic>nadD</italic> directly upstream of PA4005 in the operon were identified in our primary screen but discarded because they are auxotrophs. Interestingly, in the case of 5/11 putative operons (containing <italic>pepP, kinB</italic>, PA0745, <italic>clpA</italic> and <italic>fha2</italic>) for which mutations in multiple genes were analyzed, only mutation of a single gene in the operon resulted in an attenuated phenotype. Two genes in the final operon examined (<italic>pchH, pchI</italic>) were identified in the primary and secondary screens, but mutations in the other genes in this pyochelin operon had no significant effect on virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). It is important to keep in mind that not all the genes in each of the operons examined were represented by <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> insertions in the master library.</p>
          <p>Our finding that mutation of some but not all genes in an operon affect virulence may indicate redundant functions (perhaps located elsewhere in the genome) for those with no mutant phenotype or unique roles in virulence for specific genes within the operon. The <italic>aru</italic> operon, which encodes the catabolic enzymes for aerobic utilization of arginine as a carbon, nitrogen and energy source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Schneider1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Itoh1">[57]</xref>, represented an unusual case where 5/5 genes in the <italic>aruCFDGB</italic> operon all exhibited a similar moderate attenuation of virulence when mutated. The <italic>aru</italic> insertion mutations did not observably affect growth of the bacteria on SK plates (although a single mutant in <italic>aruF</italic> #56181 had somewhat reduced growth on minimal media in the absence of nucleotides and amino acids) suggesting that the catabolism of arginine may be important for growth or virulence of the bacteria within the nematode. Interestingly, mutation of <italic>aruE</italic>, which is located downstream and adjacent to the <italic>aruFGDB</italic> operon, did not result in an avirulent phenotype. In the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA01 <italic>aruE</italic> is reported to be a separate transcription unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Itoh1">[57]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Virulence-Related Phenotypes of Selected Mutants</title>
        <p>Seven putative virulence-related factors, cold shock domain protein PA0456, ABC transporters PchH and PchI, aminopeptidase PepP, putative enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase PA0745, ATPase/molecular chaperone ClpA, and putative transcriptional regulator PA14_27700 were chosen for further study. Mutants corresponding to these factors (<italic>clpA</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; <italic>pchH and pchI</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <italic>pepP</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s005">Figure S5B</xref>; PA0456, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s006">Figure S6B</xref>; PA14_27700, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s008">Figure S8B</xref>; and PA0745, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s009">Figure S9B</xref>, C) all have a strong avirulent phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, exhibit normal growth kinetics <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s012">Figure S12</xref>), and represent genes whose role in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence has not been previously characterized. The avirulent phenotype of all these mutants was confirmed with multiple transposon alleles except for <italic>pchH</italic> for which there is only a single allele available. In addition, in the case of PA0745, an in-frame deletion mutant was generated that was severely impaired in virulence, similar to the transposon allele #37629 isolated in the screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s009">Figure S9C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Many of the genes previously identified as necessary for virulence of PA14 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, for example those coding for the quorum sensing regulators RhlR and LasR, are known regulators of multiple virulence factors or virulence associated pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Wagner1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Schuster1">[59]</xref>. Both <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic> mutants have a spectrum of pigment and motility defects. <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic> mutants produce reduced levels of the blue-green pigment pyocyanin, <italic>rhlR</italic> produces no pyocyanin, and <italic>lasR</italic> mutants produce varying amounts dependent on conditions and growth phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Dekimpe1">[60]</xref>. Under certain growth conditions, <italic>rhlR</italic> and <italic>lasR</italic> mutants have been reported to produce less of the fluorescent siderophore pyoverdine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Stintzi1">[61]</xref>. <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic> mutants also exhibit dramatically reduced swarming motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Kohler1">[62]</xref>, which is dependent on both the type IV pilus and the flagella and regulated by quorum sensing and a host of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Yeung1">[63]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We tested the seven selected virulence-related mutants for defects in motility (twitching, swimming and swarming assays) as well as for pyocyanin and pyoverdine production in comparison to <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic> mutants to determine whether they had a similar spectrum of defects and/or could be classified into groups based on common pigment or motility phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002813-t002">Table 2</xref>). It should be noted that of these phenotypes, only mutants in which type IV pilus function is affected have been shown to exhibit reduced virulence in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> infection model; pyocyanin does not appear to be necessary for virulence in the SK model and the roles of pyoverdine production, swimming and swarming have not been directly tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-MahajanMiklos1">[14]</xref>. Significantly, with the exception of PA14_27700, all of the mutants exhibited defects in some aspect of motility or pigment production. Mutation of putative cold shock protein PA0456 diminished pyocyanin production as did the quorum sensing regulators <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic>, whereas a <italic>pepP</italic> mutant had elevated pyocyanin levels. The putative enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase PA0745 produced reduced levels of pyoverdine. Among the tested mutants, 4/7 had clear swarming defects, but exhibited normal levels of swimming and twitching motility, suggesting that neither flagella nor type IV pili function was compromised. The <italic>clpA</italic> mutant was slightly attenuated for swarming and twitching, implying that there might be a type IV pilus defect in this mutant.</p>

        <title>Characterization of Genomic and Phylogenetic Distribution of Virulence-Attenuated Genes</title>
        <p>The list of PA14 genes identified as being required for full virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> from the genome-wide screen provided the opportunity to examine the distribution within a species and conservation across bacterial species of a large set of genes required for virulence in a single host. We determined whether this set of virulence associated genes was biased towards <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> core or strain-specific (auxiliary) regions of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome (as defined by Mathee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Mathee1">[41]</xref> and/or whether these virulence genes were preferentially located on genomic islands, as previously suggested for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-HoSui1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-He1">[40]</xref>. In addition, we examined whether the PA14 virulence genes had a narrow phylogenetic distribution (unique to PA14, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, or closely-related organisms) or were broadly distributed across prokaryotic phylogeny.</p>
        <p>We used four sets of genes identified in our screen and a set of previously defined PA14 virulence genes downloaded from the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) for all analyses. The sets of unique genes identified in the primary (294), secondary (170) and tertiary (41) virulence-attenuated screens outlined above and the auxotrophic genes identified in the primary screen but subsequently discarded (76) were used and for simplicity are referred to below as primary, secondary, tertiary, and auxotroph sets. All statistical analyses of the virulence genes identified in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> screen were done in comparison to the genes represented in the non-redundant (NR) library, as opposed to the entire PA14 genome, because this was the starting set for the screen. We used all four sets of genes in our comparisons to gain statistical power because the final set of 41 verified virulence-related genes was so small that most analyses did not make statistical cutoffs. In addition, using sets of genes from subsequent rounds of screening allowed us to look for enrichment that correlated with the refinement of the screen. To compare the virulence-related genes identified in our screen to previously identified <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes, we made use of a set of 241 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 virulence genes downloaded from the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Yang1">[52]</xref>.</p>

The auxiliary genome is dispersed across the chromosome with regions of genomic plasticity containing strain-specific segments bordered by conserved genes. It should be noted that approximately 66% of the auxiliary genome is found in species outside of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Mathee1">[41]</xref> and that the designated auxiliary and core genes may change somewhat over time as more <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genomes are sequenced. The distribution of the primary, secondary, and tertiary genes in the core versus auxiliary genome was statistically identical to the distribution of genes in the NR set. That is, roughly 15% of the virulence-related genes were part of the auxiliary genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s020">Table S7</xref>). By comparison, we performed the same analysis with the auxotrophic genes and as expected for genes necessary for fundamental cellular metabolism, this set was significantly over-represented in the core genome (p-value = 0.009). Therefore, despite the fact that PA14 is much more virulent than strain PA01 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> killing assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lee1">[32]</xref>, our set of functionally defined PA14 virulence factors show no bias for the set of genes that is present in PA14 but absent in PAO1, consistent with our previous preliminary conclusion based on a much smaller data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lee1">[32]</xref>. Likewise, the representation of the VFDB genes in the core and auxiliary genomes was not significantly different from that of the NR set.</p>

          <title>Location of PA14 virulence-attenuated genes on genomic island versus non-islands</title>
          <p>We retrieved a list of predicted genomic islands of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 from the IslandViewer website <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Langille1">[64]</xref> at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/query.php" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/query.php</ext-link>). IslandViewer combines multiple methods of genomic island prediction. A list of PA14 genes located on the predicted islands was compiled. However, we noticed that the set of genes predicted to be on islands by IslandViewer only included 20 of the 143 genes located on the previously defined genomic islands PAPI-1, PAPI-2 and PAGI-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-He1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Liang1">[65]</xref>. Therefore, an additional set of genes was compiled consisting of the 143 genes located on these known islands. We determined whether PA14 virulence genes identified in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> screen were associated with predicted genomic islands or with previously defined islands. Among the PA14 NR mutant set (3.0%; 131) of the genes represented are located on predicted genomic islands (similar to the 3.6%; 215 in entire PA14 genome). None of the identified auxotroph genes were located on predicted genomic islands and only one was located on a known genomic island. The virulence-related genes identified in our screen exhibited no bias for incorporation on the genomic islands predicted by IslandViewer nor on known genomic islands (PAPI-1, PAPI-2, and PAGI-1); in fact a non-statistically significant skew towards non-island regions of the genome was observed for the primary, secondary and tertiary sets in both comparisons.

          <title>Breadth of phylogenetic distribution of PA14 virulence genes across prokaryotes</title>
          <p>Are the predominant contributors to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes that are unique to PA14 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or are they common to many bacteria? The comparisons above suggest that they are not PA14 specific genes, but to ask the question more generally we used a variation of the phylostratigraphy approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-DomazetLoso1">[66]</xref> in which we evaluated the breadth of the phylogenetic distribution of each PA14 gene by examining 727 bacterial genomes for orthologs of these genes. Each gene was designated as belonging to one of seven breadth categories or phylostrata (0–6) depending on its distribution across the bacterial kingdom, with “0” representing genes that are only present in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, “1” for genes present in other <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains but absent outside the species, “2” for genes occurring in other species in the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> but absent outside the genus, and so forth, with the most broadly-distributed category “6” found in Archaea as well as bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s013">Figure S13</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). It should be noted that each ORF is given a “breadth of phylogenetic distribution” designation based on the presence of a putative ortholog in the most distantly related organism and does not necessarily imply that orthologs for the given ORF are present in all groups less divergent than this most distantly related organism.</p>
          <p>Whereas “breadth of phylogenetic distribution” may be a meaningful surrogate for the age of a gene in the case of eukaryotes, there is a significant pitfall to using it as such in prokaryotes, because horizontal gene transfer between unrelated prokaryotic lineages could distort the apparent age of a gene. An apparently young, narrowly distributed gene could be older than it seems if horizontally transferred from a previously unrelated unsequenced organism, but it would appear to be a new within the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lineage. A more serious problem is presented by genes that appear older than they are, as a result of a limited number of horizontal gene transfer events between unrelated lineages. We reasoned that we could mitigate this latter complication by including information about the frequency of occurrence across the clades in which genes are represented. Broadly distributed genes that occur with high frequency across their phylogenetic breadths, have, we believe, a greater likelihood of being genuinely “old” genes. We therefore created a subset of our most broadly distributed genes, categories 4, 5, and 6, that are also represented in 50% or more of the sequenced genomes in the clades in which they occur. We dubbed this subset “high-frequency-broad-phylogeny” or HFBP genes, which comprise 6.9% of the NR Set. Since we were also interested in examining the representation of the newest or most recently acquired genes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14, we also considered genes that were <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-genus-specific, which we dubbed “PGS” genes. For this set, we binned genes of breadths 0, 1, and 2, which total 9.6% of the NR set, reasoning that such a set would represent relatively new genes, while at the same time being a large enough set to provide some statistical power.</p>
          <p>The distribution of phylogenetic breadths of all the PA14 genes, all the PA14 NR set mutants, and the primary, secondary, tertiary and auxotrophic set mutants is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s013">Figure S13</xref>, with statistical analysis presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s020">Table S7</xref>. The virulence-attenuated primary, secondary, and tertiary sets of genes identified in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> screen show a trend of underrepresentation in the narrowest phylogenetic breadth classes, with the tertiary positives, the set that predominantly includes highly virulence-attenuated mutants, being most underrepresented in the narrow phylogenetic breadth classes. However, taken individually, these underrepresentations are not statistically significant, due to the small number of mutants in each set.</p>
          <p>When the same analysis was performed examining the HFBP and PGS gene sets in comparison with all the other PA14 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002813-g008">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s020">Table S7</xref>), we observed that there was a significant overrepresentation of HFBP genes among auxotroph set (p-value = 5.47×10<sup>−28</sup>) and in the primary, secondary and tertiary mutant sets (p-values of 0.00004, 0.0005, 0.006, respectively). At the same time, there was an underrepresentation of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-genus-specific (PGS) genes among the primary set (5.8% vs 9.6% in the NR Set, with p-value = 0.01), and the proportion of PGS genes appeared even more depleted among secondary and tertiary gene sets (5.3% and 2.4%), although the smaller size of these sets rendered these underrepresentations not statistically significant. However, we believe the statistically significant underrepresentation of PGS genes in the primary set, combined with the successive, increasing depletion of that category in the secondary and tertiary positives, suggests that those depletions are not spurious. In contrast to the gene sets from our screen, HFBP genes were underrepresented in the VFDB <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 gene set (p-value = 0.00013). The apparent underrepresentation of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-genus-specific genes, most likely the youngest genes, and the overrepresentation of high-frequency-broad-phylogeny genes that likely represent older genes, point to a skew in the primary, secondary, and tertiary mutant sets toward older genes, and away from young, newly-acquired, or fast-evolving genes.</p>

              <p>Based on phylostratigraphic analysis, PA14 genes required for virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> were classified as either “<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-genus-specific” (PGS), presumably representing the newest genes in PA14, “high-frequency-broad-phylogeny” (HFBP), representing the oldest, most conserved genes in PA14, or “all others”. The percentage of each gene set, including the PA14 genome genes, the PA14-NR, primary, secondary, tertiary, auxotroph, and VFDB gene sets that are classified as PGS genes, HFBP genes, or all others genes, are shown. HFBP genes comprise 10% of the PA14 genome, and about 7% of the NR set genes. Furthermore, HFBP genes are increasingly overrepresented with successive iterations of the screen accounting for 13% of the primary set (p-value = 0.00004), 14% of the secondary set (p-value = 0.0005) and 19% of the tertiary set (p-value = 0.006). HFBP genes make up greater than 50% of the auxotroph set with a (p-value = 5.47×10<sup>−28</sup>) relative to the NR set. The PA14 VFDB set contains an underrepresentation of HFBP genes (1.6%, p-value = 0.0001). PGS genes make up 11% and 9.6% of the PA14 genome and NR set respectively. Over successive iterations of the screen, PGS genes become numerically more underrepresented relative to the NR set, comprising 5.7% of the primary set (5.7%, p-value = 0.01), 5.2% of the secondary set (p-value = 0.03, not statistically significant), and 2.4% of the tertiary set (p-value = 0.08, not statistically significant). Due to the small numbers of genes in the secondary and tertiary sets, only the underrepresentation in the primary set is significant after application of multiple comparison correction (FDR, q&lt; = 0.05). PGS genes are underrepresented in the auxotroph set (0%, p-value = 0.0006).

        <title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 Genes Required for <italic>C. elegans</italic> Killing</title>
        <p>We set out to define the spectrum of genes required for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 infection in a single host organism with the ultimate goal of elucidating the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in this multi-host opportunistic pathogen. A genome-wide unbiased screen for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 mutants defective in killing <italic>C. elegans</italic> identified a set of 180 putative virulence-related mutants (corresponding to 170 genes) after two rounds of screening. The screen was validated by the isolation of mutants previously shown to be required for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence in both nematodes and mammals or known to regulate processes or pathways linked to pathogenesis including, but not limited to, genes involved in quorum sensing, two component regulators of virulence, transcriptional regulators, genes involved in type IV pilus production, and O-antigen biosynthesis. Twenty genes in the 170 gene set overlapped with a set of previously defined virulence factors in VFDB, a database of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-related virulence factors. Overall, the PA14 genes identified in the genome-wide screen have an overrepresentation of highly conserved genes present in many bacterial phyla and are part of the stable <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome, rather than being located on pathogenicity islands.</p>
        <p>The set of 170 virulence-related genes is broadly distributed across 27 defined functional classes and DAVID GO term analysis and mapping onto KEGG pathways did not reveal any interpretable enrichment for particular functions or pathways. This breadth of functional classes parallels the virulence-attenuated mutants identified in an independent unbiased screen using signature tagged mutagenesis carried out by Potvin and coworkers in a rat chronic infection model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Potvin1">[46]</xref>. Unlike the genes identified in our screen and by Potvin et al., virulence-related factors in the VFDB are enriched for secretion- and adherence-related proteins. A major difference between the virulence-related genes in VFDB and the genes identified in our unbiased screen is that many of the genes in VFDB were included because they encode secreted toxins, secretion systems, or cell surface structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Yang1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Chen1">[67]</xref>. However, the sensitivity of our screen favored identification of mutants with strongly attenuated virulence. This was expected given the nature of the primary screen that required that both the parent nematodes live long enough to produce a significant brood and that the nematode brood mature on the mutant bacterial lawn. It is possible, therefore that mutants with a weak virulence-attenuated phenotype were not detected and this could potentially skew the collective analysis of virulence factors.</p>
        <p>One explanation for why so few mutants identified in our screen correspond to secretion pathways or to secreted effectors is that many of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence effectors appear to function redundantly in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> killing assay. In support of this conclusion, disruption of the ExoU cytotoxic phospholipase had no statistically significant impact on virulence, but appeared to create a sensitized background that allowed the detection of other relatively weak virulence factors. Further, McEwan et al. have shown that whereas PA14 exotoxin A (<italic>toxA</italic>) mutants have no or little defect in virulence, overexpression of ToxA in <italic>E. coli</italic> activates the worm immune system and ultimately kills an immune-compromised animal, suggesting that ToxA may play an active, but to date undetected, role in PA14 pathogenesis in the nematode host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-McEwan1">[68]</xref>. Similarly, Dunbar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Dunbar1">[69]</xref> have shown that ToxA inhibits protein synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells during an infection. ExoU and ToxA are secreted by distinct systems and the weak virulence attenuation of secretion system mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> implies that multiple secretion systems and effectors may contribute to virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with no single system being paramount.</p>
        <p>An alternative explanation for the identification of a limited number of secretion-related mutants in our screen may be linked to the fitness costs of maintaining a large set of effectors targeting a wide range of potential hosts. Only four Type III effectors have been identified in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, whereas 46 families of effector proteins have been identified in various strains of the related plant pathogen <italic>P. syringae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lindeberg1">[70]</xref> and a typical <italic>P. syringae</italic> strain has 20 to 30 effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Chang1">[71]</xref>. In <italic>P. syringae</italic>, which has a much more limited host range than <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, type III effectors mostly target host defense signaling pathways and both enhance virulence in particular host plants, while eliciting a strong immune response in others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lindeberg2">[72]</xref>. This fact, combined with the observations that the genes encoding secreted effectors are often under diversifying selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Ma1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Schirawski1">[73]</xref> and are typically located in plastic regions of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Lindeberg1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Alfano1">[74]</xref>, suggests that <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains actively co-evolve with a limited number of hosts. In contrast, from first principles, it seems highly unlikely that a broad host-range pathogen like <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 can be simultaneously co-evolving with all of its multiple hosts. Therefore <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> might employ a broader set of strategies to ensure survival in diverse hosts instead of maintaining large sets of host-specific virulence-related effectors.</p>
        <p>In this context, a number of the strongly virulence-attenuated PA14 mutants identified in our screen may correspond to factors that enable survival of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the hostile environment of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal tract, which is acidic and filled with enzymes such as proteases, lipases, and DNAse that potentially disrupt bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-McGhee1">[75]</xref>. Moreover, in response to pathogens, the nematode specifically upregulates transcription of many putative antimicrobial genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Troemel1">[18]</xref>. In order for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to proliferate in the intestine and cause disease, it first has to survive. Both the two component potassium sensor KpdD and the nitrogen assimilation regulatory protein GlnK, identified in our screen, have recently been shown to play a role in the persistence of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine and defects in outer membrane integrity may reduce the survival of <italic>kdpD</italic> and <italic>glnK</italic> mutants in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Alegado1">[76]</xref>. In addition, the identification of two PA14 genes required for biosynthesis of glutathione, <italic>gshA</italic> and <italic>gshB</italic>, may be related to the role of glutathione as a protectant against stresses encountered in the worm intestine including reactive oxygen species and low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Riccillo1">[77]</xref>. Cold shock domain proteins, like PA0465 identified in our screen are another class of molecule that are induced by environmental stress and are generally thought to play a protective role in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Phadtare1">[78]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Identification of a number of PA14 mutants corresponding to metabolic genes illustrates the importance of nutrient acquisition in virulence. Without specific biosynthetic or metabolic capabilities a pathogen may be unable to colonize or grow within a host. For example, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants defective in purine biosynthesis are unable to replicate in neutropenic mice, presumably because the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment is deficient in purine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Wang1">[48]</xref>. In the cases of intercellular pathogens such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, specific amino acid and nucleotide auxotrophs are reduced in growth <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Smith2">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Marquis1">[80]</xref>. We identified a number of metabolic genes including <italic>prpB</italic> and <italic>prpC</italic> and several <italic>aru</italic> genes that may be important for bacterial metabolism and growth under the nutrient conditions within the nematode intestine. Further, some of the putative virulence-attenuated mutants identified in the primary screen that were set aside for further study because they were determined to be auxotrophs (a typical step in many screens) might specifically reflect nutrient availability in the nematode intestine. In this regard it is notable that mutations in nine purine, five pyrimidine, and six tryptophan biosynthetic genes were identified in the primary screen for virulence-attenuated mutants, and although some of these mutants exhibited reduced growth on the killing assay medium, many did not have any observable difference from wild-type PA14, suggesting that the reduction in virulence might be due to aberrant growth of these auxotrophs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
        <p>The predominant contributors to PA14 virulence in our <italic>C. elegans</italic> infection based assay appear not to be individual effectors, but genes that regulate numerous effectors (like the quorum sensing regulators <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic>), genes that are vital for protecting the bacteria from the host defense onslaught, and genes that help <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> obtain the necessary nutrients to survive in the host. Therefore the strategy of a broad host range opportunistic pathogen might fundamentally differ from a pathogen that targets specific hosts, relying more on multiple partially redundant secretion systems and their cognate effectors and strategies for survival under a wide-variety of metabolic and environmental conditions.</p>

        <title>Location of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Virulence Factors in the Core <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Genome</title>
        <p>The long-recognized association between virulence genes and regions of genomic plasticity, particularly genomic islands acquired by lateral transfer of genetic material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Kung1">[81]</xref>, has been attributed to the competitive advantage conferred by horizontally-acquired virulence factors in an ongoing co-evolutionary struggle between a host and pathogen. Two pathogenicity islands carrying plant and animal virulence-related genes have been identified and characterized in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 (PAPI-1 and PAPI-2). Of the 11 genes located on PAPI-1 previously shown to be required for normal levels of virulence in plants and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-He1">[40]</xref>, only one (<italic>rcsC</italic>) was identified in our secondary screen as a weak mutant and it did not re-test in the tertiary screen. Overall our results showed no enrichment of virulence-associated genes on predicted genomic islands, or on the known genomic islands PAPI-1, PAPI-2, or PAGI-1. More generally, whether or not virulence genes in aggregate are preponderantly associated with genomic islands in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has not been experimentally demonstrated. The statistical power of analysis with respect to the genomic locations of genes is limited in part by the fact that not all genes are expected to segregate independently. In this regard, it is worth noting that the apparent enrichment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> VFDB genes on predicted genomic islands is primarily due to the cluster of functionally interdependent Type III secretion apparatus genes located between gene loci PA14_42440 and PA14_42660. In summary, our data and analysis of existing data suggest that neither <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> VFDB genes nor the virulence-attenuated genes identified in our screen are preferentially found on genomic islands.</p>
        <p>Roughly paralleling our observations with genomic islands, our analysis of the frequency of PA14 virulence genes in the core and auxiliary genomes (both from our screen and the VFDB) showed no statistically significant over or underrepresentation. The main difference between the core versus auxiliary genome distinction, and that of genomic islands, is that auxiliary genes include both genes that are lost from the genomes of some isolates, as well as those genes that are newly acquired. Genomic islands by contrast, specifically include only newly acquired genes. Taken together, these results suggest that there is no specific enrichment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence-related genes on islands or in strain-specific regions of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome, at least with respect to those that are involved in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> slow killing assay.</p>
        <p>To further test the hypothesis that the arsenal of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors includes newly evolved and or newly acquired genes we investigated the phylogenetic breadth of distribution of the PA14 virulence genes, as well as the degree to which they belong to a set of putative old conserved genes, the so-called high-frequency-broad-phylogeny (HFBP) set, and probable newer genes, the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-genus-specific (PGS) set. We found that consistent with the result that virulence genes are not located on islands, that PA14 virulence genes involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> killing are enriched in HFBP genes, which as a group are likely to be the most ancient and conserved prokaryotic genes. The vast majority of PA14 virulence genes appear not to be specific to the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus, and in fact, such recently acquired or novel genes are underrepresented among our putative virulence genes. These observations underscore the point that many virulence factors with the most significant contribution to virulence can be old, highly conserved genes.</p>

        <title>Assessing the Generality of the <italic>P. aeruginosa C. elegans</italic> Infection Model</title>
        <p>Although the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model, in which nematodes are “force-fed” a monoculture of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Wiehlmann1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Garvis1">[44]</xref>, is somewhat artificial, so are other laboratory models of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection that require pricking of the body of a fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Kim2">[45]</xref>, lung inoculation with agarose beads in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Potvin1">[46]</xref> and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Bianconi1">[47]</xref>, and non-lethal cutaneous burns in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Stieritz1">[82]</xref>. The artificiality of these models and the need for a compromised host is in part dictated by the opportunistic nature of the pathogen. The fact that conserved immune defense pathways are activated in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> host by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strongly supports the view that the nematode is responding to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as a pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Irazoqui2">[83]</xref>. Although we don't yet know whether <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a natural pathogen of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, since both organisms live in the soil, it is likely that they encounter one another, and it is not inconceivable that the pathogenicity interactions that we observe may approximate the interactions of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with weakened individual <italic>C. elegans</italic> animals in the wild.</p>
        <p>Although some putative <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors are common to both mammalian and <italic>C. elegans</italic> host models, the degree to which <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors are shared, and implicitly, the degree to which <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence strategies are common to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian hosts is not yet clear. That only a single putative virulence-related gene is shared between the 170 virulence-attenuated genes from our secondary set, the rat chronic infection set defined by Potvin et al., and the VFDB set, argues against the idea of a core set of virulence factors common to all infection models. The spectrum of virulence factors that play a role in a given host model is likely to depend on a wide variety of factors including the characteristics of the site of infection, such as pH, ionic strength, nutrient availability, and temperature, the type of immune compromise, the phase of infection, and the particulars of the immune response, including the presence of host factors, and even host behavior. Indeed, two additional PA14 pathogenicity assays in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been developed in our laboratory, a toxin-mediated killing model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Tan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-MahajanMiklos1">[14]</xref> and a liquid killing assay (N. Kirienko and F. Ausubel, unpublished). PA14 appears to utilize distinct mostly non-overlapping sets of virulence-related genes to kill nematodes in the three different models. Nevertheless, all three of these assays have identified virulence factors that play important roles in various aspects of mammalian pathogenesis. The implication for human pathology is that the predominant virulence factors that play a role in different types of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in humans may be somewhat distinct.</p>

        <title>Implications for Multi-host Opportunistic Pathogens</title>
        <p>In summary, the data from our unbiased genome-wide screen for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> killing in a specific infection model, suggest that in comparison to host-specific pathogens, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may employ a smaller arsenal of host-specific effectors, and rely more on conserved, generic virulence factors and on its ability to endure host defense responses. While it is not yet clear that this same strategy is employed by multi-host pathogens beyond <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that are capable of infecting organisms from multiple phylogenetic kingdoms, this may explain why the major genes contributing to PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are not overrepresented on genomic islands, are not PA14 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> specific genes, and may in fact be biased for ancient genes common to many other prokaryotic species. These observations are consistent with the view of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 as a generalist pathogen for which the relationship with <italic>C. elegans</italic> is opportunistic rather than co-evolved. Indeed it is likely that no significant co-evolution occurs between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and any of the hosts for which it is an opportunistic pathogen, both because of the rarity of pathogenic interaction, and because of the likelihood that co-evolution with multiple hosts would necessitate balancing opposing evolutionary pressures from those hosts. From a clinical perspective, the multiplicity and apparent combinatorial nature of <italic>P. aeruginosa's</italic> virulence factors may pose a challenge for the development of new therapeutics to fight <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection. This work does not settle the question of whether the profile of virulence factors of a multi-host pathogen is likely to be different from that of host-specific pathogens in terms of the reliance on conserved effectors that target highly conserved features of eukaryotic biology, but it is a question that deserves further inquiry.</p>

        <p>A database of orthologs of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 genes across 727 sequenced prokaryotic genomes (including PA14) was created.

PA14 proteins were used as BLASTP queries against each bacterial genome. Putative orthologs were reciprocal best hits against the corresponding proteins in the subject genomes. Blast results against subject genomes were required to have an e-value equal to or less than 0.0001. Reciprocal blasts against the PA14 genome were required to have e-values of 0.001 or less. Putative orthologs were required to align for at least 80 percent of their length and have less than 20% difference in protein sequence lengths, thereby conserving overall domain structure. The e-value constraint was permissive to allow detection of distant orthologs, but the requirement for alignment length was fairly stringent. Breadth of phylogenetic distribution, also called phylostratum, was a measure of the maximal phylogenetic distance at which an ortholog occurs. Breadth was defined as: 0 for proteins specific to PA14, 1 for proteins that occur in multiple strains of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, but not in other species, 2 for proteins that occur in multiple <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species but not in other genera, 3 if across gamma and beta proteobacteria, 4 if across proteobacteria, 5 if across eubacteria, and 6 if across eubacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002813.s013">Figure S13</xref>).</p>

        <p>Genes of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 were mapped to KEGG pathways using the KEGG Mapper program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway1.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway1.html</ext-link>). The total number of mutants in each pathway was summed for those genes in the PA14 NR set and for each mutant set analyzed. P-values for overrepresentation of each pathway were calculated using Fisher exact test right-probabilities, and their significance was assessed using the Bonferroni correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Benjamini1">[94]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Abdi1">[95]</xref>. GO term analysis was performed using DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp" xlink:type="simple">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp</ext-link>) using the genes in the NR set as a background, and the genes in the sets of analyzed positives as gene-lists. The DAVID software package calculates p-values for each GO term automatically, and also gives an EASE score, which was used to assess the significance of the overrepresentation of any given GO term.</p>

Mutants in the two downstream genes tested, <italic>ubiH</italic> and PA5222 exhibited wild-type levels of virulence whereas the single mutant in the upstream PA5225 had a modest attenuation of virulence (compared to <italic>pepP</italic>) that might be due to effects on <italic>pepP</italic> expression. <italic>pepP</italic> mutant #31097 produced elevated levels of pyocyanin and had somewhat reduced swimming ability, although swarming was normal on both SK and LB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002813-t002">Table 2</xref>).

PA0456 (previously annotated as <italic>cspB</italic> in the PA14 genome) contains a canonical cold shock domain (CSD) and is homologous to other CSD proteins (57% identical to the major <italic>E. coli</italic> cold shock protein, CspA, and 65% to <italic>B. subtilis</italic> CspB as determined by BLASTP). Although the first cold shock proteins (Csps), a conserved family of small mostly acidic proteins that bind single stranded DNA and RNA, were identified as major proteins induced upon temperature downshift, some members of the family are not induced upon cold shock and many are implicated in other cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Horn1">[101]</xref>. B) Three independent <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> transposon insertions in PA0456 have attenuated virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. C) Transposon insertion mutants in four additional CSD containing genes (<italic>capB</italic> PA3266, PA0961, <italic>cspD</italic> PA2622 and PA1960) have wild-type virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Five additional CSD-containing homologs of PA0456 (PA3266, PA1159, PA0961, PA2622, PA1960) were identified by BLASTP against the PA14 protein database with 76, 66, 62, 54 and 41% identity to PA0456 respectively; all 5 contain a CSD as analyzed by Prosite and transposon insertion mutants were available in 4/5 of these genes. Among the CSD containing proteins tested, PA0456 appears to be unique in its role in virulence, suggesting that the cold shock response per se is most likely not required for virulence of PA14. PA14 PA0456 has been reported to be regulated by quorum sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Balasubramanian1">[102]</xref>, and in keeping with these findings PA0456 exhibited defects in quorum sensing regulated phenotypes; the PA0456 mutant had reduced pyocyanin production and swarming motility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002813-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

It is unclear whether PA14_27700 and PA14_26790 form an operon. B) Multiple <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> insertions in both PA14_27700 and PA14_27690 are attenuated in virulence. Although not initially identified in our screen, mutants in PA14_26790 have a strong virulence-attenuated phenotype like PA14_27700. ECF sigma factors, to which PA14_26790 has homology, are commonly co-transcribed with a regulatory anti-sigma factor and the ECF sigma factor and its regulatory anti-sigma factor frequently play an important role in adaptation to the external environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Potvin2">[104]</xref>. Canonical transmembrane anti-sigma factors have a small cytoplasmic regulatory/inhibitory domain linked by a transmembrane domain to a C-terminus sensory domain that resides in the periplasm. PA14_27700 has neither a signal sequence nor a transmembrane domain suggesting that it functions in the cytoplasm. However, most anti-sigma factors are poorly conserved at the sequence level and there are anti-sigma factors that sense cytoplasmic stimuli. PA14_27700 #32578, although attenuated in virulence, does not exhibit any obvious defects in pigment production or motility in our assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002813-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

B) Insertions in PA0745 exhibit a virulence-attenuated phenotype but mutants of PA0746, the only other gene in the putative operon for which <italic>MAR2xT7</italic> mutants were available, exhibited wild-type levels of virulence. C) The virulence-attenuated phenotype of an in-frame deletion mutant of PA0745 is complemented by expression of the entire operon (PA0747-PA0743) in trans. The operon was expressed under its own promoter; PA14 DNA from genome position 4851671–4848075 was cloned in Pseudomonas vector pucP19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Schweizer1">[105]</xref>. D) A defect in pyoverdine production in PA0745 mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002813-t002">Table 2</xref>) is not the cause of the PA0745 avirulent phenotype. Pyoverdine biosynthetic mutants <italic>pvdA</italic> and <italic>pvdD</italic> show minimal to no attenuation of virulence. It has been suggested that PA0745 enoyl-CoA hydratase isomerase may function in the production of cis-2-decenoic acid, a fatty acid signal responsible for inducing biofilm dispersal, due to its weak homology to RpfF which produces cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid, the diffusible soluble factor (DSF) required for virulence in <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Davies1">[106]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002813-Wang2">[107]</xref>.
