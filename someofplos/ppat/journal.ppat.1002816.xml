        <p>Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is an important human pathogen, which is cross-resistant to virtually all β-lactam antibiotics. MRSA strains are defined by the presence of <italic>mecA</italic> gene. The transcription of <italic>mecA</italic> can be regulated by a sensor-inducer (MecR1) and a repressor (MecI), involving a unique series of proteolytic steps. The induction of <italic>mecA</italic> by MecR1 has been described as very inefficient and, as such, it is believed that optimal expression of β-lactam resistance by MRSA requires a non-functional MecR1-MecI system. However, in a recent study, no correlation was found between the presence of functional MecR1-MecI and the level of β-lactam resistance in a representative collection of epidemic MRSA strains. Here, we demonstrate that the <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus consists, in fact, of an unusual three-component arrangement containing, in addition to <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic>, the up to now unrecognized <italic>mecR2</italic> gene coding for an anti-repressor. The MecR2 function is essential for the full induction of <italic>mecA</italic> expression, compensating for the inefficient induction of <italic>mecA</italic> by MecR1 and enabling optimal expression of β-lactam resistance in MRSA strains with functional <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> regulatory genes. Our data shows that MecR2 interacts directly with MecI, destabilizing its binding to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter, which results in the repressor inactivation by proteolytic cleavage, presumably mediated by native cytoplasmatic proteases. These observations point to a revision of the current model for the transcriptional control of <italic>mecA</italic> and open new avenues for the design of alternative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MRSA infections. Moreover, these findings also provide important insights into the complex evolutionary pathways of antibiotic resistance and molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in bacteria.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Methicillin-resistance <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is an important human pathogen, causing a wide range of infections. MRSA strains are resistant to virtually all β-lactam antibiotics and often are also resistant to many other classes of antibiotics, leaving physicians with few therapeutic options. MRSA is defined by the presence of the <italic>mecA</italic> gene. The induction of <italic>mecA</italic> transcription in response to β-lactams involves a unique series of proteolytic steps and some critical details of this signal transduction mechanism are still illusive. For instance, it is not fully explained why the induction of <italic>mecA</italic> by its cognate regulatory genes <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> appears to be very inefficient and it is not clear if the observed MecI repressor proteolysis is mediated directly by the activated MecR1 sensor-inducer. In this study, we demonstrate that the <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus is not a two-component system but instead it is a three-component system containing the previously unrecognized anti-repressor <italic>mecR2</italic> gene. MecR2 disturbs the binding of the repressor MecI to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter, which leads to its proteolytic inactivation independently from MecR1. Moreover, our data shows that in the presence of functional <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> genes, <italic>mecR2</italic> is essential for a robust induction of <italic>mecA</italic> transcription and, as consequence, for the optimal expression of β-lactam resistance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is a leading cause of infections in hospitals in many countries and has also become an important community- and livestock-associated pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Lowy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Otter1">[3]</xref>. Recently, a report from CDC has reassessed the burden of MRSA infections in the USA, putting the number of deaths attributable to MRSA in front of those related to HIV-AIDS, Alzheimer disease or homicide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Klevens1">[4]</xref>. MRSA are resistant to virtually all β-lactam antibiotics, one of the most clinically relevant class of antimicrobial agents. In addition, contemporary MRSA strains are frequently resistant to many other antimicrobial classes leaving clinicians with few therapeutic options.</p>
      <p>The MRSA characteristic phenotype is due to an extra penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) coded by the <italic>mecA</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Song1">[5]</xref>, which has a remarkable reduced affinity for many β-lactams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Hartman1">[6]</xref>. In addition, &gt;95% of MRSA strains have also a β-lactamase enzyme coded by <italic>blaZ</italic> that confers penicillin-resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Livermore1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Richmond1">[9]</xref>. The <italic>mecA</italic> transcription can be controlled by the divergent <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> regulatory genes, coding for a sensor-inducer and a repressor, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Hiramatsu1">[10]</xref>. This genetic organization of the <italic>mecA</italic> locus is similar to that of the β-lactamase, which contains the structural gene <italic>blaZ</italic> and the homologous <italic>blaR1-blaI</italic> regulatory genes. In fact, there is a cross-talk between both systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Ubukata1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Sharma1">[14]</xref>, and the signal-transduction mechanisms are believed to be identical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Zhang1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Archer1">[16]</xref>, involving two proteolytic steps, in contrast with the most common bacterial signal transduction mechanism that involves the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Browning1">[17]</xref>. Specifically, the currently accepted model of <italic>mecA</italic> regulation involves two main steps: (i) binding of the β-lactam antibiotic to the extracellular sensor domain of MecR1 leads to the autocatalytic cleavage of the sensor-inducer and activation of the cytoplasmatic inducer domain, which appears to be a prometalloprotease; (ii) the activated inducer domain of MecR1 either directly cleaves the promoter-bound MecI dimers or promotes the repressor cleavage, which disables the ability of the repressor protein to dimerize and bind to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter, enabling the expression of the resistance gene. MecR1 once cleaved can no longer transmit signal but, since the expression of <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> is also up-regulated, the <italic>mecA</italic> induction continues as long as the antibiotic is present in the environment.</p>
      <p>Some details of the signaling mechanism involved in the transcriptional control of <italic>mecA</italic> are still elusive. For instance, induction of <italic>mecA</italic> by MecR1 has been described as extremely slow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Ryffel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Hackbarth1">[13]</xref>, so that cells with intact <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> regulatory system appear phenotypically susceptible in spite of the presence of <italic>mecA</italic> – the so-called “pre-MRSA” phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Hiramatsu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-KuwaharaArai1">[18]</xref>. Based on these observations, it has been postulated that high-level resistance to β-lactams, characteristic of many contemporary MRSA clinical strains, implies a non-functional <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> regulatory system. In agreement with this hypothesis, several studies have described the accumulation of point mutations and/or gene deletions in the <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Archer2">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Weller1">[23]</xref>. Still, in some of these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Archer2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Kobayashi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Weller1">[23]</xref>, based on contradictory observations, the existence of alternative <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory mechanisms has also been proposed. In fact, in a recent study, we could not establish any correlation between the <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> integrity and the β-lactam resistance phenotype in a representative collection of epidemic MRSA strains and, unexpectedly, overexpression <italic>in trans</italic> of a wild-type copy of MecI had no effect on the phenotypic expression of resistance in most strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Oliveira1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we identify the missing link that explains the puzzling observations described above. We demonstrate that the <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus is in fact a three-component system that contains, besides <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> genes, the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene, which is co-transcribed with <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays show that MecR2 acts as an anti-repressor by interacting directly with MecI repressor, disturbing its binding to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter, which results in its inactivation by proteolytic cleavage. In MRSA strains with functional <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> genes, MecR2 is essential for the full induction of <italic>mecA</italic> transcription, compensating for the inefficient induction of <italic>mecA</italic> by <italic>mecR1</italic> and enabling the optimal expression of β-lactam resistance. These findings suggest a need to revise the current model for the induction of <italic>mecA</italic> expression in clinical MRSA strains and open new avenues for the design of alternative therapeutic strategies targeting the regulatory pathway of <italic>mecA</italic> expression. In addition, this unusual combination of repressor, sensor-inducer and anti-repressor, together with the unique modulation of a series of proteolytic cleavage steps underlying the signal transduction mechanism, provides important insights into the evolution of antibiotic-resistance and transcriptional control of genes in bacteria.</p>

        <title>The <italic>mecA</italic> cognate regulatory locus is a three-component system</title>
        <p>Since the MRSA phenotype is not affected by the overexpression <italic>in trans</italic> of the <italic>mecA</italic> repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Oliveira1">[24]</xref>, we hypothesized that a third regulator might be involved in the <italic>mecA</italic> transcriptional control. Taking into account that <italic>mecA</italic> gene is part of a large polymorphic exogenous DNA fragment (the so called SCC<italic>mec</italic> element), which has integrated in the chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Ito1">[25]</xref>, we reasoned that the putative additional regulator should be located within this chromosomal cassette, most likely upstream to the <italic>mecA</italic> gene; i.e. genetically linked to the <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> region. Upon analysis of prototype sequences of SCC<italic>mec</italic> types II and III, which are characterized by complete <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-IWGSCC1">[26]</xref>, we found a highly conserved region (99.9% homology) immediately downstream of <italic>mecI</italic>. This region contains the divergent small coding sequence for a phenol-soluble modulin, <italic>psm</italic>-<italic>mec</italic>, involved in <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence and colony spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Queck1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Kaito1">[28]</xref>, and a putative open-reading frame (ORF) that, due to a difference in four-tandem thymine residues, has a variable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g001">Figure 1A</xref>): 870 bp in SCC<italic>mec</italic> type II prototype strain N315 (accession no. D86934, positions 41794-40925) and 1149 bp in SCC<italic>mec</italic> type III prototype strain HU25 (accession no. AF422694, positions 4729-3861). Both variants are homologous to the repressor of the xylose operon of <italic>S. xylosus</italic>, XylR (accession no. X57599) with an amino-acid identity of 60–64%; the four-thymine deletion in strain N315 eliminates the N-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domain of XylR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Available genomic and SCC<italic>mec</italic> sequence data demonstrate that both ORF variants are disseminated in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and in other staphylococcal species containing SCC<italic>mec</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>Analysis of the upstream sequences of the putative <italic>mecR2</italic> gene revealed no obvious promoter sequences. A putative terminator region, consisting of two perfect inverted repeats of 19 base pairs, was identified downstream the stop codon of <italic>mecR2</italic>. No terminator sequences were found in the <italic>mecI-mecR2</italic> intergenic region, suggesting that the putative <italic>mecR2</italic> gene might be co-transcribed together with <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> from the <italic>mecR1</italic> promoter. This hypothesis was confirmed by transcriptional analysis of <italic>mecR2</italic> by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in prototype strains N315 and HU25. Using internal primers for the putative coding region of <italic>mecR2</italic> a positive signal was detected in both prototype strains. Moreover, using pairs of primers spanning the <italic>mecI-mecR2</italic> and <italic>mecR1</italic>-<italic>mecI</italic> regions, positive signals were detected suggesting that <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic> genes are co-transcribed from the <italic>mecR1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>We next evaluated the role of <italic>mecR2</italic> on the MRSA phenotype by constructing a series of recombinant strains using two parental strains with contrasting phenotypes.

        <p>To exclude possible artifacts due to the overexpression of genes from multi-copy plasmids, we reconstructed the <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic> regulatory locus of prototype strain N315 in the chromosome of strain COL, using an insertion-deletion strategy with a thermosensible plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s003">Figure S3</xref>). First, we inserted the wild-type sequences of <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> (strain COL::RI), which caused a decrease of oxacillin-resistance when compared to the parental strain COL, in agreement with the poor induction of <italic>mecA</italic> by MecR1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Compared to COL+<italic>mecI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g002">Figure 2</xref>), the decrease of oxacillin-resistance in COL::RI was less severe, most likely due to the presence of the inducer MecR1.

        <p>To further clarify the <italic>mecR2</italic> function, the chromosomal copy of <italic>mecR2</italic> gene from strain N315 was replaced by an antibiotic-resistance marker (N315::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic>), using a similar insertion-deletion strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Deletion of <italic>mecR2</italic> caused a sharp decrease in the phenotypic expression of oxacillin-resistance in strain N315. We then cloned the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene from strain N315 under the control of an inducible promoter (<italic>spac</italic>::<italic>mecR2</italic>) and, in the presence of the inducer (IPTG 100 µM), we succeeded in complementing the <italic>mecR2</italic> null-mutant in strain N315 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and restored the COL phenotype of recombinant strain COL::RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

        <p>Of note, in parental strain N315, <italic>mecR2</italic> transcription levels appear to be residual when compared to those of <italic>mecA</italic> (10<sup>9</sup> fold less). Although this might be explained by an experimental artifact, one can also speculate that this may be due to different promoter strengths and/or to promoter blockage by RNA polymerase, since <italic>mecA</italic> and <italic>mecR1</italic> promoters are divergent and overlap partially. In terms of signal-transduction mechanism, once the expression of <italic>mecA</italic> is induced in response to β-lactams, there is no need for high cellular levels of inducer, repressor or anti-repressor. Actually, the basal transcription of <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic> is only necessary to assure that the repressor protein is still present when the antibiotic induction stops, so that the transcription of the resistance gene is shutdown. The apparent very low transcription level of <italic>mecR2</italic> in parental strain N315 may also explain the lack of complementation when <italic>mecR2</italic> was over-expressed <italic>in trans</italic>. In fact, this artificial system, when compared to wild-type strains, presumably generates extremely high cellular amounts of MecR2, which may originate a loss of function by oligomerization or non-specific interactions with other cellular targets. Finally, the apparent residual <italic>mecR2</italic> transcription levels may also explain our failed attempts to analyze by Northern blotting the transcription of <italic>mecR2</italic> in prototype MRSA strains, even with large amounts of total RNA (10–30 µg) and long autoradiograph expositions (72 h). To our knowledge, Northern blotting analysis of <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic>/<italic>blaR1-blaI</italic> transcripts was described in only two studies and, in both cases, clear signals were obtained only when regulatory genes were overexpressed from recombinant plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Niemeyer1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Clarke1">[34]</xref>.</p>

For instance, in a BLAST analysis against the <italic>mecI</italic> sequence from strain N315, c.a. 20 entries were found with 100% sequence identity, mostly from <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains but also from a few coagulase-negative staphylococci (<italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, <italic>S. saprophyticus, S. fleurettii, S. cohinii</italic>, etc.).

        <title><italic>mecR2</italic> function is not dependent on <italic>mecR1</italic> neither on the β-lactamase locus</title>
        <p>Since strains N315, USA100, USA200, and USA60 have complete <italic>mecR1</italic> genes and strain COL has a truncated <italic>mecR1</italic> gene but with a complete N-terminal inducer domain, with the previous experiments we could not formally exclude that MecR2 function is dependent of at least the N-terminal inducer domain of MecR1. Therefore, we sought to test the effect of <italic>mecR2</italic> in a prototype SCC<italic>mec</italic> type V MRSA strain, characterized by an extensive deletion of <italic>mecR1</italic> spanning both N- and C-terminal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Ito2">[40]</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g001">Figure 1A</xref>.

Similar to what was observed for strain COL, overexpression of MecI in strain HT0350 (HT0350+<italic>mecI</italic>) caused a sharp decrease of resistance level, which was fully reverted with the co-overexpression of MecI and MecR2 (HT0350+<italic>mecI-mecR2</italic>) – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g008">Figure 8A</xref>.

        <p>Since <italic>mecA</italic> transcription can be co-regulated by the regulators of the β-lactamase (<italic>bla</italic>) locus, <italic>blaR1-blaI</italic>, and parental strains N315, USA100, USA200 and USA600 are <italic>bla</italic> positive, we sought to evaluate the effect of <italic>bla</italic> genes on the observed <italic>mecR2</italic>-induced phenotypes. For this purpose, we took advantage of the fact that the experimental strategy used to construct the <italic>mecR2</italic> knockout in prototype strain N315 generated an intermediate mutant strain which lost the β-lactamase plasmid, probably due to the multiple passages, many of which at 45°C. As in all other chromosomal manipulations, the <italic>mecR2</italic> genetic deletion was transduced back to the parental β-lactamase positive strain N315 to generate the final deletion mutant (N315::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic>) tested in all previous experiments. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, in both variants of the <italic>mecR2</italic> chromosomal deletion, there was a sharp decrease of the β-lactam resistance. Together with the experimental data for strains COL and HT0350, both <italic>bla</italic> negative, this assay indicated that the <italic>mecR2</italic> function on the phenotypic expression of β-lactam resistance is not dependent on the presence of the β-lactamase plasmid.</p>
        <p>In addition, in order to exclude an interaction of MecR2 with <italic>bla</italic> regulators, we sought to evaluate the phenotype of a <italic>mecR2</italic> deletion mutant in prototype strain HU25, a highly resistant MRSA strain which is positive for the <italic>bla</italic> locus and has a truncated non-functional MecI protein due to a premature stop codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Oliveira1">[24]</xref>.

        <title>MecR2 interacts directly with MecI</title>
        <p>The MecR2 is homologous to the transcriptional repressor of the xylose operon, XylR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Sizemore1">[42]</xref>, which has a N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The <italic>mecR2</italic> gene in the prototype strain N315 has no DNA binding domain due to a deletion of four tandem-thymine residues, which, together with the genetic experiments done with this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g008">8</xref>), suggests that only the dimerization domain is involved in the MRSA phenotype. Therefore, we reasoned that the mode of action of MecR2 might involve a direct interaction with the MecI dimer, through its dimerization domain, which eventually would interfere with its binding to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the MecR2-MecI interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid <italic>in vivo</italic> strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Karimova1">[43]</xref>.

No MecR2::MecR2 interaction was detected in the four combinations tested (data not shown) and, as such, the assay was not conclusive in this case.

            <p>(A) <italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of the MecR2::MecI interaction using the bacterial two-hybrid strategy. This strategy is based on the restoration of the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) activity of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which activates a specific reporter gene, <italic>lacZ</italic>. Interactions between protein fusions were evaluated in liquid cultures through the hydrolysis of the chromogenic X-gal substrate by the activated β-galoctasidase. The MecR2::MecI interaction was evaluated using the eight possible combinations: fusions either with T25 or T18 fragments of CyaA at either the N′ or C′ terminals. Tube 1, T18-MecR2::MecI-T25; tube 2, T18-MecR2::T25-MecI; tube 3, MecR2-T18::MecI-T25; tube 4, MecR2-T18::T25-MecI; tube 5, MecR2-T25::T18-MecI; tube 6, T25-MecR2::T18-MecI; tube 7, MecR2-T25::MecI-T18; tube 8, T25-MecR2::MecI-T18; tube 9, positive control provided by the manufacturer (Zip-T25::Zip-T18); tube 10, negative control (T25::T18); tube 11, “in-house” positive control testing the MecI-MecI interaction T18-MecI::T25-MecI.

        <title>MecR2 interferes with the binding of MecI to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter</title>
        <p>Next, we evaluated the interference of purified MecR2 protein with the binding of MecI to the promoter of <italic>mecA</italic> (P<italic>mecA</italic>) at several molar ratios by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), a strategy previously used to study the binding of purified MecI protein to P<italic>mecA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Sharma1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Oliveira1">[24]</xref>. In these experiments, we expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> the full MecR2 protein from prototype strain HU25, since the shorter variant of strain N315 could not be expressed and purified in a soluble form at high concentrations. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, MecR2 interferes with the binding of MecI to P<italic>mecA</italic> in a concentration-dependent manner: the heavier band presumably reflecting the binding of MecI dimers to P<italic>mecA</italic> decreases in intensity, whereas the intermediate band reflecting the binding of MecI monomers to P<italic>mecA</italic> and the lighter free DNA band increase in intensity. In line with the genetic experiments, this effect was optimal for a MecR2::MecI molecular ratio below one; in the presence of excess MecR2 the binding of MecI to P<italic>mecA</italic> was restored. This <italic>in vitro</italic> loss of effect at higher concentrations of MecR2 suggests that under these conditions MecR2 may be trapped in a non-active conformation; e.g. MecR2 may oligomerize in a concentration-dependent manner and stop interacting with MecI. It should be noted that in wild-type strains, <italic>mecI</italic> and <italic>mecR2</italic> are co-transcribed from the <italic>mecR1</italic> promoter and, as such, the cellular amounts of both proteins are likely to be similar. Since in these experiments we used the full MecR2 variant containing a putative N-terminal DNA binding, control EMSA experiments with MecR2 alone were performed to verify that purified MecR2 did not bind to P<italic>mecA</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). In addition, control experiments with mixtures of MecI and MBP (maltose-binding protein, which has an identical molecular weight to MecR2) were performed to demonstrate that inhibition of MecI binding to P<italic>mecA</italic> is specific for MecR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Finally, in order to exclude the hypothesis that at higher concentrations MecR2 binds (not specifically) to secondary sites in P<italic>mecA</italic> DNA in a MecI-dependent manner, EMSA assays with MecI-MecR2 mixtures were also performed with a much smaller DNA fragment (39 bp instead of 212 bp) containing the MecI protected sequences and the same results were obtained (data not shown). Altogether, these assays demonstrate that MecR2 acts as an anti-repressor disturbing the binding of MecI to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter.</p>

        <title>MecR2 promotes the proteolytic cleavage of MecI</title>
        <p>Based on structural data, it has been suggested that the proteolysis of MecI observed during <italic>mecA</italic> induction is not mediated by the activated MecR1 inducer domain and instead, is a secondary event not required for induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-GarcaCastellanos1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Fuda1">[47]</xref>. This is in agreement with what has been found for the β-lactamase system of <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Filee1">[48]</xref>. We speculated that MecR2, by interacting with MecI and disturbing its binding to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter, could foster a local melting of MecI-dimers, making the scissile bonds more accessible to proteolytic inactivation. To test this hypothesis, we compared by Western blotting the MecI proteolysis in total protein extracts from prototype strain N315 <italic>versus</italic> its <italic>mecR2</italic> null-mutant under induction conditions, and from strain HT0350 overexpressing MecI-MecR2 <italic>versus</italic> HT0350 overexpressing MecI only. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g009">Figure 9C</xref>, in the absence of MecR2, intact MecI accumulates in both pairs of strains analyzed. Because parental strain HT0350 is negative for all <italic>mecA</italic> regulators and its derivatives used in these experiments overexpress constitutively MecI-MecR2 or MecI, the observed MecR2-induced proteolysis of MecI does not involve MecR1 (neither BlaR1) and, most likely, is mediated by unspecific cytoplasmatic proteases.</p>

        <title>MecR2, the missing link in the signal-transduction mechanism of <italic>mecA</italic> expression</title>
        <p>The findings described in this report clarify some critical aspects of the unique signal transduction mechanism underlying the induction of <italic>mecA</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>First, we demonstrated that the cognate <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus contains, besides MecR1-MecI, the anti-repressor MecR2. MecR2 compensates for the inefficient MecR1-mediated induction of <italic>mecA</italic>, being essential for the optimal expression of β-lactam resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g007">7A</xref>), and enabling the full induction of <italic>mecA</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g007">7B</xref>). These findings explain the puzzling observation of the poor <italic>mecA</italic> induction by MecR1, reported in studies analysing the effects of <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> only (without <italic>mecR2</italic>) on <italic>mecA</italic> expression in recombinant strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Ryffel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Hackbarth1">[13]</xref>; an experimental artefact also observed in this study with recombinant strain COL::RI (artificially made positive for <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> only) and in the <italic>mecR2</italic> null mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g007">7</xref>). Because wild-type MRSA strains positive for <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> are also positive for <italic>mecR2</italic>, these strains are in fact able to express optimal levels of β-lactam resistance and, as such, <italic>mecA</italic> is efficiently induced upon exposure to β-lactams by its cognate three-component regulatory system.</p>
        <p>Second, the findings herein described also clarify the relevance and specificity of MecI proteolysis observed upon induction with β-lactams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Archer1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-GarcaCastellanos1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Filee1">[48]</xref>. Our data demonstrates that MecI proteolysis is required for optimal expression of resistance and that MecR2 alone (i.e. without MecR1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) interferes specifically with the MecI function and promotes its inactivation by proteolytic cleavage, presumably mediated by (non-specific) native cytoplasmatic proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Our findings contrast with published observations for the <italic>blaR1-blaI</italic> system of <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic>, demonstrating that the proteolysis of the repressor is a secondary event not required for induction of resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Filee1">[48]</xref>, and also for the <italic>blaR1-blaI</italic> system of <italic>S. aureus</italic> demonstrating that BlaR1 directly promotes the BlaI cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Zhang1">[15]</xref>. Altogether, these observations suggest the existence of subtle differences between the <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic> and the <italic>blaR1-blaI</italic> regulatory systems and that, in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, BlaR1 may accumulate the MecR1 and MecR2 functions.</p>
        <p>Our findings lead us to propose a revised model for the induction of <italic>mecA</italic> expression in wild-type MRSA strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g010">Figure 10</xref>): (i) in the presence of β-lactams, MecR1 is activated and induces the transcription of <italic>mecA</italic> and <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic>; (ii) the anti-repressor MecR2, destabilizes MecI-dimers, disturbing their binding to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter and fostering their proteolytic inactivation, resulting in a sustained induction of <italic>mecA</italic> transcription; (iii) when depletion of β-lactam occurs, MecR1 is no longer activated and a steady state is established consisting of stable MecI-dimers bound to the <italic>mecA</italic> promoter (and protected from proteolysis) and residual copies of MecR1 at the cell membrane; the remaining free MecR2 molecules are most likely degraded by the cellular protein turnover pathway. This model implies that in the absence of MecR2, functional MecI-dimers are more resilient to proteolytic inactivation and outcompete the MecR1 signalling, a hypothesis supported by the Western blotting experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002816-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Concluding remarks</title>
        <p>This study demonstrates that the central element of methicillin-resistance in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the <italic>mecA</italic> gene, can be regulated by a three-component system consisting of a transcriptional repressor, a sensor-inducer and an anti-repressor, a very unusual arrangement for the transcriptional control of genes in bacteria. In addition, the induction of the resistance gene expression involves a unique series of proteolytic steps, being the proteolytic cleavage of the repressor modulated by the anti-repressor.</p>
        <p>This study also sheds light on the evolution of antibiotic-resistance genes. The <italic>mecA</italic> gene itself is probably ancient and predates the use of antibiotics in clinical practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-DCosta1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Couto1">[50]</xref>. Before its recent acquisition by MRSA, <italic>mecA</italic> was assembled into a gene complex containing its transcriptional regulators and incorporated into a mobile genetic element. Tsubakishita <italic>et al.</italic> have proposed that the <italic>mecA</italic> gene complex found in MRSA has been assembled in the animal-related <italic>Staphylococcus fleurettii</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Tsubakishita1">[51]</xref>. Remarkably, in this species the <italic>mecA-mecR1-mecI</italic> locus was found immediately upstream to the complete and functional xylose operon, containing the XylR repressor homologous to MecR2. This suggests that a specific selection acted on XylR, a transcriptional repressor of sugar metabolism, to originate the MecR2 function, an anti-repressor of an antibiotic-resistance gene, and that the three-component <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus was assembled in <italic>S. fleuretti</italic> before being transferred to <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>
        <p>In short, this study points to a revision of the model for the transcriptional control of <italic>mecA</italic> by its cognate regulatory locus, which may pave the way for the design of alternative therapeutic strategies targeting the induction mechanism of the resistance gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Meng1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Woodford1">[53]</xref>. If successful, these strategies may extend the clinical utility of β-lactams for the treatment of MRSA infections. Recycling β-lactams is particularly relevant given that MRSA pose a substantial burden for the public health, are often multi-drug resistant and, in the past 40 years, very few new classes of antibiotics have reached the clinic.</p>

        <title>Construction of recombinant <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains</title>
        <p>All recombinant plasmids used in this work were firstly constructed and stabilized in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α, electroporated into <italic>S. aureus</italic> restriction-deficient strain RN4220 and finally transduced by the 80α phage to the desired parental strain, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Kraemer1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Oshida1">[59]</xref>. The Integrity of plasmid inserts was confirmed by restriction analysis, PCR and DNA sequencing. The integrity of chromosomal insertion-deletions was confirmed by PCR, DNA sequencing and Southern blotting of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal insertion-deletions were backcrossed by phage transduction to the original parental strains.</p>
        <p>To co-overexpress <italic>mecI</italic> and <italic>mecR2</italic> in strain COL, a fragment containing the <italic>mecI-mecR2</italic> region from strain N315 was amplified using primers MI-P1/MR2-P1, double-digested with EcoR1/BamH1 and cloned into pGC2, originating the recombinant plasmid pGC::<italic>mecI-mecR2</italic>. To reconstruct the <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus in the chromosome of strain COL, we first construct pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>, a pSPT181 derivative containing the terminal fragment from IS<italic>1272</italic> located in the upstream vicinity of <italic>mecA</italic> in strain COL and the erythromycin (<italic>erm</italic>) resistance cassette gene from Tn<italic>551</italic>. The 0.6 kb terminal fragment of IS<italic>1272</italic> was amplified from strain COL using primers IS1272-P1/IS1272-P2, double-digested with PstI/SalI and cloned into pSPT181, originating pSPT::IS. The <italic>erm</italic> cassette was recovered from the pSP64E plasmid by BamHI/SalI double-digestion and was cloned into pSPT::IS, originating pSPT::IS::<italic>erm</italic>. To reconstruct the <italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> locus in strain COL (strain COL::RI), we amplified by high-fidelity PCR a 1.9 kb DNA fragment from strain N315 chromossomal DNA, containing the wild-type coding sequences of <italic>mecR1</italic> and <italic>mecI</italic> genes, using primers MI-P2/MR1-P1. The fragment was double-digested with BamH1/AvaI and directionally cloned into pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>, originating pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>-<italic>mecI-mecR1</italic>. To reconstruct the full <italic>mecA</italic> regulatory locus in strain COL (strain COL::RI-R2), we amplified by high-fidelity PCR a 3.5 kb DNA fragment from strain N315 chromossomal DNA, containing the <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic> locus, using primers MR2-P1/MR1-P1. The fragment was double-digested with BamH1/AvaI and directionally cloned into pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>, originating pSPT::IS-<italic>erm-mecR2-mecI-mecR1</italic>. As control, we constructed a strain with a integrated <italic>erm</italic> gene in the <italic>mecA</italic> upstream vicinity (strain COL::<italic>erm</italic>): a 0.5 kb DNA fragment containing the terminal fragment of the N-terminal cytoplasmatic domain of <italic>mecR1</italic>, was amplified using primers MR1-P1/MR1-P2, double-digested with BamH1/AvaI and cloned in pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>, originating pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>-Δ<italic>mecR1</italic>. The integration into COL chromosome of the three recombinant plasmids (pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>-<italic>mecI-mecR1</italic>, pSPT::IS-<italic>erm</italic>-<italic>mecR2-mecI-mecR1</italic> and pST::IS<italic>-erm</italic>-Δ<italic>mecR1</italic>) was performed by an insertion-deletion strategy by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s003">Figure S3</xref>). First, insertion into the chromosome was promoted by growing transductants in TSB at a non-permissive temperature (45°C) without antibiotic selection for 2–3 days, with daily re-inoculum in fresh medium. Serial dilutions were plated onto TSA plates supplemented with erythromycin (Ery) and tetracycline (Tc). Single-colonies Erm<sup>r</sup>-Tc<sup>r</sup> were screened for chromosomal insertion of the plasmids by PCR and the absence of plasmid DNA was confirmed. Resolution of integrates by homologous-recombination was promoted by growing selected single colonies in TSB supplemented with tetracycline at 40 µg/mL at the permissive temperature of 30°C for 4–5 days, with daily re-inoculum in fresh medium. Finally segregation of the excised plasmids was promoted by growing cultures at 45°C without antibiotic selection for 2–3 days, with daily re-inoculum in fresh medium. Culture aliquots were plated onto TSA plates supplemented with erythromycin and single colonies Erm<sup>r</sup>-Tc<sup>s</sup> were selected by replica plating onto TSA plates supplemented with erythromycin or tetracycline.</p>
        <p>To construct the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene null mutant in strain N315, two DNA fragments of 1000 bp corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ vicinities of the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene were amplified by PCR from strain N315 DNA using primers MR2-P2/MR2-P3 and MR2-P4/MR2-P5, respectively. The <italic>cat</italic> gene coding for chloramphenicol resistance was also amplified by PCR from pGC2 plasmid with primers CAT-P1/CAT-P2. The three fragments were double-digested with SalI/PstI, BamH1/XhoI and XhoI/SalI, respectively, and then sequentially cloned into pSPT181, originating the pSPT::<italic>cat</italic>-Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> recombinant plasmid. Following the same insertion-deletion strategy described above, but selecting for chloramphenicol resistance instead of erythromycin resistance, we obtained the recombinant strain N315::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> in which the chromosomal copy of <italic>mecR2</italic> was replaced by the <italic>cat</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002816.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To complement the N315Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> null-mutant three recombinant plasmids were constructed: (i) pSPT::<italic>mecR2</italic>, pSPT181 vector containing at the XmaI site the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene from strain N315, obtained by PCR with primers MR2-P6/MR2-P7 (the proper insert orientation was selected by restriction analysis using the HindIII site within <italic>mecR2</italic> gene); (ii) pSPT::<italic>mecImecR2</italic>, pSPT181 containing the <italic>mecI-mecR2</italic> genes of strain N315, constructed by sequential cloning, first, at the BamH1/PstI, the <italic>mecI</italic> gene site obtained with primers MI-P3/MI-P4 and then, at the XmaI site, the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene obtained with primers MR2-P6/MR2-P7; (iii) pSPT::<italic>spac</italic>-<italic>mecR2</italic>, pSPT181 with the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene under the control of <italic>Pspac</italic> promoter, constructed by sequential cloning the 1.6 kb EcoR1-BamH1 fragment from plasmid pDH88 containing the <italic>spac</italic> locus (P<italic>spac</italic>-polylinker-<italic>lacI</italic> repressor) and then, at the XmaI site of the <italic>spac</italic> polylinker, the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene from strain N315 obtained with primers MR2-P6/MR2-P7. As control, N315Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> was transformed with a pST181 derivative containing the <italic>spac</italic> locus only (pSPT::<italic>spac</italic>).</p>
        <p>To generate the <italic>mecR2</italic> gene null mutant in prototype strains USA100, USA200, USA600, and HU25 the chromosomal deletion of strain N315::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> was transduced by bacteriophage infection with selection for chloramphenicol resistance, originating recombinant strains USA100::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic>, USA200::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic>, USA600::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> and HU25::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic>. Mutant strains USA100::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic>, USA200::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> and USA600::Δ<italic>mecR2</italic> were then complemented with recombinant plasmid pSPT::<italic>spac</italic>-<italic>mecR2</italic>.</p>

        <title>Transcription analysis</title>
        <p>Total RNA extraction and purification was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Sobral1">[60]</xref>. Briefly overnight cultures were grown in TSB, supplemented with antibiotics when appropriate, and then diluted 1∶50 in fresh TSB and grown to the mid-log phase (OD<sub>620</sub>∼0.7). Cultures were stabilized with two volumes of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were centrifuged and pellets were ressuspended in 1 mL of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The ressuspended cells were transferred to a new tube with silica beads (Lysing Matrix B tubes, Bio101) and cell lysis was performed in the FastPrep FP120 apparatus (Bio 101). RNA was extracted with chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, washed twice with ethanol at 80% and ressuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. For the analysis of the <italic>mecA</italic> and <italic>mecR2</italic> induction profiles, after cultures were grown to OD<sub>620</sub>∼0.7, oxacillin at 0.05 µg/mL was added and cultures were incubated for an additional 60 minutes. Samples were taken either at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 or at 0, 10 and 60 minutes, stabilized, pelleted and kept on ice until being simultaneously processed. For RT-PCR and qReal-time RT-PCR experiments (see below), total RNA preps were treated twice with DNAse (RNase-Free DNase Set I, Qiagen) and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacture's recommendations. Control PCR reactions were performed to test the absence of DNA contamination in total RNA preps.</p>
        <p>Transcription analysis of <italic>mecR1-mecI-mecR2</italic> was performed by RT-PCR for mid-log phase induced cultures (oxacillin at 0.05 µg/mL) of strains N315 and HU25 with primer pairs MR2-RT1/MR2-RT2 (<italic>mecR2</italic> transcript), MI-P5/MR2-P8 (<italic>mecI-mecR2</italic> co-transcript), MR1-P3/MI-P6 (<italic>mecR1-mecI</italic> co-transcript), and MA-P1/MA-P2 (<italic>mecA</italic> transcript, inducible positive control). RT-PCR reactions were set-up using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacture's recommendations. To control the absence of DNA contamination, all samples were tested in a parallel reaction without the reverse-transcription step. To control the size of the amplified transcripts, PCR reactions with chromosomal DNA were also performed in parallel. The <italic>mecA</italic> transcript was detected in both induced and non-induced samples suggesting that the RT-PCR assay was too sensitive to discriminate between basal and induced transcription levels.</p>
        <p>The induction profiles of <italic>mecA</italic> and <italic>mecR2</italic> were determined by quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and/or Northern blotting. For the qRT-PCR data analysis, relative gene expression was expressed as a ratio to the transcript of <italic>pta</italic>, a housekeeping gene with constitutive expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002816-Enright2">[61]</xref>. Standard curves were generated using serial dilutions (0.4–40 ng/reaction) of genomic DNA and primers MR2-RT3/MR2-RT4, MA-RT1/MA-RT2 and pta-RT1/pta-RT2 for amplification internal fragments of <italic>mecR2</italic>, <italic>mecA</italic>, and <italic>pta</italic>, respectively. qRT-PCR reactions were performed with QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen); each 25 µl reaction containing 12.5 µl SybrGreen mix, 0.25 µl RT enzyme mix, 12.5 pmol of each primer and 40 ng of purified RNA. Amplification consisted of an initial RT step at 50°C for 30 min, followed by a denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min, then by 45 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 53°C and 30 s at 72°C. For each RNA sample three independent qReal-Time RT-PCR experiments were carried out. Fluorescence was measured at the end of the annealing-extension phase of each cycle. A threshold value for the fluorescence of all samples was set manually. The reaction cycle at which the PCR product exceeds this fluorescence threshold was identified as the threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>). The C<sub>T</sub> was then converted to relative quantity of mRNA by using a standard curve. To verify the specificity of the PCR amplification products, melting curve analysis was performed between 60–95°C.</p>
        <p>For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (5 µg) was resolved through a 1.2% agarose-0.66 M formaldehyde gel in MOPS (morpholine propanesulfonic acid) running buffer (Sigma). Blotting of RNA onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham) was performed with Turboblotter alkaline transfer systems (Schleicher &amp; Schuell). For detection of <italic>mecA</italic> specific transcripts, a DNA probe was constructed by PCR amplification with primers MA-P1 and MA-P2. After purification the probe was labeled with a Ready To Go labeling kit (Amersham) by using [a-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (Amersham) and was hybridized under high-stringency conditions. The blots were subsequently washed and autoradiographed.</p>
