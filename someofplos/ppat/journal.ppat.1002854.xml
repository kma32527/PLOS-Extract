        <p>The opportunistic human pathogen, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, is a major cause of infections in chronic wounds, burns and the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome encodes at least three proteins exhibiting the characteristic three domain structure of autotransporters, but much remains to be understood about the functions of these three proteins and their role in pathogenicity. Autotransporters are the largest family of secreted proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, and those characterised are virulence factors. Here, we demonstrate that the PA0328 autotransporter is a cell-surface tethered, arginine-specific aminopeptidase, and have defined its active site by site directed mutagenesis. Hence, we have assigned PA0328 with the name AaaA, for <underline>a</underline>rginine-specific <underline>a</underline>utotransporter of <italic>P. <underline>a</underline>eruginosa</italic>. We show that AaaA provides a fitness advantage in environments where the sole source of nitrogen is peptides with an aminoterminal arginine, and that this could be important for establishing an infection, as the lack of AaaA led to attenuation in a mouse chronic wound infection which correlated with lower levels of the cytokines TNFα, IL-1α, KC and COX-2. Consequently AaaA is an important virulence factor playing a significant role in the successful establishment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>We present a new <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> virulence factor that promotes chronic skin wound infections. We propose the name AaaA for this cell-surface tethered autotransporter. This arginine-specific aminopeptidase confers a growth advantage upon <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, providing a fitness advantage by creating a supply of arginine in chronic wounds where oxygen availability is limited and biofilm formation is involved. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanistic evidence linking the upregulation of genes involved in arginine metabolism with pathogenicity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and we propose potential underlying mechanisms. The superbug <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is the leading cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis patients. The ineffective host immune response to bacterial colonization is likely to play a critical role in the demise of these patients, making the possibility that AaaA could interface with the innate immune system, influencing the activity of iNOS and consequently the host's defence against invading pathogens. The surface localisation of AaaA makes it accessible to inhibitors that could reduce growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during colonisation and alter biofilm formation, potentially improving the efficacy of current antimicrobials. Indeed, structurally related aminopeptidases play a central role in several disease states (stroke, diabetes, cancer, HIV and neuropsychiatric disorders), and inhibitors alleviate symptoms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an important human pathogen causing a myriad of infections including those of burns, trauma wounds and the eyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Kerr1">[1]</xref>. This Gram-negative bacterium is perhaps best known for being the leading cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with 80% of adult CF patients carrying <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in their lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-George1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Doring1">[3]</xref>, and has recently gained notoriety by being classified as a ‘superbug’ by the media. The latter emanates from the intrinsic resistance that this opportunistic pathogen has against antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-ElSolh1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Lister1">[5]</xref>, and its prominence as a cause of nosocomial infections (there are an estimated 10,000 cases each year in UK hospitals) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Lister1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Pitt1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The success of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as a pathogen is attributed to the immense battery of virulence determinants that it possesses. These virulence factors include toxins, proteases, lipases, and rhamnolipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Hardie1">[9]</xref>, which are regulated by a complex hierarchy of regulators that include cell-to-cell communication networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Williams1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Heeb1">[12]</xref>. One of the least-studied families of virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is the autotransporters (ATs). ATs are characterized by a tripartite structure encompassing (i) an <italic>N</italic>-terminal signal peptide that enables translocation across the inner membrane, (ii) a <italic>C</italic>-terminal domain that forms a β-barrel in the outer membrane, and (iii) a central passenger domain that bears the functional domain of the AT. ATs have diverse functions, but all of those characterized to date in pathogens contribute to the virulence of their producing bacterium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Henderson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Dautin1">[14]</xref>. The functions of ATs include agglutination (e.g. Ag43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-vanderWoude1">[15]</xref>), vacuolating toxins (e.g. VacA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Sewald1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Atherton1">[17]</xref>) and serine proteases. The serine protease ATs of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> are termed SPATES, and their functions as we understand them have been comprehensively reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Henderson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Yen1">[18]</xref>. SPATES tend to be the most abundant proteins secreted during <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of pathogenic <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and usually exhibit multifunctional virulence-related activities. Other ATs with proteolytic activities include NalP, which processes other ATs and is responsible for the release of the lactoferrin-binding protein B (LpbB) from the surface of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-RousselJazede1">[19]</xref>. Additional ATs involved in surface maturation of proteins include SphB1 of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Coutte1">[20]</xref> and AasP of <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Ali1">[21]</xref>. Some ATs use their proteolytic activities to direct their own release via autoproteolysis from the surface of the bacteria that produces them, e.g. IgA protease of <italic>Neisseria gonnorhoeae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Pohlner1">[22]</xref>, and Hap from <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Kenjale1">[23]</xref>. In some cases, although the proteolytic AT clearly augments virulence and influences interactions with host cells, its precise role is uncertain, e.g. PfaI from <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Hu1">[24]</xref>. There are also examples where ATs combine proteolysis with other functions to ameliorate pathogenicity, e.g. the <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> toxic agglutinin Pta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Alamuri1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Whilst ATs appear to have the simplest mechanism of secretion found in Gram-negative bacteria and constitute a subgroup of the type V secretion system, the mechanistic details of AT secretion are currently controversial and need further study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Leyton1">[26]</xref>. Originally it was proposed that the β-barrel acted as the outer membrane conduit to secrete the passenger domain to the bacterial surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Pohlner1">[22]</xref>. More recently it has become evident that additional proteins may be involved in this process, most notably the recently discovered Bam complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Knowles1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Jain1">[30]</xref>, but the mechanistic steps are hotly debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Dautin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Yen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Leyton1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Sauri1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Walther1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-vandenBerg1">[33]</xref>. Once at the bacterial cell surface, some ATs, such as IgA protease from <italic>Neisseria gonorrohoeae</italic>, release their passenger domains into the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Pohlner1">[22]</xref>, whilst others like the Ag43 produced by enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic> maintain the functional passenger domain on their cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-vanderWoude1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The genome of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encodes a number of proteins with a type V mode of secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Hardie1">[9]</xref>, including a recently described member of a novel subgroup (type Vd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Salacha1">[34]</xref>). However, it only harbours three genes encoding proteins predicted to have the characteristic AT β-barrel domain. One of these, the esterase EstA, functions to alter the levels of extracellular rhamnolipids, modulates twitching, swimming and swarming motility and influences the formation and architecture of biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Tielen1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Wilhelm1">[36]</xref>. The isolation of an attenuated mutant indicates that EstA contributes to the virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, although the underlying mechanisms require further investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Potvin1">[37]</xref>. The two other ATs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are not as well studied. While PA3535 is a putative serine protease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Ma1">[38]</xref>, there is currently no published experimental evidence to confirm this. Similarly, little is known of the function of PA0328, although it is annotated as an aminopeptidase. The MEROPS database of peptidases predicts PA0328 to be a member of the M28 family of peptidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Rawlings1">[39]</xref>. The M28 family encompasses both amino and carboxy specific peptidases which tetrahedrally coordinate two zinc ligands using residues including histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid to create their catalytic pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-FundoianoHershcovitz1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Gilboa1">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the characterisation of PA0328. Since we demonstrate that PA0328 is an AT that specifically removes aminoterminal arginine from peptides, we propose to name it the <underline>A</underline>rginine-specific <underline>A</underline>minopeptidase of <italic>P. <underline>a</underline>eruginosa</italic>: AaaA. In addition to characterizing the surface localization of AaaA, and its ability to confer a growth fitness advantage, we describe the influence that AaaA has on the pathogenicity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and put forward potential mechanistic models for this role.</p>

        <title>AaaA is an AT that is not released from the bacterial cell surface</title>
        <p>To verify that the predicted AT domain located in the <italic>C</italic>-terminal of AaaA functions to direct it to the outer membrane (OM), and to determine whether there is subsequent proteolytic release of the passenger domain, the cellular localisation of AaaA was first analysed. To do this, <italic>aaaA</italic> was inserted adjacent to an IPTG inducible promoter with a C-terminal His-tag resulting in the plasmid pDEST42::<italic>aaaA</italic>. The protein production profiles observed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the α-His antibody of this clone expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α revealed a protein associated with the bacterial cells with a predicted mass of approximately 85 kDa which is larger than 70.4 kDa predicted from the sequence of the encoding gene. Peptide mass fingerprinting confirmed that this protein was indeed AaaA, lacking its <italic>N</italic>-terminal signal peptide (not shown). Subcloning into pET21a was undertaken as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref> to enable overexpression of <italic>aaaA</italic> from a T7 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 2). The resultant protein was purified, verified by peptide mass spectroscopy, and used to generate specific polyclonal antisera to aid AaaA detection.</p>

            <p><italic>E. coli</italic> LEMO21 bearing the empty vector pET21a or pET21a::<italic>aaaA</italic> was grown to mid exponential phase in LB, and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h. Following harvesting, washing and resuspension in PBS-Hepes, half of the cells were lysed by sonication. The whole and lysed cells were split into three aliquots and incubated with (T) or without (−) trypsin according to the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Trypsin inhibitor was added at the same time as trypsin to one of the aliquots (T+I). Proteins were separated through a 9% SDS PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Panel A) or subjected to immunoblotting with either α-AaaA (Panel B, top), or α-IscS (Panel B, bottom) antisera. A parallel experiment was performed with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> bearing either pME6032 or pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>. LB overnight cultures were diluted 1∶100 in fresh LB, grown for 3 h at 37°C, and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h. The immunoblot of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> proteins is shown in Panel C, with the cytoplasmic control protein being detected with α-RpoS in the bottom panel. The sizes of molecular weight markers are shown in kDa on the left, and the position of AaaA is indicated. In Panels B and C, densitometry was used to estimate the quantity of the cytoplasmic protein and the full length AaaA (indicated with the asterisk) detected in the immunoblots using imageJ software. The fold change of AaaA, IscS and RpoS are shown below the images of the respective immunoblots. The images in Panels D and E were captured by confocal fluorescent microscopy. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Δ<italic>aaaA</italic>(pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>) was grown and induced as described for Panel C, probed with FM1-43 and either α-AaaA (Panel E) or pre-immune serum (Panel D). Incubation with donkey α-rabbit alexa fluor 680-conjugated secondary antibody (red) was performed before images were captured at either the apex or cross section of individual cells (as indicated in the dotted lines of the cartoon). Green fluorescence from FM1-43 (top Panel, green circle in cartoon), red fluorescence from alexa fluor 680 (middle Panel, red stars in cartoon), merged 2D and merged 3D shadowed images are shown.</p>

        <p>To establish whether AaaA was exposed on the cell surface, the AaaA-specific polyclonal antiserum was used to detect whether exogenously introduced trypsin could degrade AaaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To enable detection in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as well as <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>aaaA</italic> was cloned into the shuttle vector pME6032 (creating pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>), introduced into the <italic>P. aeruginosa aaaA</italic>-deficient mutant (Δ<italic>aaaA</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002854.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and induced with IPTG. The low copy number of pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α led to AaaA levels too low to be detected easily by immunoblot. Therefore, AaaA was overproduced from pET21a::<italic>aaaA</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> LEMO2, a strain reported to tolerate higher levels of membrane proteins. The cultures were split into aliquots. These aliquots were treated with trypsin with or without a protease inhibitor, followed by immunoblotting with α-His (not shown) or α-AaaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As controls, cytoplasmic RpoS (for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) or IscS (for <italic>E. coli</italic>) were detected similarly, and found not to be degraded as much as AaaA in the presence of trypsin. When the cells were lysed before treatment commenced, greater degradation of AaaA and the cytoplasmic control protein was observed. The intensity of the fully mature AaaA protein was reduced in both whole and lysed cells. The presence of trypsin inhibitor prevented degradation by trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This suggested to us that the passenger domain of AaaA is anchored to the bacterial cell surface, where it is accessible to trypsin digestion, consistent with it being an uncleaved AT. No released AaaA passenger domain could be detected in culture supernatants.</p>
        <p>To visualise this more directly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Δ<italic>aaaA</italic>(pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>) was subjected to confocal immunofluorescent microscopy with α-AaaA, and its localisation was compared with that of FM1-43, a fluorescent marker that interacts with lipid membranes. Whilst no signal was detected using the pre-immune serum, α-AaaA clearly detected AaaA primarily on the surface of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g001">Figure 1D, E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether the surface exposed AaaA was integrated into the outer membrane, <italic>E. coli</italic> LEMO21(pET21a::<italic>aaaA</italic>) was induced and fractionated. Clean separation of cytoplasmic, periplasmic, inner membrane and outer membrane fractions was verified by immunoblotting with marker proteins: IscS (cystoplasm), LEP (inner membrane), and TolC (outer membrane). Immunoblotting of AaaA revealed that this protein was only detected in the OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g002">Figure 2A–D</xref>).</p>

        <p>In the first instance, a phenotypic comparison between PAO1 and the derived PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant was conducted to ascertain whether there were any gross changes in proteolytic capability. This analysis revealed that both PAO1 and PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> generated similar zones of clearing on agar plates containing skimmed milk, which correlated with no difference in casein degradation using the azocasein degradation assay (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>, data not shown). Similarly there was no change in elastin degradation using the elastin-congo red degradation assay or haemolysis on blood agar plates (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>, data not shown). Having been unable to detect a difference in the degradation of proteins known to be broken down by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we sought to identify the specificity of the predicted aminopeptidase activity of AaaA. To do this, an assay used for a similar purpose with other members of the M28 family was employed. For this assay, amino acids linked to <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide are incubated with the suspected peptidase. Aminopeptidase activity is detected when the pseudo-peptide bond of the <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide derivative is broken, and the chromophore released (4-nitroanilide) is monitored by a change at 405 nm over time.</p>
        <p>Both PAO1 and PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> were only able to degrade methionine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide and leucine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide slowly and to a limited extent during 24 h, whilst a commercial preparation of SGAP clearly released maximal levels of 4-nitroanilide from leucine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide and methionine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide in less than 2 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002854.s002">Figure S2</xref> A,B,C). As one of the closest homologues (57% sequence identity in the passenger domain) of AaaA, the IAP aminopeptidase produced by <italic>E. coli</italic>, enables isoenzyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase by removing the terminal arginine residue from each protomer within the alkaline phosphatase dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Ishino1">[50]</xref> and because <italic>aaaA</italic> expression levels are altered in the absence of the arginine-dependent regulator ArgR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Lu1">[51]</xref>, we hypothesized that AaaA may release arginine from peptides. To test this, we assayed the ability of PAO1 and PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> to release 4-nitroanilide from arginine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide. Whilst the wild type efficiently degraded the arginine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide to fully release 4-nitroanilide within 8 h, the PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant did not do this, even after 24 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To verify that this difference was due to the deletion of <italic>aaaA</italic>, complementation was performed with plasmid pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>. In comparison to the empty vector (pME6032), pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic> significantly repaired the mutant's ability to degrade arginine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide, giving higher levels of degradation than the wild type.</p>

        <title>Site directed mutagenesis reveals key residues in AaaA are involved in aminopeptidase activity</title>
        <p>To establish that the predicted active site within AaaA is responsible for the measured arginine-specific aminopeptidase activity, site directed mutagenesis targeted at predicted key residues was undertaken. To identify key residues in the catalytic site, we took advantage of the crystal structure of SGAP (referred to as 1xjo on the protein structure database). Alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) had shown that residues involved in catalysis were conserved between AaaA and SGAP, so these were mapped onto the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). It was evident from this that the active site pocket was well conserved, as were key residues stabilising structural elements.</p>
        <p>Seven residues were chosen (underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and site directed mutagenesis used to convert them to alanines. Six of the residues mapped within the predicted catalytic pocket of AaaA (H100, D102, E147, E149, D176, D277), and the other was located on a surface exposed, unstructured loop (G89) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Three of the mutants with amino acid substitutions predicted to lie within the active site pocket (H100, E147, E149) were overproduced in <italic>E. coli</italic> as stable proteins of the predicted size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

        <p>Interestingly, and in support of our hypothesis, when the peptide Arg-Gly-Asp was included in MMP as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant could not grow although the wild type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 grew well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The presence of the complementation vector (pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>) restored the growth of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant to a level close to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that there were no second site mutations underlying the growth deficiency observed in the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant.</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of the growth deficiency exhibited by the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant, we were able to further define the specificity of the AaaA peptidase. The Phenotype Microarrays (Biolog Inc) enable the simultaneous comparison of a range of two thousand phenotypes including substrate utilisation and various chemical sensitivities, using cellular respiration as a reporter. We screened the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant and its parent, PAO1, to compare their ability to utilise 380 nitrogen sources including 24 arginine-containing dipeptides. The data is plotted as respiration over time (data not shown), and the area under these curves (AUC) has been calculated and normalised by subtraction of respiration in the absence of a nitrogen source in order to enable determination of fold induction of respiration in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Both PAO1 and PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> respired poorly in the absence of a nitrogen source and mirrored each other on a number of other nitrogen sources. For example, both PAO1 and PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> respired similarly if L-arginine was provided, whilst in the presence of lysine respiration was on a par with the negative control in which no nitrogen source was provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g006">Figure 6</xref>, data not shown). For all the non dipeptide nitrogen sources, if respiration levels indicated utilization (AUC&gt;negative control), PAO1 and PAO1Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> respired equally well (fold induction ∼1), or the mutant respired better (fold induction &gt;1). Notably, the wild type and Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant respired equally well with all the dipeptides where arginine was placed at the <italic>C</italic>-terminus (fold induction ∼1). In contrast, with the exception of Arg-Arg and Arg-Lys dipeptides as the source of nitrogen, all the dipeptides with an amino terminal arginine supported better respiration of PAO1 than of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The extent of this phenotypic difference observed between the wild type and Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant varied slightly depending on the dipeptide. The greatest difference in the respiration of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant compared to the WT was exhibited with the dipeptides containing Arg-Ile and Arg-Val (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g006">Figure 6</xref>)</p>

        <p>To discount the possibility of secondary site mutations attenuating virulence, <italic>aaaA</italic> and its adjacent promoter were introduced onto the chromosome of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> using miniCTX1 to create a stable chromosomal complementation for the 8 day animal infection model (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAJL2). <italic>In vitro</italic>, PAJL2 grew similarly to PAO1 and the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant in LB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002854.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and degraded comparable levels of arginine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide. Although behaving like the <italic>ΔaaaA</italic> mutant initially in the chronic mouse wound infection model, and exhibiting lower viable cell numbers (colony forming units, cfus) than the WT at 2 days post infection, by 8 days post infection the number of viable bacteria isolated from the wound site for PAJL2 more closely resembled the WT than the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant.</p>
        <p>In addition to an alteration of bacterial load within a mouse wound chronic infection, there were also changes in immune response dependent on the presence of AaaA. Initial analysis revealed that lower levels of expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1α were found in mice colonised with the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant in comparison to the wild type by RT-PCR (data not shown). More sensitive qRT-PCR confirmed this, and in addition showed that the expression of KC and COX-2 were also lower in mice colonised with the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant in comparison to the wild type 2 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate the expression of more host factors including components of the innate immune system linked to arginine availability in the tissue, the expression of iNOS, Arg1 and Arg2 was quantified and also found to be lower within the mouse wound infected by the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant in comparison to the wild type 2 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In each case host factor expression in skin infected by the complemented Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant matched that infected by the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant rather than the WT which is in line with the cfus with the exception of Arg1, which exhibited elevated expression in the complemented Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant 2 days post infection.</p>
        <p>Levels for the cytokine expression at day 8 of the infection are not shown as levels are low at this point in the infection (data not shown). As a first step to understanding the potential mechanism underlying AaaA function in the context of chronic skin infections, the expression levels of iNOS and Arginase are shown. During trauma, such as in a skin wound, mammalian arginine requirements exceed production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Frank1">[55]</xref>. Thus, with limited arginine available, release of arginine from peptides by AaaA may disrupt a delicate balance of arginine utilization in host cells. Arginase and iNOS use arginine as a common substrate, and compete with each other for this substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Das1">[56]</xref>. Although a much more extensive investigation is required to obtain statistically significant data of expression collected in parallel to protein levels and activity, there was an interesting trend. After 8 days of infection, the levels of iNOS expression rose in mouse skin infected by the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant compared to the WT and complemented mutant whilst expression of Arg1 tended towards a fall in the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant. The error in the measurement of Arg1 at 8 days post infection is higher than for the other genes analysed, thus data must be viewed with caution although loose trends can be identified to inform further studies and maximise the benefit of using an animal model. Whilst iNOS expression in the skin infected by the complemented Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant mirrored that in PAO1 8 days post infection, Arg1 expression did not. However, interestingly, the Arg1 induction evident 2 days post infection had resided by 8 days. Arg2 expression does not appear strongly influenced by the course of infection, perhaps due to its different tissue distribution or cellular localisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Das1">[56]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Sectioning the colonised skin and staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) indicated that neutrophils infiltrated all the infected skin wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g007">Figure 7</xref>, Panels D–L). Consistent with the lower cfus, it was difficult to visualise the bacteria in the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant infected skin (Panels J–L), and they could not be located in the skin 8 day post infection. Interestingly, clumps of bacteria could be found within the mouse skin sections for PAO1 and the complemented ΔaaaA mutant after 2 or 8 days (see asterisk in Panels D–I). In contrast, bacteria observed for the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant infection after 2 days, were not located within dense clumps. Moreover, there was evidence of wound repair for the skin infected by the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant after 8 days as infiltration by fibroblasts was observed (Panel K).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we show that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses an aminopeptidase, AaaA. AaaA is an AT that is tethered to the surface of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and specifically removes amino terminal arginine from peptides. Site directed mutagenesis revealed that AaaA aminopeptidase function relies on key amino acids that are conserved within the M28.005 aminopeptidase family and are located within the active site pocket of SGAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-FundoianoHershcovitz1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Gilboa1">[43]</xref>. Although no specific target peptides or proteins could be identified, we showed that AaaA released arginine from the aminoterminus of di and tripeptides. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was able to use the liberated arginine as a nutrient for growth, providing a fitness advantage when arginine-containing peptides were the sole source of nitrogen in the environment. Colonisation experiments in mice revealed that whilst AaaA did not confer a virulence advantage in an acute burn wound infection, it did in a chronic wound infection. The observed attenuation of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant was associated with reduced levels of the cytokine expression.</p>
      <p>The M28 family includes amino and carboxy-specific peptidases with a range of different specificities that are produced by a diverse array of organisms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://merops.sanger.ac.uk" xlink:type="simple">http://merops.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). These include eukaryotes (e.g. humans, mice, plants and nematodes), as well as bacterial species, including but not limited to <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Vibrio</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. Despite this diversity of hosts, the residues of the active sites are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Rawlings1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Cahan1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Rawlings2">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Rawlings3">[58]</xref>, suggesting a common reaction mechanism. The crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of one of the M28 aminopeptidases, SGAP, has been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Gilboa1">[43]</xref>. The residues that maintain the correct active site conformation were identified, and it was proposed that a glutamic acid residue plus either a tyrosine or histidine brought about the formation of the catalytic complex via interaction with two zinc ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-FundoianoHershcovitz1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Hershcovitz1">[59]</xref>. Our data suggests that the active site of AaaA incorporates the conserved active site residues of the M28 family. Moreover, two of them (E147 and E149) appear to have roles in catalysis or stabilization of the active site pocket since mutation of them to alanine rendered AaaA stable, OM localised, but non-functional. Presumably the mutant proteins are unable to form the enzyme-substrate intermediary complex. We cannot currently conclude whether AaaA utilizes a similar or distinct catalytic mechanism to SGAP since the predicted equivalent of one of the two SGAP catalytically important active-site residues (Y246) has yet to be mutated in AaaA. Moreover, the equivalent of the other SGAP active site residue (E131) in AaaA (E147) generated a mutant protein that retained 46% activity when replaced by alanine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-FundoianoHershcovitz1">[40]</xref>. From the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g003">Figure 3A</xref> however it can be seen that E147 is adjacent to two other glutamates, whilst SGAP has a run of only two. It is possible that one the neighbouring glutamates may be able to substitute as a general base in AaaA in the E147A mutant. Since E149A retained only 7% activity, it may plays a dominant role within the active site. However, it is not yet possible to deduct whether this is for co-ordination of the zinc ions or in catalysis. Since the H100A mutant was not localised correctly to the OM, its loss of activity (down to1.5%) could be attributed to mislocalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The instability of a subset of the active site mutants cannot currently be explained. Point mutations in ATs produced by other bacteria have not led to degraded proteins, so this was unexpected and interesting. Studies are underway to confirm the localisation of these degraded mutant proteins and we aim to determine the nature of the stable products observed. Moreover, we predicted that the C-terminal autotransporter β-barrel domain of AaaA would have been protected from digestion from exogenous trypsin due to membrane embedding, and thus parallel studies will investigate why attempts to detect it have not yet been successful and why AaaA migrates at a molecular mass approximately 10 kDa larger than predicted. It is not surprising that the passenger domain could not be detected after trypsin digestion in the supernatant as the software PeptideCutter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/" xlink:type="simple">http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/</ext-link>) indicated that 27 residues can be digested by trypsin. These were mapped onto the 3D model of PA0328 using RasMol software, where it was possible locate 14 of these 27 residues on the surface, thereby indicating that they are more accessible to digestion by trypsin (residues: 33, 38, 47, 106, 130, 136, 185, 262, 273, 277, 279, 283, 309 and 329). The biggest fragments of PA0328 which could be released by such digestion would have a predicted molecular weight of 8.3, 6.2 and 5.6 kDa, which are too small to be detected.</p>

The altered pathogenicity in the chronic wound model was associated with lower bacterial loads and levels of the proinflamatory cytokines IL-1α, KC, TNFα, and COX-2.

Both KC and COX-2 have also been linked with the progression of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Cole1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Sadikot1">[77]</xref>, and microbial load may be influencing the expression of all these cytokines. The influence of microbial load on cytokine levels is in part indicated by the data obtained from the complemented <italic>ΔaaaA</italic> mutant. At day two post infection, the number of viable cells for the <italic>ΔaaaA</italic> mutant and complemented <italic>ΔaaaA</italic> mutant were similar, as were all the cytokines, however by day 8 post-infection the complemented <italic>ΔaaaA</italic> mutant resembled PAO1 in viable cell numbers, although cytokine levels were not determined. It is not clear why the behaviour of the complemented <italic>ΔaaaA</italic> mutant did not mirror that of PAO1 exactly, but it could be due to the ectopic localisation of <italic>aaaA</italic> and its promoter since the local chromosomal structure or features may influence expression of <italic>aaaA</italic>.</p>
      <p>There are a number of potential underlying mechanisms that could lead to reduced pathogenicity of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant, and these are depicted in the cartoons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g008">Figure 8</xref>. Firstly, the lack of AaaA may lead to reduced fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. The data presented here clearly shows that AaaA enables <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to release arginine from the aminoterminus of peptides and feed this into metabolism to enable growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, and could thus provide the strength of numbers to overcome the host defences.</p>

          <title>Cartoon Model illustrating a selection of the potential roles AaaA may have within a chronic wound.</title>
          <p>In <bold>Panel A</bold>, the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> WT scenario is depicted, where AaaA (black dots) is present on the surface of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells colonising a host. <bold>Panel B</bold> shows infection with an AaaA deficient mutant that only has non-AaaA proteins on its surface (grey dots). It is possible that AaaA may: <bold>Panel I</bold> degrade a protein on the surface of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, causing activation that aids infection (represented by removal of the black outline around the grey dots in Panel A, but not in Panel B), <bold>Panel II</bold> degrade a host protein/peptide, that may be a component of the host immune system (<bold>Panel III</bold>) by removing an aminoterminal arginine (R in circle). These activities may be sufficient to aid pathogenicity, however they may serve to liberate arginine that can be catabolised by the bacteria (<bold>Panel IV</bold>) resulting in growth promotion in Panel A that is not evident in the absence of AaaA (Panel B). This may provide a fitness advantage to the bacteria that improves virulence. In conditions where oxygen is limited, the arginine may provide a particular advantage (<bold>Panel V</bold>), potentially enabling formation of biofilms that could both serve to promote colonisation and provide resistance against the immune system. If only some of the released arginine is utilized by the bacteria, local arginine levels may rise in the host (<bold>Panel VI</bold>). This could induce arginase production in host cells (depicted by dark grey box and solid black arrows in Panel A:VI). The arginase enzymes will degrade the arginine, reducing its availability as a substrate for iNOS (indicated by pale grey box and dashed grey arrows in Panel A:VI). Consequently, there will be lower levels of nitric oxide (NO) and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> will be able to successfully establish an infection. Alternatively, in Panel B:VI, AaaA is absent from the invading <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, so there is no degradation of proteins and peptides. This maintains the limited arginine concentration and avoids induction of arginase in host cells. Consequently, arginine would be available to serve as a substrate for iNOS, and the nitric oxide generated could disable the bacterial cells and promote wound healing.</p>

      <p>The fitness advantage extended by liberating arginine could be of particular relevance in anaerobic conditions since in the absence of oxygen, nitrate and nitrite, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is able to catabolize arginine by substrate level phosphorylation to serve as an energy source for anaerobic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Mercenier1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-vanderWauven1">[79]</xref>. The presence of arginine in the environment triggers the regulator ArgR to respond by activating a set of genes involved in arginine metabolism or uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Ochs1">[80]</xref>. ArgR works in concert with the anaerobic regulator (ANR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Lu2">[53]</xref>), and interestingly has been shown to positively regulate <italic>aaaA</italic> 3.7 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Lu1">[51]</xref>. In this way arginine metabolism and growth in anaerobic environments are linked with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Filiatrault1">[81]</xref> and AaaA.</p>
      <p>Additional information linking AaaA to anaerobic growth can be inferred by considering the lifestyles of bacteria which harbour AaaA homologues. For example the uncharacterised <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic> AT ECA2163 is a member of the M28.005 sub-family with 64% sequence identity with AaaA. <italic>P. carotovorum</italic> is well known for its ability to grow in anaerobic environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Smid1">[82]</xref>. Another observation that could argue for a link between AaaA and anaerobic growth is the absence of a homologue of AaaA in the plant pathogen <italic>P. syringae</italic> DC3000. This is despite the presence of 9 ATs in <italic>P. syringae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Preston1">[83]</xref>, two of which are homologues of the other AT proteins in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Notably, <italic>P. syringae</italic> DC3000 is known for its virulence in aerobic conditions within the apoplast of tomato (an environment with particularly low levels of arginine). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colonises many sites where anaerobic or microaerobic conditions are encountered, both in the environment e.g. water-logged soils and sediments and <italic>in vivo</italic> e.g. wound infections, otitis media, and pulmonary infections including those seen in CF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Rumbaugh2">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Brook1">[84]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Portier1">[87]</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Hassett1">[88]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant was not attenuated in the acute mouse burn wound model, there was a significant attenuation in the chronic wound model. The latter, probably more so than the burn model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Rumbaugh1">[54]</xref>, relies on the formation of biofilms that enable persistence and immune cell evasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Hogardt1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Schaber1">[90]</xref>. Indeed, dense clusters of bacteria which may represent biofilms were observed in mouse skin infected by the wild type and complemented Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant, but were absent from wounds infected by the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant. A possible explanation could be that there is a growth advantage conferred by AaaA under anaerobic stress or within biofilms which leads to increased resistance to attack by immune cells. We are currently investigating the biofilm formation of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to determine whether this could be a factor.</p>
      <p>There is already a precedent for a pathogenicity mechanism involving a fitness advantage provided by a protease generating arginine in anaerobic conditions: the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> relies on the production of an arginine-specific gingipain peptidase to survive in the anaerobic pockets within gums where it causes chronic inflammation and destruction of the bone in which teeth are embedded. Since <italic>Por. gingivalis</italic> cannot utilise sugars, it has an absolute requirement for proteins as a carbon and nitrogen source. The degradative gingipains, are thus an absolute requirement for growth on medium containing proteins such as bovine serum albumin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Kadowaki1">[91]</xref>. In addition to endopeptidase activity, the arginine gingipain has an arginine-specific aminopeptidase activity akin to that of AaaA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Grenier1">[92]</xref>, and we have shown that AaaA is required for growth in certain environments.</p>
      <p>Alternatively the loss of AaaA may influence virulence because one of its functions is to activate a bacterial virulence factor in a similar way to which the AT NalP activates other ATs in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-VanUlsen1">[93]</xref>. It is also possible that AaaA may utilise its aminopeptidase activity to inactivate a host protein and thereby aid pathogenicity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Such a mechanism would be analogous to the modification of the extracellular matrix by the AT Hap which aids attachment of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Fink1">[94]</xref>. Another way that AaaA might contribute to virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is by inactivating or degrading immune system components. This would be akin to one of the roles of the <italic>Por. gingivalis</italic> gingipains which are involved in direct degradation of host immune factors including cytokines, immunoglobulins and complement factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Imamura1">[95]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Mahtout1">[97]</xref>. Further study is required to assess whether the lack of any of these mechanisms underlie the attenuation of the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant in the chronic mouse model.</p>
      <p>Recently, modulation of the arginases as a means to enable microbial pathogenesis has been put forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Das1">[56]</xref>, and suggests an additional interesting hypothesis to explain why AaaA plays such a key role in pathogenicity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The limited arginine availability within skin wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Frank1">[55]</xref> creates a delicate balance of arginine utilization within host cells exploited by a range of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Das1">[56]</xref>. Arginine can be used as a substrate by host cell Arginase I and II enzymes which differ in their tissue distribution and subcellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Das1">[56]</xref>. Both arginase isoforms release urea and ornithine for metabolism and this leads to the T<sub>H</sub>2 alternative activation if it occurs in macrophages. Arginine is also a substrate for the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The iNOS enzyme combines arginine and oxygen to form nitric oxide which inhibits bacterial growth forming part of the T<sub>H</sub>1 classical pathway of macrophage activation. Elevated levels of arginine stimulate arginase activity in the host and bacterial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Gaur1">[98]</xref>. This will favour the breakdown of arginine to urea and ornithine. This will, in turn, reduce the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) response because there will no longer be arginine available to act as a substrate for iNOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Weller1">[99]</xref>. In addition to lowering the amount of nitric oxide to fight the pathogen, since nitric oxide aids wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Frank1">[55]</xref>, its absence will prevent the host regenerating physical barriers to hinder bacterial colonisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Whilst a rigorous study involving infections of mice mutated in the arginase pathway and inhibitors of AaaA is required to establish this potential mechanism, the data presented provides tantalising preliminary data that supports this model. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g007">Figure 7C</xref> Arg1 and iNOS expression were slightly reduced and increased respectively in the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant compared to the wild type, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g007">Figure 7K</xref>, an influx of fibroblasts is observed suggesting that wound healing is occurring.</p>
      <p>In support of AaaA releasing arginine from peptides to tip the balance of host cells towards degrading it via arginase enzymes rather than producing NO using iNOS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Bronte1">[100]</xref> for a comprehensive overview of the regulation of immune responses by L-arginine), mice deficient in iNOS and TNFα clear <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from their lungs less efficiently in a malnourished CF infection model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Yu1">[101]</xref>. Interestingly, another important pathogen (the stomach dwelling <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>) encodes a constitutive arginase (RocF) that functions in exactly the manner outlined above, although the RocF arginase is produced directly by the bacterium. In contrast, our model suggests that the altered arginine levels generated by AaaA stimulate expression of the host arginase. RocF consumes arginine and prevents NO production in cultured macrophages, which is relevant to pathogenicity because the <italic>rocF</italic> mutant is more efficiently killed and eliminated by activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Chaturvedi1">[102]</xref>. Similarly, removal of arginine from the oral cavity through introduction of <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> producing arginine deiminase led to reduced generation of nitric oxide which was associated with reduced inflammation and has been proposed as a novel therapeutic to combat periodontal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-DellaRiccia1">[103]</xref>. In contrast to these examples, we are proposing that rather than acting as an arginase directly, AaaA is generating arginine that stimulates the expression of the host arginase (an approach taken by a range of intracellular pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Das1">[56]</xref>). For this to occur, the arginine released from peptides by AaaA on the surface <italic>of P. aeruginosa</italic> would need to remain extracellular rather than being directly imported into the bacterial cell and used in metabolism. It is possible that we observed enhanced bacterial growth/respiration due to the presence of AaaA <italic>in vitro</italic> by virtue of the growth conditions employed, which would be very different <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further investigation of this will require technology capable of monitoring metabolites at a single-cell resolution during an infection <italic>in situ</italic>. Linking this to iNOS and arginase expression would be ideal to provide an explanation for the delay in stimulation of iNOS in the Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant compared to PAO1 since this was seen at 8 days, but not 2 days post infection in the mouse skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002854-g007">Figure 7B,C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Clearly AaaA is located on the surface of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, probably by virtue of its AT domain, and has arginine-specific aminopeptidase activity that can be used to release arginine to provide a growth fitness advantage. Whilst we were able to show that loss of AaaA led to attenuation in a mouse chronic wound infection, there remains a number of interesting hypotheses that might explain the underlying mechanisms involved in this role in pathogenicity.</p>
      <p>Further understanding of the reaction mechanism is also critical as aminopeptidases play central roles in several disease states (e.g. stroke, diabetes, cancer, HIV, neuropsychiatric disorders) and other bacterial infections. Since several naturally occurring hydroxyethyl isostere dipeptide metallo-aminopeptidase inhibitors (e.g. bestatin, leuhistin and actinonin) alleviate disease symptoms, e.g by inhibiting matrix degradation and invasion of extracellular matrixes by fibrosarcoma cells or decreasing HIV viral load, metallopeptidases are ideal targets in the search for novel therapeutic drugs. Furthermore, these enzymes have important biotechnological applications in the processing of proteins and can be exploited as a diagnostic tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Stamper1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Gilboa2">[46]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Construction of plasmids used in this study</title>
        <p>pBluescript::<italic>aaaA</italic> was constructed by PCR amplifying <italic>aaaA</italic> from the genome of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 with primers aaaAstart and aaaAend and digesting them with <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>EcoR</italic>I to insert them into the same sites in pBluescript KS+. pDEST42::<italic>aaaA</italic> was created using the directions provided in the Invitrogen Gateway system. Essentially, the <italic>aaaA</italic> open reading frame was transferred from an Entry vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Labaer1">[110]</xref> into pDEST42 using the AttB1 sites. Insertions were screened by molecular weight following PCR amplification with AttB1-HIP and AttB2-HIP primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002854-t001">Table 1</xref>), and verified by sequencing. To create the shuttle expression plasmid, pME6032::<italic>aaaA</italic>, primers aaaAstartEcoRI and aaaAendhis were used to amplify <italic>aaaA</italic> from pBluescript::<italic>aaaA</italic>. Following digestion with <italic>EcoR</italic>I and <italic>Cla</italic>I, the amplicon was inserted into similarly digested pME6032 (N.B one of the <italic>Cla</italic>I recognition sites of pME6032 was previously methylated to prevent cleavage). pET21a::<italic>aaaA</italic> was built by amplifying the <italic>aaaA</italic> open reading frame from pBluescript::<italic>aaaA</italic> with primers aaaAstartNdeI and aaaAend, digesting the amplicon and pET21a with <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI, and ligating these together.</p>

          <p>Regions of DNA (approximately 600 bp long) immediately upstream and downstream of <italic>aaaA</italic> were amplified with primers aaaAfa/aaaArb and aaaAfb/aaaArc respectively. The amplicons were cloned into pBluescript KS+ using restriction enzymes <italic>Xho</italic>I/<italic>Hind</italic>III and <italic>Hind</italic>III/<italic>Spe</italic>I respectively (creating plasmids pBluescript::<italic>aaaA</italic>upstream and pBluescript::<italic>aaaA</italic>downstream respectively). The two DNA fragments were then excised with the same enzyme combinations, ligated together to generate an in-frame deletion at the <italic>Hind</italic>III site, between the <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Spe</italic>I restriction enzyme recognition sites of pBluescript. The resultant plasmid, pBluescriptΔ<italic>aaaA</italic>, encodes only the first 5 and last 3 amino acids of the native AaaA separated by two residues (S and F), and was digested with <italic>XhoI</italic>/<italic>SpeI</italic> to excise the approximately sized 1.2 kb DNA fragment that was ligated into the suicide vector pDM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002854-Milton1">[111]</xref> that had been similarly digested. The resultant plasmid (pDM4Δ<italic>aaaA</italic>) was electroporated into <italic>E. coli</italic> S17-1λ<italic>pir</italic> and chloramphenicol resistant colonies selected, which were conjugated to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (Nottingham). Transconjugant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were selected by growth on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolation agar (Difco) containing chloramphenicol. To select for the second crossover event, transconjugants were grown for 24 h at 37°C in LB broth containing 5% (w/v) sucrose. These cultures were subsequently streaked onto LB agar containing 5% (w/v) sucrose, and grown overnight at 37°C. Colonies which were obtained here were streaked onto LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol to ensure none retained Cm<sup>R</sup> phenotype. The Δ<italic>aaaA</italic> mutant was confirmed by screening by PCR with primers aaaAfa and aaaArc which flank the region deleted. The absence of point mutations was verified by sequencing of this amplicon.</p>
