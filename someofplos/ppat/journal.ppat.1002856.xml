        <p>Surface proteins of the obligate intracellular bacterium <italic>Rickettsia typhi</italic>, the agent of murine or endemic typhus fever, comprise an important interface for host-pathogen interactions including adherence, invasion and survival in the host cytoplasm. In this report, we present analyses of the surface exposed proteins of <italic>R. typhi</italic> based on a suite of predictive algorithms complemented by experimental surface-labeling with thiol-cleavable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and identification of labeled peptides by LC MS/MS. Further, we focus on proteins belonging to the surface cell antigen (Sca) autotransporter (AT) family which are known to be involved in rickettsial infection of mammalian cells. Each species of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> has a different complement of <italic>sca</italic> genes in various states; <italic>R. typhi</italic>, has genes <italic>sca1</italic> thru <italic>sca5</italic>. <italic>In silico</italic> analyses indicate divergence of the Sca paralogs across the four <italic>Rickettsia</italic> groups and concur with previous evidence of positive selection. Transcripts for each <italic>sca</italic> were detected during infection of L929 cells and four of the five Sca proteins were detected in the surface proteome analysis. We observed that each <italic>R. typhi</italic> Sca protein is expressed during <italic>in vitro</italic> infections and selected Sca proteins were expressed during <italic>in vivo</italic> infections. Using biotin-affinity pull down assays, negative staining electron microscopy, and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that the Sca proteins in <italic>R. typhi</italic> are localized to the surface of the bacteria. All Scas were detected during infection of L929 cells by immunogold electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that Scas 1–3 and 5 are expressed in the spleens of infected Sprague-Dawley rats and Scas 3, 4 and 5 are expressed in cat fleas (<italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic>). Sca proteins may be crucial in the recognition and invasion of different host cell types. In short, continuous expression of all Scas may ensure that rickettsiae are primed i) to infect mammalian cells should the flea bite a host, ii) to remain infectious when extracellular and iii) to infect the flea midgut when ingested with a blood meal. Each Sca protein may be important for survival of <italic>R. typhi</italic> and the lack of host restricted expression may indicate a strategy of preparedness for infection of a new host.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Rickettsia typhi</italic>, a member of the typhus group (TG) rickettsia, is the agent of murine or endemic typhus fever – a disease exhibiting mild to severe flu-like symptoms resulting in significant morbidity. It is maintained in a flearodent transmission cycle in urban and suburban environments. The obligate intracellular lifestyle of rickettsiae makes genetic manipulation difficult and impedes progress towards identification of virulence factors. All five Scas were detected on the surface of <italic>R.. typhi</italic> using a combination of a biotin-labeled affinity assay, negative stain electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Sca proteins are members of the autotransporter (AT) family or type V secretion system (TVSS). We employed detailed bioinformatic analyses and evaluated their transcript abundance in an <italic>in vitro</italic> infection model where <italic>sca</italic> transcripts are detected at varying levels over the course of a 5 day <italic>in vitro</italic> infection. We also observe expression of selected Sca proteins during infection of fleas and rats. Our study provides a proteomic analysis of the bacterial surface and an initial characterization of the Sca family as it exists in <italic>R. typhi</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rickettsia (<italic>Rickettsiales</italic>: <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic>) are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria that are maintained in enzootic cycles involving both hematophagous arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Azad1">[1]</xref>. Rickettsiae are the causative agents of significant human diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (<italic>R. rickettsii</italic>) and epidemic typhus (<italic>R. prowazekii</italic>). Classically, the members of the genus <italic>Rickettsia</italic> have been divided into two groups: the tick-transmitted spotted fever group (SFG) and the insect-transmitted typhus group (TG) based on their antigenic and molecular profiles. However, these groups share some antigenic proteins such as outer membrane protein B (OmpB) and 17 kDa lipoprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Vishwanath1">[2]</xref>. The tick-transmitted SFG currently includes over 16 species, several of which are known human pathogens (<italic>R. rickettsii</italic>, <italic>R. conorii</italic>, <italic>and R. sibirica</italic>). The louse and flea transmitted TG rickettsia contain the pathogenic species <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> and <italic>R. typhi</italic> (causative agent of murine typhus). Extensive phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses have resulted in the proposal of the ancestral group (AG) and transitional group (TRG) rickettsia and these include species with mild or unknown pathogenicity as well as broad arthropod host ranges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Gillespie1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Stothard1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Perlman1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the recent advances made in rickettsial molecular biology and genomics, their determinants of pathogenicity still remain undefined. Because of the involvement of rickettsial Omps in cell surface recognition, initial binding of bacteria to host cells, invasion processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Uchiyama1">[7]</xref> as well as their immunogenicity and utility as vaccine candidates, this group of proteins has been a target of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Bourgeois1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Feng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Folds1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Li2">[11]</xref>. Bacterial surface-exposed proteins are involved in an array of processes including sensing the environment, protection from environmental stresses, adherence to and invasion of host cells, cell growth and interaction with the immune system. For intracellular bacteria, surface exposed proteins interact with host cytoplasmic or organelle proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Stavru1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Wakeel1">[13]</xref>. Characterizing the surface composition of rickettsiae allows for identification of factors required for successful colonization of mammalian and arthropod hosts.</p>
      <p>The family of rickettsial autotransporters (ATs) are referred to as <underline>s</underline>urface <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>a</underline>ntigen (Sca) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-McLeod1">[14]</xref>. A previous computation analysis identified 17 orthologs <italic>Sca0</italic> (<italic>OmpA</italic>), <italic>Sca1-Sca4</italic>, <italic>Sca5</italic> (<italic>OmpB</italic>), <italic>Sca6-Sca16</italic>) distributed throughout nine complete rickettsial genome sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Blanc1">[15]</xref>. These genomes as well as those subsequently sequenced, each encode a unique repertoire of <italic>sca</italic> orthologs that are present in different functional states (i.e. complete, fragmented or split). Furthermore, while the AT domains are well conserved within orthologs and to a lesser degree across paralogs, much less amino acid identity is observed among the passenger domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Blanc1">[15]</xref>. Experimental studies have detected expression of Sca0, Sca5 and Sca4 by various methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Uchiyama2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Walker1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Chao1">[18]</xref>, however, only Sca0, Sca5 and more recently Sca1 and Sca2 of <italic>R. conorii</italic> have been shown to function as adhesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Feng2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Cardwell1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Uchiyama3">[21]</xref>. The internal repeat motifs within the passenger domains are proposed to render each protein an adhesin and contribute specificity to host receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Blanc1">[15]</xref>. For <italic>R. conorii</italic> Sca5, these repeats may contribute to its specificity for the DNA protein kinase Ku70 on the surface of host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Martinez1">[22]</xref>. More recently, Sca2 in <italic>R. parkeri</italic> has been characterized as a formin-like mediator of actin-based motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Haglund1">[23]</xref> indicating that some of the Scas have intracellular functions and may interact with host proteins to promote rickettsial survival.</p>
      <p><italic>R. typhi</italic>, the focal organism of this study, contains 5 <italic>sca</italic> orthologs in its genome – <italic>sca1, sca2, sca3, sca4</italic> and <italic>sca5</italic>. As in other species studied, Sca5 likely mediates adherence and invasion of <italic>R. typhi</italic> to host cells, however little is known about the expression and function of the other Sca orthologs during <italic>R. typhi</italic> infection in either mammalian or arthropod hosts. A better understanding of the expression and distribution of the Scas during <italic>R. typhi</italic> transmission and infection is crucial in order to appreciate the function of these proteins. This study is a comparative analysis that was undertaken to elucidate the transcriptional and protein expression profiles of the <italic>R. typhi Sca</italic> family <italic>in vitro</italic> (tissue culture) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (rat and flea infections). This study addresses our hypothesis that <italic>R. typhi Sca</italic> expression is time and host dependent.</p>

        <p>Surface proteins of intracellular bacteria mediate interactions required for their pathogenesis and survival. Defining the surface proteome of <italic>R. typhi</italic> provides a better understanding of the potential interactions at the host-pathogen interface. Using CoBaltDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Goudenege1">[24]</xref> and pSORTb v. 3.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Yu1">[25]</xref>, several signal peptide and subcellular localization algorithms were employed to generate predictions of secreted and outer membrane proteins among the 838 ORFs in <italic>R. typhi</italic>. Of the 838 ORFs, 140 were predicted to be secreted by at least one of the four algorithms employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Further, 25 proteins had no detectable secretion signals but were predicted to be localized to the membrane or extracellular to bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s008">Table S1</xref>, proteins highlighted in yellow).

        <p>In a previous study, putative secretion signals <italic>R. typhi</italic> ORFs were tested for the ability to facilitate secretion to the periplasm via a sec-translocon dependent mechanism in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Ammerman1">[28]</xref>. We further analyzed all <italic>R. typhi</italic> str.

Based on the SecretomeP method, 26 of the proteins with classical secretion signals also have signals for non-classical secretion methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s008">Table S1</xref>, proteins highlighted in green). Fifty-four proteins were predicted to have only non-classical signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s009">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Only a fraction of the proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in the surface proteome analysis. A total of 68 proteins were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s010">Table S3</xref>), 27 of which are predicted to be secreted (to the periplasm via the Sec translocon as determined by SignalP) or surface-exposed (in the outer membrane or extracellular to bacteria as determined by SOSUIGramN and pSORTb) by at least one of the algorithms used. Fifteen of the proteins are predicted to have secretion signal peptides as determined by SignalP NN and/or HMM algorithms. pSORTb v. 3.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Yu1">[25]</xref> predicted three proteins to be localized to the outer membrane [RT0565 and RT0699(Sca5)] or be extracellular (RT0522). SOSUIGramN localized 11 proteins to either the outer membrane (RT0521, RT0744 and RT0805) or extracellular [RT0052(Sca2), RT0699(Sca5), etc.] to bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s010">Table S3</xref> cells shaded grey). LipoP, Phobius and SecretomeP were the only algorithms to predict signal sequences for one (RT0117), two (RT0222 and RT0584) and five (RT0138, RT0176, RT0362, RT0485 and RT0638) proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s010">Tables S3</xref>). The predicted signal peptides for 11 of these 68 proteins were previously tested for Sec-translocon dependent secretion into the periplasm using an alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) gene fusion system (see footnotes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s010">Table S3</xref>) and 10 of them were found to mediate secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Ammerman1">[28]</xref>. Proteins predicted by the SecretomeP method may be present in the outer membrane as a result of Sec-independent secretion mechanisms. Most of the peptides identified are predicted to be cytoplasmic or have unknown localizations with few of them predicted to be localized to the surface of the bacterium as determined by pSORTb and SOSUIGramN. The expression of cytoplasmic proteins on the surface of bacteria is not uncommon. Of the proteins identified in this study, 18 have homologs that have been shown to be surface exposed in other rickettsial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Pornwiroon1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Noh1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Ge1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Gibson1">[33]</xref>, other Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Sommer1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Rhomberg1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Boonjakuakul1">[36]</xref> and Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Desvaux1">[37]</xref>. Additionally, 14 of the proteins are annotated as hypothetical and only 5 of the 14 have predicted signal peptides detected by at least one of the algorithms further suggesting that rickettsial proteins may have novel secretion signals.</p>
        <p>The identification of most of the Sca proteins on the surface was largely consistent with the localization predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s008">Table S1</xref>). Specifically, both pSORTb algorithms, LipoP, Phobius and SecretomeP predicted the presence of signal peptides for Sca1-3 and Sca5. SOSUI-GramN and pSORTb also localized each of these proteins as extracellular to the bacteria or to the outer membrane. SecretomeP was the only program to predict a signal sequence within Sca4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s009">Table S2</xref>); it is also predicted to be localized to the cytoplasm by the SOSUI-GramN and pSORTb algorithms.</p>

        <p>We tested the above hypothesis, despite the low prediction probabilities, using RT-PCR to amplify the indicated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Co-transcription of <italic>Sca3</italic> with the gene encoding the protease <italic>Lon</italic> and <italic>Sca4</italic> with one of four ATP/ADP translocases, <italic>tlcD</italic>, were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) indicating that both of these genes comprise a transcriptional unit with their nearby genes respectively. Co-transcription data for the putative <italic>Sca5</italic> operon is less conclusive. We were unable to detect a full transcript spanning the <italic>ihfA</italic> to <italic>Sca5</italic> genes (data not shown) and therefore designed primers to amplify 5 different regions that would span the entire putative operon. Transcripts of <italic>Sca5</italic>-<italic>spoTd</italic> and <italic>spoTd-RT0701</italic>, are detected suggesting that these 3 genes are co-transcribed. While an amplicon for <italic>RT0701-RT0702</italic> is detected, a transcript spanning <italic>RT0702</italic> and <italic>spoTd</italic> could not be amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

        <p>To investigate Sca protein expression we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) against a peptide within the passenger domain of each Sca. Specificity of the serum directed to each Sca was confirmed by immunoblot against lysates from uninfected and infected L929 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and sections of infected and uninfected L929 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s004">S4</xref>). Sca5 staining is observed in the cytoplasm and the outer membrane on many rickettsiae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Some labeling of host cell chromatin was also observed. Although staining is weak, Sca 1 is observed in the rickettsial cytoplasm and in association with the membrane of rickettsiae. Staining is also observed on the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s003">Figure S3</xref>), the host cell cytoplasm and chromatin (data not shown). Sca2 and Sca3 staining is observed on the outer membrane, host chromatin or cytoplasm of very few rickettsiae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Sca4 staining shows a similar pattern to the other Scas with labeling of the outer membrane, periphery and rickettsial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate possible variability of Sca expression within organisms that maintain the infection in an enzootic cycle we infected rats and cat fleas. Rats serve as a primary reservoir for murine typhus in urban environments.

      <p>Surface proteins of obligate intracellular bacteria comprise a crucial interface for pathogen-host interactions by mediating the initial attachment and infection of host cells and subsequent contact with host cytosolic proteins to promote bacterial survival and replication through the subversion of host processes. In this report, we investigated the surface proteome of <italic>R. typhi</italic> str.

Rickettsial OMPs form the basis for antigenic relationships between and within phylogenetic groups and allow for some cross-protection from infection by multiple species.

      <p>Many of the proteins identified on the surface of <italic>R. typhi</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s010">Table S3</xref>) have homologs that were similarly identified on the surface of other rickettsiae or other families of Gram-negative bacteria.

      <p>Few rickettsial surface-exposed proteins have been investigated; however, certain Sca proteins have been localized to the bacterial surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Haglund1">[23]</xref> or inferred to be located there based on antibody inhibition of infection or conference of adhesive and invasive properties to recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Feng2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Cardwell1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Riley1">[51]</xref>. We were able to detect the recently characterized RT0522 conserved hypothetical protein, which encodes a phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> homolog that was found to be secreted from the bacterium into the host cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Rahman1">[52]</xref>. Most of the algorithms used in this study detected no signal peptide in RT0522 and predicted it to be localized to the cytoplasm; however pSORTb v3.0 predicted it to be extracellular. This may be evidence that other hypothetical proteins identified on the surface but predicted by consensus to be cytoplasmic and lacking detectable signal peptides, may in fact have extracellular functions as effector proteins. It is also an indication that the algorithms, such as SubcellPredict, SLPLocal and SubLoc v.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Niu1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Matsuda1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Hua1">[55]</xref> (data not shown), which are trained on free-living model Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, may not accurately identify the signals and motifs utilized by rickettsiae to target proteins to the surface. Discrepancies between the number of predicted outer membrane or extracellular proteins and the number actually identified may be due to low abundance of some peptides and or inaccessibility to the biotinylation reagent. It is predicted that Sca5 comprises the S-layer of rickettsiae and constitutes 15% of the total protein mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Ching1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Hahn1">[57]</xref> and might block many potential interactions. The properties of the labeling reagent must also be taken into account. The N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) group of Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin specifically reacts with the ε-amine of lysine residues and the reactions also proceed at a wide range of temperatures. A more comprehensive analysis of the surface proteome might be compiled by performing reactions across the range of temperatures and using similar biotinylated reagents with spacer arms of differing lengths and reactivity with different groups.</p>
      <p>The Sca family of autotransporters drew our focus because their primary involvement in adherence and invasion is becoming more apparent but predicted functional domains within a few of them point to other roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Cardwell1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Riley1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Chan1">[58]</xref>. Multi-functional autotransporters are not uncommon and further characterization of this family may define distinct extracellular and intracellular roles. For instance, <italic>R. parkeri</italic> Sca2 is observed to act as an actin-assembly mediator that mimics the eukaryotic formin proteins. Furthermore, it is the first bacterial protein to be identified to functionally and perhaps structurally mimic a domain that was previously thought to be solely eukaryotic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Haglund1">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, this is the second instance of a rickettsial protein containing a domain with a nearly strict eukaryotic distribution. Similarly, the Sec7-domain-containing proteins (RalF) encoded within <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> species are unknown from other prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Cox1">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As stated above, all of the Scas in <italic>R. typhi</italic> were identified on the surface when considering the biotin labeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s010">Table S3</xref>), negative staining electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and flow cytometry data collectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s007">Figure S7</xref>). All Sca proteins except Sca4 were predicted to have signal peptides and be localized to the outer membrane or be extracellular (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s008">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s009">S2</xref>). The prediction of a signal peptide in Sca4 by SecretomeP supports evidence that the first 200 bp of <italic>Sca4</italic> encode sufficient information to direct secretion of a phoA fusion peptide across the inner membrane into the periplasm (unpublished data). Further, Sca4 is known to generate an antibody response to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Schuenke1">[60]</xref> and others have shown, as we have here, that Sca4 is under positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Blanc1">[15]</xref>. It has been posited that Sca4 and the similarly AT domain-less Sca9 may be exported through the AT domain of another Sca. However a quick analysis for possible signals based on homology among the Scas returned no supporting data for this hypothesis. Further investigation of the function and secretion mechanism of Sca4 is necessary.</p>
      <p>Phylogeny estimation of Sca1, Sca2, Sca4, and Sca5 proteins resulted in trees that all differ from the <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002856.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This is not unexpected, as phylogenies based on single rickettsial genes and proteins rarely agree with those estimated from multiple molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Gillespie2">[61]</xref>. Notwithstanding, the Scas are large proteins and contain many variable sites, which should provide enough information for robust phylogeny estimation. However, the extracellular location of the passenger domains likely orchestrates selective pressures on these proteins that render them evolutionarily divergent from the species historical trajectory. Indeed, previous studies have identified positively selected sites within the Sca passenger domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Blanc1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Jiggins1">[62]</xref>. For Sca1, Sca2 and Sca5, we estimated separate trees based on the passenger domain and AT domain to determine conflicting phylogenetic signals within these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>). In each case, the trees estimated for the AT domain were much more consistent with the rickettsial species tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), while the trees generated from the passenger domains clearly illustrate Sca protein diversification inconsistent with rickettsial species phylogeny.</p>

      <p>Recombination between Sca orthologs from different species has also been demonstrated to play a role in the diversification of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Jiggins1">[62]</xref>. While recombination has been observed experimentally in <italic>Rickettsia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Rachek1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Rachek2">[64]</xref>, its contribution to rickettsial diversity is currently not fully understood. Notwithstanding, all rickettsia genomes encode enzymes involved in homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Gillespie3">[65]</xref>, so it is likely that active recombination occurs across species and strains. Insight into how recombination may shape Sca protein evolution is provided by a phylogeny estimation of an expanded set of Sca4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Without an AT domain, contrasting phylogenetic signals within Sca4 proteins could not be determined as for the other Scas described above. However, the identification of an ancestral lineage of plasmid encoded Sca4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, yellow box) proteins illustrates the inclusion of these proteins in the rickettsial mobilome (all the mobile genetic elements in the genome), allowing for the dissemination of Sca variants via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Other studies have reported the presence of Sca ORFs and fragments present on diverse rickettsial plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Baldridge1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Baldridge2">[67]</xref> further supporting the role of LGT as a facilitator of mosaicism via recombination across divergent Sca orthologs (and possibly paralogs). Like the phylogenies estimated from the other Scas, the Sca4 tree does not corroborate the rickettsial species tree, and it is likely that all Scas are subject to positive selection and recombination. These selective forces, which are counter to the evolutionary history of rickettsia, are problematic for inferring species relatedness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Jiggins1">[62]</xref>. Thus, despite their usefulness as rickettsia-specific diagnostic markers, as well as their increasing accumulation from published studies, the Scas should be avoided for phylogenetic inference and classificatory purposes.</p>
      <p>Transcriptional analysis in non-phagocytic cells demonstrates that <italic>sca</italic> transcription is sustained during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Although we are unable to correlate <italic>sca</italic> transcription with protein levels at present, the constitutive expression of all <italic>sca</italic> genes points toward essential functions. Moreover, the co-transcriptional analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that <italic>scas</italic> and the genes that are co-transcribed may function in the same processes or are part of regulatory mechanisms important for their expression. The inability to detect <italic>ihfA-RT0702</italic> and <italic>RT0702-spoTd</italic> transcripts while detecting <italic>RT0702-RT0701</italic> and <italic>RT0701-spoTd</italic> transcripts in the proposed <italic>sca5-ihfA</italic> operon indicates that the consecutive genes are not expressed at the same level. It is becoming understood that the concept of multiple successive genes under the control of a single promoter - that is operons - does not inherently mean that all genes are equally expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Guell1">[68]</xref>. This phenomenon, termed operon polarity, may be explained by the presence of internal transcription terminators, the activity of small RNAs (sRNAs) or by riboswitches within operons that modulate transcription in response to metabolite binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Guell2">[69]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We attempted to detect all of the Sca proteins for <italic>R. typhi</italic> in the spleen tissue, however, in these experiments we consistently observe expression for Scas 1 and 5. This may be specific to the rat we used in this particular experiment or the time point we chose to assay (9 days). Given animal to animal variation as well as time-dependent expression of many rickettsial proteins, we do not exclude the possibility that the remaining Scas play an important role during mammalian infection. While we show that the proteins are expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002856-g003">Figure 3B–C</xref>), we are unable to quantitatively assess this expression and correlate it with different stages of growth or infection. However, the immunogold labeling of host cell cytoplasm and chromatin may suggest translocation of the rickettsial proteins to the cytosol. Probing infected cells with pre-immune sera or uninfected cells and tissues with Sca immune sera show no cross-reactivity with host cell components. Proteins may be expressed but not required for infection of a particular host or cell type. Rather, the bacteria will be prepared, upon exiting a cell, to infect an endothelial cell or the flea midgut epithelium. Further characterization of these proteins and identification of interacting host proteins will determine where and how these proteins function and their importance in infection of mammalian and arthropod hosts.</p>

The quality of peptide and protein assignments was assessed using PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet. Proteins with probabilities ≥0.9 were accepted as true positive identifications. Proteins identified by one unique peptide were manually verified. Identified proteins were then analyzed for signal sequences and motifs that predict subcellular localization.

Total RNA was DNase-treated with the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen) then cleaned up and concentrated with the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen). DNA removal was confirmed using the SuperScriptIII One-step RT-PCR with Platinum <italic>Taq</italic> kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cDNA was made using the SuperScriptIII First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen).</p>

        <p>Expression of the <italic>Sca</italic> genes was analyzed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Ceraul1">[78]</xref> with some modifications. Briefly, gene expression was detected using LUX primers (Invitrogen) in a multiplex format. Primers for <italic>rpsL</italic>, <italic>GAPDH</italic> and one of the <italic>Sca</italic> genes were included in each PCR reaction for amplification using the Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen). Reactions were performed in duplicate on a MX3005P Stratagene real-time thermal cycler. Primer pairs were designed using the D-LUX Designer (Invitrogen) and chosen based on a melting temperature of 55°C and optimal amplicon size of 90–200 bp. Primer pairs used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002856-t001">Table 1</xref>. Cycling conditions were as follows: one cycle of 50°C for 1 h; one cycle of 95°C for 10 min; and 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 30 s followed by a disassociation cycle of 95°C for 1 min, a 30-s hold at 55°C, and a ramp up at 0.1°C/s to 95°C for a 30-s hold. Data were imported and analyzed as described in Ceraul <italic>et al</italic> 2007. Cycle thresholds above 45 were excluded from analysis and the results from three experiments were combined and the median normalized expression values were calculated.</p>

After washing in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer cells were scraped off the plastic, pelleted and processed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002856-Ceraul2">[81]</xref>. Briefly, the pellets were stained <italic>en bloc</italic> with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, dehydrated in 50% then 75% ethanol and embedded in LR White resin medium grade (Structure Probe, West Chester, PA). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and collected onto Formvar-carbon coated nickel grids (Electron Microscoy Sciences [EMS], Hatfield, PA). The grids were incubated in a wet chamber sequentially on drops of blocking buffer (0.1% BSA and 0.01 M glycine in 0.05 M Tris-buffered saline [TBS]), then on primary antibody with appropriate dilution in 1% BSA in 0.05 M TBS (diluting buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature and then overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were used at a 1∶50 dilution. After washing in blocking buffer, grids were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to 15 nm colloidal gold particles (Aurion, EMS), diluted 1∶20 in diluting buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing in TBS and distilled water grids were fixed in 2% aqueous glutaraldehyde, washed, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips 201 or Philips CM-100 Electron microscope at 60 kV.</p>
        <p>Surface labeling of whole rickettsiae for imaging by immuno-electron microscopy was performed as follows. 10<sup>7</sup> purified rickettsiae were washed in 1X PBS and suspended in 4F1G fixative for 15 min.
