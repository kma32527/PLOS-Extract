        <p>Phytopathogenic oomycetes, such as <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that modulate plant innate immunity to enable infection. We describe CRN8, a host-translocated effector of <italic>P. infestans</italic> that has kinase activity <italic>in planta</italic>. CRN8 is a modular protein of the CRN effector family. The C-terminus of CRN8 localizes to the host nucleus and triggers cell death when the protein is expressed <italic>in planta</italic>. Cell death induction by CRN8 is dependent on its localization to the plant nucleus, which requires a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminal sequence of CRN8 has similarity to a serine/threonine RD kinase domain. We demonstrated that CRN8 is a functional RD kinase and that its auto-phosphorylation is dependent on an intact catalytic site. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CRN8 forms a dimer or multimer. Heterologous expression of CRN8 <italic>in planta</italic> resulted in enhanced virulence by <italic>P. infestans</italic>. In contrast, <italic>in planta</italic> expression of the dominant-negative CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> resulted in reduced <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection, further implicating CRN8 in virulence.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> is the causal agent of late blight on potato and tomato. It is now well established that oomycetes, such as <italic>P. infestans</italic>, secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that modulate plant innate immunity to enable infection. The Crinkler (CRN) effector family containing the LFLAK translocation motif represents a new class of cytoplasmic effectors from oomycetes. The N-terminal domain, which includes this motif, is dispensable for cell death induction <italic>in planta</italic>, indicating the presence of modular domains that are involved in distinct processes. The C-terminal/effector domain of CRN8 localizes to the host nucleus and nuclear localization is required for triggering cell death. The CRN8 effector domain has similarity to plant Serine/Threonine RD kinases. This intriguing finding raises the possibility that CRN8 mimics a specific class of plant enzymes, a feature that has been observed for several other pathogen effectors. Using biochemical assays, we confirmed that the C-terminal domain of CRN8 has kinase activity, and have identified by mass spectrometry five serines shown to be auto-phosphorylated. To the best of our knowledge, CRN8 is the first reported secreted active kinase from a microbial plant pathogen.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phytopathogenic oomycetes, such as <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp., cause some of the most destructive plant diseases in the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Lamour1">[1]</xref>. <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp. are hemibiotrophic pathogens, meaning that they have a two-step infection process: an early biotrophic phase (the first 2–3 days after infection), followed by a second phase characterized by extensive host tissue necrosis which enables additional growth and sporulation of the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-vanDamme1">[2]</xref>. To achieve this level of host colonization, plant and animal pathogens secrete molecules, termed effectors, that interfere with host immune pathways and enable host colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Chisholm1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Hogenhout1">[5]</xref>. Oomycetes secrete hundreds of effector proteins that are either translocated inside host cells or act in the apoplast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Kamoun2">[7]</xref>. Although some of the apoplastic effectors are inhibitors of plant hydrolases, the majority of oomycete cytoplasmic (host-translocated) effectors, namely members of the RXLR and Crinkler (CRN) families, lack similarity to known proteins and their biochemical activities remain largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Oliva1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bos1">[10]</xref>. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying effector activity remains challenging and is dependent on identifying host targets of these effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bos1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bozkurt1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the case of bacterial plant pathogens, much has been learned from studying the role of effectors that target various host processes once delivered inside host cells. Several of these bacterial effectors, such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase HopPtoD2/HopAO1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bretz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Underwood1">[13]</xref> and the phosphothreonine lyases OspF and HopAI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Li1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Zhang1">[15]</xref>, are enzymes that alter host immunity by targeting signaling components such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Chisholm1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Mudgett1">[16]</xref>. However, most effectors of filamentous eukaryotic pathogens (oomycetes and fungi) lack similarity to known enzymes or proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Kamoun1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Oliva1">[8]</xref>, making functional predictions nearly impossible. One notable exception is the host-translocated metalloprotease AvrPita of the rice blast pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Orbach1">[17]</xref>. More recently, Avr3b, a <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> RXLR effector, was shown to carry a domain with similarity to Nudix hydrolases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Dong1">[18]</xref>. The Nudix motif is important for AVR3b virulence function but is not required for activation of the resistance protein Rps3b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Dong1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Armstrong1">[19]</xref>. This report focuses on CRN8, a host-translocated effector of <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> that has similarity to serine/threonine kinases and is a candidate enzyme effector.</p>
      <p>Even though functional secreted kinases have been described in animal pathogens, this class of effectors has not been reported for plant pathogens to date. Several animal pathogen kinases translocate inside host cells and perturb various host cell processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Sibley1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Shao1">[21]</xref>. The bacterium <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, the causal agent of the bubonic plague, secretes the virulence determinant kinase YpkA into eukaryotic host cells, which eventually leads to alterations in cell morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Galyov1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Dukuzumuremyi1">[23]</xref>. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, an obligate intracellular parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, secretes kinases that are injected from secretory parasitic organelles (rhoptries) into the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Saffer1">[24]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that certain rhoptry proteins (ROPs), specifically the tandem cluster of polymorphic ROP5 pseudokinases, are essential for pathogen virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Behnke1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Reese1">[26]</xref>. Other ROPs, for instance the kinases ROP16 and ROP18, have been previously shown to be indispensable for full virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Saeij1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Taylor1">[28]</xref>. ROP16 is secreted into the host and is redirected to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Saeij2">[29]</xref> where it phosphorylates the host proteins Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Yamamoto1">[30]</xref> and STAT6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Ong1">[31]</xref>, leading to altered cytokine profiles and repression of IL-12 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Saeij2">[29]</xref>. ROP18, an active kinase that trans-phosphorylates immunity related GTPases that plays a major role in <italic>T. gondii</italic> proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-ElHajj1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Steinfeldt1">[34]</xref>. The kinase activity of ROP18 also is essential for proteasome-dependent degradation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6β) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Yamamoto2">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The CRNs form a major class of oomycete cytoplasmic effectors that are known to alter host responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Kamoun1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Torto1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Win1">[37]</xref>. They were originally identified following an <italic>in planta</italic> expression screen of candidate secreted proteins of <italic>P. infestans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Torto1">[36]</xref>. Intracellular expression of several CRN C-termini in plants results in plant cell death and induction of defense-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Torto1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, the CRNs appear to perturb host cellular processes similar to many plant pathogen effectors, causing macroscopic phenotypes such as cell death, chlorosis, and tissue browning when expressed in host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Torto1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Kjemtrup1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Gurlebeck1">[40]</xref>. More recently, CRN N-termini were shown to be functionally interchangeable with the N-termini of RXLR effectors, and to successfully deliver the C-terminal portion of the RXLR effector protein AVR3a inside plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bos2">[41]</xref>. Therefore, CRN effectors are modular proteins consisting of conserved N-termini required for translocation inside host cells and highly diverse C-termini responsible for the effector's biochemical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Fentress1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bos2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack2">[42]</xref>. Interestingly, the CRNs appear to be chimeric, with strong evidence of recombination after the HVLVXXP motif that occurs at the end of the DWL domain just prior to the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. The C-termini of CRN proteins are diverse and typically localize to plant nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack2">[42]</xref>. Specifically, CRN8 requires a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) for nuclear accumulation and cell death induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack2">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The D2 domain of CRN8 has significant similarity to protein serine/threonine kinases of the RD class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. RD kinases are defined as those kinases in which the conserved catalytic aspartate is preceded by an arginine residue in the kinase subdomain VI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Johnson1">[43]</xref>. RD kinases are regulated by activation loop phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Johnson1">[43]</xref>. Serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate the OH group of serine or threonine, while other kinases act on tyrosine, and a number (dual-specificity kinases) act on all three <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Millward1">[44]</xref>. Protein kinases are one of the largest groups of kinases. By adding phosphate groups to substrate proteins, kinases direct the activity, localization, and overall function of many proteins, ultimately regulating almost all cellular processes. Dimerization has a crucial role in the regulation of many kinases and, as is the case with MAP kinases, can have a profound impact on their regulation and substrate selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Pelech1">[45]</xref>. Kinase activation by dimerization forms another layer of regulation. It can be exploited to interfere with normal kinase activity using dominant-negative kinase inactive mutants. For example, in cancer research the mammalian serine/threonine kinase Akt is an important regulator of cell survival and cell proliferation. However, co-expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of Akt in cells interfered with active Akt and inhibited cell proliferation and apoptotic response in tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Jetzt1">[46]</xref>. Another example is the expression of the catalytically inactive tyrosine phosphatase, HopAO1, that has a dominant-negative effect on the function of the wild type HopAO1 in infected plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Underwood1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we characterized CRN8, a secreted serine/threonine kinase of <italic>P. infestans</italic>. The predicted catalytic domain of CRN8 includes amino acid sequence 454 to 573 with a conserved catalytic aspartate (D 470) adjacent to an arginine (R 469). Here, we demonstrated that CRN8 is an active <italic>P. infestans</italic> kinase that displays catalytic activity and is auto-phosphorylated inside plant cells. Transient <italic>in planta</italic> over-expression of CRN8 resulted in cell death, and at least five phosphorylated serines were identified in CRN8 by mass spectrometry. Substitution of all five serines into alanines resulted in loss of cell death activity. Transient co-expression of wild type CRN8 and a kinase-inactive CRN8 mutant in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> resulted in a large reduction of CRN8 cell death activity consistent with dominant negative effects. We also discovered that CRN8 is able to form dimers <italic>in planta</italic>. Finally, we showed that <italic>in planta</italic> expression of CRN8 enhances <italic>P. infestans</italic> virulence, whereas expression of the dominant-negative mutant resulted in reduced virulence.</p>

        <title>Expansion of the CRN8 family in <italic>P. infestans</italic></title>
        <p>CRN8 consists of four different conserved domains: the signal peptide (SP), the LFLAK motif, the DWL domain, and the D2 domain, which shows homology to the RD class of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. Based on this domain compilation, ten functional CRN8 paralogs were predicted from the sequenced genome of <italic>P. infestans</italic> isolate T30-4, compared to three in <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, and none in <italic>P. sojae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. Five of the ten <italic>P. infestans</italic> CRN8 paralogs contain a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS: amino acid sequence KGVRKKHRRA) which occurs after the D2 domain. The three <italic>P. ramorum</italic> CRN8 paralogs also have a predicted NLS (amino acid sequence: KRKRK), however, unlike the <italic>P. infestans</italic> CRN8 paralogs, their NLS sequence occurs prior to the D2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). ClustalW alignments of the D2 domain sequences, the original CRN8 allele from <italic>P. infestans</italic> isolate 88069 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Torto1">[36]</xref>, the 10 CRN8 paralogs, and the three <italic>P. ramorum</italic> paralogs revealed conservation of the RD kinase catalytic site (marked by the two asterisks) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, the <italic>P. ramorum</italic> CRN8 paralog sequences share only 33% amino acid identity to CRN8 compared to 97–99% identity among the <italic>P. infestans</italic> kinase domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002875.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> genome sequences also revealed 38 CRN8 pseudogenes in <italic>P. infestans</italic>, four in <italic>P. ramorum</italic> and three from <italic>P. sojae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The high number of <italic>P. infestans</italic> CRN8 paralogs, the presence of many pseudogenes, and the high amino acid conservation is an indication that the CRN8 family in <italic>P. infestans</italic> arose from a recent expansion.</p>

        <p>The modular domain structure of the CRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref> implies that each domain may evolve separately. Taking this into account, we examined the phylogenetic relationship among CRN8 paralogs by analyzing the C-terminal amino acid sequence (the D2 domain) separately from the N-terminal sequence (including the SP, LFLAK and DWL domains). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the two separate phylogenetic trees of the <italic>P. infestans</italic> and <italic>P. ramorum</italic> CRN8 paralogs. The N-terminal amino acid sequences in the left tree are connected to their corresponding C-terminal amino acid sequence in the right tree by a dashed line. In the N-terminal phylogenetic tree, the <italic>P. ramorum</italic> CRN8 sequences are present in different clades, yet analysis of the C-terminus shows <italic>P. ramorum</italic> D2 sequences to be grouped into a single clade when compared to <italic>P. infestans</italic> D2 sequences. From these phylogenetic analyses, we conclude that both termini evolved separately. The separate clustering of <italic>P. infestans</italic> and <italic>P. ramorum</italic> D2 domains suggests that the expansion of the CRN8 family in <italic>P. infestans</italic> occurred after the divergence of <italic>P. infestans</italic> and <italic>P. ramorum</italic>. This feature of CRN8, together with the phylogenetic studies on all <italic>P. infestans</italic> CRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>, is indicative of recombination between different CRN domains and points to a mechanism responsible for increasing CRN diversity. Expansion of the <italic>P. infestans</italic> CRN8 family and conservation of its D2 kinase domain suggests that CRN8 kinase activity was preserved in the <italic>P. infestans</italic> lineage.</p>

        <title>The D2 kinase domain of CRN8 causes cell death <italic>in planta</italic></title>
        <p>The C-terminus of CRN8 was previously shown to induce cell death when expressed <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. To further define the domain of CRN8 that is required for cell death induction, we used <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transient expression to assay five N-terminal and three C-terminal deletion mutants for cell death activation in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The only N-terminal mutant that retained the ability to give a strong cell death induction was the smallest deletion, consisting of amino acid residues 118 to 599 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For C-terminal deletion mutants, cell death induction was partially lost in the 118–582 deletion mutant, and completely lost in any of the larger deletions, indicating that an intact C-terminus containing amino acids 118 to 599 is required for full activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicate that the region required for cell death induction includes the entire kinase domain, as well as the C-terminal NLS; a finding consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack2">[42]</xref>. The full-length CRN8 protein with signal peptide, caused cell death but at weaker levels than the C-terminal domain alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Previous studies with oomycete cytoplasmic effectors have demonstrated stronger phenotypes when effectors are expressed <italic>in planta</italic> without secretion signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Bos2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Allen1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Dou1">[48]</xref>.

        <p>To determine if CRN8 is a functional kinase, we tested the phosphorylation ability of the D2 kinase domain <italic>in vitro</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3A</xref> illustrates the used FLAG fused protein structure of the CRN8 effector, mutations were generated at the indicated RD site. Large amounts of FLAG epitope-tagged CRN8 fusion protein (amino acids 118–599) and kinase-inactive mutant proteins, FLAG:CRN8<sup>D470N</sup> and FLAG:CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup>, were expressed <italic>in planta</italic> and purified by FLAG immuno-precipitation. To verify that the proteins were present, a fraction of each purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, upper panel). When these samples were subjected to an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay with γ-P<sup>32</sup>-ATP, an auto-phosphorylated band corresponding to the FLAG:CRN8 (WT) protein was detected, but no signal was detectable for the FLAG:CRN8<sup>D470N</sup> and FLAG:CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> mutant proteins on the autoradiogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panel). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, we further examined the phosphorylation status of CRN8 and its mutants by using phosphorylation-specific staining (ProQ Diamond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schulenberg1">[49]</xref>) of crude and immuno precipitated material. Only CRN8 (WT) protein was found to be phosphorylated in both crude and immuno-purified plant protein extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, top panel). While all fusion proteins were present at detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, middle panel), only the FLAG:CRN8 (WT) protein produced a signal when incubated with the ProQ Diamond stain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schulenberg1">[49]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom panel).

The first panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g006">figure 6B</xref> shows strong induction of cell death by FLAG:CRN8, indicating that co-expression with the EV:GFP control did not suppress the cell death response.

We attribute this reduction to the presence of the GFP:CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> mutant protein because when FLAG:CRN8 is co-expressed with wild type GFP:CRN8, the protein levels remain unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g006">Figure 6C, E</xref>). In addition, despite substantially lower protein levels of GFP:CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> compared to GFP:CRN8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), the destabilization impact of the GFP:CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> protein on FLAG:CRN8 is greater. Our data indicate that suppression of CRN8-induced cell death is probably due to a reduction in FLAG:CRN8 protein levels, suggesting that the GFP:CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> protein destabilizes the FLAG:CRN8 protein.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we functionally characterize the CRN8 effector, a secreted kinase from <italic>P. infestans</italic> previously shown to be delivered into plant cells via its N-terminal targeting motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack2">[42]</xref>. The <italic>P. infestans</italic> genome consists of gene-dense regions composed mainly of core ortholog genes, and gene-sparse regions which contain many fast-evolving pathogenicity effector families such as the CRNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. The location of the CRN genes in these gene-sparse dynamic regions has likely allowed for the accumulation of rapid evolutionary changes and the considerable expansion of subsets of the CRNs, as evidenced by CRN8 and its homologs. The occurrence of 10 predicted CRN8 paralogs and many additional pseudogenes, all of which carry a highly conserved D2 kinase domain, suggests that the kinase activity of CRN8 is important for <italic>P. infestans</italic> CRN proteins are modular, and recombination of different domains generates an array of chimeric proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that the CRN8 C-terminus, the kinase domain, has evolved separately from its N-terminal domains. Additionally, this D2 kinase domain segregates into two separate phylogenetic clusters which correspond to the different <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, <italic>P. infestans</italic> and <italic>P. ramorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that the expansion of the CRN8 family in the <italic>P. infestans</italic> lineage occurred after its divergence from <italic>P. ramorum</italic>. Indeed, the <italic>P. infestans</italic> paralogs carry only 11 non-synonymous polymorphisms in the D2 kinase domain, a level of polymorphism consistent with recent duplication.</p>
      <p>We discovered that CRN8 is an active kinase capable of triggering cell death even in the absence of an intact catalytic site. With the exception of the CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> double mutant, mutations that disrupted kinase activity did not alter cell death induction. Previously, we found that cell death induction by the CRN8 protein depends on its nuclear localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Schornack2">[42]</xref>. The absence of CRN8 cell death induction by the CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> is not due to its mislocalisation. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002875.s004">Figure S3</xref> we show that YFP tagged CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> still localizes to the plant nucleus. Therefore, disruption of the kinase activity does not interfere with CRN8 nuclear localization. Interestingly, we were able to show that CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> displayed a dominant negative phenotype. Co-expression of CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> with CRN8 resulted in a significant reduction of CRN8-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and <italic>P. infestans</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). The dominant-negative effect attributed to CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> can be accounted for by the destabilization of wild type CRN8 we observed when CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> and CRN8 were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar antagonistic interference has been noted for other kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Shpak1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Wang1">[51]</xref>, such as the mammalian Ser/Thr kinase, Akt, an important regulator of cell survival and cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Staal1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Brazil1">[53]</xref>. Co-expression of an inactive Akt kinase mutant inhibited both cell proliferation and apoptopic response in tumor cells expressing the active Akt kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Jetzt1">[46]</xref>. Dominant-negative effects have also been documented for plant pathogen effectors, e.g. the effect of truncated derivatives HopM1 to the HopM1 effector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Nomura1">[54]</xref>. <italic>In planta</italic> expression of the tyrosine phosphatase HopAO1, a Type III secreted effector of the bacterium <italic>P. syringae</italic>, increases bacterial virulence. Expression of the catalytically inactive form, HopAO1<sup>C378S</sup>, interferes specifically with the function of wild type HopAO1 delivered by <italic>P. syringae</italic> by reducing its virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Underwood1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We observed that <italic>in planta</italic> expression of CRN8, prior to the onset of cell death, increased virulence of <italic>P. infestans</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). <italic>P. infestans</italic> is a hemibiotroph that colonizes living plant cells before proliferating on dead plant tissue. Our experiment suggests that CRN8 may contribute to virulence during the biotrophic phase. In addition to CRN8 and other CRNs, several bacterial Type III secretion system effectors and RXLR effectors are known to trigger tissue necrosis, browning, and chlorosis when ectopically expressed in plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Haas1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Cunnac1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Oh1">[55]</xref>. The biological relevance of nonspecific cell death promotion by these effectors remains unclear as discussed by Cunnac et al., 2009 and Oh et al. 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Cunnac1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Oh1">[55]</xref>. The promotion of cell death was proposed to reflect an excessive virulence activity on one or more effector targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Cunnac1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Oh1">[55]</xref>. This view is consistent with the finding that CRN8 can enhance virulence prior to the appearance of visible cell death symptoms.</p>
      <p>The finding that heterologous expression of CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> reduces <italic>P. infestans</italic> virulence raises the possibility of using this mutant to engineer enhanced resistance to late blight in potato and tomato. Heterologous expression of CRN8 and its various mutants in <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, tomato (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002875.s003">Figure S2</xref>) a host of <italic>P. infestans</italic> showed similar results of cell death induction as was shown by heterologous expression of CRN8 and the CRN8 mutants in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. By creating plants that constitutively express the dominant negative form of CRN8, invading <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains that rely on the delivery of active CRN8 may be unable to effectively colonize their host. Our <italic>P. infestans</italic> virulence assays, show a promising restriction in pathogen spread when CRN8<sup>R469A;D470A</sup> is expressed <italic>in planta</italic>. Nonetheless, it remains to be determined whether these results will translate into enhanced resistance under field conditions.</p>
      <p>Many questions remain about to the mode of action of CRN8 during infection. Does CRN8 act as a kinase, as a substrate, or as part of a complex, or possibly all of the above? CRN8 is likely to auto-phosphorylate, but which plant proteins are targeted and trans-phosphorylated by CRN8? In addition, CRN8 could target and activate plant kinases by forming a complex independent of CRN8 trans-phosphorylation. In the future, identification of CRN8 plant targets will result in a better understanding of how this effector contributes to virulence.</p>
      <p>We cannot formally rule out that plant kinases are present in our CRN8 kinase detection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002875-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002875.s003">Figure S2</xref>). However, this is unlikely because mutations in the active sites R469 and D470 abolished the detected kinase activity. We have also subjected the CRN8 immunoprecipitates, both complete mixture and excised gel fragments, to LC-MS/MS for protein composition and detection of secondary modifications and failed to identify additional proteins. Given that we have not identified other phosphorylated proteins by LC-MS/MS we conclude that the measured kinase activity is mainly due to CRN8.</p>
      <p>We identified kinase-like proteins with similarity to CRN8 in the genomes of Arabidopsis, grape, poplar, and several other plant species (MvD and SK, unpublished). Given that kinases, including CRN8, often form dimers and heterodimers, it is possible that CRN8 heterodimerizes with plant kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Pelech1">[45]</xref>, influencing their proper activation and subsequent cellular activities. CRN8 might also mimic these plant kinases and target the substrates of the CRN8-like plant kinases. Kinases with closely-related catalytic domains tend to be similar in overall structural topology, have similar modes of regulation, and have similar substrate specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Pelech1">[45]</xref>. Plant pathogen effectors that mimic host proteins are well-known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Hogenhout1">[5]</xref>. One example of pathogen mimicry of a plant protein is the bacterial effector AvrPtoB, which is thought to mimic a substrate of a conserved plant kinase, leading to the enhanced activity of host plant kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Xiao1">[56]</xref>. Another example is the secreted kinase from the animal parasitic bacterium <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, YpkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Galyov1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Prehna1">[57]</xref>. YpkA possesses a domain that binds to the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1. This YpkA domain mimics host guanidine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for the Rho family of small GTPases and as such, <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> utilize the Rho GTPases for unique activities during their interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002875-Dukuzumuremyi1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, we describe the first plant pathogen effector, CRN8, that encodes a functional kinase domain. The next challenge is to determine the mechanism by which CRN8 functions inside plant cells, which plant process does it ‘hijack’ to interfere with plant immunity. Our study is the first step towards understanding how this secreted kinase effector perturbs the complex kinase signaling network that modulates plant immunity.</p>

PVDF membranes were incubated and washed between different incubation steps with TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7,5 150 mM NaCl+0.1% Tween). Monoclonal α-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a primary antibody at 1∶8000 (in 5% milk), and anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a secondary antibody at a 1∶20,000 dilution. For GFP immunoblots, monoclonal α-GFP (Invitrogen) was used as a primary antibody at 1∶4000, and anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a secondary antibody (1∶12,000 dilution). Blots were developed using the Pierce Horseradish Peroxidase detection kit (Thermo Scientific) and exposed for 2 min on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). Blots were stained with Coomassie (Instant Blue, Expedeon) to visualize protein loading.</p>

        <title>Protein purification</title>
        <p>Proteins were extracted from plant material as described above and immuno-purified by FLAG or GFP affinity chromatography. For FLAG immuno-purification: 2.0 ml of extracted protein was incubated with 50 µl anti-FLAG M2 affinity matrix (Sigma) and rotated for 1.5 hr at 4°C followed by 5× wash (centrifuge 30 seconds at 800× g) with 1 ml 50 mM Tris/HCl. Proteins were eluted with 100 µl IP buffer containing 3 µl of 3xFLAG peptide (150 ng/µl), in 97 µl 50 mM Tris/HCl for 30 minutes, shaking gently at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged for 1 minute at 16,000× g and supernatants were saved for either kinase assays or in gel analysis. For the GFP immuno-purification: 1.5 ml of extracted protein were incubated with 20 µl GFP affinity matrix (Chromotek) and rotated for 4 hr at 4°C followed by 5× wash (1 ml TBS+0.5% NP-40) and centrifugation (0.5× g) to pellet beads. 40 µl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer was added and samples were denatured for 5 minutes at a 95°C boil.</p>

Carbiodomethylation of cysteine residues was specified as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine and phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues were allowed as variable modifications. Other Mascot (version 2.3) parameters: mass values were monoisotopic and the protein mass unrestricted, the peptide mass tolerance was 5 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance: ±0.6 Da, two missed cleavages were allowed with trypsin. A second Mascot search was performed allowing ‘error tolerant’ modification of all robustly identified proteins from the previous round. All Mascot searches were collated and verified using Scaffold (Proteome Software) and the subset database was searched using X! Tandem (The Global Proteome Machine Organization Proteomics Database and Open Source Software; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thegpm.org" xlink:type="simple">www.thegpm.org</ext-link>). Accepted proteins passed the following threshold in Scaffold: 95% protein confidence, with minimum of two unique peptides at 95% confidence.</p>
