        <p>Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of viral restriction factors that inhibit the entry processes of several pathogenic viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we report that IAV-infected knockout mice lacking the <italic>Ifitm</italic> locus on chromosome 7 exhibited accelerated disease progression, greater mortality, and higher pulmonary and systemic viral burdens as compared to wild type controls. We further observed that the phenotype of <italic>Ifitm3</italic>-specific knockout mice was indistinguishable from that of mice lacking the entire <italic>Ifitm</italic> locus. Ifitm3 was expressed by IAV target cells including alveolar type II pneumocytes and tracheal/bronchial respiratory epithelial cells. Robust Ifitm3 expression was also observed in several tissues in the absence of infection. Among murine <italic>Ifitm</italic> promoters, only that of <italic>Ifitm3</italic> could be induced by type I and II interferons. Ifitm3 could also be upregulated by the gp130 cytokines IL-6 and oncostatin M on cells expressing appropriate receptors, suggesting that multiple cytokine signals could contribute to Ifitm3 expression in a cell or tissue-specific manner.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The human genome contains many genes devoted to combating viral infections. Some of these genes encode a family of proteins called interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins which were recently discovered to inhibit infection by influenza A viruses in cell culture experiments. Here we show that genetically engineered mice lacking the murine equivalents of the human <italic>IFITM</italic> genes are more susceptible to influenza than mice with a full complement of these genes. In addition, deletion of one of these genes alone, <italic>Ifitm3</italic>, made mice equally susceptible to infection, showing that the Ifitm3 protein plays a central role in the control of influenza A virus in living animals. We also show that murine Ifitm proteins are expressed on cells targeted by influenza A viruses and that the control of their expression in animals is more complex than suggested by previous cell culture studies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of small transmembrane proteins that mediate some of the antiviral activities of type I and II interferons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Schoggins1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Brass1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Shapira1">[3]</xref>. IFITM-mediated restriction is specific to particular virus families. Influenza A viruses (IAV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue virus, and West Nile virus are all efficiently restricted by one or more IFITM family proteins. Conversely, IFITM proteins do not restrict murine leukemia virus (MLV), a range of alphaviruses, and arenaviruses including Machupo virus (MACV), Lassa virus (LASV), and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Brass1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Jiang1">[5]</xref>. Vesicular stomatitis virus is inefficiently restricted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Weidner1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Alber1">[7]</xref>. Two groups have reported cell line-specific restriction of HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Schoggins1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Lu1">[8]</xref>, but these reports differ as to which cell lines show efficient restriction. Restriction activity against non-enveloped viruses has not been reported to date.</p>
      <p>The mechanism of action of IFITM-mediated restriction has not yet been determined. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that restriction occurs after virion endocytosis but during or prior to membrane fusion. IFITM proteins prevent infection by retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins of IFITM-restricted viruses, but not those pseudotyped with entry proteins of unrestricted viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang1">[4]</xref>. Entry assays using virions containing β-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) fusion proteins likewise reveal that IFITM proteins prevent transfer of BlaM-Vpr to the cytosol of target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Lu1">[8]</xref>. Previously, we showed by fluorescent microscopy that labeled IAV virions are internalized normally and traffic to acidified endocytic compartments despite IFITM expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang1">[4]</xref>, a conclusion confirmed and extended by Feely et al. using a rigorous set of imaging studies. They further demonstrated by fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization that IFITM proteins cause sequestration and accumulation of IAV genetic material in late endocytic/lysosomal compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Feeley1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>IFITM proteins also localize to late endosomes/lysosomes as demonstrated by co-localization with LAMP1, LAMP2, and CD63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang1">[4]</xref>. Moreover, IFITM protein over-expression – and in some cell lines, interferon treatment – results in enlargement of these organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Feeley1">[9]</xref>. Finally, a recent report showed that endosomes in interferon-treated <italic>Ifitm</italic> knockout cells are inefficiently acidified and suggested that a physical association between Ifitm3 and a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase complex mediates this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Wee1">[10]</xref>. It appears, therefore, that IFITM proteins alter the properties of late endosomes and lysosomes, and render these organelles inhospitable to viral fusion. Such a model is supported by the pattern of IFITM-mediated restriction; excepting HIV-1, restricted viruses generally fuse late in the endocytic pathway whereas unrestricted viruses fuse at the plasma membrane or in early endocytic compartments. Further evidence that restriction depends on the site of viral fusion comes from investigation of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV requires lysosomal cathepsins to activate its entry protein and fuse with the lysosomal membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang2">[11]</xref>. Treating receptor-bound virions with trypsin, however, removes this cathepsin dependency, induces fusion at the plasma membrane, and bypasses IFITM-mediated entry restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Most vertebrates have two or more <italic>IFITM</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Hickford1">[12]</xref>. The human <italic>IFITM</italic> family is composed of four functional genes, <italic>IFITM1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>. Murine <italic>Ifitm1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>, located on chromosome 7, are clear orthologs of their human counterparts but mice possess two additional loci: <italic>Ifitm6</italic>, also located on chromosome 7, and <italic>Ifitm7</italic>, a retrogene on chromosome 16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Lange1">[13]</xref>. The proteins expressed by these genes restrict influenza A virus (IAV), filovirus, flavivirus, and SARS coronavirus entry <italic>in vitro</italic> with varying efficiencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Huang1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Weidner1">[6]</xref>. <italic>Ifitm5</italic> expression is limited to bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Moffatt1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Hanagata1">[15]</xref>, and the roles of <italic>Ifitm6</italic> and <italic>7</italic> are not yet clear. Two strains of knockout mice were used in the following experiments. <italic>IfitmDel</italic> mice lack <italic>Ifitm1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>6</italic> and <italic>Ifitm3egfp</italic> mice lack <italic>Ifitm3</italic> alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Lange1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The aim of the present study was to determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> contribution of the Ifitm proteins to the innate immune control of IAV. We show that Ifitm3 alone makes a significant contribution to the control of influenza in mice and provide further insight into its expression and regulation.</p>

        <title>Murine Ifitm proteins are protective against influenza <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of Ifitm proteins, we challenged cohorts of <italic>IfitmDel</italic>, wild type, and heterozygous male mice with intranasal doses of either 500 or 1000 PFU of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8). In accordance with institutional policies, mice were considered moribund and euthanized upon loss of 20% of initial body weight, defined as the 2-day average of their pre-inoculation weights. At both challenge doses, knockout mice exhibited significantly accelerated disease progression and mortality compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002909-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Heterozygotes had an intermediate phenotype. A modest but insignificant difference was observed in the mean survival time of knockout mice receiving each challenge dose, with mice receiving 1000 PFU surviving 0.7 days longer. With the 500 PFU challenge dose, two of five wild type animals survived acute infection but disease remained uniformly lethal in knockout mice. Weight loss at days 3 and 5 was significantly increased in <italic>IfitmDel</italic> and heterozygous animals as compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002909-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; plots of body weight in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>

            <p><italic>IfitmDel</italic> knockout mice challenged intranasally with either 1000 or 500 PFU of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) exhibited more rapid disease progression and higher mortality than wild type and heterozygous controls. (<bold>A</bold>) At 1000 PFU, a survival analysis between wild type and knockout animals showed significant differences (p = 0.0067, Mantel-Cox test) in survival time as did a comparison of wild type and heterozygous mice (p = 0.0266). With a 500 PFU challenge, survival differences between all pairs of groups were statistically significant: wild type and knockout (p = 0.0011), wild type and heterozygous (p = 0.0366), heterozygous and knockout (p = 0.0012). At both challenge doses, heterozygous animals exhibited an intermediate phenotype consistent with a gene dosage requirement for the antiviral effects of <italic>Ifitm</italic>. (<bold>B</bold>) Weight loss measurements from all surviving study animals at 3 and 5 DPI are shown. Closed symbols represent animals challenged with 1000 PFU and open symbols represent animals challenged with 500 PFU. At both time points, weight loss differences between any two genotypes were statistically significant (Mann Whitney U test). Bars show mean ± SEM. (<bold>C</bold>) Pulmonary and systemic viral loads were measured at 3 DPI from animals challenged with 500 PFU of PR8. The relative abundance of IAV M2 transcript levels from total lung or spleen RNA, normalized to endogenous <italic>Gapdh</italic> transcript, is shown. Values represent fold changes relative to the mean viral burden of wild type mice. Pulmonary viral loads were 2.7-fold higher in knockout than in wild type controls (p = 0.0159, Mann Whitney U test). Error bars show mean ± SEM. Splenic viral loads were 15.9-fold greater in knockout than wild type animals (p = 0.0079), but splenic viral loads of wild type animals were barely above the detection threshold of the assay. Splenic viral loads of heterozygotes were not significantly different from those of wild type or knockout animals but a non-significant trend was evident across all three genotypes.</p>

        <p>Weight loss in wild type animals receiving a 500 PFU challenge followed trends reported by other investigators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Price1">[16]</xref>. Price et al. found that mice generally maintained body weight until day 4–5 post-infection, after which they underwent a rapid period of weight loss that continued until day 8–9. The rapid clinical progression beginning on day 4–5 coincided with the onset of cellular and humoral immunity while recovery on day 8–9 corresponded to clearance of the virus. In contrast to wild type animals, <italic>IfitmDel</italic> mice began a steep decline in weight beginning on day 2 consistent with a failure of innate control of early infection. The variability in the rate of disease progression of knockout mice was also far lower than that of both wild type and heterozygous animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). These results demonstrate that Ifitm proteins mediate innate immunity to influenza A virus during acute infection and that the effect of their deletion is powerful enough to overwhelm other sources of experimental variation. The intermediate phenotype of heterozygous animals shows that gene dosage is important for Ifitm protein-mediated viral restriction. The requirement for high gene dosage may also explain the duplication of the <italic>Ifitm</italic> alleles observed in multiple species.</p>

        <title>Viral loads are higher in infected <italic>IfitmDel</italic> knockout mice</title>
        <p>Viral loads were measured in a separate cohort of mice euthanized three days after infection, the period during which body weights of wild type and <italic>IfitmDel</italic> animals diverge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Weight loss trends in this cohort of animals were similar to those of previous cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Viral loads, as assessed by real-time RT-PCR of lung RNA, were 2.7-fold higher on average (p = 0.0159) in <italic>IfitmDel</italic> mice as compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002909-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Differences in splenic viral loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002909-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) were similarly increased (15.9-fold, p = 0.0079).</p>
        <p>Although the relative difference in splenic viral loads was high, IAV genome copy numbers in the spleen were on the order of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> times lower than those in the lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) and genome expression in the spleens of wild type animals was barely above the detection threshold of our assay. Similarly, we did not identify splenic lesions or any other lesions beyond those in the lungs, trachea, and nasal passages, consistent with the dependence of PR8 hemagglutinin on respiratory proteases for cleavage and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Klenk1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-GarcaSastre1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Sun1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Bottcher1">[20]</xref>. We therefore speculate that increased splenic viral loads in knockout mice are a result of more robust infection in the lung and subsequent leakage of virus or viral debris into the periphery.</p>

        <title><italic>Ifitm3</italic>-specific and <italic>IfitmDel</italic> knockout mice are equally susceptible to IAV infection</title>
        <p>Previously, we reported that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <italic>IfitmDel</italic> knockout mice are highly susceptible to IAV and that both baseline and interferon-induced Ifitm protein expression contribute to the IAV resistance in wild type MEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Brass1">[2]</xref>.

We confirmed this observation in the context of <italic>IfitmDel</italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s002">Figure S2A</xref>); again murine Ifitm3 demonstrated the most potent IAV restriction activity regardless of HA type, likely in part due to its higher steady-state expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s002">Figures S2B and S2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ifitm3 expression is both cell-type and cytokine dependent</title>
        <p>Because the <italic>Ifitm3</italic> promoter is sensitive to interferon signaling we reasoned that other Jak/STAT-mediated cytokines might likewise induce Ifitm3 expression. We tested the ability of a type III interferon (IFNλ2), the acute phase cytokine IL-6, and oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine released from activated dendritic cells that synergizes with type I interferon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Larrea1">[21]</xref>, to upregulate Ifitm3 expression. The latter two molecules belong to a diverse family of cytokines that signal through hetero- or multimeric receptors that activate the Jak/STAT pathway via a common gp130 subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Silver1">[22]</xref>. Consistent with previous studies, type I and type II interferons induced Ifitm3 expression in both NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts, and the murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. IFNλ2 was ineffective, likely due to lack of the appropriate receptor. In 3T3 cells, however, oncostatin M (OSM) induced strong Ifitm3 expression and IL-6 was a potent inducer of Ifitm3 expression and in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002909-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The ability of these two cytokines to modulate Ifitm3 expression correlated with the surface expression of their cognate receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002909-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and was not due to increased expression of type I or II interferons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002909.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These data raise the possibility that other gp130-mediated cytokines such as IL-11, IL-27, and LIF could modulate basal and inducible <italic>Ifitm3</italic> expression in cells bearing appropriate receptors. Furthermore, they indicate greater specificity and complexity in the regulation of <italic>Ifitm3</italic> expression, and possibly other interferon-stimulated genes, than previous studies have implied.</p>

        <p>While this manuscript was under review, Everitt et al. published data showing that <italic>Ifitm3</italic>-specific knockout mice are more susceptible to infection with influenza A virus X31 (H3N2) than wild type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002909-Everitt1">[26]</xref>. They also identified and characterized a polymorphism in human <italic>IFITM3</italic> associated with reduced restriction activity and found an increased prevalence of this mutant allele in patients hospitalized for influenza. Our data support and extend the core conclusions of their mouse studies. We further show that mice lacking entire <italic>Ifitm</italic> locus exhibit a nearly identical disease course to those lacking <italic>Ifitm3</italic> alone, and that their respective heterozygote littermates exhibit a phenotype intermediate between knockout and wild type mice. Morever, Ifitm3 is expressed on key IAV target cells in the lungs, and among murine Ifitms, is uniquely induced by type I and II interferons. Collectively these data make clear a primary role for Ifitm3 in the control of influenza A virus in mice.</p>
        <p>We also show that many tissues express basal levels of Ifitm3 proteins, and that at least two gp130-family cytokines – OSM and IL-6 – can induce its expression, even in the absence of an interferon response. These results suggest greater complexity in the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of other well-characterized interferon-stimulated genes as well. We further noted Ifitm3 expression in cell populations that are not major IAV targets such as macrophages and endothelial cells. This implies that <italic>Ifitm3</italic> deletion will likely enhance susceptibility to infections by monocyte-tropic flaviviruses and macrophage- and endotheliotropic filoviruses.</p>
        <p>Our results may also have implications for treatment of viral infections. The fact that Ifitm3 expression can be induced by gp130-mediated cytokines may allow for modulation of its expression in a more targeted, less pleiotropic way by agonizing or antagonizing cell type-specific gp130 heterodimeric receptors. More generally, our findings suggest that pharmacologic induction of human IFITM3 expression or emulation of IFITM3 activity could provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach to the treatment of a range of human pathogenic viruses.</p>
