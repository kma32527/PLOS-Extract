        <p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium that replicates within human alveolar macrophages by evasion of the host endocytic pathway through the formation of a replicative vacuole. Generation of this vacuole is dependent upon the secretion of over 275 effector proteins into the host cell via the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4SS). The type IV coupling protein (T4CP) subcomplex, consisting of DotL, DotM, DotN, IcmS and IcmW, was recently defined. DotL is proposed to be the T4CP of the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> T4SS based on its homology to known T4CPs, which function as inner-membrane receptors for substrates. As a result, DotL is hypothesized to play an integral role(s) in the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> T4SS for the engagement and translocation of substrates. To elucidate this role, a genetic approach was taken to screen for <italic>dotL</italic> mutants that were unable to survive inside host cells. One mutant, <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop, did not interact with the type IV adaptor proteins IcmS/IcmW (IcmSW) leading to the identification of an IcmSW-binding domain on DotL. Interestingly, the <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop mutant was competent for export of one class of secreted effectors, the IcmSW-independent substrates, but exhibited a specific defect in secretion of IcmSW-dependent substrates. This differential secretion illustrates that DotL requires a direct interaction with the type IV adaptor proteins for the secretion of a major class of substrates. Thus, by identifying a new target for IcmSW, we have discovered that the type IV adaptors perform an additional role in the export of substrates by the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm T4SS.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Many pathogens are able to survive and grow within eukaryotic host cells. One such pathogen, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, is able to replicate within macrophages, resulting in a form of pneumonia called Legionnaires' Disease. One key to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>'s capacity to cause disease is its ability to translocate several hundred proteins into the host cell. These proteins, typically referred to as “effectors”, function to alter the host cell to create a hospitable environment for the bacteria. <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors are exported by a specialized export apparatus, which is encoded by the <italic>dot/icm</italic> genes. However, the mechanism of secretion for these substrates is poorly understood. It is known that a subset of these effectors requires assistance from the type IV adaptor proteins IcmS and IcmW for transport out of the bacterium. It has been shown that IcmSW binds adaptor-dependent secreted proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm prior to their export. Here we report that DotL, an inner membrane component of the Dot/Icm secretion system, also binds IcmSW and this interaction is required for the export of adaptor-dependent substrates. This defines a new role for the type IV adaptors IcmSW and furthers our understanding of how <italic>Legionella</italic> exports substrates into its host cell.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterium that is able to survive and replicate in freshwater protozoa and in human alveolar macrophages, where its proliferation can result in a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' Disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-McDade1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Fields1">[3]</xref>. Following entry into the host cell, the <italic><underline>L</underline>egionella</italic> <underline>c</underline>ontaining <underline>v</underline>acuole (LCV) evades the host endocytic pathway and avoids fusion with the bactericidal lysosomes. Concurrently, it forms a protective niche by recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, including associated markers such as Sec22b and Rab1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Isberg1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Hubber1">[5]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is dependent on the translocation of at least two hundred seventy-five effector proteins into the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Burstein1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Zhu1">[11]</xref>. Deciphering the specific functions of individual substrates has been hampered by the lack of detectable homology of many of the effectors to known toxins and the apparent functional redundancy among the substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Isberg1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Hubber1">[5]</xref>. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action for some substrates have been determined and they include activities such as recruitment and activation of Arf1 and Rab1 at the LCV, subsequent inactivation of Rab1, prevention of LCV acidification, up-regulation of the NF-κB pathway, interference with host cell pro-apoptotic pathways among others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Hubber1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Ge1">[12]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Secretion of these proteins is dependent upon a large class of genes called <italic>dot</italic> (<underline>d</underline>efect in <underline>o</underline>rganelle <underline>t</underline>rafficking) and <italic>icm</italic> (<underline>i</underline>ntra<underline>c</underline>ellular <underline>m</underline>ultiplication defect) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vogel1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Segal1">[14]</xref>. The <italic>dot/icm</italic> genes encode a large, membrane-spanning apparatus that is classified as a type IVB secretion system (T4SS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Christie1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Nagai1">[16]</xref>. The Dot/Icm T4SS is made up of twenty-seven proteins that include two large subcomplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>. The first is called the transmembrane subcomplex and includes the inner membrane proteins DotF(IcmG) and DotG(IcmE), the presumed outer membrane pore DotH(IcmK) and two associated outer membrane lipoproteins DotC and DotD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent1">[17]</xref>. The second sub-assembly, the DotL T4CP subcomplex, is made up of DotL(IcmO), DotM(IcmP), DotN(IcmJ), IcmS and IcmW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>DotL is of particular interest because it has been proposed to function as the type IV coupling protein (T4CP) for the <italic>Legionella</italic> Dot/Icm secretion system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Buscher1">[19]</xref>. T4CPs are inner membrane components of T4SSs, they are known to interact with substrates prior to their secretion and with other membrane proteins of the T4SSs, thus “coupling” substrates to the T4SS apparatus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Fronzes1">[20]</xref>). In addition, they contain a Walker box motif for ATP hydrolysis and are believed to provide energy to actively drive the export of substrates across the inner and outer membranes of the bacterial cell wall.</p>
      <p>The DotL T4CP subcomplex includes four other proteins in addition to DotL. Although DotM and DotN lack homology to well conserved T4SS components, they are known to associate with the inner membrane and are required to stabilize DotL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent1">[17]</xref>. In contrast, more is known about IcmS and IcmW (IcmSW). These are two small, acidic proteins that interact to form a heterodimer pair and have been called type IV adaptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent3">[21]</xref>. They have been shown to bind to a subset of Dot/Icm substrates and are required for their export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Coers1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Habyarimana1">[28]</xref>. Based on these properties, IcmSW appear to function similarly to the well-characterized T3SS specialized secretion chaperones.</p>
      <p>Based on DotL's similarity to T4CPs, we hypothesized that DotL performs an integral role in substrate secretion. To determine DotL's role(s) in effector translocation, a collection of <italic>dotL</italic> mutants that were defective for the intracellular growth of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> were isolated. Characterization of one <italic>dotL</italic> mutant elucidated a specific interaction with one component of the Dot/Icm T4SS and revealed novel information about the differential mechanism of secretion of IcmSW-dependent and IcmSW-independent substrates by the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> type IV secretion system.</p>

        <title>Isolation of DotL mutants with an intracellular growth defect</title>
        <p>To ascertain DotL's role in the export of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> T4SS substrates, we isolated a collection of <italic>dotL</italic> mutants that were unable to replicate inside <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic>. However, this was challenging as an easy and unbiased method to select for <italic>dot/icm</italic> mutants that are replication incompetent within host cells did not currently exist. In addition, the most common null mutants consist of proteins that are not stable, which would not be useful for structure-function analysis. Therefore, to eliminate unstable proteins we exploited a unique property of <italic>dotL</italic>, known as Δ<italic>dotL</italic> lethality, that exists in the <italic>Legionella</italic> strain Lp02 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Buscher1">[19]</xref>. In this strain background, <italic>dotL</italic> is not only essential for growth within host cells but, unlike most other <italic>dot/icm</italic> genes, is also required for growth on bacteriologic media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Buscher1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent4">[29]</xref>. Since these traits are not linked, it was possible to first select for clones from an error-prone PCR generated <italic>dotL</italic> library that were able to complement Δ<italic>dotL</italic> lethality, thus ensuring that they made stable, functional DotL protein. Subsequently, the library was screened for clones that failed to complement a <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Δ<italic>dotL</italic> mutant for growth within amoebae.</p>
        <p>Based on this strategy, ∼100 <italic>dotL</italic> mutants with an intracellular growth defect were identified by a visual screen from a pool of 3800 plasmids. To eliminate clones with multiple mutations, the plasmids were sequenced revealing twelve <italic>dotL</italic> mutants that contained a single amino acid change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The mutants were distributed throughout the protein but none were identified in either the amino-terminal transmembrane domain of DotL or in the canonical Walker A box motif at amino acids 133–140 of DotL (<underline>G</underline>STGS<underline>GKT</underline>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Buscher1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Walker1">[30]</xref>. Eleven of the mutants contained a single amino acid change, while one resulted in a truncation of the C-terminus of DotL at amino acid 725 due to the insertion of a nonsense mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to validate our screen, the twelve <italic>dotL</italic> mutants were assayed for their ability to complement Δ<italic>dotL</italic> lethality and to express normal levels of DotL protein. Similar to a strain expressing wild-type <italic>dotL</italic>, each of the <italic>dotL</italic> mutants was able to restore viability to a Δ<italic>dotL</italic> mutant when grown on plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Likewise, each of the mutants restored DotL proteins levels in a Δ<italic>dotL</italic> mutant to that observed with wild-type <italic>dotL</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that expression of another Dot/Icm component, DotM, was not affected as DotL and DotM require each other for their own stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Therefore, based on these criteria, we conclude that our strategy successfully identified <italic>dotL</italic> mutants with an intracellular growth defect and that their attenuated growth phenotype was not due to reduced DotL or DotM levels.</p>

        <title>DotL plays a conserved role in intracellular growth</title>
        <p>The <italic>dotL</italic> mutants were originally identified as being defective for intracellular growth by a visual assessment at forty-eight hours. To measure the extent of their growth defect more precisely, the mutants were assayed for intracellular replication within <italic>A. castellanii</italic> by a quantitative growth curve. In this assay, both the wild-type strain Lp02 and a Δ<italic>dotL</italic> mutant expressing <italic>dotL</italic><sup>+</sup> from a plasmid grew approximately 3,000-fold over forty-two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, filled squares and inverted triangles). In contrast, a strain with a mutation in <italic>dotA</italic> that renders the T4SS non-functional (Lp03), was defective for intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, filled triangles). Similarly, none of the <italic>dotL</italic> mutants could complement the Δ<italic>dotL</italic> mutant for replication in <italic>A. castellanii</italic>, further validating our screen conditions (two representative mutants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and the remaining are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>–B).</p>
        <p>To examine if the <italic>dotL</italic> mutants were defective in other hosts, their ability to grow and replicate was assayed in mouse A/J bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Swanson1">[31]</xref> and in the human monocytic cell line U937 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Sundstrom1">[32]</xref>. Similar to amoebae, the wild-type strain Lp02 grew robustly in BMMs and in U937 cells, whereas the T4SS-deficient strain Lp03 was unable to grow in either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and data not shown). Likewise, all twelve of the <italic>dotL</italic> mutants exhibited a dramatic defect in their ability to replicate within BMM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>–D) and were attenuated for growth within U937 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the intracellular growth defect of the <italic>dotL</italic> mutants was not restricted to amoebae and occurred in a variety of host cells.</p>

        <title><italic>dotL</italic> mutants' interaction with other components of the Dot/Icm T4SS</title>
        <p>To identify the underlying molecular mechanism(s) for the <italic>dotL</italic> mutants' intracellular growth defect, their ability to assemble the DotL T4CP subcomplex was assessed. One novel feature of this subcomplex is the recruitment of the type IV adaptors IcmSW to the membrane, which can be assayed by membrane fractionation. As previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>, a significant proportion of the total cellular pool of IcmSW is targeted to the membrane in a wild-type strain, while a strain lacking <italic>dotL</italic> is defective for IcmSW-membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lanes 1–2). Measuring IcmSW recruitment in a strain lacking <italic>dotL</italic> had to be assessed in a suppressed background, such as Δ<italic>dotA</italic>, due to Δ<italic>dotL</italic> lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Buscher1">[19]</xref>, although the absence of <italic>dotA</italic> had no effect on targeting of IcmSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 3).

Proper fractionation of the samples was confirmed by localization of the cytoplasmic protein isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and the inner membrane protease LepB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). In conclusion, only the <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop mutant was defective for recruiting IcmSW to the inner membrane implying that the underlying cause of this mutant's intracellular growth defect may be due to the lack of interaction with the type IV adaptors.</p>

        <title>Identification of the IcmS/IcmW binding domain on DotL</title>
        <p>To further examine the relationship between these proteins, the IcmSW-binding region of DotL was mapped by defining the N-terminal and C-terminal boundaries of the domain followed by a “necessary &amp; sufficiency” test. The N-terminal boundary of the IcmSW-binding domain of DotL was determined by analyzing interactions between histidine tagged-IcmS/IcmW (His:SW) and a series of DotL truncations fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST:DotL). The His:SW heterodimer was recovered with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin and interaction with the GST:DotL fragments was monitored by immunoblot with a GST-specific antibody. In this analysis, the minimal DotL fragment that could bind IcmSW consisted of 113 amino acids from residues 671–783 of DotL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The interactions were specific as none of the GST:DotL fragments were recovered from reactions containing the empty His vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>) and the failure to see an interaction was not due to an inability to bind the Ni-NTA resin as His:SW was recoverable in all reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The C-terminal boundary of the IcmSW-binding domain of DotL was determined by assaying recruitment of IcmSW to the membrane as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Truncations of 10 to 30 amino acids did not affect IcmSW localization to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> with representative controls in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s005">Fig. S5C</xref>). In contrast, removal of the last 40 or 50 amino acids of DotL resulted in vastly diminished recruitment of IcmSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), although these constructs did express slightly decreased levels of DotL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s005">Fig. S5D</xref>), which could be partially responsible for their defect. Based on the above analysis, the N-terminal boundary of the IcmSW-binding domain on DotL begins around amino acid 671 and ends near amino acid 753. Deletion of this domain from wild-type DotL (removal of amino acids 671 to 753) resulted in no IcmSW recruitment to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), thus validating the mapped boundaries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further refine the binding domain, a necessary and sufficiency test was performed. A series of internal ten amino acid deletions were constructed throughout the mapped boundaries in full-length DotL. Only two deletions, one removing amino acids 730–739 and the other deleting amino acids 735–744, affected IcmSW binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), thus potentially identifying one domain necessary for the interaction between DotL and the adaptors. Since these deletions may affect the fold of this domain, we cannot conclude that DotL binds IcmSW directly via these residues. To further refine the binding domain(s), a set of larger deletions consisting of twenty amino acids revealed a potential second binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The first deletion, spanning amino acids 735–753, overlapped the domain identified with the smaller deletions. The second deletion, spanning amino acids 695–714, was located twenty amino acids closer to the N-terminus. Thus, there appears to be at least two critical domains within this region of DotL that are necessary for IcmSW recruitment to the membrane.</p>

        <p>Finally, we attempted to identify the minimal fragment of DotL sufficient to interact with IcmSW. The minimal fragment identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> consisted of 113 amino acids from residues 671 to 783. Although small deletions from the C-terminus of this fragment could bind IcmSW, larger deletions were unstable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s006">Fig. S6A</xref>). Therefore, a series of truncations were constructed using a slightly larger DotL fragment containing amino acids 661–783. Removal of 3 or 10 amino acids from the C-terminus of this fragment had no effect, whereas a deletion of 20 amino acids was partially defective and removal of the last 30 amino acids completely prevented DotL binding to IcmSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> with controls in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>–C). In summary, two DotL fragments consisting of 113 amino acids (671–783 or 661–773) were both fully sufficient to interact with IcmSW. Taken as a whole, we propose the minimal domain of DotL that is sufficient to interact with IcmSW likely consists of amino acids 671–773 and this includes two regions (695–714 and 730–753) that are critically important for the interaction (schematic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

        <p>The previous data mapped an IcmSW-binding domain on DotL, and strongly suggested that the connection was direct, but did not rule out the possibility that the interaction was mediated via an intermediate protein that binds both IcmSW and DotL. To eliminate the latter possibility, four different DotL fragments fused to GST were co-expressed with His:SW and subjected to a tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Puig1">[37]</xref>.

        <p>Three major bands, consisting of GST:DotL, IcmW, and His:IcmS, were recovered when using the DotL fragments 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Although three fainter bands were apparent (indicated with a bracket), they appeared to be GST:DotL degradation products based on a modest size shift consistent with the difference in size between fragments 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) and their detection in an anti-GST western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>). Strikingly, no protein was recovered when using fragments 3 or 4, which contain deletions of the IcmSW-binding domain. The failure to detect the DotL fragments from these reactions was likely caused by their inability to bind IcmSW, and not due to their instability or inability to bind the glutathione sepharose resin, since the fragments could be detected and purified if applied directly to the respective resin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>). Thus, tandem purification of GST:DotL and His:SW clearly demonstrates that the interaction between DotL and IcmSW is direct and is not mediated through Dot/Icm substrates, via other T4SS components such as DotM, or a conserved Gram-negative protein.</p>

        <title>The DotL IcmSW-binding site is not required for growth phase dependent destabilization</title>
        <p>Although it was clear that DotL could directly bind IcmSW through a domain near its C-terminus, the purpose of this interaction remained enigmatic. A connection between DotL and IcmS was previously observed where DotL became destabilized, due to proteolysis by the ClpAP protease, in a strain lacking <italic>icmS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, degradation of DotL occurred during the transition from exponential phase growth to stationary phase, a point concurrent with the expression of the majority of Dot/Icm substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Ninio3">[38]</xref>. This led to the hypothesis that DotL degradation could be a cellular response of clearing a “jammed” secretion apparatus, which was generated by a failed attempt to export a substrate that was in the wrong conformation due to the absence of IcmSW.</p>
        <p>To examine this theory, we compared the steady-state abundance of wild-type DotL with the DotLY725Stop mutant in the presence and absence of IcmS. As previously seen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>, DotL protein levels remain constant in Lp02 but DotL is destabilized in stationary phase in a Δ<italic>icmS</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Although the amount of the DotLY725Stop protein was unchanged compared to wild-type DotL in the presence of <italic>icmS</italic>, it did not decrease in the absence of the adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). One explanation for this result is that IcmSW function as a chaperone to stabilize a poorly folded domain on DotL, and when that domain is removed, DotL levels do not change in the presence or absence of IcmSW. Alternatively, since the <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop allele truncates the last 58 amino acids of the DotL protein, it might have simply removed the protease recognition site from DotL. Consistent with latter idea, ClpAP is known to be able to target proteins at either the N- or C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Baker1">[39]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To differentiate between these two possibilities, we examined if a <italic>dotL</italic> mutant that binds IcmSW, but lacks the last 10 amino acids of DotL, would no longer be degraded in a Δ<italic>icmS</italic> mutant. Similar to the <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop mutant, the <italic>dotL</italic>1-773 mutant (originally described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) had unaltered steady-state DotL protein levels in the presence or absence of IcmSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This strongly implied that the lack of destabilization of the DotLY725Stop mutant was not due to its inability to bind IcmSW but was due to the absence of a ClpAP recognition site within its C-terminus.</p>
        <p>Therefore, to more precisely probe the role of the IcmSW-binding site on DotL protein levels, we employed several of the <italic>dotL</italic> internal deletions that retain DotL's native C-terminus but cannot bind IcmSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast to the DotLY725Stop mutant, the DotL1–694/715–783 mutant proteins levels were not affected in the presence of IcmS but exhibited protein instability in the absence of IcmS similar to wild-type DotL protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, several other <italic>dotL</italic> mutants that cannot bind IcmSW exhibited a similar phenotype (data not shown). Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the IcmSW-binding domain on DotL is not involved in modulating DotL's protein levels. Rather, it suggests that DotL destabilization must be due to some other process, perhaps aberrant export of substrates through the Dot/Icm T4SS in the absence of the adaptors.</p>

        <p>In contrast to the IcmSW-dependent substrates, three IcmSW-independent substrates (RalF, LnaB, and LidA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Vincent2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Nagai2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Losick1">[42]</xref> were secreted at the same level in all strains, notably including the <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g007">Fig. 7D–F</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we extensively characterized one <italic>dotL</italic> mutant, <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop, which revealed that DotL directly binds to the type IV adaptors IcmSW via a domain that is located near the C-terminus of DotL. Removal of the IcmSW-binding domain from DotL did not prevent the assembly of a functional T4SS, nor did it affect the growth phase instability of DotL that occurs in the absence of IcmS. However, <italic>dotL</italic> mutants unable to bind IcmSW were defective specifically for the export of IcmSW-dependent substrates, thus revealing an additional role for the type IV adaptors in the translocation of a major class of Dot/Icm substrates into the cytoplasm of host cells.</p>
      <p>Although the IcmSW complex is critically important for the intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, the molecular role of these two proteins has remained elusive. Based on the type IV adaptors resemblance to type III secretion chaperones, including their small size, acidic nature, and ability to dimerize, it was initially proposed that IcmS and IcmW might function as chaperones to mediate the export of Dot/Icm substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Coers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Ninio1">[24]</xref>. It was subsequently shown that secretion of several substrates, including SdeA, SidG, SidH, and WipA, was more dependent on IcmSW than the substrate RalF, whose export was largely IcmSW-independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Bardill1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Ninio1">[24]</xref>. Moreover, consistent with their proposed role as secretion chaperones, several of the substrates that require IcmSW for their optimal export were also shown to bind IcmSW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Coers1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Cambronne1">[25]</xref>. Conversely, RalF does not require IcmSW for its export and was unable to bind to IcmSW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Coers1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Cambronne1">[25]</xref>. To date, 24 out of 34 Dot/Icm substrates examined require IcmS and/or IcmW for their export (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s010">Table S2</xref>). However, it is worth noting that this collection includes only a small fraction of the ∼300 known Dot/Icm substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Hubber1">[5]</xref>. In addition, only six substrates have been assayed for their ability to bind the type IV adaptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002910.s010">Table S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although a good correlation exists between these traits within this limited data set, it is not known how the adaptors mediate export by binding to IcmSW-dependent substrates. Direct binding of substrates by the type IV adaptors is reminiscent of one or more of the proposed roles performed by type III secretion chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Galan1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Fattori1">[44]</xref>. For example, IcmSW-binding of substrates could potentially stabilize or prevent aggregation of the substrates in the bacterial cytoplasm. Though, this does not appear to be a general task for the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> type IV adaptors as SidE family members and SidG are stable and do not aggregate in the absence of IcmSW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Bardill1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Cambronne1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, IcmSW could function to target substrates to the T4SS apparatus. However, IcmSW binds SidG at a location distinct from its C-terminal signal sequence and removal of the IcmSW-binding domain(s) allows SidG to be exported in type IV adaptor-independent manner, inconsistent with IcmSW functioning directly as a targeting factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Cambronne1">[25]</xref>. Instead Cambronne <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that the type IV adaptors might regulate secretion by preventing occlusion of the C-terminal signal sequence in a partially folded domain of the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Cambronne1">[25]</xref>. While this is a novel and interesting concept, no experimental evidence exists that IcmSW-dependent substrates fail to engage the T4SS apparatus in the absence of the type IV adaptors. In contrast, our data on DotL protein levels suggests that IcmSW-dependent substrates can interact with DotL in the absence of <italic>icmS</italic>, leading to the degradation of DotL.</p>
      <p>Therefore, IcmSW likely perform an alternative role in mediating export of many Dot/Icm substrates. Since IcmSW appear not to be required for targeting, and are not exported along with the Dot/Icm substrates, they likely act at the membrane complex perhaps by directly assisting in the export of the proteins. Consistent with this notion, we have now discovered that IcmSW bind directly to DotL and this interaction is critical for the export of IcmSW-dependent substrates. Precedence exists for an interaction between T3SS chaperones and their associated ATPases during targeting of substrates to the secretion apparatus. In addition, some T3SS chaperones are able to interact with their corresponding ATPase in the absence of their cognate substrate, although it is not clear why they interact nor has the interaction been shown to be required for secretion (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Galan1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Wilharm1">[45]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Therefore, taking all of the existing data into context, we propose a new model for the export of IcmSW-dependent substrates by the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm T4SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). In this unified model, IcmSW-dependent substrates are bound by the type IV adaptors in the cytoplasm in order to maintain the substrates in a translocation competent form. Substrates are targeted to the inner membrane via their C-terminal signal sequence and likely interact directly with the type IV coupling protein DotL. After the substrates engage the translocation apparatus, IcmSW need to be removed from the substrates and this may be mediated by transfer to the IcmSW-binding domain on DotL, perhaps while the substrates are being actively pumped out of the cell. Later, IcmSW would dissociate from DotL, disengage from the inner membrane, and transit back to the cytoplasm in order to interact with new substrates, thus completing an export cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). Although this model incorporates all of the existing data, and provides a reasonable explanation for how IcmSW could function while independently binding substrates and DotL, there are a number of potential caveats. For example, the model predicts a large amount of IcmSW would be required in the cell in order to bind the vast number of type IV-adaptor dependent substrates. This has not been experimentally established nor has the direct transfer of IcmSW from substrates to DotL.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Nevertheless, our working model allows us to speculate why IcmSW-dependent substrates are not exported in different mutant backgrounds that are compromised for type IV adaptor activity. For example, a strain that expresses a <italic>dotL</italic> mutant that is unable to bind IcmSW (<italic>dotL</italic><sup>−S/W</sup>) is not capable of exporting IcmSW-dependent substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). In this case, IcmSW-dependent substrates would still be bound by the adaptors and maintained in a translocation competent form. Since targeting is dependent on their C-terminal signal sequence, these substrates would still bind to inner membrane components of the T4SS. However, as the substrates engage the T4SS apparatus, the proposed transfer of IcmSW from the substrate onto DotL would fail because no acceptor site would be present. As a result, the substrate might be rejected from the apparatus, a result previously observed with T3SS substrates that are fused to proteins that are difficult to be unfolded such as DHFR and ubiquitin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002910-Sorg1">[46]</xref>). This model of rejection is consistent with our observation that DotL<sup>−S/W</sup> is not degraded in wild-type strains expressing IcmS.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the phenotypes associated with a Δ<italic>icmS</italic> mutant are more complicated because both IcmSW-dependent substrates and DotL would not bind the type IV adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002910-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). Although the <italic>dotL</italic><sup>−S/W</sup> mutant and a Δ<italic>icmS</italic> mutant are each unable to export IcmSW-dependent substrates, we propose that their molecular defects differ. In the case of a strain lacking <italic>icmS</italic>, IcmSW-dependent substrates would still interact with DotL via their C-terminal signal sequence, however they would not be in a translocation competent form due to the absence of the type IV adaptors. As a result, the substrates might engage the apparatus in an aberrant manner and become “jammed”. This would likely induce membrane stress resulting in removal of the DotL/substrate aggregate via the ClpAP protease, which would also be consistent with our results on DotL protein levels in the absence of <italic>icmS</italic>. Furthermore, this model predicts that substrates can interact with DotL in the absence of the type IV adaptors, thus supporting the idea that IcmSW do not perform a role in targeting of substrates to the Dot/Icm apparatus.</p>
      <p>By characterizing the <italic>dotL</italic>Y725Stop mutant, we discovered that DotL directly binds to the type IV adaptors and that the interaction is required for the specific export of IcmSW-dependent substrates. This mutant provides a key reagent for the future dissection of the role of IcmSW, as the phenotypes of the Δ<italic>icmS</italic> mutant are clearly pleiotropic. Moreover, as IcmSW-dependent substrates appear to constitute the major class of Dot/Icm proteins, understanding how <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> controls and regulates the secretion of several hundred proteins will be vital to understanding how this pathogen is able to replicate inside host cells and cause disease.</p>
