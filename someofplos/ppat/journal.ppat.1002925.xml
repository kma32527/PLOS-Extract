        <p>Finding bacterial cellular targets for developing novel antibiotics has become a major challenge in fighting resistant pathogenic bacteria. We present a novel compound, Relacin, designed to inhibit (p)ppGpp production by the ubiquitous bacterial enzyme RelA that triggers the Stringent Response. Relacin inhibits RelA <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduces (p)ppGpp production <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, Relacin affects entry into stationary phase in Gram positive bacteria, leading to a dramatic reduction in cell viability. When Relacin is added to sporulating <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells, it strongly perturbs spore formation regardless of the time of addition. Spore formation is also impeded in the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> that causes the acute anthrax disease. Finally, the formation of multicellular biofilms is markedly disrupted by Relacin. Thus, we establish that Relacin, a novel ppGpp analogue, interferes with bacterial long term survival strategies, placing it as an attractive new antibacterial agent.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The development of new antibacterial agents has become the major demand for fighting against pathogenic bacteria. The identification of new unexplored cellular targets in this combat is essential to prevent a possible return to the pre-antibiotic era. Traditional antibiotics target essential cellular components such as ribosomes and cell wall constituents, making them effective mostly during bacterial growth. However, the ability of bacteria to reside in nature at durable stages sets the need to cope with these alternative survival strategies. In this report, we present a novel antibiotic, termed Relacin, which targets the Stringent Response, a process required for the transition into stationary phase, crucial for bacterial survival. Relacin inhibits the abundant bacterial Rel enzymes that synthesize the signaling molecules required to activate the Stringent Response. We found that Relacin perturbs the switch into stationary phase in Gram positive bacteria and leads to cell death. Further, Relacin inhibits sporulation and biofilm formation, additional bacterial long term survival strategies. The ubiquity of Rel enzymes among bacteria, combined with the absence of known homologues in mammalian cells, strengthen the potential of Relacin to turn into a therapeutic antibiotic.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The emergence of multi drug resistant bacteria dictates the need to develop novel antibiotics that target key components of essential bacterial processes. The pleiotropic response to starvation, known as the Stringent Response, provides a potential target, as it is crucial for activation of survival strategies such as stationary phase, sporulation and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Jain1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Potrykus1">[4]</xref>. Further, the Stringent Response has been recently shown to mediate antibiotic tolerance in nutrient-limited bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>. The Stringent Response is induced by the accumulation of the bacterial signaling molecules 5′-triphosphate-3′-diphosphate and 5′-3′-bis-diphosphate, collectively called (p)ppGpp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Cashel1">[6]</xref>. Synthesis of (p)ppGpp has been characterized as a ribosome-dependent pyrophosphate transfer of the β and γ phosphates from an ATP donor to the 3′ hydroxyl group of GTP or GDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-CashelM1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In Gram negative bacteria (p)ppGpp is mostly synthesized by RelA and hydrolyzed by SpoT, while in Gram positive bacteria a bifunctional enzyme, Rel/Spo, both synthesizes and hydrolyses (p)ppGpp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Metzger1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wendrich1">[9]</xref>. Upon nutrient deprivation, Rel proteins bind to ribosomes blocked by uncharged tRNA and catalyze the synthesis of (p)ppGpp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wendrich2">[10]</xref>. It has been proposed that Rel proteins hop between stalled ribosomes in order to achieve the (p)ppGpp concentration required to induce the Stringent Response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wendrich2">[10]</xref>. A recent report, however, proposes that RelA actually synthesizes ppGpp only after it is dissociated from the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-English1">[11]</xref>. The Rel proteins comprise two major domains: a catalytic domain located in the N-terminus and a regulatory domain in the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Mechold1">[12]</xref>. Crystal structure analysis of the N-terminal domain of Rel/Spo from <italic>Streptococcus equisimilis</italic> (<italic>S. equisimilis</italic>) revealed two conformations with opposing hydrolase and synthetase states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Hogg1">[13]</xref>. Further, the N-terminal domain was found to harbor two catalytic subdomains: N-terminal which hydrolyses (p)ppGpp and C-terminal that catalyzes its synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Mechold1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When ppGpp accumulates within the bacterial cell it affects transcription and a plethora of physiological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Barker1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Vrentas1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, the activation of many stress-induced genes is partially or totally dependent on ppGpp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Gruber1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Magnusson1">[18]</xref>. The importance of (p)ppGpp as a regulator of bacterial survival prompted us to develop a series of non-hydrolyzable ppGpp analogues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wexselblatt1">[19]</xref> potentially targeting Rel proteins. Here we present Relacin, a potent inhibitor of Rel proteins. We demonstrate that Relacin inhibits RelA and Rel/Spo <italic>in vitro</italic> and impairs growth, sporulation and biofilm formation in Gram positive bacteria.</p>

        <p>Based on the Rel/Spo crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Hogg1">[13]</xref>, we designed Relacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), a 2′-deoxyguanosine-based analogue of ppGpp, in which the original pyrophosphate moieties at positions 5′ and 3′ were replaced by glycyl-glycine dipeptides linked to the sugar ring by a carbamate bridge (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s007">Text <italic>S1</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). Modeling the binding of Relacin to the Rel/Spo synthetase site shows that it occupies a considerable volume of the binding pocket and forms a range of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s001">Figure S1C</xref>), providing a structural basis for the inhibitory effect of Relacin.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To investigate the biological activity of Relacin, we first evaluated its inhibitory potential on the (p)ppGpp synthetase activity of RelA and Rel/Spo purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> (<italic>D. radiodurans</italic>), respectively. Relacin was shown to inhibit both Rel proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, at the highest Relacin concentration, the Rel enzymes from Gram negative and positive bacteria were inhibited by approximately 100% and 80%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Notably, the synthesis of ppGpp and pppGpp by both Rel proteins was similarly inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we examined the effect of Relacin on the interaction between Rel/Spo and stalled ribosomes. Ribosomes purified from <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> were incubated with Rel/Spo in the presence of increasing concentrations of Relacin, and the relative amount of Rel/Spo molecules associated with 70S complexes was examined. Western blot analysis revealed that Relacin increases the levels of Rel/Spo locked on the ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the presence of Relacin reduces the pool of protein molecules available for (p)ppGpp re-synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wendrich2">[10]</xref>. To further investigate whether ribosomes are actually required for Relacin activity, we took advantage of a RelA mutant protein (RelAC638F), which exerts its activity in a ribosome-independent manner. Relacin was equally able to inhibit the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating a direct Relacin-RelA interaction.</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relacin inhibits dissociation of Rel/Spo from the ribosome. The relative amount of Rel/Spo (<italic>D. radiodurans</italic>) bound to purified ribosomes was quantified following the addition of increasing levels of Relacin.

Shown is the average of duplicates of a representative experiment. Error bars represent the range.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We then examined the influence of Relacin on (p)ppGpp production in living cells upon induction of the Stringent Response. To this end, cells of the Gram positive spore forming bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<italic>B. subtilis</italic>) were incubated with Relacin and treated with serine hydroxamate (SHX) to simulate amino acid starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Gropp1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Tosa1">[21]</xref>. Subsequently, the accumulated levels of (p)ppGpp were monitored from cell extracts. In line with the inhibitory activity observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, Relacin markedly reduced (p)ppGpp production <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

        <title>Relacin reduces survival of Gram positive bacteria</title>
        <p>Having ascertained that Relacin affects the production of (p)ppGpp <italic>in vivo</italic> by <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells and given the vital role of the Stringent Response in bacterial survival, we investigated the impact of Relacin on cell growth and viability. Interestingly, in the presence of Relacin, cells exhibited an extended logarithmic phase as indicated by the increase in OD<sub>600</sub> values, implying that they failed to properly enter into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Of note, a similar phenomenon was observed for <italic>spoT</italic> null mutant of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Zhou1">[22]</xref>. This failure led to substantial dose-dependent cell death after 24 hours, with an estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of 200 µM, as monitored by the reduction in colony forming units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s003">S3</xref>). Moreover, after 48 hours the deleterious effect of Relacin persisted, reducing the number of colonies by approximately five orders of magnitude relative to untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). A similar viability pattern was observed in untreated <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells lacking Rel/Spo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that this enzyme is indeed the main target for Relacin action. Consistent with this observation, the survival of the mutant strain was not affected by the addition of Relacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, the effect of Relacin on survival is not likely to be dependent on spore formation, as only few spores, if any, were present in untreated cultures. On the other hand, the appearance of dead cells as well as disintegrated cells was largely increased within the treated population over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Consistent with the inability of Relacin to perturb (p)ppGpp production in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), no effect on growth and viability was detected in these cells.</p>

        <p>The biological activity of Relacin was further explored in non-spore-forming Gram positive bacteria. Treating the Group A streptococcus (GAS) with Relacin revealed that, although growth rate was only slightly affected, cell viability was largely reduced after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). This toxic effect was enhanced after 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and was associated with the formation of very small colonies. Additionally, as observed for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, entering stationary phase was perturbed by Relacin in the extremely slow growing bacterium <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).

        <title>Relacin perturbs long term survival strategies</title>
        <p>In addition to switching into stationary phase some bacteria, such as <italic>Bacilli</italic>, respond to nutrient limitation by producing highly resilient dormant spores as a strategy for long term survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Errington1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Stragier1">[25]</xref>. Entry into sporulation is triggered by a decrease in the intracellular GTP pools, in part due to conversion of GTP into (p)ppGpp by RelA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Lopez1">[26]</xref>. At the onset of sporulation, an asymmetric septum is generated, dividing the cell into a nurturing mother cell and a smaller forespore compartment that develops into a spore. Subsequently, the forespore is engulfed by the mother cell to form a fully mature spore. Remarkably, when nutrients become available the spore can rapidly convert into an actively growing cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Errington1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Stragier1">[25]</xref>. To explore whether Relacin affects sporulation, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells were induced to sporulate in the presence or absence of Relacin and sporulation progression was monitored by observing polar septa formation. Indeed, sporulation was largely inhibited, with asymmetric septa exhibited by only 8% and 0.5% of the cells treated with 200 µM and 1 mM of Relacin, respectively. In comparison, 47% of untreated cells displayed polar septa at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In line with these observations, Relacin lowered the number of cells expressing early (SpoIIE), middle (SpoIIQ) and late (SspE) sporulation-specific proteins along the process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Stragier1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s006">S6</xref>). Subsequently, a fivefold drop in the formation of mature heat resistant spores was measured at the highest Relacin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g004">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>). Remarkably, adding Relacin to sporulating cells at different time points, up to six hours after the induction of sporulation, strongly inhibited spore formation regardless of the time of addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These findings indicate that the ppGpp signal is crucial throughout the entire pathway of sporulation, and demonstrate the potency of Relacin to impede this process. Importantly, spore formation in the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, the causative agent of anthrax disease, was inhibited by Relacin in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), establishing the compound as a general inhibitor of the <italic>Bacilli</italic> sporulation process.</p>

        <p>Since it has been reported that <italic>relA</italic> mutant cells fail to properly form multicellular biofilm structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Lemos1">[2]</xref>, the effect of Relacin on the ability of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells to produce biofilms was evaluated. Indeed, a disrupted pellicle was visualized at the air/liquid interface of standing cell cultures grown in the presence of the compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, the effect on biofilm formation was found to be dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Relacin also inhibited the development of biofilm on solid medium, leading to the formation of colonies with altered morphology that were smaller in size than the untreated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

Moreover, staining the biofilm with propidium iodide (PI), indicative of unviable cells, showed the signal to be higher within the treated biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002925-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report, we established Relacin as a novel antibacterial agent. By specifically interfering with the activation of the Stringent Response, Relacin perturbs the switch into stationary phase in several tested Gram positive bacteria and leads to bacterial death. Although Relacin did not affect growth and survival of the Gram negative <italic>E. coli</italic>, it was found to effectively inhibit the <italic>E. coli</italic> RelA <italic>in vitro</italic>, implying that improving the delivery of Relacin to Gram negative bacteria may lead to an effective outcome. Relacin was found to block every tested stage of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation, proving the essentiality of the Stringent Response throughout this process. Finally, we demonstrate that Relacin affects the production of multicellular biofilm communities, formed in response to challenging conditions. Taken together, we present evidence that Relacin impedes bacterial long term survival pathways, placing the compound as a new promising antibacterial agent.</p>
      <p>By utilizing the crystal structure of Rel/Spo from the <italic>S. equisimilis</italic>, we were able to model the interaction of Relacin with amino acid residues located within the Rel/Spo synthetase site. This analysis yielded the identification of a putative binding mode of Relacin, presumably adopting the conformation shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002925.s001">Figure S1C</xref>. In this conformation, Relacin forms a net of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that are most likely to provide a more efficient binding in comparison to previously identified inhibitors exhibiting lower activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wexselblatt1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Relacin appears to specifically target Rel proteins, as the effect of the compound was nearly undetectable when tested on Rel/Spo mutant cells. Consistently, Relacin activity <italic>in vivo</italic> resulted in a sharp decrease in (p)ppGpp synthesis. Since ppGpp inhibits the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, it causes the cellular GTP levels to decrease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Ochi2">[28]</xref>. The intracellular levels of GDP/GTP are known to determine the initiation of several developmental pathways such as sporulation and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Lopez1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Hsueh1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-RatnayakeLecamwasam1">[30]</xref> that were indeed shown to be influenced by Relacin. Interestingly, we also observed that Relacin treatment resulted in a large decrease in Rel/Spo ability to dissociate from ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic>. This deficiency could be explained by the model proposed by Wendrich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Wendrich2">[10]</xref> in which the rapid accumulation of ppGpp during amino acid starvation is attributed to the ability of RelA to ‘hop’ between ribosomes. This potential hopping is probably a consequence of the synthesis of (p)ppGpp that releases RelA from the ribosome, liberating it for another synthesis cycle.</p>
      <p>The emergence of bacterial resistance to the current array of antimicrobial agents demands the development of novel strategies to eradicate pathogenic bacteria. The traditional cellular antibiotic targets include ribosomes, cell wall constituents and components of nucleic acids synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Kohanski1">[31]</xref>. These cellular targets are mainly active during the bacterial vegetative phase, making the available antibiotics effective mostly during growth. However, the ability of bacteria to reside in nature within biofilm communities or as durable spores, as well as to become persistent to antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Costerton1">[32]</xref>, sets the need to tackle these alternative modes. In this regard, Relacin affects specifically the Stringent Response, a pathway crucial for the activation of bacterial survival strategies. Since Relacin can persist for a relatively long period of time, and exert its effect even a few days post addition, it might become a valuable antagonist of these long term survival approaches. Taken together, Relacin may be combined with antibiotics currently in use, to eradicate non-homogenous bacterial populations with cells residing in diverse life cycles.</p>
      <p>Cellular components, which are conserved throughout the bacterial kingdom and crucial for cellular survival, provide attractive antimicrobial targets as long as they lack eukaryotic counterparts. One of such targets is the highly conserved bacterial tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ, which provides the basis for the assembly of the division machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Goehring1">[33]</xref>. Indeed, a promising inhibitor of FtsZ with potent and selective activity against <italic>Staphylococci</italic> has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Haydon1">[34]</xref>. In a similar fashion, the ubiquity of Rel enzymes among bacteria, combined with the absence of known (p)ppGpp synthetases in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Mittenhuber1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Sun1">[36]</xref>, strengthen the potential of Relacin to turn into a therapeutic antibiotic. The profound influence of Relacin on long term bacterial survival makes it an attractive compound to serve as a scaffold for generating an array of new antibacterial agents.</p>

        <p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> (PY79) or <italic>E. coli</italic> (W3110) cells were grown in MOPS glucose minimal medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Neidhard1">[39]</xref> supplemented with all amino acids except glutamine and glutamate. At OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1, cells were supplemented with H<sub>3</sub><sup>32</sup>PO<sub>4</sub> and incubated for 45 minutes, after which Relacin was added at the indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated for additional 15 minutes. Next, amino acid starvation was induced by adding serine-hydroxamate (SHX, Sigma) 1 mg/mL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002925-Gropp1">[20]</xref>. Samples were withdrawn ten minutes after addition of SHX and analyzed for their (p)ppGpp content as described above (Measuring (p)ppGpp synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>).</p>

        <p>The reaction was carried out as described above for measuring (p)ppGpp synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, without the addition of radiolabeled GTP, with or without increasing amounts of Relacin as indicated. Reactions were centrifuged for 4 hours at 35,000 g (4°C), ribosomal fractions were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore Bedford) and processed for immunoreaction using mouse anti-His antibody (1∶10,000; Amersham). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (Biological Industries) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p>

(<bold>C</bold>) Structural basis of binding and inhibition of Rel/Spo by Relacin. A putative model describing how Relacin (sticks, colored according to the cpk scheme) binds in the known GDP binding site of Rel/Spo protein from <italic>Streptococcus equisimilis</italic> (shown as transparent white surface and cartoon). Relacin also forms additional contacts with Rel/Spo within the active site. GDP is shown in black lines for comparison, and residues of Rel/Spo that form hydrogen bonding contacts to GDP are shown in stick representation (see Text <italic>S1</italic>). The high affinity of Relacin can be explained by the extensive contacts formed between the ligand and the receptor. The ligand occupies a considerable volume of the binding pocket, including both the GDP binding sites, as well as additional regions. In addition to a range of hydrogen bonds mediated by the overall very polar pocket, the hydrophobic isobutyryl group contacts a defined hydrophobic patch shown as black dots.</p>
