        <p>One of the hallmarks of opportunistic pathogens is their ability to adjust and respond to a wide range of environmental and host-associated conditions. The human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has an ability to thrive in a variety of hosts and cause a range of acute and chronic infections in individuals with impaired host defenses or cystic fibrosis. Here we report an in-depth transcriptional profiling of this organism when grown at host-related temperatures. Using RNA-seq of samples from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown at 28°C and 37°C we detected genes preferentially expressed at the body temperature of mammalian hosts, suggesting that they play a role during infection. These temperature-induced genes included the type III secretion system (T3SS) genes and effectors, as well as the genes responsible for phenazines biosynthesis. Using genome-wide transcription start site (TSS) mapping by RNA-seq we were able to accurately define the promoters and <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements of many genes, and uncovered new genes and previously unrecognized non-coding RNAs directly controlled by the LasR quorum sensing regulator. Overall we identified 165 small RNAs and over 380 <italic>cis-</italic>antisense RNAs, some of which predicted to perform regulatory functions, and found that non-coding RNAs are preferentially localized in pathogenicity islands and horizontally transferred regions. Our work identifies regulatory features of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes whose products play a role in environmental adaption during infection and provides a reference transcriptional landscape for this pathogen.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Identifying coordinately regulated genes and their control by environmentally-initiated signal transduction pathways is important for understanding bacterial virulence mechanisms. The work reported here provides a comprehensive, high resolution, transcriptome map of the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> using RNA-seq. The results suggest that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> senses the temperature during the transition from its natural environment to a mammalian host, and this plays a key role in regulating the coordinated expression of several virulence factors. A large number of antisense transcripts and non-coding RNAs were identified, with preferential clustering in the regions acquired through horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that a part of the non-coding genome has a distinct evolutionary origin. We created an online data viewer, the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> transcriptome browser, to facilitate access to the transcriptome data from this study as well as the subsequent results of work deposited by other investigators. The resources generated through our analyses provide a valuable tool to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> research community and set the foundation for a systems biology approach towards understanding the complexity of the regulatory networks controlling the multiple lifestyles of this highly versatile organism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The outcomes of the broad spectrum of diseases caused by the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginos</italic>a are determined by several factors related to the predisposing conditions of the infected individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Kang1">[1]</xref>, the mechanism of entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Aaron1">[2]</xref> and consequences of interaction with the innate defense mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Koh1">[3]</xref>. The versatility of this organism in adapting to a wide range of environments including that of the human body is attributed to a large genomic repertoire consisting of a diverse set of genes encoding metabolic functions suited for proliferation in environments with a wide range of available nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Alonso1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Stover1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has an impressive armament of virulence factors, explaining why this species is the only known human pathogen among the members of the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Li1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Tan1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, virulence genes are highly conserved among different <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains and are part of the core genome, leading to speculations that, in addition to rare infections of humans, some form of pathogenic interaction occurs in natural environments providing the evolutionary pressure for their maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mathee1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wolfgang1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Rapid adaptation of bacteria to changing environments is accompanied by reprogramming of their regulatory networks to activate the expression of genes essential for their survival in the new environment while repressing those that are unnecessary or potentially deleterious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Pal1">[11]</xref>. This can be accomplished at the transcriptional level by responding to inputs from various environmental cues that are often mediated by specific signal transduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Cases1">[12]</xref>. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing approaches allow more accurate quantification of RNA levels in bacteria (RNA-seq) providing significant advances over microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Pallen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-vanVliet1">[14]</xref>. RNA-seq can provide complete coverage of protein-coding genes and intergenic regions to a single nucleotide resolution, and, with adaptation in the library preparation protocols, also allows strand-specific mapping of transcription start sites (TSSs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wurtzel1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Vijayan1">[18]</xref>. Driven mainly by the data generated from RNA-seq, a number of new regulatory mechanisms were uncovered based on activities of non-coding RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Sorek1">[19]</xref>. RNA-based regulation (riboregulation) is now recognized as an important mechanism for controlling gene expression by altering the translation of mRNA and/or modulating transcript turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Waters1">[20]</xref>. Such regulation is performed by <italic>trans</italic>-acting small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), <italic>cis</italic>-antisense transcripts (asRNAs), and riboswitches. Not unexpectedly, virulence gene expression is also subject to riboregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Sorek1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Gripenland1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Romby1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to small molecule chemical signals, such as nutrients, bacteria also sense and respond to environmental cues, such as the availability of oxygen, altered osmolarity, or pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Nechooshtan1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wassarman1">[25]</xref>. Facultative pathogens are also exposed in their natural environments to temperatures that are usually lower than the relatively constant temperature of mammals, 37°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mahenthiralingam1">[26]</xref>; exposure to this temperature could represent an important signal of environmental change, and trigger expression of specific virulence determinants. Modulation of gene expression by the temperature experienced by microorganisms has been described for a number of facultative pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Johansson1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Konkel1">[28]</xref>. Moreover, pathogens with a more restricted lifestyle, involving different hosts, can display differential expression of genes depending on the host. For example, a number of proteins encoded on the virulence plasmid of <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> are expressed at low temperature during growth in fleas, while a different set of proteins is induced at 37°C during the human infection cycle; each set of these proteins is required for growth and survival during a particular stage of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Marceau1">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, bacteria lacking a reservoir outside of the human host can also display temperature-regulated gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mereghetti1">[30]</xref>, possibly due to colonization of exposed surfaces such as skin, or during episodes of fever.</p>
      <p>Here we present the results of a global transcript analysis using RNA-seq to generate a high resolution map of transcription start sites and identify mRNAs and non-protein coding transcripts (sRNAs and asRNAs) for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. We compare transcript abundance in bacteria grown at the mammalian body temperature (37°C) and an arbitrarily-selected reduced temperature (28°C). Our results present several unexpected findings in regards to temperature and quorum sensing control of gene expression. Moreover, our data provide a useful tool for studies of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by identifying transcriptional units, accurately mapping transcription start sites and identifying sRNA and asRNA transcripts.</p>

        <title>A number of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence genes are regulated by temperature</title>
        <p>We used RNA-seq to examine the global gene expression of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 at 37°C and 28°C, with an objective to assess whether virulence genes respond to alterations in temperatures encountered in different environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s005">Table S1</xref>). Using replicate experiments, we identified a total of 144 genes that showed statistically significant over-expression of transcripts at 37°C, and 234 genes whose mRNA levels were reduced at 37°C compared to 28°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s006">Table S2</xref>). These represent transcripts of genes that may be activated or repressed during infection of warm-blooded mammals and possibly respond to temperature as one of several input signals for their coordinated expression. Therefore, the levels of transcripts for 6.4% of the genes of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 genome were affected by temperature. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment for genes related to protein secretion, phenazine biosynthesis and regulation of alginate biosynthesis among the genes upregulated at 37°C (p = 5.1×10<sup>−6</sup>, 4×10<sup>−3</sup>, and 6×10<sup>−3</sup> respectively; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Elevated expression of the regulatory gene cluster (<italic>mucABCD</italic>) leads to repression of alginate production. However, this effect can be overcome in isolates from cystic fibrosis patients in which common mutations in <italic>mucA</italic> lead to overproduction of the alginate exopolysaccharide. At 28°C, we observed upregulation of ribosomal protein genes, histidine catabolic genes, and aromatic and catechol-related genes (p = 6.4×10<sup>−12</sup>, 2.9×10<sup>−3</sup>, 1×10<sup>−3</sup>, and 4×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively). We found a strong enrichment for virulence-related genes among those upregulated at 37°C (hypergeometric test p = 8.6×10<sup>−15</sup>). Indeed, the expression of 43 out of 238 annotated virulence genes was altered in response to the temperature shift, with most of these (32, 74%) being upregulated at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The vast majority of the genes, 94%, were transcribed only from the strand containing the ORF, thus allowing quantification and comparison of the gene expression with strand-insensitive sequencing.</p>

        <p>At the two temperatures used in our transcriptome analysis, we observed few significant changes in the expression of cold-response (<italic>capB</italic> and PA14_05960) or heat-shock genes (<italic>htpG</italic>), and did not find evidence for extensive cold- or heat- shock response that is indicative of thermal stress. This suggests that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has evolved to thrive under a range of conditions that may include a variety of environmental temperatures without the need to activate protective survival responses.</p>

        <title>The type III secretion system is preferentially expressed at 37°C</title>
        <p>The mRNA levels for the majority of the T3SS components (regulators, secretion machinery and effectors) were higher at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) suggesting that this important <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence mechanism is subject to temperature regulation. Since the RNA-seq was carried out in calcium replete media, which is not optimal for the expression of the T3SS genes, we analyzed the production of the secretin component PscC by Western blots in two different strains, PA14 and PAO1, grown on calcium-depleted media, which promotes T3SS expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In both strains we observed immunoreactive PscC at 37°C but not at 28°C. Similarly, we observed temperature-regulated production of species-specific effectors of the T3SS, ExoS and ExoU in PAO1 and PA14, respectively, where they were detected only at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), confirming that the temperature regulation is not a PA14-specific trait.</p>

These molecules are also involved in electron shuttling to alternate terminal acceptors particularly during anaerobic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wang2">[45]</xref>. Moreover, the production of phenazines in other <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species is temperature regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Huang1">[46]</xref>. In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, two unlinked gene clusters, <italic>phzA1-G1</italic> and <italic>phzA2-G2</italic> encode enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of the core molecule phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mavrodi1">[47]</xref>. Although levels of transcripts from both of the <italic>phz</italic> clusters were elevated at 37°C, the temperature effect was more pronounced for <italic>phzA1-phzG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Two additional genes located adjacent to the <italic>phzA1-G1</italic> operon encode enzymes involved in the modification of PCA: PhzM (a methyltransferase) and PhzS (a monooxygenase). These two enzymes modify PCA to give pyocyanin, while PhzS alone can convert PCA to 1-hydroxy-phenazine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mentel1">[48]</xref>. The levels of <italic>phzM</italic> and <italic>phzS</italic> mRNAs were also increased at 37°C. Finally, the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> chromosome contains the <italic>phzH</italic> gene at an unlinked site; it encodes the enzyme for the conversion of PCA to phenazine-1-carboxamide. However, we did not detect significant expression of this gene at either temperature, and, therefore, it is unlikely that this modification step takes place in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> under the conditions tested.</p>
        <p>Phenazine is synthesized by a pathway utilizing metabolites that are also precursors for aromatic amino acids, TCA cycle intermediates and other bioactive molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Gaille1">[49]</xref>. We therefore examined the levels of transcripts for enzymes of the entire pathway and its branches, starting from condensation of erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate to various end products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Genes found in several operons encoding enzymes of these pathways were significantly more expressed (ranging from 6.6- to 35-fold) at 28°C than 37°C. Specifically, <italic>antABC</italic>, the genes for enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of catechol from anthranilic acid, and genes encoding CatABC and PcaDIJF, responsible for the conversion of catechol to the TCA cycle intermediates succinate and acetyl-CoA, were preferentially expressed at 28°C when compared to 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). We also detected temperature regulation of the <italic>antR</italic> gene encoding the transcriptional activator of the <italic>ant</italic> operon, which was not the case for mRNA levels of <italic>catR</italic>, the regulatory gene of the <italic>cat</italic> operon. Although numerous regulatory inputs are involved in regulating these genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Oglesby1">[50]</xref>, appears that the conversion of anthranilate to TCA cycle intermediates may occur less effectively at 37°C than at 28°C, making more precursors available for other biosynthetic pathways.</p>
        <p>Our results therefore show that at 37°C there should be a significant increase in the levels of two metabolic intermediates affecting the synthesis of important signaling and virulence-enhancing molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s001">Figure S1</xref>). An increase in the concentration of chorismic acid would be the consequence of higher levels of PhzC at 37°C and constitutive, temperature-independent transcription of genes encoding enzymes of the shikimate pathway (AroF1BQ1EKAC). Chorismic acid can be also converted to anthranilic acid, which would accumulate at 37°C, in part because of a decrease in its flow through the breakdown pathway to the TCA cycle intermediates succinate and acetyl-CoA, resulting from lower levels the enzymes (CatABC, PcaDIJF). An important consequence of this redistribution of various metabolic intermediates at 37°C is the diversion of chorismic acid towards the biosynthesis of phenazine. Anthranilic acid is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of the quorum sensing molecules alkyl-4 quinolones (AQs). Therefore, the reduction of the levels of the <italic>ant</italic>, <italic>cat</italic> and <italic>pca</italic> transcripts at 37°C (and by inference, levels of corresponding catabolic enzymes) could lead to an increase of the production of 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ) and 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS), two important regulators of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cell-to-cell communication and virulence gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Heeb1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Rumbaugh1">[52]</xref>. We tested these predictions directly by comparing the levels of pyocyanin and PQS in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> supernatants of cultures grown at 28°C and 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We found increased concentrations of both of these molecules at 37°C, although the effect on PQS production was much more pronounced when cultures reached the stationary phase of growth. Moreover, the pyochelin siderophore pathway also benefits from the altered levels of the various precursors of the aromatic amino acid pathway, since increased levels of chorismic acid as the consequence of a decrease in its flow towards the TCA cycle makes more of it available for the synthesis of pyochelin, although mRNA concentrations encoding the enzymes of this pathway were not affected by temperature.</p>

        <title>The transcriptome structure of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14</title>
        <p>Understanding the transcriptome structure and operon organization in bacteria is essential for understanding bacterial RNA-based regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Sorek1">[19]</xref>. To produce a detailed transcriptome structure map of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we used the mapping of the RNA-seq reads, which provides transcript coverage in a non-strand-specific manner. To complement this approach, we also used a strand-specific 5′-end sequencing method, which identifies active transcription start sites (TSS) at a single nucleotide resolution across the entire genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wurtzel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wurtzel2">[17]</xref>. The combination of the two sequencing methods provided a comprehensive view of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 transcriptome in an unbiased manner.</p>
        <p>We were able to map transcription start sites (TSSs) for 2,117 transcriptional units (TU), spanning 3,325 protein-coding genes (55% of all protein coding genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s007">Table S3</xref>). A total of 1,854 genes (56%) were found to be included in polycistronic TUs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Over 61% of the multi-gene operons are bicistronic, and only 19% contain 4 or more genes. This general operon organization is highly similar to that found in other bacteria. For example, in the Gram-positive <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, in which the operon structure was determined by hybridization of RNA to tiling-arrays, it was found that 60% of the genes were transcribed in multi-gene operon structures, with about half of the multi-gene TUs transcribed as bicistronic mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-ToledoArana1">[53]</xref>. In <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic>, polycystronic mRNAs accounted for approximately 50% of all transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Qiu1">[54]</xref> and a recent determination of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 found that 35% of the TUs are polycistronic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Cho1">[55]</xref>. Since these organisms vary greatly in genome size, growth conditions and physiology, there appears to be a general design principle for bacterial operon organization, which has no correlation with the genome coding capacity.

Until now, the mapping of 5′ UTRs has not been performed systematically on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, thus limiting the discovery of new <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. Since our TSS mapping defines the 5′ ends of TUs, it also reveals the 5′ UTRs of the immediate downstream genes. Inspection of the 5′ UTRs for the 2,117 TUs we defined showed a median 5′ UTR length of 47 nt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), similar to the 5′ UTR lengths reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> (20–40 nt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-MendozaVargas1">[59]</xref> and <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> (30 nt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Vijayan1">[18]</xref>. Most of the 5′ UTRs (77%) were shorter than 100 nt, with 60 genes completely lacking 5′ UTRs. Interestingly, 115 5′ UTRs were longer than 200 nt, which suggests that a significant fraction of these leader regions may function as <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory RNA elements. We scanned the sequences of all 5′ UTRs longer than 100 nt using RFAM, and found that 13 of those contain known riboswitches and RNA-leaders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s007">Table S3</xref>).

        <p>Since gene annotation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is largely limited to the description of ORFs, a genome-wide characterization of promoter regions and binding sites of regulators of transcription is often difficult. The availability of a comprehensive list of TSSs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> now allows an accurate search for promoter and regulatory regions for specific genes or operons. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we selected LasR, the transcriptional regulator of quorum sensing and virulence genes. LasR independently regulates the expression of a number of genes. It is positioned at the top of a regulatory network that includes additional quorum sensing systems such as Rhl, PQS and Qsc and, therefore, its regulon is extensive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Heurlier1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Williams1">[62]</xref>. The number of genes directly or indirectly controlled by LasR was shown to include over 300 genes or about 6% of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Schuster2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wagner1">[64]</xref>.

By analyzing the TSSs of genes marked as LasR-bound by the ChIP-chip study, we were able to establish that this transcription factor has a preferential positioning of 51–52 bases upstream to the start of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on this analysis, we computationally identified 17 new, previously unrecognized putative LasR binding sites on the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s008">Table S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).

        <p>To confirm that the new LasR binding sites identified by our computational methods represent direct targets of regulation by this transcription factor, we analyzed these promoters for direct binding by LasR using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and for LasR-dependent expression using <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusions. When purified LasR was used to analyze DNA-protein interactions, we detected binding of this protein to all but one fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Based on the low concentrations of LasR (0.3 pM) that were required to give a complete or near-compete shift, relatively high affinity binding was detected for at least five DNA fragments corresponding to the promoter regions of PA14_09480, PA14_09490, PA14_33830, and PA14_48530. For the rest of the DNA fragments, the extent of binding of LasR varied and in a number of cases, only a weak shift was observed even at the highest concentrations (30 pM) tested. No binding of LasR to the promoter region of PA14_23220 was detected.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the newly identified LasR-dependent binding sites indeed respond to LasR <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have cloned the same fragments used in the EMSAs into a transcriptional <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter plasmid and incorporated the gene fusion into the chromosome of wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 and its isogenic <italic>lasR</italic> mutant. LasR-dependent <italic>lacZ</italic> expression was assessed at two time points corresponding to early stationary phase (8 hr growth) and late stationary phase (12 hr growth). In general, the levels of expression for most of the fusions, and correspondingly LasR dependence, were higher at later stages of growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s003">Figure S3</xref>). A number of fusions were poorly expressed in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and because of this, no LasR-dependent regulation was observed for the fusions transcribed from the promoters of PA14_03490, PA14_23220, PA14_18800, and PA14_33890. This lack of expression is consistent with the transcriptome data (RPKM values of 30 or less for these genes) suggesting they are not expressed under these conditions. Interestingly, we observed LasR binding to three of these promoters (PA14_03490, PA14_18800, and somewhat weakly, PA14_33890) in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Two conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, the predicted LasR binding sites adjacent to promoter regions do not necessarily indicate that a particular gene is expressed under all conditions. For example, PA14_03490, PA14_18800, and PA14_33890 could be expressed in environments that are different from these used in our work (LB, aerobic and at 37°C). Moreover, full transcriptional activation of certain LasR-regulated genes could require the input of additional regulatory factors. This regulatory complexity of quorum sensing would permit a more fine-tuned response of groups of genes to specific environmental inputs.</p>

        <p>The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 genome contains two temperature regulated gene clusters, encoding the enzymes for the synthesis of phenazine-1 carboxylic acid (<italic>phzS</italic>, <italic>phzA1-G1</italic>, <italic>phzM</italic>, and <italic>phzA2-G2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Regulation of the <italic>phzA1-G1</italic> operon and <italic>phzM</italic> by acyl-homoserine-lactones (HCLs) has been shown previously using DNA microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Schuster2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wagner1">[64]</xref>. Using the precisely-mapped TSSs, we independently identified in the <italic>phzA1</italic>-<italic>phzM</italic> intergenic region a conserved palindromic LasR consensus binding sequence <underline><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">C</named-content></underline><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TACCAGATCTTGTAG</named-content>, with the <underline>C</underline> positioned 52 nt from the site and on the opposite strand, the sequence <underline><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">C</named-content></underline><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TACAAGATCTGGTAG</named-content> with the <underline>C</underline> 54 nt from the TSS of <italic>phzM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g005">5A</xref>). Since the consensus LasR binding site is palindromic, the binding of this transcription factor to a single site in an intergenic region could allow activation of the two divergent promoters, a rather uncommon arrangement of regulatory sequences bound by positive transcription regulators in bacteria. Moreover, since the LasR binding site resembles the predicted binding site for a second quorum sensing regulator RhlR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Schuster1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Schuster2">[63]</xref>, and LasR regulates the expression of <italic>rhlR</italic>, it is conceivable that the same palindromic double stranded DNA sequence serves as a binding site for either LasR or RhlR, or both for these two transcriptional units.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion experiments in wild-type, <italic>lasR</italic>, and <italic>rhlR</italic> mutants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed strong LasR- and RhlR-dependent expression of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter fused to the <italic>phzA1</italic> promoter fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>phzM</italic> promoter directed transcription in a LasR- and RhlR-dependent manner, although the fold decrease of transcription of the fusion in <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>rhlR</italic> mutants was not as large as seen for the <italic>phzA1</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusions, owing to its high level of expression in wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. There was only modest regulation by LasR or RhlR for the <italic>phzS</italic> and <italic>phzA2</italic> fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because LasR controls the expression of <italic>rhlR</italic>, it was impossible to differentiate which of the two quorum sensing transcription factors regulated the expression of <italic>phzA1</italic> or <italic>phzM</italic>. We therefore engineered <italic>phzA1-lacZ</italic> and <italic>phzM-lacZ</italic> promoter fusion plasmids and the expression of the reporter gene was measured in response to N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL) or N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), in <italic>E. coli</italic>, co-expressing LasR or RhlR on an inducible plasmid. DNA fragments containing the promoter regions of <italic>rsaL</italic> and <italic>rhlA</italic> were used as controls for specificity of expression of activation of the reporter constructs by LasR and RhlR, in response to 3O-C12-HSL and C4-HSL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>An approximately 3.7-fold and 6-fold induction of <italic>phzA1</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> was seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing either LasR or RhlR, in response to their cognate autoinducers. The <italic>phzM-lacZ</italic> fusion showed a significant, albeit modest, effect of the homoserine lactone autoinducers and LasR, RhlR (1.6-and 1.3-fold, respectively). The results from the expression of the <italic>phzA1-lacZ</italic> and <italic>phzM-lacZ</italic> fusions in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> indicate that binding of LasR and RhlR to the same site, in the context of the respective promoters, leads to the enhanced expression of <italic>phzA1</italic> over <italic>phzM</italic> in overall magnitude and dependence on these two quorum sensing regulators.</p>
        <p>There are several explanations for these observations. First, the two overlapping regulatory sequences found on the opposite DNA strands are not functionally identical although the differences are rather minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). There are two differences in the regulatory sequences adjacent to each promoter (T/A at position 5 and C/G at position 12). These could account for strong preference for LasR and RhlR activation towards the transcription of <italic>phzA1</italic>. Moreover, the predicted promoters (−10 and −35 regions) are not identical and these could also provide additional context for the extent and magnitude of LasR and RhlR activation. Finally, the distances of the LasR element from the TSSs of <italic>phzA1</italic> and <italic>phzM</italic> are different, although well within those seen for other LasR activated genes, and this could also contribute to the overall transcriptional level and extent of influence of quorum sensing regulators and autoinducers. Conceivably, all of these factors could incrementally contribute to regulated expression.</p>

        <title>Detection of expressed non-coding RNAs</title>
        <p>Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are now appreciated as important regulators of diverse processes in bacteria. Although <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has been studied extensively, only 38 intergenic ncRNAs (sRNAs) have been identified in its genome so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Sonnleitner1">[66]</xref>. By combining our TSS mapping and the whole-transcriptome data, we determined 223 events of intergenic transcription based on the current genome annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Of these, 23 represent protein-coding genes that were annotated in other genomes but so far escaped detection in PA14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s009">Table S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), and 35 additional transcripts that might represent non-conserved protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s010">Table S6</xref>). The sequences of the remaining 165 transcripts lack an ORF and therefore most likely represent non-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s010">Table S6</xref>). Most of the previously described sRNAs (31/38, 86%) were detected in our sRNA set, and we could define the exact TSS for 26 of them. Most of the sRNAs we identified (69.5%) are conserved only within other <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains, and only a few (10.5%) are conserved outside of the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s010">Table S6</xref>).</p>

        <p>In addition, we identified 384 genes with overlapping transcription on the reverse strand, representing <italic>cis</italic>-encoded antisense RNA (asRNA) transcription, Such asRNAs are known to be abundant regulators in many prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wurtzel1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Sorek1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-ToledoArana1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Qiu1">[54]</xref> but until now they have not determined globally in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
        <p>We next examined the distribution of the DNA segments that are transcribed into asRNAs and sRNAs in the genome of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. Specifically, we assessed whether they are part of the flexible or core genome, as determined previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mathee1">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We noted an over 2-fold enrichment in the location of sequences specifying both sRNAs (Fisher's exact test p = 0.003) and antisense RNAs (Fisher's exact test p = 8.83×10<sup>−18</sup>) in regions that have been previously designated as regions of genome plasticity (i.e. the flexible genome); sRNAs and asRNAs were found less frequently in the conserved core genome. For example, the annotated 115 kb pathogenicity island PAPI-1 carries only two genes with predicted function in transcriptional regulation, RL0037 (a RcsB ortholog) and a predicted transcription regulator RL0012 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-He1">[67]</xref>. Strikingly, in addition to the 175 annotated genes in PAPI-1, we were able to detect additional 46 ncRNAs (10 sRNAs and 36 asRNAs) representing 21% of the genes in the island; this number of asRNAs in PAPI-1 is enriched by over 5-fold compared to the core genome. Since the flexible genome represents, in most instances, horizontally-acquired genes, it is likely that these segments specify regulatory elements controlling the expression of co-acquired target genes. However, it could be that genes expressed from other genomic islands or from the core genome could be subject to regulation by the <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNAs at a post-transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-PadalonBrauch1">[68]</xref>. These findings raise the possibility that the ability to acquire ncRNA regulators via horizontal gene transfer contributes significantly to bacterial evolution, where new phenotypes emerge by post-transcriptional activation or repression of genes already present in the recipient cells. An alternative explanation is that horizontally acquired sequences in the flexible genome were newly introduced to the genome, and due to lack of evolutionary time to ameliorate their coding- and non-coding sequences, the acquired sequences contain random promoter sequences that are recognized by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> transcriptional machinery.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, two of the predicted sRNAs (Lrs1 and Lrs2) were identified as having a conserved binding site with similar binding affinity for LasR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g004">Figure 4A, 4C</xref>). Monitoring the expression of <italic>lrs1</italic> and <italic>lrs2</italic> with transcriptional <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions showed LasR dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) throughout the entire growth phase of the cultures, although there was a slight increase in the expression of the <italic>lrs1-lacZ</italic> fusion and <italic>lrs1</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s004">S4</xref>B) when cultures reached a late stationary phase of growth. A Northern blot with a probe designed for <italic>lrs1</italic> with RNA extracted from wild-type PA14, a Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant, and a Δ<italic>lasR</italic> strain complemented with LasR on a plasmid indicated that <italic>lrs1</italic> expression is indeed dependent on LasR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). We also note that during the late stationary phase Lrs1 can be detected even in a <italic>lasR</italic> mutant, suggesting that its regulation may be directed by another transcription factor expressed or activated at this late growth phase. We further demonstrated using EMSA that the concentrations of Lrs1 (but not Lrs2) in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were dependent on the RNA chaperone Hfq through a direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We also observed that Lrs1 transcript levels, but not Lrs2 levels, are reduced in a <italic>hfq</italic> mutant, possibly due to reduced transcript stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002945-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). These results point toward an overlapping regulatory network that includes a transcriptional regulatory cascade and a sRNA-regulated post-transcriptional regulatory component. The quorum sensing regulatory system therefore very likely integrates, in addition to cell density, a number of regulatory inputs and directs these to the most optimal responses for survival in a particular environment.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the possible roles of Lrs1, we constructed an isogenic deletion mutant lacking the <italic>lrs1</italic> sequence. We first determined the precise 5′ and 3′ ends of the transcript following intramolecular ligation and synthesis of cDNA across the junction. The sequence of the cDNA was used to design PCR primers for deletion of the entire <italic>lrs1</italic> in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. Surprisingly, the culture of the mutant strain was devoid of the characteristic blue-green pigment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, a color that stems from production of pyocyanin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). Measurements of levels of pyoverdine, the fluorescent pigment produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, showed no detectable differences between culture supernatants of wild-type and the <italic>lrs1</italic> mutant (data not shown). To detect the transcriptional changes that might contribute to this phenotype we constructed additional RNA-seq libraries from wild type and Δ<italic>lrs1</italic> isolates. Interestingly, the gene expression in both libraries was almost identical (Pearson r&gt;0.99), except for a single operon, the anthranilate dioxygenase operon (<italic>antABC</italic>), which was upregulated by more than 2-fold in the mutant strain. This might explain a highly efficient metabolic flux to this pathway, which in turn depleted the production of pyocyanin, due to lack of chorismic acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s001">Figure S1</xref>); in turn this may provide an explanation for the lack of the color in the Δ<italic>lrs1</italic> cultures. Strikingly, Δ<italic>lrs1</italic> also resulted in a significant (over 4-fold) upregulation in the expression of the two PrrF sRNAs, which are regulators of a number of iron-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wilderman1">[69]</xref>.</p>

The number of overlapping mapped reads was counted for every ORF in each sample of whole-transcriptome sequencing (2 biological replicates for the 28°C and 37°C samples). For each ORF the number of reads per kilobase of gene model per million mapped reads (RPKM) was calculated as previously described by Mortazavi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Mortazavi1">[78]</xref>; this procedure also normalizes samples having different numbers of initial reads. Differentially expressed genes were called by performing χ<sup>2</sup> test on the RPKM values and applying Bonferroni correction for multiple-testing. Genes with adjusted p-values smaller or equal to 0.05 in both replicates were determined to be differentially expressed.</p>

        <title>Determination of TSSs</title>
        <p>For each position in the genome the number of mapped reads derived from the 5′ end sequencing experiments was recorded in a strand-specific manner. Positions with five or more uniquely mapped reads (encompassing 78% of the reads) were considered as reproducible sites. Reproducible sites in intergenic regions or overlapping ORFs were associated with the closest gene according to the gene annotation (Genbank: NC_008463). In cases where the site was positioned over 250 nt from the downstream gene the site was not associated with any gene. All reproducible sites that were not associated with genes were inspected manually using the <italic>Pseudomonas transcriptome browser</italic> and in cases which had a continuous whole-transcriptome expression from the site to the beginning of a downstream gene, the site was associated with the corresponding gene. The TSS of each gene was defined as the reproducible site upstream to the beginning of the gene with the highest number of reads in comparison to other sites that were associated with the same gene, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wurtzel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Wurtzel2">[17]</xref>. This was validated by randomly selecting 200 TSSs and checking for their agreement with the whole-transcriptome sequencing data, searching for continuous expression from the TSS in the direction of the transcription. TSSs (n = 2,117) were further validated by comparing the ratio of reads derived from the TAP+ sample divided by the number of reads from TAP− sample. The TAP+/TAP− ratio of putative TSSs were found to be enriched by an average of 2.6-fold (Wilcoxon sum rank p&lt;1<sup>−193</sup>) as compared to non-TSS sites, indicating that they were preceded by a triphosphate, a hallmark of primary transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Houseley1">[80]</xref>.</p>

When genes were not expressed under the conditions tested, operon structures were determined based on distance between pairs of genes, where genes occurring on the same strand with a distance shorter than 72 nt considered as belonging to the same operon. This threshold was empirically determined based on the distances between genes in expressed polycistrons with defined TSSs (n = 646; median distance = 10 nt), where the 90th-percentile distance between genes was 72 nt.</p>

        <title>Genome-wide detection of sRNAs</title>
        <p>Small RNAs were identified based on the presence of a TSS and expression in intergenic regions (IGRs) that was not associated with genes. The TSS site was marked as the 5′ end of the putative sRNA and the 3′ end was estimated from the whole-transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002945.s010">Table S6</xref>). Previously described sRNAs in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA14 that were expressed in the 5′ end-sequencing and/or the whole-transcriptome data were included in the list. In addition, the sequence of known sRNAs from the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 were searched for in the PA14 genome by a BLAST search (parameters ‘-p blastn –e 0.001 –F F –W 4 –q 1’) and sRNAs that were found and expressed in the PA14 genome were also included in the list. All expressed regions in the list were examined manually in the <italic>Pseudomonas transcriptome browser</italic> and were validated to be transcribed independently from their downstream genes; putative sRNAs that were not transcribed independently (i.e., transcribed along with the downstream or upstream gene) were removed from the list. All remaining intergenic transcripts represented independent expression of either a non-coding RNA or an un-annotated ORF. Therefore, all intergenic transcripts were scanned for putative ORFs and the longest possible ORF lacking a stop-codon in every region of expression was subsequently searched for homology against the entire protein collection (nr) using BLAST+ with a minimal e-value of 10<sup>−4</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002945-Camacho1">[81]</xref>.
