        <p>The serine-rich repeat glycoprotein Srr1 of <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (GBS) is thought to be an important adhesin for the pathogenesis of meningitis. Although expression of Srr1 is associated with increased binding to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC), the molecular basis for this interaction is not well defined. We now demonstrate that Srr1 contributes to GBS attachment to hBMEC via the direct interaction of its binding region (BR) with human fibrinogen. When assessed by Far Western blotting, Srr1 was the only protein in GBS extracts that bound fibrinogen. Studies using recombinant Srr1-BR and purified fibrinogen <italic>in vitro</italic> confirmed a direct protein-protein interaction. Srr1-BR binding was localized to amino acids 283–410 of the fibrinogen Aα chain. Structural predictions indicated that the conformation of Srr1-BR is likely to resemble that of SdrG and other related staphylococcal proteins that bind to fibrinogen through a “dock, lock, and latch” mechanism (DLL). Deletion of the predicted latch domain of Srr1-BR abolished the interaction of the BR with fibrinogen. In addition, a mutant GBS strain lacking the latch domain exhibited reduced binding to hBMEC, and was significantly attenuated in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of meningitis. These results indicate that Srr1 can bind fibrinogen directly likely through a DLL mechanism, which has not been described for other streptococcal adhesins. This interaction was important for the pathogenesis of GBS central nervous system invasion and subsequent disease progression.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (Group B <italic>streptococcus</italic>, GBS) is a leading cause of meningitis in newborns and infants. This life-threatening infection of the brain and surrounding tissues continues to result in a high incidence of morbidity and mortality, despite antibiotic therapy. A key factor in disease production is the ability of this organism to invade the central nervous system, via the bloodstream. We now report that a GBS surface protein called Srr1 binds fibrinogen, a major protein in human blood. This interaction enhances the attachment of GBS to brain vascular endothelial cells, and contributes to the development of meningitis. A mutation in Srr1 that specifically disrupted binding to fibrinogen significantly reduced GBS attachment to brain endothelium, and markedly reduced virulence in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of GBS disease. These studies have identified a new mechanism by which Srr1 contributes to GBS invasion of the central nervous system and may provide a basis for novel therapies targeting Srr1 binding.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins are a large and diverse family of adhesins found in Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Zhou1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Bensing1">[2]</xref>. Each SRR protein is encoded within a large locus that also contains genes encoding proteins responsible for glycosylating the SRR protein, as well as an accessory Sec system that is dedicated to the export of the adhesin. The SRR proteins have a highly conserved domain organization, including a long and specialized signal sequence, two extensive serine-rich repeat regions that undergo glycosylation, and a typical LPXTG cell wall anchoring motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Pyburn1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Xiong1">[4]</xref>. The N-termini also contain a binding region that varies considerably, both in terms of structure and adherence properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Among the best-characterized is GspB of <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic>, which binds human platelets through its interaction with sialyl-T antigen on the platelet receptor GPIbα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Bensing1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Bensing2">[5]</xref>. This appears to be an important event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, since disruption of Siglec-mediated binding results in reduced virulence, as measured by an animal model of endocardial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Pyburn1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Xiong1">[4]</xref>. A number of other SRR proteins have been shown to contribute to virulence, including SraP of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, PsrP of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and the two SRR proteins (Srr1 and Srr2) of GBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Siboo1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Obert1">[11]</xref>. However, the molecular basis for binding by these other adhesins is less defined. Their binding regions have no homology to that of GspB, indicating that they are not Siglec-like adhesins. Although SraP mediates binding to platelets, the receptor for this SRR protein has not been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Siboo1">[6]</xref>. PsrP binds cytokeratin 10 <italic>in vitro</italic>, which appears to be important for binding to pulmonary epithelial cells and subsequent pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Shivshankar1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Expression of Srr1 or Srr2 by GBS has been shown to contribute to virulence in models of meningitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-vanSorge1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Seifert1">[8]</xref>. Srr1 mediates binding to several types of human epithelial cell lines, as well as human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-vanSorge1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Sheen1">[13]</xref>. Binding of these cells appears to be important for both colonization and invasion. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have indicated that one ligand for Srr1 is human keratin 4, which may facilitate attachment to cervical, vaginal, and pharyngeal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Sheen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Samen1">[14]</xref>. We now report, however, that Srr1 also binds human fibrinogen directly through its interaction with the Aα chain of the heteromultimeric protein. This interaction mediates the binding of GBS both to fibrinogen and to hBMEC, and appears to be important for virulence in the setting of meningitis.</p>

        <p>We first measured the adherence of GBS strain COH31 (a serotype III clinical isolate) to a variety of host plasma and matrix proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, GBS adhered to immobilized human fibrinogen at levels (mean: 16±2.8% of inoculum) that were significantly higher than those seen to with the negative control, casein (&lt;1%). Low levels of binding (&lt;2%) were observed with thrombin, fibronectin, laminin, plasminogen, collagen IV, and fetuin. Binding was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of immobilized fibrinogen with anti-fibrinogen IgG, indicating that the interaction between GBS and fibrinogen was specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We also examined eight additional GBS isolates, representing a range of capsular types, all of which were found to bind immobilized fibrinogen. As was seen with the COH31 strain, binding of all GBS strains tested was significantly reduced during treatment with IgG specific for fibrinogen. These data indicate that GBS can adhere specifically to immobilized fibrinogen and adherence to fibrinogen is a general property of GBS.</p>

        <p>To better characterize the GBS surface components responsible for fibrinogen interaction, we examined the binding of soluble human fibrinogen to GBS cell wall proteins by Far Western blotting. Although the GBS cell wall extracts contained numerous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel), fibrinogen binding was restricted to a group of high MW bands (300–400 kDa) (middle panel). Probing the membranes with WGA revealed binding of the lectin to one or more proteins of similar size, indicating that they were glycosylated (right panel). Since the serine-rich repeat protein Srr1 of GBS is a high MW glycoprotein, we next assessed the impact of deleting <italic>srr1</italic> on WGA and fibrinogen binding. When cell wall extracts of COH31Δ<italic>srr1</italic> (PS954) were probed with WGA or fibrinogen, no binding was observed, confirming that the glycoprotein bound by fibrinogen was Srr1.</p>
        <p>To examine the impact of Srr1 expression on bacterial binding to fibrinogen, we tested the ability of GBS strains COH31 and NCTC 10/84, and Δ<italic>srr1</italic> variants to bind to immobilized fibrinogen. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, deletion of <italic>srr1</italic> markedly reduced GBS binding to fibrinogen. Similar results were observed with additional GBS strains H36B and 515 (data not shown). To confirm the role of Srr1 expression in fibrinogen binding by GBS, we next assessed whether binding by COH31 and NCTC 10/84 to fibrinogen was inhibited by rabbit anti-Srr1 IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In control studies, co-incubation of either strain with rabbit IgG had no effect on fibrinogen binding. In contrast, co-incubation of GBS with anti-Srr1 IgG significantly reduced binding to fibrinogen. The level of inhibition was concentration-dependent, with 100 µg/ml of anti-Srr1 IgG being sufficient to reduce WT GBS binding to levels comparable to those seen with GBSΔ<italic>srr</italic>1. Complementation of the <italic>srr1</italic> mutation <italic>in trans</italic> restored fibrinogen binding by NCTC 10/84 Δ<italic>srr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s002">Figure S2</xref>), thereby demonstrating that the loss of binding observed with <italic>srr1</italic> disruption was not due to polar or pleiotropic effects. These results indicate that GBS binding to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated by the surface expressed Srr1 protein.</p>

        <p>The attachment of GBS to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) is thought to be important for the invasion of the central nervous system by this organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Nizet1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Quach1">[17]</xref>. Previous studies indicate that binding of GBS to brain endothelium is mediated by Srr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-vanSorge1">[7]</xref>. To assess whether fibrinogen contributed to this interaction, we assessed the role of fibrinogen in Srr1-mediated binding of GBS to hBMEC. Fibrinogen was detectable on the surface of washed hBMEC, as measured by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Exposure of the cells to exogenous human fibrinogen (20 µg/ml), markedly increased the amount of the protein on the cell surface, indicating that hBMEC are capable of binding fibrinogen. Strain NCTC10/84 and an isogenic Δ<italic>srr1</italic> variant (PS2645) were incubated with hBMEC in tissue culture wells.

To confirm that the putative binding region of Srr1 (Srr1-BR) interacts with fibrinogen, we assessed the binding of the purified FLAG tagged binding region (<sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR) with fibrinogen. In control studies, no significant binding by <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR to immobilized casein blocking regent was detected. In contrast, <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR showed significant binding to fibrinogen, which increased in direct proportion to the amount of protein applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). No fibrinogen binding activity was detected by either the N-terminal of Srr1-BR (AA303–479) or C-terminus (AA480–641) alone, indicating that entire region is required. To determine the apparent <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> for the binding of <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR to fibrinogen, we analyzed data from six independent ELISA-based binding assays, as described previously.

        <title>Identification of the binding site for Srr1-BR</title>

Fibrinogen is a complex protein consisting of two subunits, each containing three polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ and γ). When separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, fibrinogen appeared as three bands corresponding to the Aα, Bβ, and γ chains (Aα = 63.5 kDa, Bβ = 56 kDa, γ = 47 kDa) having the expected masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

We also assessed the binding of Srr1-BR to recombinant forms of each chain, expressed as MalE fusion proteins.

Far Western blot analysis showed that binding of <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR was localized to subdomains containing residues 283–410, which correspond to the tandem repeat region of the Aα chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). To confirm that this region was the Srr1-BR binding site, we assessed by ELISA the interaction of <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR with the immobilized fibrinogen Aα subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).

However, <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR exhibited levels of binding to MalE:Aα<sub>283–410</sub> that were comparable to recombinant full length Aα chain (MalE:Aα<sub>1–610</sub>), indicating that the Srr1-BR binding site is indeed the 13 AA tandem repeat region within the Aα chain of fibrinogen.</p>

        <p>To gain a better understanding of the structural determinants present within the binding region of Srr1, bioinformatic analysis was performed on the predicted binding region sequence (AA 303–641). Interestingly, PSI-BLAST analysis identified this region to be related to the fibrinogen binding domain of the staphylococcal adhesins SdrG and ClfA (sharing 22% and 23% identity respectively). Structure prediction analysis using PHYRE -<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Kelley1">[19]</xref>, Swiss-Model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Arnold1">[20]</xref>, and HHPRED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Biegert1">[21]</xref> algorithms also identified the binding region of Srr1 as having structural similarity to the fibrinogen-binding region of SdrG (HHPred; 100% probability, e = 4.5e−51) and ClfA (HHPred; 100% probability, e value = 9.2e−51) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>The binding regions of ClfA and SdrG are composed of two domains (N2 and N3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g001">Figure 1</xref>), each of which adopts an IgG-like fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Deivanayagam1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ponnuraj1">[24]</xref>. This domain architecture enables fibrinogen binding through a “dock, lock, and latch” mechanism (DLL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ponnuraj1">[24]</xref>, in which fibrinogen engages a binding cleft between the N2 and N3 domains. As the ligand “dock”, the flexible C-terminal extension of the N3 domain (the “latch”) changes conformation, so that it “locks” the ligand in place, and forms a β strand complex with the N2 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ponnuraj1">[24]</xref>. Bacterial adhesins that are structurally related to Clf-Sdr family are able to bind fibrinogen using this mechanism, which appears to represent a general mode of ligand-adhesin binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ponnuraj1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ganesh2">[28]</xref>. Collectively, our bioinformatic analysis suggests that the binding region of Srr1 structurally resembles the binding region of the Clf-Sdr family proteins (SdrG, ClfA, ClfB) and may have a similar binding mechanism.</p>

However, a highly homologous TYTFTDYVD-like “latching cleft” sequence between the D1 and E1 strands was identified at AA 412∼420 (TYTWTRYAS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s010">Table S3</xref>). To investigate whether the C-terminal end of Srr1-BR contained a functional latch-like domain, we generated a variant of Srr1-BR, in which the C-terminal 13 AA had been deleted (<sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BRΔlatch). As shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, this mutation abolished the binding of the Srr1-BR. Moreover, untagged Srr1-BRΔlatch (100 µg/ml) failed to inhibit the binding of <sub>FLAG</sub>Srr1-BR binding to immobilized fibrinogen (data not shown). The Srr1-BR protein readily bound to hBMEC and this interaction was increased by preincubating hBMEC with fibrinogen (20 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002947-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, the Srr1-BRΔlatch protein exhibited lower levels of binding to hBMEC compared with the Srr1-BR protein, which were not enhanced by fibrinogen. To exclude the possibility that this deletion had produced changes in the secondary structure of the protein that might account for the reduction in fibrinogen-binding activity, we analyzed Srr1-BR and Srr1-BRΔlatch proteins by circular dichroism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s006">Fig. S6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The SRR proteins of GBS are thought to be important both for colonization of the female genital tract, and for the pathogenesis of invasive diseases, such as sepsis and meningitis. Expression of Srr1 has been shown to enhance the attachment of bacteria to vaginal and cervical epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to facilitate genital colonization in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Sheen2">[30]</xref>. These interactions may be mediated in part by the binding of Srr1 to cytokeratin 4 on the surface of these epithelial cells. Studies <italic>in vitro</italic> indicate that the Srr1 interacts with cytokeratin 4 to promote bacterial attachment to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Samen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Sheen2">[30]</xref>. However, binding can be blocked by sWGA, suggesting that the glycosylated serine-rich domains may also be involved in the interaction of Srr1 with cytokeratin 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Samen1">[14]</xref>. Strains expressing Srr1 are also more virulent in animal models of meningitis, as compared with their isogenic, <italic>srr1</italic>-deleted variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-vanSorge1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Seifert1">[8]</xref>. Expression of Srr1 enhances GBS binding to hBMEC, which is likely to be an essential step for initiating central nervous system invasion and meningitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-vanSorge1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results now demonstrate that Srr1 promotes the adherence of GBS to human fibrinogen, and that this process is likely to be important for the pathogenesis of meningitis. Binding occurs via the interaction of Srr1-BR with the C-terminus of the fibrinogen Aα chain. This appears to be a specific event, requiring the entire Srr1-BR, and amino acids 283–410 of the Aα chain. Although Srr1 has limited primary sequence similarity to other known fibrinogen binding proteins, our secondary structure analyses indicate that Srr1-BR is likely to have a conformation resembling that of ClfA and possibly other related proteins, such as SdrG of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. These and a number of other Gram-positive bacterial adhesins are thought to bind fibrinogen through a “dock, lock, and latch” (DLL) mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ponnuraj1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Davis1">[26]</xref>, as described above. Deletion of the predicted latch-like domain of Srr1 significantly reduced fibrinogen binding by the recombinant protein, as well as by bacteria, suggesting that Srr1 binding occurred by a comparable mechanism. If so, this would be the first example of a streptococcal DLL adhesin. Notwithstanding these similarities, there are some notable differences between Srr1 and its staphylococcal counterparts. For example, while Srr1 binds the Aα chain of fibrinogen, ClfA recognizes the C-terminus of the γ chain, and SdrG binds the N-terminus of the β chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ponnuraj1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ganesh1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Xiang1">[27]</xref>. Although both Srr1 and ClfB bind the C-terminus of the Aα chain, their binding sites on fibrinogen appear to differ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Xiang1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Ganesh2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Walsh1">[31]</xref>. A recombinant peptide representing the Aα chain binding site for ClfB (AA283–347) did not inhibit Srr1-BR binding to fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002947.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Conversely, a peptide containing Aα chain residues 348–410 effectively blocked Srr1-BR binding, but no effect on ClfB binding to fibrinogen. These findings suggest that, while the binding of Srr1 to the Aα chain has some features in common with ClfB, the interactions of these adhesins with fibrinogen must also differ significantly. Further understanding of the precise basis for Srr1 binding to fibrinogen, and whether it occurs via a DLL mechanism, will require solution of its crystal structure.</p>
      <p>Srr1 binding to fibrinogen was also important for the attachment of GBS to hBMEC <italic>in vitro</italic>. Binding of GBS to brain endothelium was reduced by deletion of the putative latch domain of Srr1, and was significantly enhanced by adding human fibrinogen, at concentrations (20 µg/ml) well within those found in whole blood (2–4 mg/ml) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Poon1">[32]</xref>. These findings indicate that the Srr1-fibrinogen binding is a relevant process for CNS invasion, and indeed we found that in mice with experimental meningitis, the latch deletion was also associated with significantly reduced levels of bacteria, mortality, and inflammation within the CNS. Of note, levels of the bacteria within the bloodstream were not altered by the above mutation, further indicating that the virulence properties associated with Srr1 and fibrinogen binding are specific to CNS infection.</p>
      <p>FbsA and FbsB are two additional fibrinogen binding proteins of GBS that have been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Margarit1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Rivera1">[34]</xref>. These proteins appear to be structurally unrelated to Srr1 or other known fibrinogen binding proteins. FbsA and FbsB can bind fibrinogen directly <italic>in vitro</italic>, although their binding sites on fibrinogen have not been identified. FbsA can also enhance the attachment of GBS to hBMEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Tenenbaum1">[35]</xref>. However, FbsA alone is not sufficient for cell invasion, but appears to require FbsB for this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Rosenau1">[36]</xref>. The contribution of FbsA and FbsB, and their interactions with fibrinogen to virulence is not well-defined. Neither protein has been examined for its role in the pathogenesis of meningitis. Deletion of <italic>fbsA</italic> was associated with decreased virulence in an animal model of septic arthritis and septicemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Jonsson1">[37]</xref>. However, neither active nor passive immunization with FbsA or FbsA-specific antibodies resulted in protection against subsequent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Jonsson1">[37]</xref>, suggesting that the virulence properties of FbsA may be unrelated to fibrinogen binding. Two other GBS proteins (the fibronectin binding protein Fib and a predicted ABC transport protein SAG0242) have been shown to bind fibrinogen, but neither the mechanisms for protein binding, nor the biologic importance of these interactions, have been addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002947-Margarit1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results show that Srr1 mediates the binding of GBS to fibrinogen, and that this interaction is likely to occur via a DLL-like mechanism, involving the C-terminus of the fibrinogen Aα chain. It is the first streptococcal adhesin for which this type of binding has been identified, indicating that DLL binding may be a generalized mechanism for attachment by Gram-positive organisms. In addition, Srr1-fibrinogen binding appears to be important for the adherence to brain endothelium and the development of meningitis Given that Srr1 or its homolog Srr2 appear to be expressed by most clinical isolates of GBS, this interaction may prove to be a promising candidate for novel therapies targeting bacterial virulence.</p>
