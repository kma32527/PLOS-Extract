        <p>Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (catalysed by kinases and phosphatases, respectively) are post-translational modifications that play key roles in many eukaryotic signalling pathways, and are often deregulated in a number of pathological conditions in humans. In the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, functional insights into its kinome have only recently been achieved, with over half being essential for blood stage development and another 14 kinases being essential for sexual development and mosquito transmission. However, functions for any of the plasmodial protein phosphatases are unknown. Here, we use reverse genetics in the rodent malaria model, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, to examine the role of a unique protein phosphatase containing kelch-like domains (termed PPKL) from a family related to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> BSU1. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the family of BSU1-like proteins including PPKL is encoded in the genomes of land plants, green algae and alveolates, but not in other eukaryotic lineages. Furthermore, PPKL was observed in a distinct family, separate to the most closely-related phosphatase family, PP1. In our genetic approach, C-terminal GFP fusion with PPKL showed an active protein phosphatase preferentially expressed in female gametocytes and ookinetes. Deletion of the endogenous <italic>ppkl</italic> gene caused abnormal ookinete development and differentiation, and dissociated apical microtubules from the inner-membrane complex, generating an immotile phenotype and failure to invade the mosquito mid-gut epithelium. These observations were substantiated by changes in localisation of cytoskeletal tubulin and actin, and the micronemal protein CTRP in the knockout mutant as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Finally, increased mRNA expression of <italic>dozi</italic>, a RNA helicase vital to zygote development was observed in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutants, with global phosphorylation studies of ookinete differentiation from 1.5–24 h post-fertilisation indicating major changes in the first hours of zygote development. Our work demonstrates a stage-specific essentiality of the unique PPKL enzyme, which modulates parasite differentiation, motility and transmission.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Malaria parasites are single-celled organisms, which alternate their life-cycle between vertebrate and mosquito hosts. In the mosquito, the malaria parasite undergoes sexual development, whereby a male and female gamete fuse to form a zygote. This zygote then elongates into an invasive stage, termed an ookinete, which can glide to and penetrate the mosquito's gut wall in order to form a cyst (called an oocyst). Protein phosphorylation is known to play a vital role during this process; however, the role of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> kinases (which phosphorylate proteins) during zygote/ookinete maturation is better understood than the completely uncharacterised plasmodial phosphatases (which dephosphorylate proteins). Using a malaria parasite which infects mice, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, we show that a unique <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>p</underline>hosphatase containing <underline>k</underline>elch-<underline>l</underline>ike domains (called PPKL) plays a vital role in ookinete maturation and motility. Deleting this gene produces ookinetes whose shape is grossly abnormal, resulting in non-motile parasites that cannot penetrate the lining of the mosquito gut wall. Overall, PPKL is an essential phosphatase that is critical to ookinete development, motility and invasion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Reversible protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous regulatory process for a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathways, including cell-cycle regulation, cell to cell signalling, cell proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Graves1">[1]</xref>. In humans, aberrant regulation of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-BlumeJensen1">[2]</xref>, and plays a central role in many other pathological diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tan1">[3]</xref>. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is catalysed by protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Barford1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Hanks2">[7]</xref>, and nearly two-thirds of the proteins encoded in the human genome are believed to be modified by reversible phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Kostich1">[8]</xref> at over 650,000 phosphosites (PhosphoNET KnowledgeBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphonet.ca" xlink:type="simple">www.phosphonet.ca</ext-link>)), emphasizing the importance of this post-translational modification.</p>
      <p>This regulatory mechanism is highly conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tan1">[3]</xref>, and plays a vital role in development of apicomplexan protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Solyakov1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tewari1">[10]</xref>, which are globally responsible for over a million deaths annually through malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Murray1">[11]</xref>. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life-cycle proceeds via a number of distinct developmental stages: asexual exo-erythrocytic proliferation in liver hepatocytes and intra-erythrocytic multiplication in erythrocytes of the vertebrate host, and sexual development in the female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Bannister1">[12]</xref>. During both asexual and sexual development the parasite utilises a number of signalling pathways, many of which involve reversible protein phosphorylation. Systematic functional analyses of plasmodial protein kinases (PKs) in both the human parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and the rodent model <italic>P. berghei</italic> species have revealed that over half of their kinome is essential to asexual blood stage schizogony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Solyakov1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tewari1">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, reverse genetic studies in <italic>P. berghei</italic> have shown that a further 14 PKs have specific functions during sexual development of the parasite within the mosquito mid-gut lumen and subsequent migration to the salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tewari1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Rangarajan1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-SidenKiamos1">[21]</xref>. In particular, development of the motile and invasive ookinete within the mosquito mid-gut is known to be highly dependent upon two NIMA-related kinases, NEK2 and NEK4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Reininger1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Reininger2">[15]</xref>. Of the three invasive stages of malaria parasite development (namely the sporozoite, merozoite and ookinete), the ookinete stage is unique in that it can develop extracellularly and lacks rhoptries, an organelle specifically associated with cell invasion. This is in contrast to the other “zoite” forms (merozoites and sporozoites) that develop intracellularly and contain both rhoptries and micronemes as apical organelles. However, all of these invasive stages comprise a unique cortical structure termed a pellicle, which consists of a parasitic plasma membrane and an underlying double membrane structure termed the inner membrane complex (IMC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Morrissette1">[22]</xref>. Parasite motility is powered by an actin myosin motor termed the glideosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Opitz1">[23]</xref>, which resides within the pellicle of invasive stages. At the molecular level, the motility and mid-gut invasion of the ookinete involves the secretion of a number of membrane proteins including the motor complex-associated proteins glideosome-associated protein 45 (GAP45) and myosin-A tail domain interacting protein (MTIP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Keeley1">[24]</xref>, micronemal proteins such as circumsporozoite-and trap-related protein (CTRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Dessens1">[25]</xref> and secreted ookinete adhesive protein (SOAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Dessens2">[26]</xref>, as well as calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CDPK3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-SidenKiamos1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the role of plasmodial kinases has been intensively studied, the role of all the complementary protein phosphatases (PPs) during any stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development is unknown. Biochemical studies have shown that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> possesses predominantly phosphatase-1-like activities, and chemical inhibition of phosphatase activity by use of calyculin A and okadaic acid significantly reduces asexual blood stage proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Yokoyama1">[27]</xref>. In contrast to the human phosphatome (comprising approximately 156 phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Wilkes1">[28]</xref> (and PhosphoNET KnowledgeBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphonet.ca" xlink:type="simple">www.phosphonet.ca</ext-link>)), the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome codes for one of the smallest phosphatomes of all the eukaryotic phyla known to date, with 27 putative protein phosphatases falling into four major classes: phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs), metallo-dependent protein phosphatases (PPMs), protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and NLI interacting factor-like phosphatases (NIFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Wilkes1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Like the kinases (although fewer in number), the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> phosphatome contains members that have no orthologues in mammalian systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Wilkes1">[28]</xref>. The function of the <italic>Shewanella</italic>-like PPs (Shelphs) and the likely inactive pseudo-phosphatase EF-hand containing phosphatase (EFPP) is completely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Kutuzov1">[29]</xref>; however, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, Shelphs are postulated to have a role in erythrocyte invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Kutuzov2">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, a distinctive PP1-related enzyme belonging to the PPP family of phosphatases comprising an N-terminal kelch repeat domain and a C-terminal PP1-like phosphatase domain (named PPKL: <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>P</underline>hosphatase with <underline>K</underline>elch-<underline>L</underline>ike domains) has been detected in the apicomplexans <italic>Cryptosporidium hominis, Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Theileria parva</italic> (one gene per genome), as well as in the land plants <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (4 and 5 genes respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Kutuzov3">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moorhead1">[32]</xref>. The kelch motif is widespread and involved in many cellular functions, particularly in actin-based cytoskeleton formation and transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Adams1">[33]</xref>. PPKL itself has only been studied in detail in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (where it is known as BSU1 or <italic>bri1</italic> suppressor1) and along with the kinase BIN2, is involved in brassinosteroid hormone signalling and phosphorylation of the transcription factors BZR1 and BES1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-MoraGarcia1">[34]</xref>. Even though PPKL was first discovered in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (initially named PfPPα), where RT-PCR analysis showed mRNA expression exclusively in gametocytes and hence suggesting a role during sexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Li1">[35]</xref>, its function has remained unknown. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-LeRoch1">[36]</xref> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Hall1">[37]</xref> showed high levels of <italic>ppkl</italic> transcripts in gametocytes and PPKL protein in ookinetes, respectively (PlasmoDB), although discordant results were found in a study of the proteome of sex-specific gametocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Khan1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have used <italic>P. berghei</italic> to elucidate the function of the PPKL enzyme during the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life-cycle. We show by using reverse genetics that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> PPKL has an essential function during ookinete differentiation, affecting apical end integrity, collar and pellicle morphology, and microtubule linkage to the IMC that are crucial for parasite shape, motility and invasion.</p>

        <title>PPKL is essential for gliding motility and mosquito invasion</title>
        <p>To substantiate the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, parasites in mice infected with either wild-type or <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> gametocytes were fed to mosquitoes to analyse oocyst development. Wild-type oocysts developed normally; whereas no oocysts were found in the guts of mosquitoes fed on <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> parasites when analysed 14 and 21 days after feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

        <p>Due to the ablation of oocyst development in our <italic>in vivo</italic> study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), as well as defects in the morphology and maturation of <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutants, we analysed gliding motility of wild-type and <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> parasites by embedding cultured ookinetes in dilute Matrigel and using time-lapse video microscopy to quantify gliding movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moon1">[20]</xref>. Using this method, we found that wild-type parasites followed a characteristic helical gliding motion with an average speed of 4.74 µm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s006">Video S1</xref>), in close agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moon1">[20]</xref>. Strikingly, gliding motility in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> retorts was significantly reduced compared to wild-type parasites (0.13 µm/min; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), although occasional limited forward motion and “flexing” at the apical end was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s007">Video S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess whether the ablation of oocyst development in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutant parasites was also due to a defect in invasion of the mid-gut epithelium, we bypassed the gut barrier by injecting <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> parasites directly into the haemocoel of <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes and analyzed salivary gland invasion 20 days post-injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Ecker1">[42]</xref>.

        <title><italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> parasites show defects in ookinete apical end integrity</title>
        <p>To examine whether the morphology of the <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutant retorts could be linked to their inability to glide and invade, we performed ultrastructure analyses using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>
        <p>Significant structural differences were detected between wild-type and <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutant parasites at the apical end of the ookinete. Wild-type ookinetes had a very uniform appearance with a conical shaped apical end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figures 5Ai</xref>), with unique and complex structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Canning1">[43]</xref> consisting of an enclosing plasmalemma, beneath which is a conical electron dense collar with a central aperture and in firm contact with the IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aiii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s005">S5A</xref>). Beneath the collar, but in close contact with it, is a second somewhat smaller and less electron dense layer termed the apical ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aiii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s005">S5A</xref>), which is subtended by the sub-pellicular microtubules. The apical end also has a large number of micronemes with fine ducts running through the aperture in the collar to the apical plasmalemma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aiii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s005">S5A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> retort forms showed marked variation in shape with clear constriction and elongation of the apical end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aii, 5Avii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s005">S5B</xref>). Detailed examination of the apical end showed structural differences from the wild-type, namely: the electron dense collar's reduced length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aiv</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s005">S5B</xref>); the apical ring appeared reduced in size compared to the wild-type, resembling a series of small vesicles and some loss of connection to the collar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aiv</xref>); the microtubules run longitudinally from the ring, but while they were closely associated with the IMC in the wild-type parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Av</xref>), they were more disorganised in the mutant and the electron dense links between the microtubules and the IMC were not found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Avi</xref>); in severe cases, collapse of the apex resulted in groups of tubules within a neck-like region not associated with the IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Avii, viii</xref>). Due to the collapse of the apex, fewer micronemes were located in the apical region, but those present appeared normal with ducts running to the apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Aiv</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002948.s005">S5B</xref>). The other cytoplasmic and nuclear features were similar in both wild-type and mutant parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002948-g005">Figure 5Ai, ii</xref>). In summary, there is a loss of apical integrity due to defects in the collar and the attachment between the microtubules and IMC possibly resulting in an immotile parasite.</p>

            <p>A. (i) Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a longitudinal section though a wild-type ookinete showing the conical apical end. The cytoplasm contains a number of apically located micronemes (<bold>Mn</bold>), a more posteriorly located nucleus (<bold>N</bold>) and a central crystalloid body (<bold>Cr</bold>). Bar = 1 µm. (ii) TEM of a longitudinal section though an ookinete of the <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutant showing partial collapse and elongation of the apical end. Within the cytoplasm, the micronemes (<bold>Mn</bold>) are more randomly distributed. Bar = 1 µm. (iii) Enlargement of the anterior of a wild-type ookinete illustrating the complex nature of the apical end consisting of a conical shaped electron dense collar (<bold>C</bold>) with a central aperture. Underlying the collar and in contact with it is a less electron dense ring (<bold>R</bold>) that is also in contact with longitudinally running sub-pellicular microtubules (<bold>Mt</bold>). Micronemes (<bold>Mn</bold>) are located within the cytoplasm with small ducts (<bold>D</bold>) running though the apical aperture to the plasmlemma. Bar = 100 nm. (iv) Detail of the anterior of a <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> ookinete showing a less conical shape associated with a reduction in the length of the electron dense collar (<bold>C</bold>) and some separation (arrow) from the electron lucent ring (<bold>R</bold>) with associated microtubules (<bold>Mt</bold>). The few micronemes (<bold>Mn</bold>) present showed ducts (<bold>D</bold>) running to the anterior. Bar = 100 nm. (v) Part of a cross section though the anterior end of a wild-type ookinete showing the specific inter-relationship between the microtubules (arrowheads) and the inner membrane complex (<bold>IMC</bold>). Bar = 100 nm. (vi) Cross-section though a <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> ookinete illustrating microtubules (arrowheads) within the cytoplasm that have lost contact with the IMC. Bar = 100 nm. (vii) Longitudinal section though the apical end of a severely affected <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> ookinete showing the collapsed and elongate neck-like structure containing longitudinally running microtubules (<bold>Mt</bold>). Bar = 100 nm. (viii) Cross section though the collapsed neck region showing it to consist of microtubules. Bar = 100 nm. B. Indirect immunofluorescence detection of a number of cytoskeletal, glideosomal and micronemal proteins in wild-type ookinetes and <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> abnormal retorts (24 h) post-gametocyte activation. Abnormally intense tubulin staining was observed at the ookinetes apical end (red). Motor protein GAP45 and MTIP distributions (green) did not show any difference in the mutant compared to wild-type. The apical localisation of actin and micronemal CTRP was more diffuse throughout the cell body (red) in the <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutant. However, the usual diffuse intracellular staining of SOAP showed no obvious abnormal pattern in the mutant. The nucleus was counter-stained using DAPI (blue). Arrows indicate the apical end of the ookinete. Bar = 5 µm.</p>

        <p>Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies for the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and actin showed mislocalisation with intense atypical tubulin staining at the apical end of the <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> abnormal retort as well as loss of the normal apical staining for actin. While the motor complex proteins GAP45 and MTIP showed no obvious abnormal pattern in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> lines, micronemal CTRP showed less distinct apical staining and is more distributed throughout the body of the retort. This may be due to the structural and cytoskeletal changes at the apical end.

        <title>Expression of genes essential to zygote development is differentially regulated in PPKL mutants</title>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Reversible phosphorylation is a major regulator for many cellular processes. The kinases are well recognised as important signalling molecules and drug targets in various diseases, but phosphatases have been neglected and their roles remained elusive until recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moorhead1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Virshup1">[47]</xref>. Although recent systematic functional analyses of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> kinome have identified a number of potential drug targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Solyakov1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tewari1">[10]</xref>, studies on phosphatases in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> have been mostly limited to biochemical studies. Recently however, the total protein phosphatome of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> was published and showed that the genome of this malaria parasite codes for one of the smallest known eukaryotic phosphatomes, comprising 27 phosphatase sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Wilkes1">[28]</xref>. We have shown that the unique phosphatase PPKL is encoded by a single-copy gene belonging to a robust family that is only detected in <italic>Viridiplantae</italic> and <italic>Alveolata</italic>, confirming previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Kutuzov3">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moorhead1">[32]</xref>. Analysis of wild-type mRNA transcription and protein expression confirmed the findings of previous global studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-LeRoch1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Hall1">[37]</xref>, suggesting that PPKL is expressed during sexual development. Furthermore, we have also shown that PPKL is an active phosphatase, which in gametocyte/gamete stages is female-specific and in the ookinete is found preferentially at the apical end. However, the localisation is not uniquely nuclear but is also cytosolic, contrasting the exclusively nuclear localisation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> BSU1 phosphatase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-MoraGarcia1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our functional studies have shown that the only point of essentiality for PPKL in the malaria parasite is ookinete differentiation, particularly in the latter stages when the machinery for motility and invasion is formed. Zygote development is normal in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutants, but ookinete differentiation is grossly impaired, producing a parasite population dominated by retorts with abnormal morphology and varying degrees of structural deformities. By using a motility assay we show here that the gliding motility of <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> abnormal retorts is virtually abolished. The data suggest that apical structure and organelle distribution are determined at the early female/zygote stage. We also show that this defect is inherited through the female line. Previous studies have shown that many defects at the zygote/ookinete stage are carried through maternal inheritance of a number of ookinete specific molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Ecker1">[42]</xref>. In addition, the haemocoel infection experiment clearly suggests that this impairment is restricted to the ookinete stage since by-passing the mid-gut barrier by direct injection of mutant retorts into the haemocoel allowed oocyst formation and the production of invasive sporozoites that could cause blood stage infection after a mosquito bite-back. However, the abnormality persisted at the subsequent ookinete stage in these <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> parasites.</p>
      <p>The ookinete is morphologically and biochemically distinct from sexual stage gametocytes and zygotes, as well as the later oocyst and sporozoite stages. It is also the only motile and invasive stage that is formed extracellularly, does not require invasion of a new host cell as it moves between the mosquito gut cells in traversing to the basal surface and also develops extracellularly into the next stage. Ultrastructure analyses using TEM revealed severe structural abnormalities in the apical end of the mutant retort forms, particularly that of microtubule organisation and association with the IMC, as well as a reduction in the length of the apical ring and distinct shortening of the apical collar. The apical complex of the ookinete is unique amongst the invasive <italic>Plasmodium</italic> stages. In particular, the distinctive ookinete morphology is maintained through an array of microtubules, the subpellicular network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Morrissette1">[22]</xref>, and a lattice of intermediate filaments. These are enclosed by the pellicle consisting of the plasmalemma and two underlying closely associated unit membranes formed from flatten vacuoles and referred to as the IMC. The structural abnormalities seen in the microtubular association with the IMC, as well as the mislocalisation of cytoskeletal proteins in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> lines could explain the distinctive morphology of the mutant. It would also explain why no <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic>-associated defects are observed in the rest of the life-cycle since the unique apical complex of the ookinete is absent in both merozoites and sporozoites.</p>
      <p>Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies to the microneme marker CTRP suggested that in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> lines CTRP is distributed throughout the parasite body and the apical end localisation as seen in the wild-type parasite is not observed. It is important to note however, that even though CTRP and SOAP are both microneme-associated proteins, the localisation we see in our wild-type parasites is consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Dessens2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Nacer1">[48]</xref>, with CTRP showing intense apical staining and SOAP localisation more diffuse throughout the cell body. The altered distribution of CTRP in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> lines could more likely be due to the structural abnormality at the apical end, since we still observe a high concentration of apical micronemes in the mutants. Although this may explain their inability to move and invade the gut wall, it has been shown previously in <italic>misfit</italic> disruption mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Bushell1">[49]</xref> that even in the absence of micronemes, parasites could still form oocysts. Nevertheless, this particular defect in MISFIT is quite different to <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> because it shows paternal inheritance and a range of distinct molecular defects. The location of markers of the motor complex such as GAP45 and MTIP did not show any marked difference between wild-type and <italic>ppkl</italic><sup>−</sup> parasites. However, the mislocalisation of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin and of actin in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> parasites is consistent with the structural defects identified in the ultrastructure studies. In mammalian systems protein phosphatases are important in microtubule formation and are regulated during the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moorhead2">[50]</xref>; it is therefore possible that PPKL has a direct role in microtubule distribution, consistent with the aberrant morphology of the <italic>ppkl</italic><sup>−</sup> retorts.</p>
      <p>Cellular processes are regulated through complex signalling networks, although very little is known in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Studies of kinases have demonstrated the importance and specificity of protein phosphorylation at every stage of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life-cycle. For example, a number of kinases are implicated in male gamete (CDPK4, SRPK, MAP2), female gamete (NEK2, NEK4), zygote (NEK2, NEK4), and ookinete (PK7, GAK) development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tewari1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Guttery2">[51]</xref>. We have shown that <italic>ppkl</italic> transcripts are down-regulated in <italic>nek4<sup>−</sup></italic> mutants. Furthermore, we have also shown that PPKL is phosphorylated in both schizonts and activated gametocytes, confirming phosphoproteomic studies indicating that PPKL is itself phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Treeck1">[52]</xref> and suggesting that its activity or interactions with other proteins may also be regulated by phosphorylation. As a precedent, phosphorylation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PPKL orthologue, BSU1, by the constitutive differential growth 1 (CDG1) kinase results in its activation and the subsequent dephosphorylation of BIN2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Kim1">[45]</xref>, suggesting a fine balance between phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways in signalling in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Belkhadir1">[53]</xref>. Whether such a mechanism operates in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is to be elucidated in future studies.</p>
      <p>The global protein phosphorylation profile during ookinete development of the <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> mutant is evidently different from that of wild-type parasites. Most changes were seen within 1.5 h of gametocyte activation and zygote formation, suggesting that the function of PPKL is crucial at the early zygote stage even though the phenotype is observed at the ookinete stage. For example, the molecular blueprint for apical end formation may be established following fertilization in the early zygote stage. One intriguing observation is that the qRT-PCR analyses revealed that transcripts of <italic>dozi</italic> (which is involved in mRNA processing) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Mair1">[44]</xref> are significantly up-regulated in <italic>ppkl<sup>−</sup></italic> lines. This might suggest that in the absence of the phosphatase the modulation of DOZI is perturbed and this could directly affect the process of translational repression for many proteins in early zygote development. Previous studies have identified IMC-associated proteins that are vital for maintenance of ookinete morphology and virulence, namely IMC1b and IMC1h (or Alv3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tremp1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Khater1">[56]</xref>. Disruption and deletion mutants of the nucleotide cyclase guanylyl cyclase β (GCβ) and the cyclic nucleotide degrading phosphodiesterase δ (PDEδ), respectively, showed unregulated signalling via cGMP resulting in defective ookinete development and gliding motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Moon1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Hirai1">[57]</xref>.

Asexual stages and gametocyte production were monitored on Giemsa-stained blood films.</p>
        <p>Exflagellation was examined on day 4–5 post infection. 10 µl of gametocyte-infected blood were obtained from the tail with a heparinized pipette tip and mixed immediately with 40 µl of ookinete culture medium (RPMI1640 containing 25 mM HEPES, 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM sodium bicarbonate, 50 µM xanthurenic acid at pH 7.6). The mixture was placed under a Vaseline-coated cover slip and 15 min later exflagellation centres were counted by phase contrast microscopy in 12–15 fields of view using a 63× objective and 10× ocular lens. Ookinete formation was assessed the next day. 10 µl of infected tail blood were obtained as above, mixed immediately with 40 µl ookinete culture medium, and incubated for 2 h at 20°C to allow completion of gametogenesis and fertilization. Each culture was then diluted with 0.45 ml of ookinete medium and incubated at 20°C for a further 21–24 h to allow ookinete differentiation. Cultures were pelleted for 2 min at 5000 rpm and then incubated with 50 µl of ookinete medium containing Hoechst 33342 DNA dye to a final concentration of 5 µg/ml and a Cy3-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody 13.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Tewari2">[16]</xref> recognizing the P28 protein on the surface of ookinetes and any undifferentiated macrogametes or zygotes.

Oocyst formation was examined by Hoechst 33342 staining for 10–15 min and guts were washed and mounted under Vaseline-rimmed cover slips. Images were recorded using a 63× oil immersion objective on a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope fitted with an AxioCam ICc1 digital camera. Day 21 post feeding another 20 mosquitoes were dissected and their guts and salivary glands crushed separately in a loosely fitting homogenizer to release sporozoites, which were then quantified using a haemocytometer.

        <p>Ookinetes were cultured using standard methods and harvested by pelleting. <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes were anaesthetised with CO<sub>2</sub> and approximately 500 ookinetes in 69 µl of complete ookinete medium were injected into the thorax using a microinjector (Drummond, Nanoject II). Bitebacks and dissections for quantification of salivary gland sporozoites were performed 20 days after injection.</p>

        <title>Statistical analyses</title>
        <p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). For ookinete motility analysis, non-parametric t-tests were used. For relative quantification of qRT-PCR reactions, a pair-wise fixed reallocation randomisation test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002948-Pfaffl1">[67]</xref> was used.</p>
